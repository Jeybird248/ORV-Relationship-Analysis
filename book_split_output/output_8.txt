350: Ep. 65 - Good and Evil, VI


I sighed lightly as I thought about it. I had no idea what to choose but now I
was a demon king. Thus, the table I would naturally sit at was…

[Now, come over here. I have prepared a seat for you in advance.]

Uriel started to take me and my companions somewhere. I felt embarrassed
as I was dragged by Uriel. Uriel led me in a more natural manner to the
table with the archangel. On the opposite table, the demon kings were
staring at me.

"No, wait a minute. Uriel. I…"

I sat down next to Uriel and the other members sat behind me in turn.
Raphael sat in front of me and stared at me in a dumbfounded manner.

[Aren't you a demon king?]

"Well, that…"
Either way, Uriel sitting on my left was happy.

[Okay, okay.]

I felt something strange and turned to the right, only to see an unexpected
person.

"What? You're here as well?"

When did he come here? Yoo Joonghyuk sat there with a peculiar and
terrifying killing intent. Next to him was Metatron, who was looking at me
with an unknown expression. Based on the seating, Yoo Joonghyuk had
been brought here by Metatron. Why did I have an ominous feeling?

Metatron waved to me before shaking his head at Uriel. [Uriel, I understand
your heart but the Demon King of Salvation is a demon king.]

[How is he a demon king, Scribe?]

[He is a demon king from his modifier. Send him back.]

[I don't want to.]

The moment Metatron and Uriel were bickering, a dokkaebi appeared in the
center of the hall. The number and size of the horns showed he was an
advanced dokkaebi.

[Then from now on…] The dokkaebi's gaze stopped on me. [Hmm. I
gave you the notice earlier but someone isn't keeping to it. I would be
grateful if the constellations and demon kings sat in their 'own' seat.] I
belatedly identified the modifier written in my spot.

[That seat is reserved for the Saviour of Corruption.]

…It was that jerk's seat. Michael wasn't in attendance. I hurriedly turned to
the party members. "You just stay here. That would be safer."
"Then what about Dokja-ssi?"

"I am fine. Don't be too nervous and think of it as a year-end awards
ceremony. Everyone has suffered so sometimes there should be a scenario
like this."

I told the group members this but I still couldn't relax. According to the
development of the original novel, the balance of good and evil would be
disturbed by this Duet Between Good and Evil. I smiled at Uriel and
crossed the hall alone, everyone's attention on me.

[The demon king 'Duke of Everywhere' thinks you are a lesser demon
king.]

[The constellation 'Morning Star Goddess' is shaking her hand in a
dumbfounded manner.]

[The demon king 'Devil of Principles' is doubting your dignity.]

I really felt I was sitting in another class alone at the entrance ceremony.

[The constellation 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' likes your stupidity.]

Abyssal Black Flame Dragon? This brat was here too? After a while, I
barely found my designated seat.

[What a coincidence. We are paired up again.]

I was sitting next to Asmodeus. "Please don't say such bad things."

Then the banquet began. The first phase was simple refreshments along
with the performance of special guests. It really did feel like a year-end
awards ceremony. I looked down at the steak on the plate in front of me.

「 Scream of the Finest Swordmaster on Phille Mountain. 」
It was all the same taste. I put my fork down and watched the garish stage.
The performances by the special guests… there were also incarnations.

[Today's stage is very special. I constantly tried to get in touch with them
but they never responded to me once.]

Who was it?

[Introducing the God of Wine and Ecstasy! In addition, the Goddess of
Love and Beauty!]

…What? Along with the colourful lighting, Dionysus in a suit and diamond
gloves and Aphrodite in a black jumpsuit appeared on the stage. Then
music started to play. I looked back and Orpheus' band was playing music.

[Whoa ~ The flashy lights are my own thing.]

Dionysus started singing. The song continued.

[You shall never break the excitement― you

can't!] I didn't know the song.

The constellations seemed excited by the unexpected event. In particular,
they cheered at the exciting dances that Aphrodite and her incarnation
showed. Meanwhile, some constellations were throwing forks at Dionysus.

Come to think of it, Dionysus had said something after Gigantomachia.

–…Thanks to you, Olympus will be suffering for a while.

I didn't know he meant it like this. Perhaps Dionysus and Aphrodite would
receive a large amount of coins for this performance. It was shameful
considering Olympus' great pride.

[Whoa! Don't break the excitement! Then excitement… thank you! Please
continue to love Bacchus and Goddess Do in the future!]
Dionysus, who was baptized with food for a while, laughing and walked off
with spaghetti on his head. Laughing like this… I couldn't tell if he was
acting or not.

During the show, I observed the demon kings sitting around me. Of course,
I was also being observed. In particular, the lower ranks of the demon kings
were polarized.

[The demon king 'Monarch who is a Philosopher about Corpses' is wary of
you.]

[The demon king 'Eyes that See the Forbidden' is checking you.]

It was natural since my rank was upgraded from 73rd to 67th in one day.
They must be trembling because they didn't know when I would ask for a
promotion battle.

[Now, we will proceed with the awards

ceremony.] I sat up straight. From now on, it was

real.

[A good story is created through close cooperation between the
constellations and incarnations. This season, there were people who showed
great chemistry not only between constellation and incarnation, but
incarnation and incarnation. Thus, I prepared a small award for them.]

The cheers of the constellations filled the hall. Was there something like
this in the original?

[This season's 'Best Chemistry Award' nominees!]

At the same time, videos flashed. Some of the candidates were very
familiar.

–We can't do it.
–In any case, we will die if this continues.

Two children appeared on the screen.

[The first candidates are incarnation 'Shin Yoosung' and incarnation' Lee
Gilyoung'!]

The spotlight suddenly poured down and Shin Yoosung and Lee Gilyoung's
wide eyes were visible. This was something I didn't expect. Come to think
of it, I saw a placard talking about best chemistry when crossing the bridge.

The footage featured on the screen was when the two children met the
chimera dragon in Dark Castle. There was the video of two children
moving through the wave of monsters, plucking up their courage as they
advanced towards the dragon. Somehow, I felt touched.

The candidate introductions continued.

[The second candidates are incarnation 'Jung Heewon' and incarnation' Lee
Hyunsung'!]

More from our nebula?

–Heewon-ssi, excuse me.

The screen showed the moment when Lee Hyunsung learnt Steel
Transformation. Lee Hyunsung voluntarily sacrificed himself to quench
Jung Heewon's Hell Flames Ignition after she was affected by Nirvana.

On the other table, I could see Lee Hyunsung blushing and Jung Heewon
touching her forehead. They both looked pretty good.

[Next are the third candidates!] I

was shocked to witness the scene.

…What was this?
–Kim Dokja, there is only one chance.

–It has always been 'once' for me.

Once this screen came out, Uriel and the archangels of Eden screamed. The
two people on the screen were me and Yoo Joonghyuk. It was the moment
we threw a spear together at Ares.

The dokkaebi continued, [The third candidates are constellation 'Demon
King of Salvation' and incarnation 'Yoo Joonghyuk'!]

Yoo Joonghyuk's frown deepened even more. This jerk, I didn't like it
either. Lee Jihye and Jung Heewon glanced at me before chuckling.

[Then let's announce the winner of the award!]

I inwardly prayed. 'Please not the third candidates. Please not the third'.

[The season's Best Chemistry Award goes to incarnation 'Shin Yoosung'
and incarnation 'Lee Gilyoung'!]

The names were released with popping fireworks. Fortunately, the
constellations gave the right judgment. The archangels sighed while I could
see Lee Gilyoung and Shin Yoosung hesitantly walking to the stage.

"Eh, uh. I mean… thanks… for the award…"

The extremely nervous Shin Yoosung stared at me. Suddenly, Lee
Gilyoung took the microphone. "I love Dokja hyung!"

"I love ahjussi!"

"Kim Dokja's Company is the best!"

The archangels clapped like the children were adorable. The children
received the prize money and plaque and returned to their seats.
[Hum hum. We will continue with the awards.]

The Best Chemistry Award was special. In fact, most of the awards in the
Duet Between Good and Evil were given to the giant stories. Therefore, the
people who got a decent 'giant story' in this season were very nervous.

There was a prize money but all the plaques given here were star relics that
enhanced their status.

How could the constellations not go crazy?

Asmodeus sat beside me and whispered. [Are you looking forward to it?
What type of prize you will receive.]

"I haven't received it yet."

I was sure it was just a newcomer award. In the first place, the awards
ceremony couldn't afford to give a demon king the biggest prize.

Asmodeus' expression was curious. [Do you think so?]

I shook my head and watched the following prizes. Putting aside the
awards, I wasn't feeling comfortable.

In the first place, Duet Between Good and Evil wasn't just a ceremony. The
Duet Between Good and Evil. The banquet of good and evil was to judge
the good and evil of the scenario. In fact, this event was a contest of pride
between the absolute good and absolute evil systems held at regular
intervals.

The giant stories from all over the universe rose in the air.

[The winner of the New Evil Award is the giant story 'Descendant of
Chiyou'!]

Descendant of Chiyou. It was a giant story from the Emperor side. Perhaps
it was a story that the incarnation 'Feihu' participated in.
From now on, all the giant stories receiving awards would be divided by
'good' or 'evil'. In other words, the prizes given to 'good' and 'evil' were
different. I was judged as an evil person and thanks to that, I would be
given the prizes of a demon king.

[The winner of the New Good Award is the giant story 'Protector of the
Sphinx'!]

Protector of the Sphinx. It was the giant story of Papyrus. It was probably
Ranveer Khan. Ranveer Khan seemed to have received the support of the
absolute good system because he was a good and generous man.

[Winners, please come forward!]

Feihu and Ranveer Khan received the awards as representatives and gave a
brief statement.

Feihu, a master in one-on-one fighting.

Ranveer Khan, a master in fighting against an army. I thought they
would've entered the giant stories by now but I was surprised they already
collected such great stories. It was different from the original novel.

[Now, the next one is…]

The newcomer awards passed and the awards for excellence in each field
were continued.

One was evil and the other was good. There was a dividing line as the
awards were given.

Perhaps some of these prizes were strongly influenced by the constellations.
This was the constellation of the Star Stream's way of balancing good and
evil.
[I sincerely thank the constellations of the absolute evil system and the
demon kings who gave me this award. The maternal sponsor behind me, the
dokkaebi who operated the channel and…]

The long speech for the Excellence Award finished and I felt a bit strange. I
thought I would've already received a prize at this point but all the awards
for the newcomers had passed. Kim Dokja's Company didn't even qualify
for a newcomer award? The stories were created…

[The winner of this season's Top Excellence Award, the giant story…]

The winner of the Top Excellence Award was Anna Croft's Zarathustra.
She didn't attend and it was Selena Kim who received the award. Come to
think of it, the grand prize in the original work went to Anna Croft.

All that remained was the grand prize. At this point, I started to be afraid of
something.

「 The Duet Between Good and Evil determines the balance of good and
evil through the Grand Prize. 」

In fact, the 'Grand Prize' was the most important thing about this banquet. It
was because the 'Grand Prize' determined the power status of good and evil.
The giant story of this season was either good or bad.

I looked around and the smiling and chatting demon kings and angels were
tense.

[The Grand Prize of this season―]

The dokkaebi's mouth opened. I heard the syllables spoken by him and felt
the reality of the world gradually disappearing. The balance of the world
was staggering.

[Giant Story of the nebula 'Kim Dokja's Company', the Torch That
Swallowed the Myth.]
          Chapter 351: Ep. 66 - Beyond Good and Evil, I


I thought it was wrong at first. Then the gazes of the demon kings focused
on me, Asmodeus clapped and the expressions of the party members were
dazed. It started to feel more real for me.

Kim Dokja's Company won the grand prize. However, an ominous feeling
preceded any joyful feelings.

The grand prize? Us? In this Duet Between Good and Evil?

The reason for my ominous feeling was soon revealed.

[The good or evil of this year's grand prize hasn't been determined yet.]

The message about good and evil not being determined yet caused a stir
among some of the demon kings and constellations.

[What does it mean that good or evil hasn't been determined yet?]
The dokkaebi replied immediately. [The winners of the past 'Grand Prize'
were decided by the consensus of the great dokkaebis, the absolute good
constellations and the absolute evil constellations. This time, we couldn't
come to a conclusion for the first time.]

[You couldn't come to a conclusion? The great dokkaebis?]

The demon kings and constellations looked confused. The constellations
belonging to the absolute good or absolute evil would naturally vote for
their faction but the great dokkaebis couldn't come to a consensus?

[No such thing has occurred since the Duet Between Good and Evil started.
No, it is the first time since the Holy and Demon War ended!]

[You can't identify it? There can't be such a story. The balance of good and
evil must tilt either way!]

The agitated constellations and demon kings cried out. It wasn't that they
didn't understand.

Many giant story scenarios were determined by agreement or manipulation
of the nebulae. Just as Gigantomachia was sold as a type of tourist product,
other giant stories were also sold as preferred stocks, making the good or
evil of the story already determined.

Yet out giant story was made by completely breaking down Gigantomachia.
The giant story of Olympus' collapse was born out of nowhere. Since it was
a story that wasn't scheduled in the beginning, it wasn't possible to decide
the good or evil in advance.

The dokkaebi laughed like this situation was interesting. [Well, what can
someone like me know about the opinions of the big bosses? In any case,
we are here to determine if the story is good or evil. If you have any
comments, please raise your hand.]

The intention of the dokkaebi became obvious.
…This son of a bitch.

In the first place, it didn't matter to them if Kim Dokja's Company won the
grand prize. The important thing was the good or evil of the story we built,
since it would change their status.

[This story is naturally 'evil'.]

The first one to open his mouth was the demon king 'Duke of Everywhere'.
Duke of Everywhere. His true name was Furcas, master of the 50th Demon
Realm.

[The Demon King of Salvation is a demon king. He is less devious but he is
still a demon king of the Demon Realm. Thus, all his actions are evil.]

Indeed, it was pathetic logic for the Duke of Everywhere who couldn't even
spell properly. Then someone in the opposing camp raised a hand.

[I disagree with that opinion.]

Guardian of Youths and Travel, Raphael. Raphael shook a finger and
started talking.

[For example, if someone steals something and becomes a wicked
person. Everyone in the world called him evil so he became evil. Then
what if this evil man used the stolen money to save people? What if he
saved a lot of people by giving bread to the poor and water to the
thirsty?] I nodded at Raphael's argument.

[Then is he still evil? Is he defined as evil?]

[Well, that…] The Duke of Everywhere was swayed by Raphael's logic.

At this time, the demon king sitting beside me raised a hand and helped the
Duke of Everywhere. [Do you want to discuss the paradox of good and evil
here?]
Asmodeus' red eyes were incensed. Come to think of it, Asmodeus owed
Raphael a debt.

Raphael nodded. [I can do it if you want.]

Raphael lay on a bed of clouds and flicked his fingers towards the air. Then
on the big screen of the stage, scenes of me and the party members
performing in Gigantomachia started to flow.

Raphael stared at the screen and started talking. [In the end, all existences
are made of stories and stories are made up of the sum of the events.
However, it is hard to find evil in the events accumulated in this story.]

The paradox of good and evil. This paradox implied that the good and evil
of all beings were defined by the stories built up by them.

Raphael opened his mouth and pointed at the split screens. The first screen
was a scene where I visited the Underworld and liberated the giants.

[The Demon King of Salvation liberated the underdogs from the unjust
story that suppressed them.]

The second screen was a scene where the party members resisted the
transition of Gigantomachia from a tourist destination to hunting the
Breaking the Sky Sword Saint.

[The members of Kim Dokja's Company responded to the unreasonable
scenario composition of Gigantomachia.]

The final screen was a scene where the party members and I burned the
torch and opposed Poseidon, a myth-grade constellation.

[They fought against a major object of force and overthrew the dominance
of the giant nebula. Look. Is it possible to find any evil in the events that
happened?]
Many of the constellations nodded at Raphael's story, which described the
details of the scene. On the other hand, the expressions of the demon kings
distorted. At least, apart from Asmodeus.

[How interesting. Then the angels are saying that the Demon King of
Salvation might be a good demon king?]

[Are you admitting it?]

[Nope. Your words have a loophole. One, as you say, the stories are the
sum of the events.]

Asmodeus grinned at me.

[As you know, a story is never a solitary existence. A story is related to
other stories and affects it. It is the same for Torch That Swallowed the
Myth.]

At the same time, another screen appeared and started to play. It was the
scene of the first scenario. The screen zoomed in on the eggs of the
pregnant grasshopper exploded in my hand.

[The Demon King of Salvation left the people on the subway to die. He
could've saved everyone.]

Some angels looked at me with dubious eyes.

Asmodeus continued speaking. [There was another thing.]

The next scene that appeared was the eighth scenario. It was the scenario
where the strongest incarnation in Seoul sacrificed himself so everyone
could live. The screen showed my Eight Lives attribute.

Asmodeus kept speaking. [The Demon King of Salvation had extra lives
and knew he was the strongest sacrifice. If he wanted, he could've ended the
scenario before there were big sacrifices.]
The murmuring of the constellations intensified. The story continued.

[Sparing those he wants to live and ignoring those he doesn't want to live,
the Demon King of Salvation is such an existence. He is a demon king who
practices the discrimination that you dislike. Discrimination is the most
serious sin in the Star Stream.] As if to declare victory, Asmodeus asked a
final question. [Then I'll ask Eden. Do you still think the Demon King of
Salvation is a 'good' demon king?]

The crowd fell silent. Some of the angels were watching me with suspicious
eyes while many demon kings were smiling.

At this time, there was a constellation who rose. [■■, everyone has such
a contradiction.] It was Uriel.

[The important thing isn't the accumulation of sin but the direction of
change through these events. The Demon King of Salvation is heading
towards the direction of 'good'!]

[These days, angels are very generous with the definition of good and evil.
There is a recent rumour that you have a personal crush on the demon king.
Is this true?]

[What?]

[Hmm, I guess it's true. Last time you also wanted―]

Uriel jumped out. [This ■ck ■■ now…!]

Enormous sparks occurred around both tables. There was a flurry of curses
between the archangels and demon kings and the opinions became
turbulent.

I wasn't the only target. Someone attacked Jung Heewon's killing. Someone
attacked Lee Hyunsung's cowardice in the first scenario. There was also
Lee Jihye who killed her friend. Our lives, the history we accumulated, was
being torn apart.

[Giant Story 'Torch That Swallowed the Myth' is revealing its teeth.]

The faces of the party members were gradually becoming pale. They were
people who had already been hurt. The people who risked their lives and
somehow survived to this point had become the amusement of the
constellations.

[Wait! Is it necessary to do this?]

Uriel belatedly noticed something and shouted, but the constellations and
demon kings were busy dissecting the wounds of Kim Dokja's Company. In
the end, they started to bite at the past of Shin Yoosung and Lee Gilyoung.
It was the moment I learnt about Lee Gilyoung's trauma and sponsor.

"Stop it."

At my words, the crowd momentarily turned towards me. I knew it would
be dangerous if I spoke the wrong words here.

Now Kim Dokja's Company was like a sailboat placed between two
currents. It was a small boat that could sink at any time. However, even a
small boat could choose the direction it wanted to go. I was the captain of
this boat.

"Isn't this enough? Don't you know that a conclusion can't be reached this
way?"

I hadn't intervened because I had been waiting for the constellations and
demon kings to realize it themselves.

"Do you think you can decide here what even the great dokkaebis couldn't
judge?"
Kim Dokja's Company wasn't good or evil. In the first place, I didn't intend
to play with the concept of good and evil set by others.

[Your words are right.]

Unexpectedly, it was the 5th ranked demon king, Black Mane Lion Marbas
who spoke. He looked at me and continued. [Surely it is useless to speak
here. Stop the useless arguments.]

[Marbas! But…]

[In the first place, I will ask you.] A chill went down my spine. [I will let
you decide for yourself. Is this story good or evil? Isn't that why we created
this place?]

With this, all the eyes of the demon kings and constellations focused on me.
A cold sensation flowed down my spine. Then a system message popped
up. [You have a share in the giant story 'Torch That Swallowed the Myth'.]

[Please determine the good and evil of the story.]

If I chose good or evil here, I would be taking sides with one of the 'good'
or 'evil' that they claimed. It would be hard if that happened. It might solve
the current problem for Kim Dokja's Company but if we chose good or evil
here, a terrible future might occur in later scenarios.

I worried about it for a long time before making a decision. It couldn't be
helped, even if I received the criticism of the demon kings and
constellations.

"The Torch That Swallowed the Myth is―"

"Good."
I stared at the protagonist who interrupted. The man in the black coat, who
had been silent for a while, spoke nonsense. Yoo Joonghyuk kept talking.
"This story, it is good."

I was so confused that I closed my mouth. I wondered if Yoo Joonghyuk
had gone crazy or if he was trapped by something.

Beside Yoo Joonghyuk, Metatron was slightly smiling towards me.
Goosebumps formed on my arm. Don't tell me, the reason why Metatron
brought Yoo Joonghyuk…

[Those who have shares in the giant story can claim the right to 'good' or
'evil'.]

The subsequent messages caused the mouths of the constellations and
demon kings to drop open.

[Incarnation 'Yoo Joonghyuk' has a 22.8% share in the giant story 'Torch
That Swallowed the Myth'.]

[Due to incarnation Yoo Joonghyuk's declaration, the story is tilting in the
direction of 'good'.]

It wasn't only me who could define this story as good or evil. It was
because everyone in Kim Dokja's Company had a share in this story.

[Do you approve of the story as 'good'?]

Yoo Joonghyuk was looking at me. It was an expression that I couldn't
read. He seemed to be asking me what I would do now.

–Crazy bastard! What are you thinking?

I spoke to him through Midday Tryst but Yoo Joonghyuk didn't answer. I
watched him and activated a skill.

[The exclusive skill, 'Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint' has been activated!]
[This person is currently in an emotional state that you can't understand.]

…What?

[If there are no objections from another narrator, the corresponding story
will be confirmed as 'good.]

[There are 30 seconds before it is confirmed.]

Dammit, I couldn't figure out what the hell was going on. The number
counted down and I heard the demon kings screaming.

I stared at the surprised faces of the party. Jung Heewon, Lee Hyunsung,
Shin Yoosung, Lee Gilyoung… They were people I wanted to bring to the
end of this world.

I clenched my fists. Our story shouldn't be declared as good or evil. If that
happened, I wouldn't be able to reach the correct ending of this world. Now
that Yoo Joonghyuk declared it was 'good', there was only one way to
reverse the ruling.

[The constellation 'Demon King of Salvation' is opening his 'status'.]

Black feathers pierced through my back and small horns rose from my
head. The intense sparks caused all noises to subside. I stared at Yoo
Joonghyuk and slowly opened my mouth.

[This story is evil.]
          Chapter 352: Ep. 66 - Beyond Good and Evil, II


My declaration caused the system message in the air to blink.

[You are currently the best narrator of the story.]

[You have a 33.7% share in the giant story 'Torch That Swallowed the
Myth'. Thanks to your declaration, the story is tilting in the direction of
'evil'.]

The confused party members rose from their seats. I raised a hand as if to
reassure them. I spoke to Yoo Joonghyuk through Midday Tryst.

–Yoo Joonghyuk, if this continues, our story will be evil. Do you want that?

My share in Torch That Swallowed the Myth was 33.7%. Meanwhile, Yoo
Joonghyuk's share was 22.8%. I was 10.9% ahead of him.

[The opinions of the two speakers are in conflict.]
[The narrators should decide good and evil through consensus.]

[If an agreement isn't decided within the time limit, the ruling will be based
on the side with the higher number of shares.]

[The end of the ruling has been extended by 10 minutes.]

Yoo Joonghyuk didn't answer. I once again sent him a message.

–I don't know what you are thinking but good and evil shouldn't be decided
here. Quickly withdraw the declaration. Then I'll withdraw mine too.

[The constellation 'Guardian of Youths and Travel' is looking at you.]

[The demon king 'Devil of Lust and Wrath' is pleased with your judgment.]

[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' is confused by your
judgment.]

I was sorry for Uriel but the story couldn't be determined as good or evil
here.

[The demon king 'Ruler of the East Hell' is feeling more favourable towards
you.]

The top of the demon kings. The master of the 2nd Demon Realm, the
Ruler of the East Hell was watching me with a warm face. They seemed to
be misunderstanding something. I wasn't taking the side of evil.

I impatiently cried out again.

–Hey! Can't you hear me?

Then Yoo Joonghyuk moved. Yoo Joonghyuk walked from the table and
pulled out his sword.

[The incarnation 'Yoo Joonghyuk' refuses to agree with you.]
I reflexively avoided his sword. In an instant, the table was split apart and
the stage became a mess. The demon kings screamed as I also pulled out a
sword. Yoo Joonghyuk's Black Heavenly Demon Sword and my Unbroken
Faith collided. My wrist throbbed.

"This is crazy…"

The surprised Uriel tried to run this way but a green barrier prevented the
constellations from moving.

[At present, the constellations and demon kings attending the Duet Between
Good and Evil can't be hostile to each other!]

[The assistance of other people regarded the shares decision is prohibited.]

It was the worst.

[Great Dokkaebi 'Baram' is looking forward to your choice.]

[Great Dokkaebi 'Halong' is looking forward to your choice.]

Even the great dokkaebis exposed their presence. The bureau was paying
attention to the good/evil ruling of our story. Perhaps the scenario was now
being relayed to the Star Stream through another channel.

I stared at the increasingly raging Yoo Joonghyuk. I was unable to read his
face. I didn't know why Yoo Joonghyuk was suddenly doing this. However,
I couldn't yield to this guy who knew nothing.

–Yoo Joonghyuk, you might not understand right now but listen to me.

I had to somehow convince this guy.

–If our story is fixed to either good or evil, a terrifying disaster will arise.

According to the original novel, the battle over the pride of absolute good
and absolute evil would be huge this season. In the past few seasons, the
Duet Between Good and Evil had tilted the balance towards good. In other
words, the demon kings were sharpening their swords in this Duet Between
Good and Evil.

「 If good wins here, the second 'Holy and Demon War' will start. 」

「 On the other hand, if evil wins, the position of Eden will decrease and its
destruction will be accelerated. 」

I hadn't built up enough stories yet for the Holy and Demon War. However,
I didn't want to let evil win.

–I'll explain the details later. Just listen to my words…

"Is this your prophecy?"

A shadow of deep disbelief was in Yoo Joonghyuk's eyes. Prophecy. When
I first met Yoo Joonghyuk, I introduced myself as a prophet. I didn't know
he still believed this but it might work out better. Before I could open my
mouth, Yoo Joonghyuk asked me again. "Or is it information from the book
called Ways of Survival?"

"What?"

My heart suddenly jumped.

…How? How did he know about Ways of Survival?

[The sponsor of incarnation 'Yoo Joonghyuk' isn't happy with this
situation.]

[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' doesn't want you to fight!]

[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' is confused by the
unexpected situation.]
[The constellation 'Secretive Plotter' is watching your decision.]

Sparks flew around Yoo Joonghyuk's body. He frowned like he had a
headache. As if rebelling against another will, Yoo Joonghyuk continued,
"Will this scenario end safely if I follow your words?"

"Yoo Joonghyuk, you now…"

"Is this the way I will be used in the future?"

Kukukukung!

"Is this how to survive in this ruined world?"

Suddenly, there was no strength in my hands.

[The 'Fourth Wall' is shaking.]

My surroundings shook and a small vibration rose in the depths of my
body. The tremors rapidly spread from the epicenter. I grabbed my wildly
shaking right hand. I looked up and saw Yoo Joonghyuk staring at the party
members.

–Do they know?

How much did Yoo Joonghyuk know?

–Answer me, Kim Dokja.

The energy flowing from the Black Heavenly Demon Sword became
stronger. Yoo Joonghyuk had opened up the power of transcendence. It
meant he really wouldn't back down from now on.
[The character 'Yoo Joonghyuk' is moving the giant

story.] [Giant Story 'Torch That Swallowed the Myth' is

starting!] I couldn't leave it like this.

[You are the best narrator of this story.]

[You are controlling the story.]

[Giant Story 'Torch That Swallowed the Myth' isn't satisfied with your
'status'.]

[Giant Story 'Torch That Swallowed the Myth' refuses your domination.]

…What? The story didn't listen to me despite my high shares. Our torch,
which broke through Poseidon's barrier, wound around Yoo Joonghyuk's
Black Heavenly Demon Sword. The white flame wanting to swallow me
was approaching.

[The exclusive skill 'Fourth Wall' is strongly activated!]

「(Dokja-ssi, wake up!) 」

Along with Yoo Sangah's words, I released my status.

[Giant Story 'Demon Realm's Spring' is protecting you!]

[Giant Story 'Torch That Swallowed the Myth' is showing hostility towards
you!]

The two stories we built together collided in the air. The Torch That
Swallowed the Myth and Demon Realm's Spring were like ferocious beasts.
The torn strings scattered through the air like blood.

"What are you doing now? Are you crazy?"
[The incarnation 'Jung Heewon' is jumping into the verdict of the giant
story!]

"Master! What is happening all of a sudden? Why did ahjussi pick evil?"

[The incarnation 'Lee Jihye' is jumping into the verdict of the giant story!]

"Dokja-ssi! Yoo Joonghyuk-ssi! Both of you, stop!"

[The incarnation 'Lee Hyunsung' is jumping into the verdict of the giant
story!]

"Don't bother hyung, you bastard!"

[The incarnation 'Lee Gilyoung' is jumping into the verdict of the giant
story!]

"Ahjussi! Avoid it!"

[The incarnation 'Shin Yoosung' is jumping into the verdict of the giant
story!]

It was a welcome help. The Torch That Swallowed the Myth was a story
involving all of us. In other words, Yoo Joonghyuk and I weren't the only
ones who could judge this story.

[The narrators who have entered the judgment, please distinguish between
good and evil.]

[If you don't choose good or evil, you can't intervene in the confrontation.]

The party members were confused. They panicked at suddenly having to
choose between good or evil. In the confusion, Lee Gilyoung was the first
to open his mouth.

"I will side with Dokja hyung."
[Incarnation 'Lee Gilyoung' has a 3.3% share in the giant story 'Torch That
Swallowed the Myth'.]

[Due to incarnation Lee Gilyoung's declaration, the story is tilting in the
direction of 'evil'.]

I quickly called out to them. "You can't choose evil anymore! Choose
good!"

"Huh?"

"Do as I say! Quickly!"

If Yoo Joonghyuk wouldn't withdraw his declaration then there was only
one way remaining. It was to perfectly balance good and evil.

The current difference was 14.2%. If the remaining four people's shares
were joined together…

"Slowly choose one by one! Yoosung first!"

"Yes!"

[Incarnation 'Shin Yoosung has a 3.3% share in the giant story 'Torch That
Swallowed the Myth'.]

[Incarnation 'Jung Heewon' has a 6.7% share in the giant story 'Torch That
Swallowed the Myth'.]

[Incarnation 'Lee Hyunsung' has a 7.3% share in the giant story 'Torch That
Swallowed the Myth'.]

[Three narrators have chosen 'good'.]

"Stop!"

The last one to choose, Lee Jihye paused at my cry.
[The balance has tilted by 3.1% towards good.]

[If the consensus fails in the next five minutes, the Torch That Swallowed
the Myth will be confirmed as good.]

The party members had a bigger share in the story than I expected. There
was only Lee Jihye remaining.

"Ahjussi! I'm 5.8%!"

The difference between good and evil was 3.1%. Meanwhile, Lee Jihye had
a 5.8% share. No matter what option Lee Jihye chose, it was a situation
where good and evil couldn't be balanced.

My brain worked quickly.

…What if I could bring the shares of the other party members to my side?

[Narrators participating in the good or evil judgment can't 'gift shares.]

Damn, this convenient way didn't work. Yoo Joonghyuk's Black Heavenly
Demon Sword was flying towards my neck.

"Stop it!"

Jung Heewon, who was able to intervene in the duel, stopped Yoo
Joonghyuk's sword instead of me. Lee Hyunsung ran and hugged Yoo
Joonghyuk's body from behind while the children surrounded me like they
were protecting me. Lee Jihye stood in the middle with a helpless
expression.

"Why are the two of you fighting? Fighting now…!"

Yoo Joonghyuk's gaze alternated between the party members. It seemed
like he wanted to say something. No, I knew what he wanted to say.

「 You are being deceived. 」
His trembling eyes were pouring rage towards me.

「 This guy, he deceived all of us. 」

I thought this day would come eventually. In fact, I thought about it dozens
of times a day.

"Everybody, get out of the way."

Yoo Joonghyuk amplified his status, blew away Lee Hyunsung, knocked
down Lee Jihye and ran this way. Jung Heewon and Yoo Joonghyuk's
swords collided. However, Jung Heewon couldn't use Judgment Time and
wasn't capable of dealing with Yoo Joonghyuk.

I placed the children behind me and stepped forward.

[The demon king 'Monarch of Stars and Logic' is rooting for you.]

[The demon king 'Devil of Principles' wants you to win.]

[The constellation 'Morning Star Goddess' wants good to win.]

[A large number of constellations and demon kings are watching Kim
Dokja's Company.]

They were the messages of the existences watching me walk forward. Why
were they so obsessed with good and evil?

[The exclusive skill 'Reading Comprehension' is activated.]

…I already knew the answer.

They were bound to do so.

[Giant Story 'Practitioner of Encouraging Good and Punishing Evil' is
continuing.]
[Giant Story 'Guardian of White Evil' is continuing.]

[Giant Story 'More Evil Than Evil' is continuing.]

[Giant Story 'The Suitable Good' is continuing.]

…

Numerous strings were swarming like insects in the eyes of the
constellations and demon kings.

It was the stories they had. The stories were controlling them. They were on
longer constellations or demon kings.

They only existed to execute 'good' and 'evil' in this world. Most of them
were merely breeding tools that the old stories used to propagate
themselves. These stories were trying to devour our nebula.

[If the consensus fails in the next two minutes, the Torch That Swallowed
the Myth will be confirmed as good.]

I couldn't allow that to happen. I quickly made a decision and shouted.
"Jihye! Choose good!"

"Eh? But…"

"Quickly!"

Lee Jihye made a puzzled expression. It was strange that I took her to
choose good when it was already the dominant one. Lee Jihye chose
immediately.

[The balance has tilted by 8.9% towards good!]

[If the consensus fails in the next 40 seconds, the Torch That Swallowed
the Myth will be confirmed as good.]
The difference was even larger. 8.9%… yes, this was for the best.

I took a deep breath and used all my strength to call out the modifier of a
certain being.

[Abyssal Black Flame Dragon!]

I knew that he was watching. It meant the occurrences here were known to
his incarnation. In this situation, there was only one person who would
understand exactly what I wanted.

[The constellation 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' is laughing madly.]

Yoo Joonghyuk's Black Heavenly Demon Sword filled with the power of
transcendence flew to my neck. It was an inevitable blow.

Then a crack appeared in the ceiling of the banquet hall. Yoo Joonghyuk
looked up at the ceiling but it was already too late. The running Yoo
Joonghyuk was crushed by the fragments of the broken ceiling.

Some large pieces were avoided but there were too many stones pouring
down. I saw a shadow in the dirty dust. The hair was sweaty like the person
had rushed here. The bandages half released from the left arm was blowing
in the wind.

In the dust, this person smiled as she trampled on Yoo Joonghyuk. "I knew
you couldn't do this without me."

[The incarnation 'Han Sooyoung' is jumping into the verdict of the giant
story!]
          Chapter 353: Ep. 66 - Beyond Good and Evil, III


Under the rubble, Yoo Joonghyuk's hands were sticking out. Han Sooyoung
stared down at Yoo Joonghyuk. "This jerk, always appearing and trampling
on people… do you feel good doing so?"

[Incarnation 'Han Sooyoung' has an 8.9% share in the giant story 'Torch
That Swallowed the Myth'.]

As expected, Han Sooyoung would have the correct amount of shares.

[Narrators participating in the good or evil judgment can't 'gift shares.] It
meant that those who hadn't yet participated would be able to exchange
their shares.

Han Sooyoung watched me and grumbled through Midday Tryst.

–I lost 0.1% of this story to Lee Seolhwa.
Perhaps Han Sooyoung had adjusted her shares ownership to Lee Seolhwa
as soon as she learnt the information here. Then she came straight to this
place. Han Sooyoung turned towards the surrounding constellations and
declared with a growl, "I am evil. In addition, that fucking Kim Dokja
standing over there is definitely evil."

Han Sooyoung made me evil regardless of everything else and continued
looking at Yoo Joonghyuk and the party members.

"However, Kim Dokja's Company isn't good or evil."

This person shouting with her short hair flying looked amazing. At this
time, Han Sooyoung could be seen as the main character, not Yoo
Joonghyuk.

[The time limit has expired and the judgment of good and evil has been
finished.]

[A total of 91.8% has participation in the judgment of good and evil.]

[The participation rate of good and evil is 45.9% : 45.9%.]

[Good and evil are in perfect equilibrium.]

The astonished demon kings and constellations were looking this way. I
looked back at them and added, "We aren't defined by your definitions."

[Giant Story 'Torch That Swallowed the Myth' is a story that can't be
distinguished between good and evil.]

The message drove in a wedge. I could see the dokkaebi in charge of
hosting this event smiling. It seemed that he thought it would be like this or
perhaps he wanted this ending.

The bureau must be excited right now. It was due to the huge amount of
indirect messages entering my ears.
[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' is satisfied with your
judgment.]

[The constellation 'Queen of the Darkest Spring' is proud of you.]

[The constellation 'Father of the Rich Night' is pleased with your mettle.]

[A number of constellations of the neutral system favour your nebula.]

[Constellations of the neutral system have sponsored you 281,000 coins.]

It was expected that the constellations of the neutral system would like this.
Some choices would occur while rejecting other choices.

[Someone has recommended your story to the Star Stream.]

[You have acquired a new story!]

Of course, this didn't apply to all constellations.

[Your choice has caused resentment among some of the constellations of

[What…?]

[The good or evil of the story isn't determined?]

The atmosphere of the constellations and demon kings were rapidly
changing.

[Constellations of the absolute good system oppose the ruling.]

[Constellations of the absolute evil system oppose the ruling.]

An unusual flow was detected around the two tables, as if a riot would
occur.

[Such a thing can't happen! Bureau, judge it again!]
[What the hell is this?]

From the demon kings to the archangels. All the gazes of the attendees
were fixed on the dokkaebi. The advanced dokkaebi felt the crisis and
responded while sweating. [Sorry, it isn't possible. No one can reverse the
outcome of a story that has already been judged. That's the rule.]

Fortunately, the bureau kept to its principles. However, keeping to the
principles didn't always bring about a good result.

[…I was going to wait and see this season.]

Things were flowing differently from expectations. The mid and low
ranked demon kings rose from their seats and released their status.

[If the targets can't decide good and evil, we have to make a decision in
another way.]

Once the demon kings moved, the archangels stood up like they wouldn't
lose.

[Many demon kings are showing hostility to the angels of the absolute good
system!]

[Many archangels are showing vigilance towards the demon kings.]

[The balance of good and evil is shaking!]

The two camps confronted each other and it seemed they would rush
forward at any moment.

I stayed closed to the party members and watched the situation. By my side,
Jung Heewon pulled out the Sword of Judgment and spoke in a tense voice.
"Dokja-ssi."

"It's okay."
I guarded the party members, who seemed relieved. The Great War of
Saints and Demons might take place but such a huge event wouldn't occur
here. [The constellation 'Scribe of Heaven' is dissuading the archangels.]

[The demon king 'Ruler of the East Hell' is controlling the demon kings.]

Perhaps Scribe of Heaven Metatron and Ruler of the East Hell Agares knew
this as well.

Good and evil must exist. If the scenario was triggered here, the two camps
would be destroyed by a disaster. If I was right, the damn dokkaebis of the
bureau would understand this the best.

[The great dokkaebi 'Baram' has revealed his presence on the stage.]

A great dokkaebi appeared like he had been waiting. Great Dokkaebi
Baram. I was familiar with him in the original novel.

[Stop it. I'm sure you know that fighting here won't solve the problem.]

The hard voice caused the demon kings and constellations to revolt.

[The bureau can't intervene in this fight!]

[Do you mean to end it like this?]

Some of the constellations and demon kings gathered here were close to the
myth-grade. Thus, it was natural for them to not listen to the great
dokkaebi.
The story might've been different if the dokkaebi king came directly.
Complaints came from everywhere and Baram told them.

[There is no reversal of the ruling. In addition, we can't allow hostilities in
this place.]
The resolute declaration caused the sparks flying in the air to block the
absolute good and absolute evil members. The opposing constellations were
about to rebel again when Baram continued. [Your complaint is that the
status of good and evil can't be determined. If that's the case, how about one
more giant story?]

[…What does this mean?]

[We will open up a previous scenario to determine the status of this season's
good and evil.]

I couldn't conceal my confusion at the words of the great dokkaebi. This
guy,
what now…

[The Star Stream agrees with the decision of the great dokkaebis.]

[The Duet Between Good and Evil wants a new scenario to determine the
status of good and evil.]

The probability of the Star Stream was moving. The rivers of the galaxy
were flowing towards the desired story of many constellations. The
scenario that this probability was moving towards could be found in the
hands of the Star Stream.

The Ruler of the East Hell asked, [Do you mean to open the Great War of
Saints and Demons now?]

[If you want.]

Baram's declaration caused an uproar among numerous constellations.
Baram made an unknown smile as he looked at me.

[However, please set the stage of the scenario yourself.]
During the intermission, the constellations and demon kings spoke among
themselves about where to set the stage for the Great War of Saints and
Demons. Fortunately, the hostile gazes poured towards us seemed to relax
thanks to the dokkaebi's intervention.

The party members were exhausted by the sudden situation and sat down.
Han Sooyoung kicked at Yoo Joonghyuk's hand that was sticking out from
the pile of stones. "What is this? Why hasn't he come out yet?"

Yoo Joonghyuk showed no reaction. I observed the hand of the buried man
but I was afraid to grab hold of this hand. The words spoken by him were
still ringing in my ears.

–Or is it information from the book called Ways of Survival?

Where did he hear this story? How far had the filtering been lifted and how
much did he know about Ways of Survival?

Han Sooyoung and I cooperated to bring him out. Yoo Joonghyuk was
unconscious. It was strange. He couldn't pass out just because he was hit by
a pile of stones.

"…Why is this jerk in this state?"

I looked closer and saw that Yoo Joonghyuk's body wasn't normal. I didn't
know where he went but his body was covered in large and small wounds.
There were traces of him killing and cutting something. In the past two
days, Yoo Joonghyuk seemed to have wandered through a scenario I didn't
know about. Under these circumstances, he couldn't overcome his anger
towards me and suffered severe injuries.

Han Sooyoung activated Midday Tryst and immediately sent me a message.

–Yoo Joonghyuk has noticed the existence of Ways of Survival.

–I know. Yoo Joonghyuk told me before you came.
I gave a brief overview of Yoo Joonghyuk's words. Han Sooyoung frowned
deeply when she heard the story.

–…This jerk, where did he hear about it?

–I don't know. Where have you been?

–I killed the remaining prophets. I wondered if the information leaked from
them.

–Did you figure it out?

–No.

It was as I expected. The prophets would become characters once they ran
out of information.

–The information didn't leak from the prophets. In my opinion…

I looked at Metatron who was discussing something with the archangels in
the distance. Perhaps Yoo Joonghyuk became aware of Ways of Survival
through Metatron.

Han Sooyoung said,

–Asmodeus also knew about the existence of Ways of Survival. Perhaps
most of the top constellations know.

The top constellations… It was also time for the Seekers of the End to
become active. Finally, I could start to see the end of this long-running
scenario.

I looked down at the fallen Yoo Joonghyuk. Han Sooyoung stared at me.

–Kim Dokja, think about what's important right now.

I nodded. I looked up and Great Dokkaebi Baram was staring at me.
–We also have to participate in the Great War of Saints and Demons.

–Are you crazy? It isn't a scenario we can enter with our level right now.

Han Sooyoung was right. Originally, the Great War of Saints and Demons
was a main scenario in the 80s. I hadn't intended to do this either. It was
better to avoid the dangerous scenarios if possible. However, I couldn't do
that with the Great War of Saints and Demons. It didn't matter if it didn't
wake up but once the scenario occurred, it absolutely couldn't be avoided.

–It doesn't matter if it is a higher-ranked scenario. The problem is the stage
of the war.

–What…

Baram clapped in the distance. The constellations sat in place and Baram
opened his mouth.

[We will end the recess. Constellations and demon kings, please choose the
stage of the scenario.]

As if waiting, the constellations and demon kings stood up and shouted.

[The stage of the Great War of Saints and Demons will be the 14th Demon
Realm―]

[Our Guardian Tree is a good giant story stage.]

[What nonsense is that? The stage is…!]

They all tried to make a place favourable to them as the stage. There was
also a place I wanted as the stage but no one would support me if I spoke. I
thought to myself. How to do…
「 (Dokja-ssi, do you want the island as the stage?) 」

Then I heard a message from Yoo Sangah in my head.

「 (Perhaps I can help?) 」

'…Huh?'

「 (I found something interesting inside the wall.) 」

'Interesting?'

There was no answer from Yoo Sangah. Instead, I heard a rustling sound in
my head. After a while, an uneasy atmosphere occurred in the loud hall.

Several constellations were whispering together.

[The information that just came in…]

[What? Is that true?]

I noticed their whispers.

…Were they constellations with the power of 'revelation'? The atmosphere
was becoming graver. The whispers spread like waves. After five minutes,
even Metatron was making a serious expression. The voices of the arguing
constellations and demon kings died down one by one. After a while, they
started to glance at each other. It was the demon kings who acted first in the
fierce battle of wits.

[I'm sorry, there is a bit of work to do and I have to go.]

[Me too! It is the same for me.]

Several demon kings suddenly disappeared from their seats. I watched their
faces closely. They were those associated with the Seekers of the End.
[I'm sorry but I have to leave for a while.]

Once the Morning Star Goddess of the Guardian Tree nebula spoke these
words, the situation became a one-sided wave.

[I have a little work too─]

More and more people left and Metatron sighed lightly before glancing at
Baram.

[I think you'll have to decide on your own.]

Great Dokkaebi Baram's eyes widened as he looked at the air.

[…Interesting. A revelation at this timing?]

Several constellations noticeably flinched at the word 'revelation'. Baram
laughed. […Good. Even if everyone doesn't speak, the stage has already
been decided―]

I listened to the words of the great dokkaebi and was in a daze. What the
hell just happened? Then pain suddenly shot through my head.

[The probability of the Star Stream is doubting you!]

I perceived a terrible gaze starting at me. It was gazing at me as if it found
something suspicious. The gaze lasted for a moment before disappearing.

[The Star Stream has turned its gaze from you.]

I wiped my sweat and cautiously called out to Yoo Sangah.

'Yoo Sangah-ssi? What did you do?'

Yoo Sangah was silent like she was looking for words to explain. Then she
said.
「 (Dokja-ssi, do you know how constellations read the future?) 」

'…I know'.

There were two main ways in which the constellations could read the
future. One way was to gather data to measure the future, like Hermes'
system. The other way was to receive a revelation like the Moerae, Eden
and some of the demon kings. It was a force called 'divine revelation'.

Yoo Sangah searched for words for a moment before replying with a light
laugh.

「 (Well, I think I became a god.) 」
         Chapter 354: Ep. 66 - Beyond Good and Evil, IV


At this moment, Bihyung was watching the screen of Duet Between Good
and Evil at the bureau.

[The stage of the 2nd Great War of Saints and Demons will be the
'Reincarnation Island' located in the Dark Fault.]

The moment the great dokkaebi's declaration was heard, all the dokkaebis
of the bureau were in an uproar.

"No, why the island all of a sudden?"

"Why are the great dokkaebis thinking?"

Even the great dokkaebis couldn't set the stage for the 80th main scenario.
If the will of the Star Stream didn't move…

[The Star Stream is willing to open the 80th main scenario.]
[A new main scenario has been created.]

Bihyung was surprised by the system message. "Did the Star Stream really
move?"

The series of shocking scenario changes made Bihyung stunned.

"Bihyung! A revelation was just received!"

"…A revelation?"

After a while, a new panel was prepared. The screen hadn't surfaced yet but
Bihyung knew what it was.

"…The plate of revelation."

An unknown slab that only the constellations and demon kings who had
acquired the power of 'revelation' could see. The material was unknown and
even the space and coordinates weren't clearly known. The bureau could
only observe the strange object.

Each nebula had a different name for this 'plate'. Divine revelation, a single
word, the old devil's whisper…

It was an unidentified object that spoiled the information of the future,
forcing the bureau to pay attention to it.

The method that the constellations of the Star Stream used to read the future
was simple. Sometimes there was a hole in the plate of revelation and a
series of story fragments would be released from the hole. The fragments
that spilled out had information about the future. The constellation and
demon kings recognized it, combined words and used this to predict the
future or read their fortunes.

The stigma called 'Revelation' was made. It was actually just reconstructing
these words.
Bihyung asked, "Is there another turn in the plate of revelation?"

"Yes, it has been a problem since it started shaking a few years ago."

The original version of the revelation released future information but it
didn't have a significant impact on the bureau's scenario probability. The
future reconstructed through the revelations were uncertain and unclear.

However, there had been a 'crack' in this plate since a few years ago.
Through that crack, whole information of the future came through.

"A strange hole occurred a few days ago…"

The hole that occurred a few days ago caused a problem in the probability
that couldn't be overlooked even by the Star Stream. Information that
shouldn't have been passed on crossed through that broken hole without
damage.

Bihyung still had a headache when he thought about the work at that time.
Strange strings had emerged through the hole for a while.

『 Three Ways to Survive in a Ruined World. 』

The name seemed like the title of a book and the constellations of the Star
Stream fell into chaos.

–What is Three Ways to Survive in a Ruined World.txt –

Does 'ruin' mean the ■■ of every scenario?

The constellations who neglected the scenarios and remained relaxed
started to act like their feet were on fire after this revelation was released.
The rumours about the apocalypse spread and there were rumours about the
end of the Star Stream.

"The screen is ready!"
Bihyung watched the black-white screen nervously. A few words that
emerged through the hole caused the entire Star Stream to shake. What type
of revelation would occur this time?

After a while, the screen of the revelation appeared. Then there was a very
small hole in the center of the plate.

"There is no change… eh?"

The next moment, the dokkaebis were astonished by the whitish object that
appeared inside the hole. It was someone's mouth.

–Ah, ah… so, um… microphone test?

The dokkaebi cried out, "What is this…?"

The bureau was in chaos as the mouth kept on talking.

–Can you hear me? I'm going to give you a revelation now. I'll only show
you for a second so look and remember!

Along with the clear and cheerful voice, there was the sound of pages
turning. After a while, fragments of a story passed through the hole.

「 How to survive in a ruined world, the third way. 」

The revelation appeared clearly. It was truly like a divine revelation.

「 That method is on Reincarnation Island. 」

The story fragments scattered in the air and the voice said.

–Have you seen it? Then goodbye!

The hole closed and the voice disappeared.

Bihyung muttered, "Oh my god."
None of the shocked dokkaebis of the bureau could open their mouths.
Bells were ringing from all over. The unstoppable inquiries of the
constellations were pouring in.

The Duet Between Good and Evil was still playing on the panel on the
other side.

[I will say it once again.]

The voice of Great Dokkaebi Baram rang out.

[The stage of the 2nd Great War of Saints and Demons will be the
'Reincarnation Island' located in the Dark Fault.]




After the Duet Between Good and Evil, our group immediately returned to
Earth. All the way back to the industrial complex, the party members were
excited. In particular, Jung Heewon and Lee Jihye were checking the
performance of the plaques we received.

[Grand Prize of Duet Between Good and Evil].

In the Star Stream, the 'status' generally rose only through the accumulation
of stories. However, there were extremely rare star relics that raised the
status without needing the accumulation of stories. This was the case with
the plaques awarded at the Duet Between Good and Evil.

"My sword seems lighter… is this enough to be able to swing Hyunsung
ahjussi lightly?" Lee Jihye's

murmur caused Lee Hyunsung to tremble.
Certainly, the plaque was more effective than getting two quasi-myth-grade
stories. Given that all the quasi-myth-grade stories I acquired were those I
gained after suffering and dying, it was a tremendous boost.

[5,000,000 coins Exchange Ticket]

In addition, they received five million coins as prize money.

"Ha, Dokja-ssi… we're rich now…"

"I won't have to worry about coins for a while."

"Kids, how much did you get?"

Jung Heewon was busy asking questions to the children who received the
Best Chemistry Award.

"Shin Yoosung, honestly, I was a bit more active. Give me another 100,000
coins."

"What nonsense is this? It will naturally be split in half. It is the same with
the story shares."

Lee Hyunsung stopped the children. The party members seemed to be in
good spirits for their own reasons, but on the other hand, they were also
glancing at me.

「 In fact, there is a question that everyone hasn't asked. 」

Why did Yoo Joonghyuk and I fight? The party members had seen the
scene with their own eyes but no one asked me about it. Maybe they were
instinctively avoiding the topic. Perhaps it was their own consideration as
they waited for me to speak first.

I was still listening to Yoo Sangah in my head while I carried the
unconscious Yoo Joonghyuk on my back.
'…You mean, you leaked the contents of Ways of Survival through the hole
in the Fourth Wall?'

「 (Yes.) 」

'The constellations accepted it as a revelation?'

「 (That's right.) 」

I didn't understand at first. The information sent out of the Fourth Wall
became a 'revelation' to the constellations? In the first place, the role of the
'revelation' in the original novel… no, wait.

'Don't tell me?'

There were many things in my head.

Yoo Sangah asked, 「 (Dokja-ssi, have you noticed the Fourth Wall might
be the original words?) 」

"Yes. I don't know the exact sense but…'

「 (Originally, the Fourth Wall is a stage term. A wall separating the play
from the wall. The characters in the play would never be able to
recognize the Fourth Wall. It is because they don't exist outside the
stage.) 」 Outside the stage. It was the 'reality' I lived in.

Goosebumps formed on my arms. Indeed, if the name 'Fourth Wall' had its
origins in the same meaning as Yoo Sangah's description, it was natural
there would be a Ways of Survival inside this wall. It was because the
contents of Ways of Survival were created in reality.

In other words, the revelation was a 'spoiler' that flowed from the novel to
reality. One couldn't find the source so it became a divine revelation in the
eyes of the characters.
Yoo Sangah continued speaking,

「 (I always thought it was strange. The filtered information about Ways of
Survival was suddenly released… however, that time coincided with when I
entered the Fourth Wall.) 」

'Coincides?'

「 (Yes, the book blocking the hole I entered through was Ways of
Survival. The title could be seen very well…) 」

Now I understood everything. The reason why the constellations and
demon kings suddenly knew about Ways of Survival. It was why the
development that wasn't in the original novel suddenly unfolded. The
information they knew had all leaked through the hole in the Fourth Wall.

'It is a bit complicated but this is a good thing'.

「 (Right?) 」

Yoo Sangah replied with a laugh. She was probably thinking the same thing
as me.

「 (By the way, I can't use it very often. I noticed a lot of looks… oh, I'm
sorry. I have to go for a minute because the seniors are calling.) 」

Then Yoo Sangah's voice disappeared from my head. She was the youngest
member of the library but she had a lot of sense.

In any case, thanks to Yoo Sangah's performance, we got a new card to use.
The Fourth Wall allowed me to manipulate the revelations that the
constellations received. Until it was revealed to be a false revelation, I
could use the information to incite the constellations.

Han Sooyoung walked beside me and opened her mouth. "You haven't
spoken in a while?"
"I was just thinking to myself for a while."

"You must have a lot of thoughts."

Han Sooyoung bit her lips and used Midday Tryst while talking.

–What are you going to do now?

–What else? I have to prepare for the next scenario. The Great War of
Saints and Demons is the 80th scenario and it will start in a month.

–Apart from that.

Han Sooyoung had a complicated look in her eyes. She was watching Yoo
Joonghyuk being carried on my back.

–Do you know what happens when Yoo Joonghyuk will wake up?

Yoo Joonghyuk was aware of the identity of Ways of Survival. I didn't
know what he knew but I couldn't keep hiding information from him. He
might be shocked and receive a terrible wound but… nevertheless…

Han Sooyoung told me.

–For reference. I am against it.

–What?

–The thing you're about to say.

Han Sooyoung acted like she knew my thoughts. She sighed lightly and
looked at the ground.

–With your personality, it is strange that you have been hiding it so far.

Han Sooyoung seemed to misunderstand me. If I could've hidden it better, I
would've hidden as much as I could. If possible, until the end of the story.
Han Sooyoung shook her head.

–You can hide it as much as possible. Just pretend you don't know. Pretend
to be a prophet, as you have done so far.

–Do you think they will believe it? I have to talk now. It isn't just Yoo
Joonghyuk but the other party members as well.

Han Sooyoung's eyes grew bigger at my words.

–What nonsense is this? Why are you going to tell them?

–They deserve to know.

–I tried it before. However, the characters can't know anything about Ways
of Survival. They think it is just a joke.

–It might be different now. The filtering is released.

Han Sooyoung opened her mouth before closing it again. Instead of
pressing me, she searched the faces of the people who didn't know
anything. A faint contempt towards me could be seen in Han Sooyoung's
eyes.

–Is it for you or is it for them?

–…

–You have already deceived these people. Now you are going to ask for
forgiveness?

–I don't mean to be forgiven.

Like Han Sooyoung, I also studied their faces.
The strong but delicate Jung Heewon. The sincere and unsophisticated Lee
Hyunsung. The tough but sweet Lee Jihye. The adult but pure Shin
Yoosung.

I looked at their faces and recalled the 'descriptions' I knew. Some of them
weren't 'described' and others had different faces from the 'descriptions'.
They were faces I knew but didn't know.

Shin Yoosung suddenly looked back and waved towards me. I spoke while
waving back at the child.

–…I want to be real companions.

Han Sooyoung was silent for a long time before quietly turning around and
disappearing into the Factory. In the distance, a message from her came
back like an echo.

–Didn't I say it clearly? I oppose it.

Not long after, we arrived at the Factory and each of us took a rest to
recover. That evenng, I summoned all the members of Kim Dokja's
Company apart from the unconscious Yoo Joonghyuk.

I had Biyoo block the channel and placed a thick barrier to prevent other
constellations from listening.

After some preparations, I looked back at the party members. "I have
something to say to you."

I opened my mouth but couldn't speak easily. Perhaps she thought I was
playing a joke but Lee Jihye trembled. "Ahjussi, what is wrong with you all
of a sudden? You are scary." I tried to smile at Lee Jihye.
I had been troubled for a long time. I had been certain that this moment
would come.
Lee Hyunsung and Shin Yoosung were looking at me with worry. I saw the
people who were worried about my first, even in this situation, and bit my
lips. "Some of you."

The eyes of the group shook. I saw Han Sooyoung turn away. Then I spoke
like I was pulling the trigger. "You are characters of a story."
          Chapter 355: Ep. 66 - Beyond Good and Evil, V


The expressions of the party members changed at my words. Jung
Heewon's eyes were wide while Lee Jihye looked confused. Lee Hyunsung
had big eyes. Finally, Shin Yoosung…

「 Kim Dok ja has the wrong id ea. 」

The Fourth Wall was heard in my head.

「 It isn't too la te now. 」

I didn't know if it was the will of the Fourth Wall or the weak part of my
mind. The Fourth Wall reflected my feelings to some extent so both might
be true. Either way, this time I made a decision.

"I know it is hard to understand my words." I had to tell this story to the
group of people. "I'll slowly explain it from the beginning."
I talked for a long time. One day, the novel I was reading became reality. In
that story, I met them. I didn't tell them the whole story but at the same
time, I didn't lie.

I knew about the group members before I met them. I didn't speak properly
about the fact that I knew the future. I monopolized information alone and
deceived people. I spoke about all of it. It was as if I was bringing out the
old darkness.

A little further away from the party, Han Sooyoung was staring at me with
a frown. I understood her feelings. It was the same with Han Sooyoung of
the 1863rd round.

However, I couldn't live like Han Sooyoung. This story should be done
properly. To move forward properly, some stories must be communicated.
Someday… just as Yoo Joonghyuk.

「 I am a regressor. 」

Maybe Yoo Joonghyuk also felt like me. He knew the future, experienced
the same story again and again and met the party members in countless
rounds. Then… he sent them away. I could

understand Yoo Joonghyuk's feelings when he poured out the story without
any tricks.

"…Thus, I brought you here."

My story was over. Yet no one opened their mouths after the story was
over. It wasn't that they didn't understand my story. It was a long story that
even a young child could comprehend. Nevertheless, the party members
didn't speak.

I bowed and continued. "I want to sincerely apologize to all of you. I'm
really sorry to only be telling you this now."
I wanted to know. What was the group thinking? What were they feeling?
Even so, I didn't use Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint. In this situation, it
really would be a deception if I read them using this skill.

I wanted to use my own strength without relying on any skills. I wanted to
believe that whatever they thought and felt inside, the actions they chose
was really their decision.

I slowly looked up and met Lee Jihye's eyes. Lee Jihye's eyes were red. The
moment I saw these eyes, I suddenly realized something. I already knew
these eyes.

「 "Then Master knew all of the future…" 」

They were exactly the same as when Lee Jihye heard Yoo Joonghyuk's
story. Lee Jihye slowly opened her mouth. "Then until now, you knew all
about the future…"

As if the original character was reading the given script, Lee Jihye spoke. I
also responded to her like there was a script.

「 "That's right." 」

"Yes."

Lee Jihye gritted her teeth and told me, "Then now… why are you telling us
this?"

The wounded Sword Demon was furious. I read the original novel and
could predict what she would say.

「 "What the hell are we to you?" 」

Lee Jihye's shoulders trembled slightly as she bowed her head. The
situation that followed continued to flow in my mind. Lee Jihye would pull
out her sword and might attack me because she couldn't suppress her anger.
There were many such occasions in the original novel. However, Lee Jihye
chose a way that I didn't expect at all. "Let's say that you knew the future."

"…"

"It was all planned and ahjussi used us for your purpose. Let's say we are
characters of that damn Ways of Survival and everything is set!" Lee Jihye
was crying, watching me while biting her pallid lips. "Then… why did you
throw your life away for us so many times?"

I saw the tears falling down her cheeks and tried to open my mouth several
times. It was an unexpected question. It was because it was unexpected that
I couldn't answer…

"Answer me! If we are really characters in a fictional novel, why did you
die for us over and over?"

It was a question that I couldn't answer with the Ways of Survival that I
read.

[The 'Fourth Wall' is shaking violently.]

Lee Jihye wiped her eyes and hit my shoulder as she walked past me. Jung
Heewon hurriedly chased after her.

"…Dokja-ssi, we'll talk later."

Shin Yoosung hesitated as she stared at me helplessly before following
after Jung Heewon. Lee Hyunsung had blank eyes as he walked out of the
room with a bowed head.

The only ones remaining were Han Sooyoung, Lee Seolhwa and Lee
Gilyoung. Lee Gilyoung was staring at me with complicated eyes while Lee
Seolhwa bowed her head like she was shocked. Han Sooyoung patted Lee
Seolhwa's back and snapped at me. "Kim Dokja, leave for a while."
A hospital room. I gazed at my mother's sleeping face. I visited the hospital
room in the interlude because the party members didn't return after a long
time.

Since the last major surgery, my mother slept like this all day. She had
shaded eyes and haggard cheeks. I peered at my mother's face and was
reminded of a time when I visited her in prison. What did my mother think
when her son visited her and only talked about a novel?

"Your expression is dark."

"…You are awake?"

"I woke up from the moment you entered."

It was a voice that didn't contain any energy. I dragged a matted blanket up
and covered my mother's neck. My mother smiled faintly. "It is good to
almost die. My son is taking care of me."

"Get better quickly."

"Talk to me. Anything is fine."

I struggled for a moment before opening my mouth. "In the 154th round of
Ways of Survival, Yoo Joonghyuk brought up the story of his regression
with the party members…"

"Did you talk to the group about Ways of Survival?"

"How do you know?"
My mother stretched out her bony hand and grabbed mine. "You thought
they would blame you. You thought they would feel deceived and ask why
you hid the information."

"It didn't happen like that."

"You don't know how to seek forgiveness."

I silently nodded.

–Answer me! If we are really characters in a fictional novel, why did you
die for us over and over?"

Lee Jihye's voice was revolving in my ears.

My mother said, "It isn't up to you to decide if it is a matter to forgive."

"Then…"

"Maybe the person behind you can tell you."

I turned my head and saw Jung Heewon standing at the door of the hospital
room. I excused myself and left the hospital room.

Jung Heewon scratched her cheeks and suggested, "Shall we take a walk?"

We walked down the corridor of the hospital wing. It was a simple corridor
where no decorations could be found. It seemed to be Yoo Joonghyuk's
taste… this guy had been tinkering with the Factory in the last three years.
In fact, the end of this corridor contained the hospital room where Yoo
Joonghyuk was lying.

Jung Heewon looked out the window and opened her mouth first. "Thank
you… for telling me."

I didn't know how much Jung Heewon had been troubled before saying this.
It was worse because I couldn't see her face. The party members could be
seen outside the window. Lee Gilyoung and Shin Yoosung were bickering
while Lee Hyunsung and Lee Seolhwa comforted Lee Jihye.

"Everyone will be fine. Jihye will take a bit of time but…"

"Heewon-ssi…"

Before I could finish my words, Jung Heewon turned to look at me. Her
face was smiling as usual. I closed my mouth and Jung Heewon asked, "Are
you surprised because I'm fine?"

"That's not it"

"No, it isn't."

Jung Heewon had long known that I had 'future information'. Perhaps
among the characters, she was the person who knew the most about me.

Jung Heewon spoke as she started stretching. "It isn't a big deal. This is a
world where monsters and dokkaebis exist… it is something special that
turned the novel into a reality."

"…"

"I understand the past now. The reason why Dokja-ssi said I didn't appear
in the future. Does that mean I wasn't in the novel that Dokja-ssi read?"

"…Yes."

Biyoo floated like a cloud and moved above Shin Yoosung's head.

Jung Heewon told me, "Then I was able to safely come here thanks to
Dokja-ssi."

"That, Heewon-ssi―"

"Thank you for finding me. I'm not being sarcastic. I mean it sincerely."
I knew. I was already familiar with the tone Jung Heewon used to tease me.
Even so, I didn't know what to say.

"Don't be gloomy and depressed by yourself and look forward to the future.
If you like, give me a promotion faster. Now, this is a handshake to cheer
up."

Jung Heewon grabbed my hand with a strong force. Something warm
suddenly rose inside me.

I firmly bit my lips.

「Jung Heewon, she isn't okay. 」

I could feel the pulse from Jung Heewon's hand. She would also be sad. She
would be in pain and it would be hard for her. Even so…

Jung Heewon held my hand tightly for a while before letting go with a
smile.
Then she asked, "By the way Dokja-ssi… I have a question."

"Yes, ask."

"If this world is a novel, it means there is a protagonist."

As expected, Jung Heewon was sharp. I told the group about Ways of
Survival but I didn't say who the protagonist was. However, Jung Heewon
was already aware of the identity of the protagonist.

Jung Heewon was staring at the end of the corridor. "Is that why you were
fighting?"

"I haven't exactly spoken to him but… it seems so."

"Since you started it, you need to see the end properly. Do you

know?" I nodded.
"That person won't be easy."

I knew. Still, it couldn't be avoided.




For the next two days, I was in Yoo Joonghyuk's hospital room. I hardly
met with other people. I was worried but decided to remain calm. I believed
that the people needed time to think. It wouldn't be too late to talk once the
party members were ready.

Yoo Joonghyuk still didn't wake up.

"The wounds of his flesh have almost recovered. I thin kit is a problem of
the mind."

"A problem of the mind?"

"It seems he is refusing to wake up… perhaps he experienced a severe
shock."

Those were Aileen's words. She exchanged the story pack and left, leaving
only Yoo Joonghyuk and I in the room.

The floating dust settled on his nose. I opened my mouth while watching
Yoo Joonghyuk. "You grabbed me first and dropped me down the
bridge." I knew he couldn't hear me but I still wanted to talk.

「 "Get your hand off me and get lost, you damn jerk."

"I believe you. You are definitely a prophet." 」

The first time I encountered him on the bridge. Suddenly, a laugh emerged.
"Honestly, you aren't in a position to blame me for anything. You are a
regressor… how many people died because of you?"

Once I started speaking, the memories poured out like a waterfall. It was
like Pandora's Box. It felt as if a lot of time had passed. I had spent a lot of
time with this person.

"I thought I understood you better than anyone but I don't know these days.
Why did you do that in during the Flood of Disasters?"

「 "…That person is my companion." 」

"Why did you call me a companion? You wouldn't say that normally…
Stabbing me in Dark Castle… even though I told you to kill me at the
time."

「 "Kim Dokja! No! Kim Dokja!" 」

Every single memory caused numerous emotions to rise. The scenarios,
which were really serious at the time, became stories once they were over.
We were left with the stories.

"Still, I am grateful for the revolutionary game. I lived at that time because
of you. Still, it is weird. Why did you sell my name when hitting the wrong
industrial complex? Well… maybe you were trying to fuck with me."

I poured out the things I was thinking about and gradually became sleepy. I
hadn't slept properly…

The complaints continued even as my consciousness dimmed. The times I
fought with him passed like I was reading Ways of Survival.

The Disaster of Questions. The strongest sacrifice. Peace Land. The tomb
of the scenario. The Demon King Selection and Gigantomachia. It was hard
to find a battlefield where I didn't fight with him. I thought back on those
times.
'Perhaps it will be okay'.

I could convince him somehow if it was the Yoo Joonghyuk I knew. We
had never talked about it properly. What if I took the time to explain it step
by step? It was Yoo Joonghyuk, not someone else…

I could see Yoo Joonghyuk's back in the distance. I forgot it was a dream
and approached him.

'Yoo Joonghyuk'.

At this moment, there was a stinging pain from my head and words
appeared. It was a scene from Ways of Survival. The scene where Yoo
Joonghyuk was betrayed by Anna Croft and lived miserably.

They were the last words Yoo Joonghyuk left.

「 "I will absolutely never forgive you." 」

Yoo Joonghyuk turned around and spoke to me. Killing energy was emitted
from the Black Heavenly Demon Sword.

「 "Kim Dokja." 」

I felt a coolness from my neck and woke up. I gasped while sweating before
realizing it was a dream. The dim moonlight was coming in through the
window. It was a bare hospital room.

I slowly rubbed my eyes. Then I realized something was wrong.

"…Yoo Joonghyuk?"

The bed was empty. Yoo Joonghyuk couldn't be seen anywhere in the
room. The selected Ringer's solution was floating in the air. I hurriedly got
up but I couldn't feel Yoo Joonghyuk anywhere.
On the bed, the pocket watch with the familiar design remained. The
remaining time until the Great War of Saints and Demons was 26 days.

On this day, Yoo Joonghyuk left Kim Dokja's Company.
    Chapter 356: Ep. 67 - Forgotten People of the Scenario, I


It had been a week since Yoo Joonghyuk disappeared. In the meantime, the
atmosphere of Kim Dokja's Company changed a bit.

The people were visible reticent. Rather than express it or talk about it, they
silently trained. Jung Heewon was one of them. They trained their skills
and their bodies… they pretended to do this while watching a certain
person. "Ah, I can't stand it anymore! How long will this atmosphere last?"

Lee Hyunsung, who was using Great Mountain Push against the ground,
was shocked by Jung Heewon's exclamation while Shin Yoosung's
shoulders shook as she used Advanced Diverse Communication. The most
surprised one was Lee Jihye who was training in Kendo.

Jung Heewon pressed her. "Jihye, you! Are you not going to talk to
Dokjassi anymore?"

"…I don't know."
"Are you still angry? No matter what, you should have a conversation."

Lee Jihye shouted, "I'm not angry! If I think about it, it isn't a big deal… it
is similar to the prophets. I know ahjussi is a good person. I just don't like
the word 'character'!"

It had been a week since Kim Dokja dropped the bomb. The party members
thought about Kim Dokja's words in their own way.

In summary, this was the feeling.

On the first day, all party members felt shock.

On the second day, they thought it was similar to what already happened
(Jung Heewon said, "Thinking about it, this is the same thing as the
constellations.")

On the third day, some people were amazed by the novel (Lee Seolhwa
said, "How much importance did I have?").

On the fourth day, they thought Kim Dokja was like a god of this world if
he read the novel (Lee Gilyoung said, "I knew that hyung was a god.")

On the fifth day, there were people claiming that Kim Dokja should be the
one comforted, not the party members (Shin Yoosung said, "Perhaps he is
the one having the hardest time right now.")

Lee Hyunsung heard the story and said, "Certainly, we don't know how
Dokja-ssi is feeling now. A few days ago, Joonghyuk-ssi disappeared…"

The party members nodded in agreement with Lee Hyunsung. Eventually,
their gazes once again concentrated on Lee Jihye.

"Jihye."

Lee Jihye was red-faced as she yelled. "Ah, I mean! How can I say
anything when ahjussi is walking around like a dead man?"
"Still…"

"Then why didn't Dokja ahjussi say anything? He just deceived us the
whole time…"

"Jihye." Jung Heewon called out and Lee Jihye bowed her head. Jung
Heewon kept speaking. "We can't ignore Dokja-ssi's choice just because we
don't understand it. I don't know the reason but it must've been necessary
for Dokja-ssi. Dokja-ssi would've thought about it in his own way."

"Unni, do you think we are just characters?"

"I also don't know. However, so what if we are characters living in a
scenario? It isn't Dokja-ssi's fault that such a novel exists."

It made sense. Kim Dokja didn't create this world. He was just a reader who
accidentally read the novel. Characters in a novel… that's how it was. From
the moment this damn scenario started, they were puppets of the
constellations. It didn't feel very real to hear such a story now.

Lee Jihye bit her lips for a long time before opening her mouth. "I
understand. I'll go and speak to him. Instead, Yoosung and Hyunsung
ahjussi should go with me."

Shin Yoosung and Lee Hyunsung glanced at each other after hearing Lee
Jihye's words.

"Uh, um. I visited him after dinner yesterday…"

"I talked to him three days ago."

Lee Jihye's face was pale as she looked around the party members. "What?
I am the only one who hasn't gone?"
I had mixed feelings about the party members who came to me one by one.

Lee Seolhwa appeared in the middle of the night and inserted a story pack
into my perfectly fine arm. Then when I opened my eyes in the morning,
there was a huge monster and insect king in front of me.

I was the one who did something wrong so I couldn't figure out how to
react when the party took care of me this way.

–If we are characters, Dokja-ssi threw yourself several times in front of
these characters. I remember it and I'm sure the others do as well.

Those were Jung Heewon's words.

–Ahjussi, I'm young and I'm not sure why you said that. Still, I know it is
very hard for you right now.

Shin Yoosung and Lee Gilyoung had told me.

–Dokja-ssi, my manual doesn't tell me how to deal with this situation.
So don't be too troubled and come back as usual.

Lee Hyunsung was Lee Hyunsung as always.

–I'm not good at comforting people. If I'm really in that novel, shouldn't
you already know?

In addition, Lee Jihye…

The comfort accumulated like spring raindrops. It was quiet enough not to
notice it was comforting.

Snow was piling up underneath the walls. It marked the winter season. I
looked down at the citizens who were in the process of removing the
snow. In a world turned upside down and where monsters were rampant,
we still had to clear the snow. The snow that wasn't cleared in time would
become solid ice and would be a nuisance. "Are the preparations good?"

I turned around and saw Kyrgios floating in the air. Kyrgios had regained
his momentum and had been in charge of training the group's martial arts.

"I'm working hard."

The 80th scenario 'Great War of Saints and Demons' would soon begin.
Currently, the maximum scenario we could advance to through the Context
of the Constellations was the 65th scenario.

In order words, we had to build enough stories to break through the 65th
scenario and reached the second Context of the Constellations. After that,
Kim Dokja's Company would also qualify for the 80th scenario.

"The stories are steadily accumulated and we are smoothly clearing the
scenario. In any case, the scenarios in the 60s have a similar difficulty apart
from Gigantomachia."

From Demon Realm's Spring to Torch That Swallowed the Myth. We
secured a different probability than before and cleared the scenarios
vertically. In the scenarios in the 60s, there was no nebula that could deal
with us.

In addition, the promised advertisement with the Mass Production Maker
began and the share prices of Kim Dokja's Company soared. At the same
time, the advertisement of the Mass Production Maker appeared on the
panel in mid-air.

–The scenario, it has numerous paths.

Along with my voice that was speaking, several cars on the screen were
racing towards the portal.
There was only one car that didn't choose the portal. It was the X-grade
Ferrarigini that Han Sooyoung was driving.

–Everyone has their own way.

The X-grade Ferrarigini passed the scattered cars and ran through the
darkness. The screen zoomed in on Han Sooyoung's face as she lip-synched
to my words.

–However, the real power is to run on a road without a road.

The logo of the Mass Production Maker appeared on the black screen.

I felt a bitter taste in my mouth. This old man's inspiration wasn't normal.
He used the words he told me in the advertisement. I couldn't believe this
advertisement would work on the constellations…

[The constellation 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' likes this advertisement.]

[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' wants the X-grade
Ferrarigini.]

[Your ad has stimulated the desire to to buy in some constellations.]

…There it was.

Kyrgios clicked his tongue while watching the advertisement with me. The
transcendent from Murim seemed unable to accept modern civilization.

"I can't understand. Why ride that machine? I can run a lot faster than it
with my martial arts."

"That's true."

"The disciple of Breaking the Sky hasn't returned yet?"
I shut up at the sudden question. He could only be talking about one
disciple of the Breaking the Sky Sword Saint.

"I'm not worried because he is someone who will find his own way."

I was worried. I didn't know what that sunfish was doing again. My
depression returned as I thought about the regressor. I couldn't completely
cover my anxiety despite reminding myself that not many things could
touch the present Yoo Joonghyuk.

However, I was forced to believe in him right now. It was like the days
when I only knew him in print.

"He will appear somewhere in the next scenario area. He is such a person."

"Reincarnation Island won't be easy."

"I know."

I nodded. Kyrgios was a transcendent and had already visited the
Reincarnation Island. Kyrgios' gaze turned to below the walls. I was able to
see Jang Hayoung, standing alone a bit further away from the party
members.

"Take Hayoung with you on this journey. This guy has made progress in
Breaking the Sky. He won't be a burden."

"I was going to take him anyway."

Jang Hayoung was an indispensable figure for this scenario. The place
where he got the name 'King of Transcendents' was the Reincarnation
Island. I waved lightly and Jang Hayoung, who was looking over here,
quickly turned his head away.
I gazed at the distant sky again. I could feel the vibrations of the watch
needle ticking around my wrist. There were 21 days until the Great War of
Saints and Demons.

I quietly turned on the smartphone and opened the file of Ways of Survival.
It was because of this novel that I hurt the group members but it was also
because of the novel that I could see them.

In the midst of these contradictory feelings, I opened the section on the
Constellation and Demon Way.

The first sentence of the Great War of Saints and Demons began as
followed:

「 Finally, the season of destruction was slowly coming to this world. 」




The nebula Eden.

At the entrance of the martial arts hall, which normally wouldn't be popular,
crowds of angels were gathered together.

[Ah, that incarnation is…]

[…That is a human body?]

The angels were peeping at a man with a bare upper body swinging a sword
through the air. At first glance, he seemed to just be holding the sword but
he was actually cutting the air with the sword. Any angel with good eyes
could tell that the blade was pointing down at a very fine speed.

It was Yoo Joonghyuk's repeated training when he wanted to forget time. It
was to lengthen the time of the moment and to feel the eternity that was
coming at that time.
The surrounding air was roughly shaken by his movements. It was
restrained like a crouching dragon. The fact that it was understated meant
that there was something that hadn't erupted.

[It's great. Even narrative-grade constellations can't easily rush at you now.]

Yoo Joonghyuk turned his head and saw a pale-faced archangel. The person
who recorded everything in Eden. Metatron laughed as Yoo Joonghyuk's
eyes asked why he came.

[

I came to give a bit of advice. If you are going to remove your top every
time you train, you should move to another place.]

"The probability density of Eden in this place is the most appropriate for
training."

[It is thanks to you that the little angels' morals are…]

"Metatron, why did you show me that revelation?"

Metatron knew the other person wasn't listening at all and changed his
words.

[I told you it was a bargain. You will side with 'good' at the Duet Between
Good and Evil. It was nothing more than that.]

"Are you trying to split apart Kim Dokja's Company?"

[Why would Eden do such a thing?]

"I know that you are paying special attention to Kim Dokja. I guess that you
are trying to keep his power in check."

[Is that why you're holding a protest here, to the point of taking off your
top?]
"Your words don't make sense."

Metatron shook his head as if he couldn't tell which side made sense. Yoo
Joonghyuk kept swinging his sword through the air. It was like he was
slowly cutting a virtual adversary.

[If you are going to continue with the illegal demonstration, please leave
Kim Dokja's Company officially and join Eden. Then you will be allowed
to take off your top―]

"Give me the next chapter of the revelation. Is that all the information you
had?"

[Haven't you thought that I might be giving you false information?]

"It is better than the demon kings who lie."

[Is that why you came to us instead of Asmodeus?]

"If the demon kings know the information then you will definitely know it
as well."

[Hah…]

Metatron still hadn't forgotten the day Yoo Joonghyuk invaded Eden alone.
He broke through the entrance guarded by the Powers Angels and Virtues
Angels. Even the demon kings didn't dare do such a thing. In fact, if
Metatron hadn't stopped it then Yoo Joonghyuk would've died in Michael's
hands on that day.

Yoo Joonghyuk said, "Give me the revelation. Isn't it enough that I've
played your game until now?"

Metatron's mouth twisted unpleasantly. A cold light flashed in Metatron's
eyes as he gazed at Yoo Joonghyuk.
[Incarnation Yoo Joonghyuk. The information I gave you isn't technically a
revelation. It was information received from a special existence.]

"Special existence?"

[Do you really want to know?]

Metatron stared at Yoo Joonghyuk for a moment before slowly looking up.
Yoo Joonghyuk also raised his head.

For a moment, the sky of Eden distorted. Some of the angels around the
training hall sat down with a small scream. Yoo Joonghyuk instinctively
grabbed the Black Heavenly Demon Sword.

…A demon king? No.

It was more chaos than demonic.

[Your sponsor feels uncomfortable with this heterogeneous being.]

Yoo Joonghyuk blinked and his surroundings changed. It was the center of
the Star Stream. An intangible darkness filled this space.

There was a big existence that was too much even for the transcendent Yoo
Joonghyuk.

Yoo Joonghyuk asked, "Who are you?"

[The constellation 'Secretive Plotter' is looking at the incarnation 'Yoo
Joonghyuk'.]

The darkness spoke.

[ It has been a long time, puppet of the Oldest Dream. ]
    Chapter 357: Ep. 67 - Forgotten People of the Scenario, II


The winter time flowed quickly.

Kim Dokja's Company rapidly cleared up to the 65th scenario and reached
the second Context of the Constellations a week ago. We finally succeeded
in meeting the minimum challenge condition for the 80th scenario.

[The advertisement payment has arrived from the Mass Production Maker.]

[You have received 2,500,000 coins.]

The nebula's funds accumulated quickly. 2.5 million coins. It seemed that
sales of the X-grade Ferrarigini were booming. Now we had been paid a
portion of the sales revenue and we would continue to receive more income
in the future.

"It's time."
Finally, the day of the scenario arrived. I looked around at the prepared
party members. Lee Hyunsung, Jung Heewon, Lee Jihye, Shin Yoosung
and Lee
Gilyoung. In addition, there was Jang Hayoung…

"Dokja-ssi, is it really okay to leave this way?"

Lee Hyunsung spoke in a somewhat uneasy manner. It was understandable.
A week ago, my order was to rest and do nothing until the 80th scenario
opened.

"This relaxed discipline doesn't make sense…"

Discipline. It was the words of a true soldier who lost his cartridge and
safety pin.

"No matter what we do, it is impossible to catch up with the top ranking
constellations. The important thing isn't what we do here but what we do in
that place… by the way, I feel like a person is missing."

"Sooyoung-ssi went first. She doesn't listen to orders."

The company didn't have any employees who were good at listening. Well,
Han Sooyoung would surely survive.

I turned my head and saw my mother and the other wanderers watching us
from the front door of the industrial complex.

"Then, we will be going."

"Take care."

I entrusted the security of Seoul to my mother and the wanderer forces.
They were people who didn't feel greedy for the latter scenarios. Rather
than clearing the scenario, they were determined to live in their own way.
Lee Seolhwa and Gong Pildu decided to stay in Seoul to supervise and
manage the incarnations.

"I will leave Seoul to you."

Lee Seolhwa nodded. On the other side of the square, Gong Pildu was
surrounded by incarnations targeting the early stage scenarios and was
explaining something in a brusque manner.

"The important thing is to seize the best position. You have to occupy
the good land before anyone else! Understood?" …It should be okay.

–I will join later with the Breaking the Sky Sword Saint. Go ahead.

I nodded to Kyrgios in the distance and sent a signal into the air. Soon,
there was a low-grade dokkaebi responsible for the scenario transfer.

[Kim Dokja's Company. Are the preparations finished?]

"Start transferring us."

The low-grade dokkaebis recited something and we were sucked into the
portal that appeared at our feet. It was a pretty advanced portal which meant
I didn't feel dizzy when the space changed. How much time passed?

[You have entered the waiting room for the 80th scenario.]

Rather than the peaceful scenery of Gwanghwamun, a pale marble waiting
room appeared. The waiting room was seething with constellations and
incarnations who had arrived in advance.

[When will the scenario start?]

[Open it quickly! There is no time!]
There were familiar faces among the constellations. One of them was the
Brash Swamp Predator. I thought he was dead because he hadn't been seen
since the start of the Demon King Selection but he was still alive.

Jung Heewon muttered from behind me. "There seem to be many great
constellations."

"Ahjussi, there is Ranveer Khan and Feihu over there!"

"I can see Papyrus and Tamna."

The members of Kim Dokja's Company stuck to my back like penguins
enduring the cold. They seemed like rural people who just came to Seoul.

Lee Jihye licked his lips and asked, "Ahjussi, what should we do?"

"Smile while you can smile."

In the distance, a few constellations from Olympus waved to this side.
Dionysus and Aphrodite. They probably didn't come to perform again this
time. After that, several constellations from Vedas were soon, including the
Supreme God of Light Surya. Maybe Anna Croft and Yoo Joonghyuk
would also be mixed in among them.

[The demon king 'Duke of Everywhere' is staring at you.] [The

demon king 'Eyes that See the Forbidden' is checking you.] As

expected, these guys were here as well.

[The constellation 'Guardian of Youths and Travel' yawns as if bored.]

[The constellation 'Saviour of Corruption' is revealing a ferocious spirit
towards you.]
The archangels of Eden as well. The scale of the 80th scenario was truly
different. We had to now compete with these terrible narrative-grade
constellations.

In the center of the square, a dokkaebi emerged. It was Bihyung.

[Everyone is gathered. I am Dokkaebi Bihyung and I'm in charge of this
scenario.]

Generall, this scenario was hosted by a great dokkaebi. It seemed that
Bihyung's status in the bureau had increased considerably.

[Originally, the stage of the Great War of Saints and Demons was
scheduled for another place. Then Reincarnation Island was selected as a
scenario area for special reasons. Well, don't we all have to do what our
bosses want?] Several of the constellations burst out laughing. This was the
humour of the Star Stream or the bureau. That Bihyung jerk, he was in a
form that wasn't scary.

[Some constellations might be unfamiliar with this stage. It is a very old
place and it is rarely used anymore. It has been lost in the flow of the
time…]

Along with Bihyung's words, images started to flow on the screens in the
sky. The stage of the upcoming scenario was Reincarnation Island.

[We came here to participate in the Great War of Saints and Demons. I
don't care about the stage!]

[Don't expect much. This is a world with a bunch of sword masters and 9th
circle magicians.]

The constellations spoke sarcastically like they had already experienced the
scenario.
Then Bihyung said, [Sword master… this time, you can leave those worries
behind. It is because this world view is special.]

Bihyung's words caused a fuss among the constellations but he continued
speaking.

[In the days when the island opened, there were no concepts like sword
master, 9th circle magician or even magic circles. This is an old island.]

Many constellations listened to Bihyung's words. Those paying special
attention were members of the Gourmet Association. Perhaps they knew
some information about this island.

[Well, you'll know once you personally experience it. I'll start with the
explanation necessary for the scenario. Before entering the main island that
is the stage for the Great War of Saints and Demons, you will experience
the tutorial area first.]

Soon a map of the island appeared. There was a large island floating in the
middle of the universe, with numerous small islands surrounding it.

Bihyung pointed to the outermost islands. [You will start at the island's
edge, the small islands. Through this tutorial, you will learn how to adapt to
the island. Then you will be given a scenario where you will advance to the
main island, the main stage of the Great War of Saints and Demons.]

Based on the explanation, it was an existing rule of Reincarnation Island. It
was a welcome thing for me. Of course, it wasn't the same for other
constellations.

[Tutorial? We are constellations. Are you joking right now?]

[No, of course, you don't necessarily have to perform the tutorial. There are
many ways to go straight to the main island. Therefore, don't be too angry.]
Dokkaebis usually speaking like this meant that if they didn't proceed with
the tutorial, the scenario would be like hell. In fact, if they knew what
would happen on these islands, perhaps half the constellations here would
withdraw their application.

Bihyung noticed my gaze and winked at me. [Originally, scenarios should
start without any explanation and mine has been going on for too long.
Please pick a small island to start at. If you want to start on the same island,
you can choose the same island.]

Bihyung concluded his explanation and the constellations started to pick
their place of departure.

My party members picked the same island. There was no need to split apart
when we could go together.

Some constellations noticed and choose the island that I chose. They were
going to come out like this from the beginning.

I looked around at the party members. "Do you remember what I said
yesterday?"

Jung Heewon replied. "Once the scenario starts, we have to run to the
middle of the island."

"Yes. Don't think about fighting with other people and run straight to the
middle of the island."

This scenario was completely different from all the other scenarios we
experienced. It might be the tutorial but there was a chance the party
members might not survive. I knew from reading Ways of Survival so none
of the party members questioned my suggestion. I somehow felt bitter.

The constellations were ready and Bihyung's words were heard. [Let's start
the scenario transfer!]
I held Unbroken Faith in my hands. Every minute in this scenario was
important, including the time it took to draw the sword.

"Everyone, let's meet in the village."

At the same time, my party members and I turned into a group of lights.

[A new main scenario has arrived!]

[Main Scenario #80 - Reincarnation Island has begun.]

The message was heard and the darkness became brightly lit. The smell of
grass entered my nose. I was thrown into the forest area of the island. I
didn't see any of the party members around. They had probably been
transferred to other places on the island.

[You are currently in the expedition area of Island 531. Find a village with
guides.]

[Hidden scenario - Survival Game has begun!]

At almost the same time, the messages of the dokkaebis poured from the
sky.

[It won't be fun like this, right? The taste of survival is a good start.
Constellations, please feel like you have returned to the past through a
fierce
competition for survival!]


  [Hidden Scenario - Survival Game]

  Category: Hidden

  Difficulty level: SSS

  Clear Conditions: Enter the island's village or kill your competitors who
  entered together with you.

  Time Limit: 24 hours.

  Compensation: 50,000 coins, clear the tutorial area.

  Failure: Death


I thought it would be like this. The dokkaebis who chose this island as the
stage couldn't afford to let go.

At almost the same time, I felt an ominous presence around me. It was to
late to hide my figure.

[The demon king 'Magic Peacock of Geometry' is showing hostility towards
you.]

There was a presence in the bushes. It was one of the demon kings who
followed me. The demon king of the 65th Demon Realm, Andrealphus.
[Demon King of Salvation. You defeated Demon King Amdusias?]

Dark blue demonic energy was burning from the hands of the colourful
feathered person. Andrealphus was a demon king known for having learnt
all types of magic.
[Don't be arrogant like a stud horse.]

The peacock-like person spat words out of his beak and ran towards me
while chanting a spell. Perhaps he set me as the first hunting game.

I also ran towards him.

Andrealphus muttered, [Your footwork is terrible and your skills are
absurd. It is the level of a normal human. You managed to beat Amdusias
with only this?]

I ignored him and ran hard. It was much slower than usual because I wasn't
using Way of the Wind.

Andrealphus mockingly declared,

[Die.]

The magic he cast was the 9th circle Hellfire. It was literally borrowing the
flames of hell and I wouldn't be able to endure a direct hit.

However, something strange happened the moment he cast a spell. The
hellfire, which should've burnt the whole forest, only made small sparks
before turning off.

[This island's probability doesn't allow the spell 'Hellfire'.]

The confused Andrealphus stared at me. I was now right before his nose.

"This island has no sword masters or 9th circle magicians."

The astonished eyes of Andrealphus grew bigger.

"Then is Hellfire possible?"
It was unbelievable but this was the law of the island. It was the place
where the most powerful probability of the Star Stream dominated. [There
is the powerful effect of probability on this island!]

[The Attributes Window isn't available on this island and the overall stats
will be reset.]

The system wasn't available on this island.

[The usage of most 'skills' created after the first generation is limited on this
island.]

[On this island, the proficiency of stigmas and stories are reset.]

All the fighting skills obtained were useless. Andrealphus, who was
belatedly trying to cast a defense skill, got a stiff face.

I ignorantly swung my sword without any skills. The blow, which
contained no skill, pieced the heart of demon king Andrealphus.

Unbroken Faith was a few times heavier than normal. My hand holding the
sword trembled. The benefits of my overall stats had disappeared.

In the forest, the hot sun was burning my skin. I pulled my sword out of the
demon king's dead incarnation body while sweating. It was hard to even
hold the sword thanks to my poor muscles.

"This is why I don't like the old stories."

This world had no sword masters, no SSS-grade hunters, no systems and no
Attributes Window.

[The old stories are responding to your gaze.]
Reincarnation Island. This was the tomb of the 'first generation stories' that
died out in the Star Stream.
   Chapter 358: Ep. 67 - Forgotten People of the Scenario, III


Lee Hyunsung had a thought. This must be how his grandfather who fought
in the Vietnam War felt.

It was a lush, leafy forest. Lee Hyunsung hid between trees that boasted an
unusual size and remembered his survival training.

'Go to the nearby reed forest while crawling low'.

Lee Hyunsung moved through the forest by alternating between low crawls
and high crawls. He wanted to run to the fields straight away but there were
a few groups of constellations moving.

Lee Hyunsung saw someone moving and quickly hid himself at the base of
a tree, holding his breath.

[The Demon King of Salvation definitely chose this island.]

[How are we going to distribute it if we hunt him?]
[The one who cuts off his head will get half.]

There were the murmurs of the constellations. They were all targeting Kim
Dokja. He wanted to run out and get their heads straight away.

–Unconditionally run towards the center of the island.

Kim Dokja had told them. Only then could they survive this bloody
survival game. This was the message of a man who knew the future of this
world.

He felt he should've asked Kim Dokja more details about Ways of Survival.
The more information in the manual, the better. What would happen to his
future self and the life he was living…

'It isn't the time to think useless things'.

Lee Hyunsung slapped both of his cheeks. There must've been a reason
Kim Dokja didn't tell him those things. Now was the time to focus on the
situation.

Rustle. There was another noise from nearby. No voices could be heard.
Someone was coming this way. There were cautious movements. It was a
person who had the basics of using cover. The sound was getting closer.

Rustle. If they kept coming in this direction, they would encounter Lee
Hyunsung sooner or later.

Lee Hyunsung nervously pulled out a dagger. Kim Dokja told them to
avoid combat as much as possible but that couldn't always happen.

'I should do it well if I can't avoid it'.

In the past few years, Lee Hyunsung became much stronger than before
through training. Now he wasn't the 'soldier who turned away from
injustice' in the first scenario.
Finally, the other person was right in front of him. Yet something felt
strange. The pattern of a special uniform could be seen through the long
reeds.

Lee Hyunsung muttered reflexively, "Heewon-ssi?"

"Uwah!"

The Sword of Judgment popped through the bushes. Lee Hyunsung
reflexively bent his waist and avoided the sword. After a while, Jung
Heewon's head protruded from the bush. "Hyunsung-ssi? I'm sorry."

"It's fine. Are you okay?"

However, he wasn't able to be glad about meeting his colleague due to the
desperate situation. He sighed and saw the two children glued firmly to
Jung Heewon's waist.

They were Shin Yoosung and Lee Gilyoung. Lee Hyunsung watched the
sickly pale faces of the two children and asked, "What is the status of the
children?"

"I don't know exactly. I just met them. They must've seen something
shocking."

A shocking sight. Certainly, this island was a strange place. The Heracles
Shield on Lee Hyunsung's back was very heavy. It was an item that he
normally would've have felt the weight…

Lee Hyunsung carried Shin Yoosung and said, "I think we should go to the
center of the island and meet Dokja-ssi."

"Where is the center of the island?"

"The direction of the smoke…"
He looked up and saw smoke rising through the big trees. It wasn't too far
away. Lee Hyunsung started to move with Jung Heewon. Maybe it was due
to the presence of a strong colleague but the heartbeat seemed to be moving
at a different tempo.

How long had it been? They soon arrived at the edge of the forest. A large
field unfolded in front of their eyes. It wasn't far away from the location
where the smoke was ignited. The problem was that there were a bunch of
people blocking the field.

Jung Heewon frowned and opened her mouth. "Do you think they are
chasing us?"

The constellations armed with weapons and star relics were searching
around the field. Among them were people Lee Hyunsung had seen earlier.

"Don't fight and run. It is better to avoid them but…"

Once they entered the field, they would surely become visible. There was a
way around the forest but they couldn't guarantee how long it would take.

Then Shin Yoosung opened her mouth from Lee Hyunsung's back.
"Ahjussi. Excuse me…"

Shin Yoosung's finger pointed to the forest on the opposite side of the field.
Something was running.

There were rough and wild cries. Lee Hyunsung was familiar with the
monster species that emerged from the forest. They were monsters that
regularly appeared in fantasy manhwa and novels.

Jung Heewon asked, "Aren't they orcs? They are too weak to appear in the
80th scenario…"

Orcs. They were representative monsters that emerged in numerous fantasy
genres.
"I've never fought an orc up to now."

It was strange when thinking about it. Orcs were famous monsters that
everyone knew about. Yet they made it to the 80th scenario without
meeting any orcs.

In the field, the constellations exclaimed,

[Ignoring us to this degree!]

[Releasing this crap?]

They also thought it was absurd. As if there was no need to use a weapon, a
single constellation stretched out his fist towards the rushing orcs with an
annoyed expression.

They were usually monsters that would be killed in one blow. Yet at this
moment, something strange happened. An orc swung its axe and the fist of
the constellation was broken.

The moment the bewildered constellation was about to shout something,
another stone axe came flying from somewhere. The head of the
constellation literally burst apart. The incarnation body of the constellation
fell down stupidly. The orcs roared and laughed, turning the field into a
terrible place of slaughter.

[Kuaaack!]

The fearsome constellations who could break mountains and split apart the
sea. These constellations were dying, their bodies torn apart by only two
orcs.

Jung Heewon and Lee Hyunsung fell down as well. It was reality without a
sense of realism. It was that easy to die? A constellation? To an orc?

"Run away!"
The orcs tore apart 10 constellations in an instant and were approached this
forest area.




Please don't let me meet orcs. I repeated this prayer in my head as I moved
through the lush forest.

My breathing was intermittent in this heat and my steps were heavy. I
hadn't walked for very long but I was feeling exhausted as sweat flowed all
over my body.

I didn't know the absence of my stats would be this great. It was
unavoidable with only one point in physique. To make matters worse, it felt
like my shoulders were being forced closer together. This was the reality of
the island.

Reincarnation Island. It was the place where the oldest stories of the Star
Stream were gathered. Here, all the buffs accumulated from outside data
were released.

In other words, it was a place where only the innate abilities of the body
were available. This was why I could easily defeat the 65th ranked demon
king. Many constellations neglected physical training. Then once they
entered this island, they made a mistake of misinterpreting their combat
power. It was the same for Andrealphus…

[You have killed one competitor to date.]

[You will receive additional rewards when entering the safe zone.]

I tried not to miss the occasional message as I moved through the shade
created by the lush trees.
In order to prevent dehydration, I plunged my face into a rare stream and
drank the water. It was clear and cold enough that my soul felt purified.

"The first generation water is so clean."

In fact, I wasn't adverse to the old stories.

As a reader, I liked the old stories. A story of heroes filled with dreams and
adventures. Fighting dragons in forgotten mountain ranges or looking for a
legendary sword with beautiful elves and brave dwarves.

The problem was that I now entered the 'old story'. A world without the
power of the Attributes Window and no convenient functions.

The danger here wasn't only the monsters. Since I couldn't receive the
effects of the skills, my immune system would decrease and I had to be
wary of the cold and diseases. In the original novel, some constellations
died after being affected by infectious diseases.

In fact, the following sentence had appeared in Ways of Survival:

「 The constellations, who were accustomed to the Attributes Window and
the convenience of the system, died powerlessly. They were able to raise a
proper resistance to the world that couldn't be read with their sensibilities.
」

The constellations, who reigned in the Star Stream, died because they
couldn't overcome diseases or orcs. Some constellations couldn't endure the
disgrace and took their own lives.

It was funny.

[The participants of Island 861 are wiped out.]

[The participants of Island 1896 are wiped out.]
…It had started. By now, the entire island would be engulfed in a terrible
tragedy. The constellations died to lesser monsters that they had been
ignoring in the meantime…

[Many constellations are greatly shocked by the difficulty of Reincarnation
Island.]

[Many constellations are sending a protest message to the bureau!]

It was useless to protest. The island was originally like this. Demon kings
or archangels… anyone could die in this place if they were a bit careless.

I reflexively held my breath as I heard a sound coming from a nearby bush.
I only knew one monster on the island that made a cry like this. It was a
small monster half my height with green skin.

A goblin. I sighed with relief. It was worth an attempt if it was a goblin, not
an orc.

There was a deafening roar. I reflexively swung my sword in the direction
of the cry. My body was dragged in the direction of the swing due to my
poor strength. Fortunately, the first one who jumped out was hit by the
blindly swung sword and rolled on the ground.

The problem was after this.

「 One law of the first generation. Goblins will never move alone. 」

Two goblins jumped out after the injured goblin and rapidly narrowed the
distance, swinging their clubs. The club swung by one of them caused a
long scratch on the outside of my left thigh. Damn… in this place, the
goblins were scarier than the demon kings.

[The exclusive skill 'Fourth Wall' is activated!]
If it hadn't been for the Fourth Wall, I might've died to the goblins like
other constellations. Then an ominous voice was heard.

[The administrator of the island is concerned about the fairness of the skill
you are using.]

[The administrator of the island declares this skill isn't available here.]

[The probability of the Star Stream agrees with the administrator's
complaint.]

[The Fourth Wall is revealing discomfort.]

「 Kim Dok ja, so rry. 」

'Huh?'

「 I ha ve no streng th on this is land. 」

I felt the barrier covering my spirit fading. It felt like a sensation sleeping
inside me was activated. At this moment, I realized what was happening.

[The thickness of the Fourth Wall has become thinner.]

[Your mental strength, reinforced by the Fourth Wall, has returned to its
original state.]

[The physical pain relieved by the Fourth Wall has returned to normal.

Dammit.
   Chapter 359: Ep. 67 – Forgotten People of the Scenario, IV


I swallowed my curses. If the Fourth Wall became thinner…

There was a strange pain during the battle that I had forgotten. The cuts on
my shin and arms were sore. My sweaty shirt was more uncomfortable and
the heat of the forest made me dizzy. I would've exercised more if I knew
this would happen.

A spiked club flew towards my head. I rolled my body and avoided a
goblin's attack. My joints creaked as I moved hastily. The goblin followed
my avoidance path with the club like they were catching a mole. The fuzz
on the back of my hand rose as blood stained the thorny club. It was
obviously a smell I've encountered many times but it was strange.

[The Fourth Wall has become very thin.]

[The 'Fourth Wall' is shaking dangerously.]
I jumped up from my position and corrected my sword posture. The two
goblins lost their companion and were surrounding me with red eyes. At
any time, they would rush forward and kill me. The moment I read this
desire, the fear of death came to me.

Beyond the thinning Fourth Wall, the emotions I had ignored were gushing
out. The story I looked at was actually something like this.

I controlled my trembling breaths. I had to fight. I could fight. All my
companions fought through this fear. I was the only one who cowardly
avoided the pain using the wall.

「 Kim Dokja held Unbroken Faith with trembling hands. 」

Let's think. How could I hurt the goblins with my current body? Skills
couldn't be used but stigmas were still available. The level was reset but it
was possible to use stigmas. The problem was how to apply the stigma. I
saw the approaching goblin and cast Song of the Sword.

[This isn't your stigma.]

[The effect of the stigma is fixed to the minimum.]

「 The second day. Sunny. I went out early and checked the weapons. 」

Unbroken Faith emitted a faint sheen and returned to its original state. It
would've been nice if a fire arrow emerged, shit. It was comforting to feel
that my sword was a bit lighter.

Kieeek?

The goblin laughed at my resistance and swung its thorny club. The club hit
the sword and my wrist seemed to break.

The goblins looked sloppy but they were more powerful than humans. They
were monsters optimized for survival on this island.
Then the second club flew towards my waist. It was too late to block it with
my sword. I swung my feet and kicked the club. There was the sensation of
thorns piercing the soles of my feet. I but my lips from the terrible pain.
The angry goblins cried out at the smell of blood. If the stigma couldn't be
used then I had to try the second method.

[Giant Story 'Demon Realm's Spring' is responding to your will.]

On this island, skills were sealed and the proficiency of the stigmas was
reset. This didn't mean there was no power available.

[Giant Story 'Torch That Swallowed the Myth' is responding to your will.]

Something existed even in the first generation without magic circles. It was
stories.

[Currently, you can't exercise control over these stories with your power.]

[Your stories are rejecting your domination.]

The problem was that my strength was drastically reduced and the stories
didn't listen to me.

[Giant Story 'Demon Realm's Spring' is looking at you with regret.]

[Giant Story 'Torch That Swallowed the Myth' covets your weakened
body.]

Blood rose inside me because of the heat. The goblins momentarily shrank
back from the power of the stories felt from me but they soon recovered
their momentum and rushed forward.

The stigma was blocked and the stories didn't listen to me. I gritted my
teeth as I watched the incoming goblins. In the end, there was only the last
method. I hadn't wanted to use this if possible.
It happened the moment I firmed up my heart and raised my magic power.
A dagger flew through the bush and pierced the goblin's head. The goblin
collapsed in front of me. The blade headed towards the other goblin's neck
with fantastic swordplay.

I watched the girl's ponytail flying and sighed with relief.

"Ahjussi, are you okay?"

The mud-covered Lee Jihye turned her head and stared at me.




In fact, the use of Song of the Sword wasn't just to confront the goblins.
Like the system message stated, Song of the Sword wasn't my stigma. If I
used this stigma, the master of it would surely become aware of my
existence.

"…Phew, I'm glad it is ahjussi."

Lee Jihye washed her face in the stream. Lee Jihye had also experienced a
considerable degree of hardship.

"What the hell is this place? Skills and stigmas are all useless. I would've
died if I hadn't received training from Grandfather Kyrgios.

"Are you injured?"

"No. I hid well. By the way, what's wrong with you?"

"It just happened."

I was placing the Cut Medicine received from Lee Seolhwa on my wounds.
I couldn't believe I was injured this much fighting the goblins. I couldn't
guess how hard it would be in the future.
Lee Jihye watched me and grabbed the Cut Medicine like she was
frustrated. "Give it to me. You can't apply it to your back."

Lee Jihye placed the Cut Medicine on my wounds.

"Be gentle. I might die if you press hard against it."

"Don't be a crybaby. By the way, were you this small?"

"My muscle mass was just reduced a bit."

"Your shoulders look similar to mine?"

My pride was hurt so I took back the Cut Medicine. No, I tried to take it
back but failed. It was because Lee Jihye was more powerful than me.

Lee Jihye spoke in warning, "If you move, your shoulder will break."

It had been a long time since I felt so helpless.

"Now, it's all done."

The effect of Lee Seolhwa's Cut Medicine was quite good despite the
probability of the first generation. It wasn't dramatic but the wounds
covered by the Cut Medicine were healing quickly. There were magic and
martial arts even in the first generation.

Lee Jihye and I continued to walk through the forest after taking care of my
wounds. Fortunately, night was coming. Lee Jihye measured the smoke
rising from the center of the island.

"It seems we will have to camp here today?"

I nodded. We can move all night but night time skills weren't available and
we could meet enemies that were much worse than the goblins.

[The night of the island has come.]
[At night, some of the system's functions are restored.]

[The Dokkaebi Bag feature is now available.]

I immediately opened the Dokkaebi Bag and bought a few necessary items.
There was portable accommodation for two people and safety devices for
securing the perimeter. There ware also recovery items, just in case.

Lee Jihye received the items from me and blinked. "What? You could buy
something like this in the first generation?"

"In the end, the coin usage scenarios remain the same."

Whether it was the first generation, second generation or third generation,
the essence of the scenario was money. Thus, it was obvious that the use of
the Dokkaebi Bag would be granted.

Lee Jihye was setting up the tent and looked at me like I was pathetic.
"Ahjussi, I heard you've been to the army. Why don't you know how to set
up a tent?"

"It has been a long time since I was discharged. Why are you so good at it?"

"I was in the scouts when I was an elementary school student."

Come to think of it, there was that setting for Lee Jihye. Lee Jihye watched
me struggle from the strength reduction penalty and set up my tent for me.

Night in the forest was cold. We gathered the surrounding twigs and lit a
fire. In front of the blazing bonfire, Lee Jihye and I were immersed in our
own thoughts. I wasn't using Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint but I could
see that Lee Jihye wanted to say something. I patiently waited.

Lee Jihye threw a dried branch onto the burning flames and finally raised
her courage. "Ahjussi, can I ask you something?"

"Ask."
"When did that novel start?"

I thought this question would come out. I decided to answer honestly.
"More than 10 years ago."

My memories were a bit dim but I hadn't forgotten what happened in the
days when I first clicked on Ways of Survival.

"How do I appear in the novel?"

The question was normal. I would also be curious if I was in Lee Jihye's
shoes. I took my time to recall the description of Lee Jihye.

Admiral Lee Jihye. The girl who pulled out her sword to protect her
companions. Her pride was strong but she was more affectionate than
anyone else. Her heart was always revealed on her face.

I tried not to touch on Lee Jihye's wounds as much as possible as I carefully
chose the details to tell her. Lee Jihye had a suspicious look on her face as
she opened her mouth. "It's so good that I feel bad. There was that much
detail?"

"The novel is a bit long."

"Even so… Oh, how do you remember all the details?"

"I read it a lot."

"Still, to remember it so meticulously… I feel bad."

This was my only answer. "I was a middle school student at the time and
my only hobby was reading the novel."

"Ahjussi was a middle school student? Ahaha, then you were younger than
me when you first read it? That's ridiculous."

"Everyone was 15 years old once."
[The constellation 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' is raising his head.]

Lee Jihye laughed like she heard something interesting. "That's right. I was
also 15 once."

Lee Jihye looked down at her sheath with nostalgic eyes. A small keyring
was hanging from the sheath. I read Ways of Survival so I naturally knew
the identity of the keyring.

"Are you okay?"

"…Do you know about this keyring?"

"A little bit."

"There is nothing private."

The keyring Lee Jihye always carried with her was given by her friend who
died in the first scenario.

The sentences of Ways of Survival passed through my mind.

「 "Jihye. Kill me. It's okay." 」

Lee Jihye was the wounded Sword Demon. Even if her characterization
changed one day, this face wouldn't change. Lee Jihye was a person who
never forgot the sins she committed.

"Do you know what happens to me at the end of the novel?"

Lee Jihye's words caused a story I had long forgotten to appear in my mind.
I knew the ending of Ways of Survival.

Jingle.
Then a bill ringing entered my ears. It was a sound from the safety device I
placed beforehand. The sound of the bell soon continued in a horror-like
rhythm, as if to rip off my ears.

Jingle. Jingle. Jingle. Jingle.

Jingle. Jingle. Jingle. Jingle.

"Ahjussi."

Something was coming this way. It wasn't a goblin or orc based on the
interval of the ringing. It was a much stronger monster. I gauged the
direction of the rising smoke and said, "You will live to the end and be
happy. It was the same in the novel."

It was a lie. However, the novel was a lie in the first place. I lived so far to
make my lies a reality.

"Run towards the village. I will buy time."

"I don't want to! Ahjussi, you run away! Aren't you weaker than me?"

"You can't deal with this monster. It isn't possible even if we join forces."

Lee Jihye was only able to deal with goblins with her current abilities. I
spoke calmly, "Go to the village quickly and get help. That way, both you
and I can survive. You can move faster than me."

"But…"

"Hurry! I have some way to avoid it!"

"Really?"

"Of course. Don't you know who I am?"
Lee Jihye nodded as if relieved. "Hold on for a while! I will bring back
help!"

A few seconds after Lee Jihye disappeared, a giant green monster appeared
in the forest. It was a monster over three meters with a terrifying
atmosphere.

Damn, it was a troll, not an orc. I was lying when I said there was a way to
avoid it. The entire party couldn't cope with this troll. It would be good if
they weren't wiped out.

Grrr…

The troll found me and revealed horrible teeth as it laughed. The troll's iron
club was covered with fragments of the constellations, as if it had already
broken the heads of numerous constellations.

I smiled bitterly and gripped the sword. I would probably die from just one
hit of that club. At least, if there was no one to help me.

Grrrrrrr!

In the first place, this island was impossible to attack in a normal way. As
always, there were hidden pieces in impossible scenarios. It was time for
them to show up, according to the original novel.

The moment the troll's growl soared into the sound, a piercing sound was
heard. A familiar blade was piercing the belly of the troll. It was Lee Jihye.

"I knew this would happen. You are a liar."

「 The admiral doesn't abandon her colleagues, even if it means dying. 」

This operation was possible from the beginning because I believed in Lee
Jihye. The angry troll drew out the sword and made a strange noise. The
wound was restored in an instant. It threw the sword and Lee Jihye laughed
from beside me.

"Let's die together, ahjussi."

I saw the troll running towards us and laughed too. Lee Jihye wouldn't die.
The history of her life would eventually save her. The moment the troll's
club fell, a sound was heard from the forest.

…It came. A silver sword split apart the darkness. I watched carefully. The
pure sword that wasn't an ether blade cut the fearsome troll's neck like a
toy.

「 The favourite themes of the first generation forgotten people are love,
friendship and romance. 」

First generation. One of the oldest stories in the Star Stream. The master of
that story was talking. "Sacrificing your lives for your colleagues? This is
the first time in 381 years."

I looked closer and it wasn't only one person.

"There was no need to speak. They are such friends."

"Really, there are still good stories out there."

The laughing voices spread out. Something was strange. This wasn't in the
original novel. Then I saw the faces of those walking out of the darkness.
"It's been a long time. Has it only been three years in outside world time?"
Surprisingly, it was someone I already knew.
    Chapter 360: Ep. 67 - Forgotten People of the Scenario, V


A handsome beard and thick eyebrows. The thick lips that showed a
unique, upright personality. The man who appeared from the darkness was
exactly the same as when I met him three years ago.

"Goryeo's First Sword?"

"I didn't know we would meet in such a place, Kim Dokja."

A constellation of the Korean Peninsula, Cheok Jungyeong was on
Reincarnation Island.




I was indebted to Cheok Jungyeong from Dark Castle to the Demon King
Selection. I swallowed down my pleasure. Cheok Jungyeong was a good
constellation but his purpose here was unclear. It was time to look at the
other person's purpose. It would be difficult if his purpose conflicted with
me.

"I was worried because you haven't been sending any indirect messages."

"I have been refraining from broadcasting on the stream for a while."

On closer examination, Cheok Jungyeong's entire body seemed much more
refined than before. Something flashed in my mind. "Did you come to the
island before the start of the scenario?"

"It's been 15 years already."

15 years? At this moment, a sentence of Ways of Survival rose.

「 Reincarnation Island is located in the Dark Fault. 」

It might be three years in Earth hour but time within the Dark Fault was a
few times faster. In fact, Kyrgios and the Breaking the Sky Sword Saint had
also been here. At present, the time density of this island was around five
times that of Earth.

"The reason you are here…"

Cheok Jungyeong shook his head. "It might be an outer god but I still
wasn't able to withstand it."

There was a scene playing in my head. It was three years ago, the day when
the 73rd Demon Realm was destroyed. Cheok Jungyeong lost his
incarnation body while dealing with the disaster.

The prideful Cheok Jungyeong was greatly shocked that there was such an
existence in the world. Thus, it was even more amazing. The other
constellations had their egos crumble at the mere sight of the disaster while
Cheok Jungyeong was still trying to tear down the disaster.

Perhaps this was the theme of the constellation called Goryeo's First Sword.
"I felt that I had to train again from the very basics. This island is the
perfect place for such training."

Cheok Jungyeong spoke while looking at the people moving through the
bushes in front. They had good mobility even in this hot and sticky forest.
They were probably the forgotten people of this island.

One of them noticed my gaze and walked over. "You managed to survive.
Usually, the constellations from the outside die in less than an hour. Ah,
apart from that monster 'Cheok' over there."

"Thank you for your help. I am Kim Dokja."

I deliberately didn't say my modifier. Among the first generation forgotten
people, there were many people who considered the modifier to be
pretentious.

The man laughed as if he liked my answer. "I have long forgotten my name.
That is what everyone does when they're here."

The man spoke and moved ahead. The forgotten. They were those who
forgot their names after numerous reincarnations. However, they didn't
really forget their names. It was just that reminiscing on the past became
too painful.

An old scent was felt from the bodies of the forgotten who were opening
the path. A very strong, curved and hardened story.

Lee Jihye whispered, "How are they so strong?"

It was natural to be curious. The forgotten people themselves didn't feel
particularly great. Yet they used a single strike to kill the troll we struggled
with.

"The quantity and quality of their stories seem better than us…"
"No matter how good the stories, it is useless if they can't take advantage of
it properly."

Lee Jihye stared at me with questioning eyes. The moment I tried to speak,
I was interrupted by Cheok Jungyeong.

"He's right. Even if there are 10 swords, humans could only hold two
swords properly."

Goryeo's First Sword. His body was a sword, his heart was a sword, his
story was a sword.

Lee Jihye looked down at her hands like she gained profound
enlightenment. In the meantime,

Cheok Jungyeong stared at me with a deep gaze. "You have collected many
great stories. You won't fall behind the top rated constellations right now."

"You're overpraising me."

"By the way… you've accumulated too much in a short period of time. Do
you know what state you are in right now?"

I closed my mouth. In these eyes, I was currently in a very precarious state.

[Giant Story 'Torch That Swallowed the Myth' is aiming for your
incarnation body.]

[The story 'Person who Opposes the Miracle' is doubting your
qualifications!]

[The story 'One Who Killed an Outer God' is dissatisfied with you.]

It was the same in practice. I raised the giant stories wrong and almost had
my life snatched away by the stories. If that happened, I would become the
same as the constellations I met at the Duet Between Good and Evil.
"Don't forget. After an existence creates a story, the story creates an
existence."

I already knew. I came to this island knowing it.

"I will keep that in mind."

Not long afterwards, we arrived at the village.

[You have arrived in the first safe zone!]

[You have met the conditions to clear the main scenario of the 133rd Small
Island!]

[You have met the conditions to clear the hidden scenario!]

[You have received additional compensation for killing a competitor.]

[Additional compensation is being prepared.]

The village was peaceful. After passing through the main entrance, there
was a lifestyle that revolved around a huge hearth in the center. It was
different from city life.

A stay at home woman in scruffy clothes was feeing a cow while a bearded
man was doing laundry. There were also children who seemed younger
than Gilyoung and Yoosung. It was an incredibly rural village where the
first generation forgotten people lived.

「 (…It is really amazing here.) 」

'Yoo Sangah-ssi?'

「 (Ah, sorry. Did I surprise you?) 」

'It's fine. Is it okay to talk now?'
「 (Yes, it is break time. The wall is also busy.) 」

For some reason, Yoo Sangah's voice felt closer than usual. The Fourth
Wall had become thinner, making her activities more convenient.

「 (This village is like a mural that many artisans painted over the years…)
」

I was inwardly amazed as I heard Yoo Sangah trying to find the right
words. It was apparently ordinary but as Yoo Sangah put it, the reality of
this village was never ordinary.

I might be a visitor but I could tell by the sight of the residents living their
lives as usual. They looked bored, as if they had seen this hundred of
thousands of times.

[Shit, I almost died.]

[This crazy island… are they really orcs?]

I looked up at the true voices and saw a group of constellations appearing at
the opposite entrance of the village.

I quickly looked at the faces of the group. Unfortunately, the faces of my
party members couldn't be seen. Instead, I saw an unpleasant guy.

[Demon king 'Eyes that See the Forbidden' is looking at you.]

The demon king with fiery eyes in the shape of a black panther. He was one
of those I saw when I visited the 1863rd round.

The master of the 61st Demon Realm. Eyes that See the Forbidden, Flauros.
He was the one who died from Yoo Joonghyuk's fist in the 1863rd round.

The demon king followed me to this island. Flauros stared this way with
strange eyes before turning his attention elsewhere. It was obvious even
without reading his face. He probably judged that this wasn't a favourable
place to fight.

Cheok Jungyeong standing next to me would've surely noticed it. I glanced
at Cheok Jungyeong beside me. "What did you have to say?"

"It's nothing."

…They were really strong and reliably shoulders. I was envious.

[Is this the end of the scenario? Hey, NPCs. Guide me!]

The constellations entered and the village became a bit crowded. One of the
residents frowned at the turmoil occurring everywhere and responded.
"This is the end of the small island."

[There is no sincerity in your words. Well, the scenarios are all created by
the dokkaebis.]

Now that there were no monsters, the constellations were regaining their
spirit.

[The story 'Weak Against the Strong and Strong Against the Weak' has
started.]

The voices of the stories were flowing from the eyes of the constellations.
As expected, Cheok Jungyeong was correct.

There were no exceptions, whether they were constellations or incarnations.
If we didn't live the stories properly, the stories would live instead of us.

[Are there no additional rewards here?]

[Should we search through the houses? There might be some hidden
pieces.]
The residents felt tired and replied in a voice that found the situation
troublesome.

"There are no such things. The small island scenario is over. Those who
want to go to the next scenario should enter the hearth in the center of the
village. It is the portal."

Some of the constellations frowned at the cold tone and Demon King
Flauros stepped forward.

[The NPCs are really noisy. It is up to us when we want to leave here.]

Perhaps he was looking for an opponent to go against as he suddenly raised
his status.

[I have found a village like this. It isn't bad to rest for a while. Bring out
some drinks and food! This body is very hungry.]

The violent words caused the other constellations to laugh. Lee Jihye
frowned and came forward. "That―"

"Just wait."

Perhaps there was no room for us to intervene in this fight.

In fact, the villagers weren't fazed at all by the threat of the demon king.
The man washing his laundry yawned with boredom. "NPC, always NPC…
These days, the kids think of life as a game."

An old man carrying a Korean A-frame said. "It is a strange fate today… I
have no enthusiasm and passion."

The woman feeding the cows also added some words. "Spit. This is why I
was against opening our island. No matter how urgent the need for coins,
do I have to watch these snobs entering? It is better to raise a few cows."
The flowing words were heard clearly. The situation headed in a strange
direction and the constellations started to notice.

Flauros let out a roar. [Why are these group of bugs…?]

The little boy sucking candy in front of them said, "You are the bugs who
haven't lived for a thousand years."

Flauros' mouth dropped open. He was the one who reigned over the 64th
Demon Realm and it was natural for him to react like this. It must be the
first insult he had ever received. A wicked expression flashed across
Flauros' face.

[The scenario didn't tell me not to kill NPCs.]

The demon king let out a powerful status. The moment he roared and
revealed his fangs, all the residents of the village gazed at Flauros in
unison.

The man doing the laundry. The woman placing food and water in the
trough. The old man carrying the A-frame.

It looked like the whole world froze. The constellations sensed the strange
air and faltered. The same was true for Flauros. He was a fairly keen demon
king and must've noticed something weird. Perhaps he was thinking this
way.

「 What the hell are these guys? 」

However, he couldn't back down here. His ego as a demon king wouldn't
tolerate being suppressed by the inhabitants of a small village. In the end,
Flauros chose the one who looked the weakest.

[Die!]
Flauros' claws aimed towards the little boy eating the candy. However, this
was a completely wrong choice.

「 He clenched his fists. Then the fist was there. 」

Something exploded. The fragments of an incarnation body scattered
through the air like fireworks. Flauros' incarnation body lost his head and
slowly sank to the ground.

[Eyes that See the Forbidden has been eliminated from the scenario.]

The constellations witnessed the death of the demon king in front of them
and withdrew with a shudder.

[W-What? This…]

The residents showed little response to the astonishment of the
constellations. It was a serene atmosphere like no one was holding a funeral
for the bug. The man started the laundry again and the woman gave water
to a cow. The old man shook his head and cutting at a tree.

The kid sucking the candy declared, "Get out of the way. I don't want to see
you anymore."

The pale incarnations and constellations fled through the portal. In any
case, the small island scenario had ended. There was no reason to hesitate
anymore. After disappearing through the portal, there were less than 10
constellations remaining.

[The huge story 'Torch That Swallowed the Myth' wants you to go to the
next scenario!]

From the moment I faced this child, my giant stories reacted violently.
Maybe they noticed something. I smiled bitterly and approached the child
who killed the demon king.
[Giant Story 'Torch That Swallowed the Myth' is threatening you!]

I didn't know that Flauros would be so helpful. I was relieved to find what I
had been looking for.

[Giant Story 'Torch That Swallowed the Myth' declares that it will destroy
your incarnation body if you keep approaching him!]

I ignored its words and continued forward. The swirling giant story was
emitting threatening air currents. I was annoyed by the childish story who
thought it was a provocation against him.

"What? Do you want to be like that guy?"

"One Invincible Fist, Yoo Hoseong. "You taught the Breaking the Sky
Sword Saint and Kyrgios."

The expression of the child changed. The inhabitants of this place were all
'reincarnators'. Their age couldn't be read from their appearance. The child
in front of me was a reincarnator who had lived for at least 10,000 years.
The child narrowed his eyes and asked me. "Who are you? What is your
relationship with those children?"

[Giant Story 'Torch That Swallowed the Myth' is revealing its teeth to the
presence in front of you.]

There was another reason I came to Reincarnation Island. Based on the
future battles with myth-grade constellations, I had to obtain something
from this place.

I swallowed the rising blood and spoke in a congested voice. "One
Invincible Fist, please teach me 'Story Control'."
              Chapter 361: Ep. 68 - Inaudible Words, I


Jang Hayoung moved through the forest of the small island and was
reminded of Kim Dokja's words.

–You are the hidden card of this scenario.

Before the scenario started, Kim Dokja had called Jang Hayoung
separately. Jang Hayoung suddenly heard those words and was
embarrassed.

'…He hasn't been interested in me so far'.

Jang Hayoung was sad. No matter how much time he spent with the other
party members, Kim Dokja neglected Jang Hayoung. Three years after the
end of the Revolutionary Game or the Demon King Selection. Jang
Hayoung had long felt alienated. It felt like she had been excluded from all
the main scenarios.

–Why didn't you ask me to join Kim Dokja's Company?
This was the most disturbing thing. She wanted to ask. Why didn't Kim
Dokja invite her to join the nebula? Perhaps she was forgotten…

[The Unidentified Wall says, "Don't trust Kim Dokja too much."]

"Shut up."

[The Unidentified Wall says, "He is just using you.]

Maybe this really was the case. Kim Dokja was the most practical person
Jang Hayoung knew. Nevertheless, Jang Hayoung replied, "Kim Dokja isn't
such a person. Why do you hate Kim Dokja?"

[The Unidentified Wall asks, "Do you want to be friends with him?"]

"It would be good if we were friendly… We haven't talked much lately."

[The 'Unidentified Wall' asks, "Why? Do you like him?"]

"I like who I like." Jang Hayoung replied bluntly and bit her lips. "My
favourite is the Demon King of Salvation."

[The Unidentified Wall is looking at you. "That's him."]

"It is different! In any case, I just want to get along with him."

[The Unidentified Wall is sighing. "Even if he kills you one day?"]

"Why are you saying such ominous things?"

The Unidentified Wall had never liked Kim Dokja. It was from the first
time it met Kim Dokja all the way to the present.

"Don't get in my way. Last time, I didn't get a giant story because of you."
The giant story that told of the victory in Gigantomachia, Torch That
Swallowed the Myth. Jang Hayoung had watched through the screen and
was overwhelmed, moved and finally sad.

She thought she should've been there. She should've hurled herself into that
blazing flame. She should've been part of the giant story. Yet she couldn't.
[The Unidentified Wall says, "Trusting people will only make you
disappointed. You have suffered enough in your last life."]

She had no confidence. Would the torch have gone out if she jumped in?
What if the giant story was ruined with her involvement? What if Kim
Dokja didn't want her involvement?

Jang Hayoung was different from the other party members. She was a
resident of the Demon Realm and came to Earth. She wasn't a companion
who fought with Kim Dokja since the first scenario. Thus, she couldn't say
that she wanted to go together with him.

There was an insurmountable wall between them. It was a wall that couldn't
be reached no matter how she tried. Jang Hayoung didn't have a history to
share with them.

"This way! Just a bit more!"

"Heewon-ssi, please give me Gilyoung. I'll take him."

"It's okay! I still have enough stamina left."

Voices were heard in the distant bushes. Jang Hayoung reflexively hid
herself behind a tree. A wounded man and woman were running while
carrying a child on each of their backs. They were people Jang Hayoung
knew.

Jung Heewon and Lee Hyunsung. The two of them were being chased by
monsters. They were followed by half a dozen orcs and two trolls.
Based on the direction, they seemed to be moving across the field o the
source of the smoke. It was the wrong choice. The direction they were
heading in had more fearsome monsters than orcs and trolls. If this
continued, they would be wiped out.

Jang Hayoung reflexively clenched her fists and got up. To be exact, she
tried to get up.

[The Unidentified Wall says, "Don't save them."]

"What? What nonsense is this?"

[The Unidentified Wall says, "If they die here, you can be Kim Dokja's
only friend.]

At almost the same time, the running Jung Heewon tripped over a stone and
fell. Jung Heewon and Lee Gilyoung fell onto the ground. The orc close
behind them raised a glaive. It was too late to evade.

Jung Heewon shouted, "Gilyoung! Run!"

Jang Hayoung looked at the falling glaive and thought. Maybe
the Unidentified Wall was right. If these people died here… –
Thank you.

The conversation she had with Kim Dokja before coming here flashed in
her mind.

–For what?

–The words you said at that time.

Kim Dokja muttered with his usual distant face.

–You said it. Even if the other side of the wall can't hear it… still, leave
something on the wall.
Jang Hayoung had wondered. Did she say that? When?

…Was she drunk?

Kim Dokja continued.

–Thus, I'm doing it. As you said, one day somebody might look at the traces
on the wall.

Jang Hayoung could see Jung Heewon closing her eyes as the glaive fell.
Lee Hyunsung was shouting something while Jung Heewon covered Lee
Gilyoung. By the time she came to her senses, Jang Hayoung was already
running.

[Your new attribute is preparing to bloom.]

Her fist stretched out. The orc's glaive broke like straw before her
transcendent fist. Jung Heewon stared up at her with wide eyes.

Jang Hayoung looked down at this person and thought. 'Fool…'

Kim Dokja wouldn't recognize their feelings. The Demon King of Salvation
was a demon king, not a god. He would have no interest in what they did.
However, just because it couldn't be communicated didn't mean their hearts
weren't there.

Jang Hayoung stood as if guarding the party members and said, "Leave it to
me from now on."

It wasn't too late to make history from now on.

She still had a lot of time.
I breathed out and opened my eyes.

[Exclusive skill, Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint stage 3 has been turned
off.]

[Exiting the third person viewpoint.]

Fortunately, Jang Hayoung met with some of our companions. I was
nervous that she would be delayed but luckily, it went according to plan.
They met with Jang Hayoung and now they would be safe.

I raised my stiff body and reconfirmed the message in front of me.

[You have earned the right to use the skill Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint
as a reward for clearing the hidden scenario.]

It wasn't possible to use skills on Reincarnation Island. The story was
different after completing the hidden scenario, Survival Game.

[The exclusive skill 'Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint' is fixed at the lowest
level.]

[A system error has occurred. There is no level concept for this skill.]

[This skill isn't affected by the first generation probability.]

At first, I thought it would be better to get the license for Bookmark. Then I
thought about it and Bookmark was a skill that borrowed other people's
skills.

In other words, if I got a license for Bookmark but no additional license for
the other person's skill, Bookmark would be useless.

It was an island with too many constraints but it couldn't be helped. The
thing I needed to go on this island was more important than skills.

I heard Lee Jihye's voice in the distance. "Great Great Master!"
It was already the second day. Lee Jihye was chasing One Invincible
Fist Yoo Hoseong around. "Great Great Master! Please tell me that
story!" It was the same with Yoo Hoseong gave a cow food.

"Just one phrase! I can really learn well."

Lee Jihye annoyed Yoo Hoseong even when doing his laundry or cutting
firewood.

"How did you do that yesterday? You stretched out your fist and his head
exploded!"

Of course, Yoo Hoseong didn't say anything. I thought it wouldn't be easy
to learn Story Control. it took a long time for Kyrgios and the Breaking the
Sky Sword Saint to learn this technique.

Story Control. It was the name of a pure technique, not a skill or stigma.
There were many explanations for it in Ways of Survival but I didn't know
it precisely because there were many voices. Thus, I was actually a bit
worried.

[Giant Story 'Torch That Swallowed the Myth' is growling.]

…I had to do something about this brat soon.

It was this evening that Yoo Hoseong first became irritated. "Stop chasing
me. In addition, why I am your Great Great Master?"

"Well… you are the master of my master's teacher!"

I smiled as I heard Lee Jihye's words. It was true. Lee Jihye's master was
Yoo Joonghyuk, Yoo Joonghyuk's master was the Breaking the Sky Sword
Saint and the Breaking the Sky Sword Saint's master was One Invincible
Fist Yoo Hoseong.
Yoo Hoseong stared at Lee Jihye and sighed. "It isn't something you can
learn. Those like you who are accustomed to the system won't see any
effect, even if you train for 100 days."

"You taught Great Master!"

"They were transcendents without any sponsors. They are different from
you."

It was a sober refusal.

"You never know! I'll do exactly as you tell me!"

"Your position is wrong from the beginning. This isn't something you can
learn just be doing as I say. Have you felt nothing while following me for
two days?"

Yoo Joonghyuk's great master (they even had the same surname) gave an
unlucky smile. In fact, I knew. Yoo Hoseong was testing us the whole time.

"Haven't you heard anything here?"

Lee Jihye and I looked at the surrounding scenery at the same time. The
man cleaning up the pig's poop stared at me, like he was asking what I was
looking at.

[The story 'Master of Cleaning Defecation' is determined to live happily
today.]

The woman harvesting the crops was drinking rice wine while humming a
song.

[The story 'Master of Labour' is humming while helping its master's work.]

The old man carrying the axe sighed and sat down on the ground.
[The story 'Millennium Woodcutter' is saying that young people these days
don't know how to respect adults.]

There were no great stories. They were stories made by cleaning up animal
poop, singing while working or cutting wood. These stories were different
from other stories that I knew. There was a strange harmony in the stories.

They felt different from the stories seeking power or the stories that tried to
dominate their master. An ensemble of one story and one being created
over many years.

Yoo Hoseong said, "It takes 10 years, 100 years, 1000 years to obtain only
one sentence. Those are real stories."

Real stories. It was an interesting expression.

"Don't you have stories? Train well in that method. It is useless to learn
other stories now."

"But… I can't become as strong as you."

"That depends on what you do. The important thing is to look at the story
correctly."

"Look at it correctly?"

"A story that is too big makes it impossible to know the direction of the
story."

I had heard such cryptic words before. Was it from Lycaon when learning
Way of the Wind? I had this thought and suddenly started to worry. Could I
learn Story Control when I couldn't even learn Way of the Wind? I was
troubled when hearing people talk about talent.

Yoo Hoseong sighed and opened his mouth again. "Phew, these damn kids.
I'll tell you just once."
At these words, Lee Jihye sat in front of him like a demure student. I also
approached and listened to his story. "What do you think is a story?"

Lee Jihye rolled her eyes and answered, "Um… a tale?"

"Pitiful."

"Don't just scold me. Let me know!"

"I have to explain from the basics." Yoo Hoseong clicked his tongue and
raised his left hand. "What do you call this?"

"…Left hand?"

Yoo Hoseong raised his opposite hand. Then what about this?"

"Right hand."

"Then what about when they are joined together?"

Lee Jihye pondered for a moment before answering. "Two hands?"

Then the story replied on behalf of Yoo Hoseong.


[The story 'Ambidextrous Boxer' is having fun.]

"Yes, this leads to the words 'two hands'. Many people call it a
'relationship'. They perceive it as a similar form."

Lee Jihye had a blank expression. It was an expression that showed she
didn't understand. Yoo Hoseong spoke like he knew. "If so, what would
you call this?"

Yoo Hoseong grabbed the twig on the ground with his left hand and asked,
"One is the left hand and one is a twig. What would you call them if they
are tied together?"
"Um… a left hand holding a twig? Or left hand and twig?"

I felt a cool sensation.

"It isn't easy. Do you know why?"

Lee Jihye shook her head. Yoo Hoseong said, "There is no correct
relationship between the two. Whether it is left hand and twig or left hand
holding a twig, it isn't something that falls naturally. It is awkward."

Yoo Hoseong held the twig like a dart and threw it at a tree far away. The
twig flew quickly and stuck into a tree. It looked natural, like it was
originally part of the tree.

"It is the story that narrows that awkward distance. It connects the most
distant things in the world. If you want to control the story, you have to
make sure to understand the story."

It was a seemingly confusing explanation. Lee Jihye stared at the twig on
the tree blankly. I carefully picked up a stone that was rolling on the
ground. The power to connect the most distant things in the world… it was
difficult.

Yoo Hoseong saw my actions and clicked his tongue. "Stupid guy. I just
gave an example. A relationship can't be made and a story generated by
holding something! It takes a long time to narrow the distance between the
materials and yourself…!"

The next moment, something strange happened.

[The full probability of the first generation is responding to your actions.]

[The story material has an affinity for you.]

The stone in the hand looked up at me in a pleasant manner.

[The story 'The Pebble and I' has begun.]
Yoo Hoseong stared at me with a dumbfounded expression and his lips
trembled. "You, what the hell are you?"
              Chapter 362: Ep. 68 - Inaudible Words, II


The stone in my hand trembled like it was alive.

[You have acquired a new story!]

[The story 'The Pebble and I' wants to continue.]

It was a first for me. I just touched the stone and a story occurred? There
were all sorts of complicated hypotheses in my head but I didn't have an
answer.

[The probability of the first generation is around you.]

[Currently, the Fourth Wall is in a very thin state.]

The only doubts were these two system messages. Yoo Hoseong stared at
me with suspicious eyes. "I see, you are a reincarnator. Is that right?" I

t seemed he had the wrong hypothesis about me.
"Were you stoned to death in your previous life? That's why the stone is…"

"No."

"Oh, you're a stone head. That's why the stone―"

I picked up a branch thrown by Yoo Hoseong.

[The material of the story is sensitive to you.]

[The story 'Kim Dokja Likes a Branch' has begun!]

I glanced towards the dazed Yoo Hoseong who had a gaping mouth. "I'm
afraid that my head isn't that bad."

By my side, Lee Jihye glared at me. Yoo Hoseong shouted with wide eyes.

"H-Hold this!"

I accepted the flower that Yoo Hoseong gave me.

[The story material has an affinity for you.]

[The story 'Kim Dokja with a Flower' has begun.]

Yoo Hoseong continued to give me things and I accepted all of them.

[The story material has an affinity for you.]

[The story material has an affinity for you.]

My surroundings were filled with singing stones and flowers. After much
agonizing, Yoo Hoseong made a decision.

"…Grab me."

"Where do you mean?"
"Here, grab me here."

Yoo Hoseong's eyes were blazing. I understood his anger. The 'real stories'
that took 10, 100 or even 1000 years to build up were easily obtained by
me… he was bound to feel like this.

"If you wish… please excuse me."

I sighed and placed a hand on Yoo Hoseong's shoulder.

…Why was this small shoulder so hard?

Yoo Hoseong said, "There is no change. Is it limited to inanimate objects?
Hrmm…"

[The character 'Yoo Hoseong' shows a small liking towards you.] The

shocked Yoo Hoseong withdrew from my hand. "W-What is this?"

The next second, I heard a message in my ears.

[The story 'Person Who is Loved by All' has been acquired!]




It was the other residents of the village who showed interest in me while
Yoo Hoseong was in shock.

"It has been a long time since I've seen this crazy talent."

"Huh, this is a rare friend… did you come from the outside?"

"Are you interested in the cattle feed?"

I accepted the cattle feed that the woman gave me in a dazed mood.
Human Kim Dokja. This was the first time I received such attention in my
almost 30 years of living. I… was talented?

「 (Dokja-ssi is definitely talented. You've been reading this novel for over
ten years.) 」

Perhaps her librarian's work had been busy lately because Yoo Sangah
sounded tired.

'Is it related to reading the novel?'

「 (I can't think of anything else but that.) 」

'This has never happened in the meantime…;

Come to think of it, that wasn't true. There were some characters who had
good feelings towards me as soon as they saw me.

「 (Maybe it is because the wall is thinner?) 」

I heard Yoo Sangah's words and thought it was possible. I didn't know the
exact reason but it was possible the failure of the Fourth Wall had closed
the distance between the world and me. Then how far did this power apply?

Looking back, Lee Jihye seemed to have her own sense of pride as she
muttered to herself while holding a branch in her hand. I poked her with my
finger.

"Eek!" The startled Lee Jihye screamed. "Ahjussi, are you crazy? The
finger that touched poop…!"

It didn't work. Now, let's see…

I poked the shoulder of Cheok Jungyeong sitting next to me.

"Is this a challenge?"
"That's not it."

…This didn't work either. Then what were the principles behind it? No
matter how I thought about it, I couldn't figure out how my talent worked.
"It is really fucking talent. I can't explain it any other way."

The one who spoke with Yoo Hoseong, who had been preoccupied with his
thoughts for a long time.

Ferocious anger was seething on his face.

Yoo Hoseong approached me with a child's stride. "You might not know
but I hate strange fates the most. In particular, I hate those like you who
don't try hard and easily obtain something.

One Invincible Fist Yoo Hoseong was such a person. He liked people with
a persistent spirit and cared for those who strove to overcome their
insurmountable talent. In Yoo Hoseong's eyes, a man like me was a
criminal who would destroy the first generation with talent. "For the first
time today, I am going to break my belief."

Huh?

"I will teach you Story Control."




I didn't know why Yoo Hoseong changed his mind. The only certainty was
that he discovered some possibilities from me. As if to leave a lifelong
disciple, Yoo Hoseong troubled me day and night.

"Phenomena and truth aren't the same. Using a story properly means
understanding its language."
"Solid ground is needed to leap into abstraction. That is the details of the
stories you have built up."

…Etc. There were so many ghostly words that I thought it would be better
to read Ways of Survival again.

I ate a tangerine that the villagers gave me and thought hard about it.

"Stupid guy. It is a face that doesn't understand anything."

"I'm sorry."

"Don't try to understand it if you don't know. Not everyone will learn
control in the same way." "What are you saying?" It was like I was struck.

"It is your problem from the beginning. You lack respect for the elderly."

"…"

"You must learn how to listen first."

"I don't think I can listen better than this."

"I'm telling you to listen to the words of your story!"

…Words of the story? Was this mentioned in Ways of Survival?

"You already have the talent to communicate with stories. It is the talent to
listen to their emotions and words."

It was true. I didn't know when but I was able to read the stories, just like
they were people.

"However, I want to control the stories, not chat."

"The stories aren't controllable."
The one saying this was the person who taught the method to control
stories.

"Can you control your thoughts?"

"Of course I can…"

"Then don't think of anything for five minutes."

I nodded as if it was easy. Don't think, don't think…

Damn, I was thinking 'don't think'. I tried hard to escape my thoughts but it
wasn't easy.

In five minutes, many things passed through my head. For example, the
probability of Yoo Joonghyuk becoming a girl and killing the demon kings
or Han Sooyoung suffering from an unknown delirium declaring, "I'm sorry
for plagiarizing Kim Dokja at the time"…

I raised both hands and surrendered. "…I can't do it."

"You're a fool."

[The story 'Demon King of Salvation' is laughing at you.]

"This is what you have to do from today. Listen to the words of the story."

"But…"

"Don't be afraid. No matter how big the story, they are stories that you
gained."

Turning away, Yoo Hoseong looked like a teacher for the first time.

"A story can dominate us but sometimes it tells us the way."
From that day on, I started practicing Story Control. To be precise, it was
practice to hear the voices of the story more accurately.

[Giant Story 'Torch That Swallowed the Myth' is annoyed by your interest.]

The stories were unfamiliar to me but after a day or two, they started to
gradually open up. I listened to the voices of the stories that had refrained
from expressing their emotions so far.

[The story 'King of a Kingless World' says it was very happy at the time.]
The stories told their tales and I heard them. The stories became the
memories we accumulated.

The feeling of pleasure as the Four Yin Demonic Beheading Sword broke
the Absolute Throne. Yes, I really enjoyed it. It was because this was my
first story.

[The story 'Person who Opposes the Miracle' says the returnee was really
troublesome.

That's right, the Myung Ilsang bastard was really tricky. I fought with Yoo
Joonghyuk and Han Sooyoung and still almost died.

[The story 'One Who Hunted the King of Disasters' misses the taste of the
snake wine.]

[The story 'One Who Killed an Outer God' is asking you to remember.]

Every time I heard these words, I was immersed in my memories. On the
other hand, it was hard to suppress the urgency if I delayed here for too
long. Han Sooyoung, Yoo Joonghyuk, Anna Croft…

Those who pursued a different ending from me might already be knocking
at the door of the next scenario.
[The story 'Demon King of Salvation' says you shouldn't run away
anymore.]

I focused on the story again. From a certain point, the voices of the stories
grew and I found it hard to distinguish between reality and the illusion. My
sense of space was fading. I couldn't tell if I was in the story or if I was
listening to the story in reality.

[The story 'Revolutionary of the Silver Screen' is hungry for a new
revolution.]

Yes, I'm sorry. I neglected you for too long.

[The story 'Gourmet Association's Heretic' is complaining of hunger!]

[The story 'Miracle Gambler' wants another big bet.]

In between, dream-like screens passed by.

–Dokja-ssi. We almost died. Do you know?

–Ahjussi!

The voices of the party members were faintly heard from somewhere.

–…Oh, how cheap. You are training alone?

–We will learn quickly! Who can we learn from?

I had a thought while listening to those voices. If this was really a dream, it
was a sweet dream.

–…Why am I not getting a story? Dokja hyung got a story from doing this.

–Get your hands off him, Lee Gilyoung.

–You stay away, Shin Yoosung.
In my dream, I heard the children muttering things like 'ahjussi and I' or
'Dokja hyung and Lee Gilyoung'. I didn't know how they would use such
stories even if they did obtain them but…

[Giant Story 'Demon Realm's Spring' is looking at your story together.]

Why? I listened to the voices of the children and felt warm. In my dim
vision, countless stories were watching the scene with me.

[The story 'Person Who is Loved by an Archangel' likes your stories.]

[The story 'King of a Kingless World' is watching the children.]

[The story 'Giant's Liberator' is looking at the party members with fond
eyes.]

All the stories resembled me and I resembled all the stories. If so, that guy
alone on the other side was surely part of us.

[Giant Story 'Torch That Swallowed the Myth' is turning away from

you.] I spoke to it. 'Stop being grumpy and come here'.

There was no answer. The one who threatened other stories with its size
was turning its back to us. Its head was drooping like a child reading
something.

Maybe I already knew. This was a small child immersed in its own story.
Still, such stories couldn't exist alone.

I spoke carefully to its back. 'It looks interesting'.

The Torch That Swallowed the Myth looked up at me and raised its body.

「 You…! 」
The story will a very large body glared at me. Strangely, I wasn't afraid of
it. This guy was a story. All stories had to flow somewhere.

'Where do you want to go?'

It couldn't easily answer my question and shut its mouth. It probably
couldn't answer. I knew its heart.

'Come with me'.

「 …To where? 」

I slowly opened my mouth and spoke. I wanted all my stories to reach ■■.

The story asked, 「 What is at the end of the whole story? 」

'I don't know. Still, at least we won't be alone'.

[The story 'Hell of Eternity' is looking at you.]

After a while, I felt the stories wrapping around my fingertips. My body
floating in the waves of the story gradually became heavy and I slowly
opened my eyes.

I couldn't tell how much time had passed.

My legs were numb. I looked down and saw Lee Gilyoung and Shin
Yoosung leaning against them while sleeping. They weren't stories. They
were children with real bodies. I lightly stroked the hair of the children.
[Giant Story 'Torch That Swallowed the Myth' is listening to your story.]
Finally, I was ready to leave for the next scenario.
At this time, the only survivor of the 331st island was moving towards the
next scenario.

[You have slaughtered all participants on the island.]

[You are the only survivor of the 331st Island.]

[You are qualified to enter the following scenario.]

A black coat was flapping and the Black Heavenly Demon Sword shone.
Looking at the portal to the next scenario, Yoo Joonghyuk was reminded of
the insidious presence he met just before coming here. The outer god in the
third round whose identity was unknown.

–I can't tell you the full contents of the revelation. It is too much of a breach
of probability, even for me. However, I can give this much. This way, it
will be a fair fight.

He turned on the smartphone and a text file appeared.

『 Han Sooyoung - Record of the 1863rd Round (First) 』

Yoo Joonghyuk moved towards the portal while opening the first chapter of
the story he didn't know.
             Chapter 363: Ep. 68 - Inaudible Words, III


It had been a week since my arrival in the village.

After all the 'Stories' settled down in their places, I began preparing for the
next scenario right away.

「The Isle of Reincarnators is formed around three islands – the 'Small
Island' where the Probability of the 1st generation of Stories is applicable.
The 'Middle Island', where the Probability of the 2nd generation of Stories
is applicable. Finally, the 'Main Island', where the Probability of the 3rd
generation of Stories is applicable…」

Unlike how it was in the 'Small Island', I'd be directly clashing against the
Constellations from the 'Middle Island' onwards. Meaning, the beings that
managed to survive while breaking past the rather realistic Probability of
the 1st generation were waiting for me there.

[Giant Story, 'Torch that Swallowed the Myth', urges you to get a move on.]
As usual, one of the guys remained temperamental, but, well, I figured that
I had gained enough control over them by now, anyway. Yoo Hoseong said
this before – Stories would try to control their user, but at the same time,
they would also show the person the way forward, too.

[Giant Story, 'Demon Realm's Spring', is waiting for your decision.]

These guys would have to continue existing within me from now on. We'd
get to tell new stories and they would shine, as new and different Stories, as
well.

"Heewon-ssi, good to see you that you're unhurt."

"Can't you change your repertoire of greetings already? I almost died for
real this time, you know?"

I was told that my companions arrived around a week after I began my
'Story Control' training. Apparently, they got lost at the outskirts of the
island and that delayed their arrival somewhat.

I looked around and asked her. "Where is everyone?"

"They are in training right now."

We walked for a bit and soon, the sight of the kids, Lee Hyunsung, and
Jang Hayoung sitting cross-legged on the ground caught my eyes. It seemed
that their training wasn't easy, judging from their current facial expressions.

But, that was rather obvious.

Even at the shortest estimation, the 'Story Control' training would at least
need around two months. The Yoo Joonghyuk from the original story
needed to waste over 3 weeks, even with his incredible talent, so… I quietly
observed the Stories of my companions.
[Story, 'Kim Dokja's Company's Code of Conduct', is writhing around in
pain.]

[Story, 'One who Hears the Monster's Voice', is moaning in pain.]

[Story, 'One who Craves for the Trust of his Companions', is in great pain.]

Like how I earned my Stories, they too had earned theirs. Going through
the same scenarios didn't mean that we'd automatically earn the exact same
Stories.

Their Stories would be different from each other's because they all
possessed different levels of sensibilities.

"The flow of time here is slower compared to other islands, so it'll be fine to
take it easy with your training. You shouldn't try to rush it. You will be able
to fight properly in the Great War of Saints and Demons only after you've
completed your training."

"I understand."

[Story, 'Demon King's Fanatical Believer', is singing a song.]

「Oh, oh~, Dokja hyung said it back then. I am the god of the world.
Follow me, and you'll learn the truth of the world~.」

"…And when Gilyoung wakes up, please tell him this. Something really
bad will happen if he continues to acquire twisted Stories." (Lee Gilyoung
→ Lee Gilyoung)

Jung Heewon broke into a fit of giggles, and I reprimanded her with a
slightly more serious tone of voice. "This isn't a joke, you know."

"I'm not joking, either. Dokja-ssi, you really need to consciously recognise
your position. I'm talking about recognising just what kind of a person you
are to these kids."
"…"

"Do you think they would've made it this far without you, Dokja-ssi?"

I wordlessly stared at Shin Yoosung and Lee Gilyoung as they pinched the
backs of each other's hands even during the training itself. These two kids
trusted me and were willing to come this far while sharing our imperfect
story together.

[A brand new Story that had not existed before has begun sprouting within
you.]

"…It's the same story for me."

The last person I looked at was Jang Hayoung. Trickles of cold perspiration
soaked her forehead as she maintained the intense battle against her Stories.

「I don't want to hear it. Honestly, I don't want to.」

「But, you must hear it. No matter what, you must.」

My ears overheard the Story's voice coming out of her. With that, I could
guess which Story Jang Hayoung was watching right now. Most likely,
she'd get to awaken a new attribute on this island. And then, she'd use that
as a foundation to become the 'King of the Transcendents'.

"Dokja-ssi."

"Yes?"

"Are you aware that you've been behaving indifferently only towards
Hayoung-ssi?"

"That wasn't my original intention. Things somehow worked out that
way…"

"That story you told us, shouldn't you tell that to Hayoung-ssi, as well?"
The story I told my companions… It was quite clear what Jung Heewon
referred to in this case.

「This world is constructed with a novel as the basis, and I'm the sole
reader who read that novel.」

Currently, I've told that story to only a small number of my companions.
Most other people, including Kyrgios and the Breaking the Sky Sword
Saint, didn't know this truth. Jang Hayoung was no exception.

I lowered my waist and observed her face a little closer.

「Deep double eyelids, and gently curling golden hair. Even without
[Moisture Retention], pale-smooth and soft skin. Slightly plump cheeks,
and charming dimples that appear when she smiles. Due to an oddly
androgynous atmosphere, her gender is hard to identify with her face
alone.」

The descriptions from within the text of Ways of Survival, and the
comments I had left behind in the past, were all coming back to me now.
Her appearance that exactly matched my imagination became an
indescribable guilt weighing me down.

"I'm not sure how much I can be honest with her."

"Pardon?"

I couldn't tell Jang Hayoung the truth. I mean, how could I?

Tell her that I created you? That you were born because of my
comments…?

"I've been thinking about this quite often lately. Maybe, it wasn't that the
novel I've been reading became reality, but that novel was simply a
recording of this world…"
"…What are you suddenly talking about?"

Maybe, that was what I've been wishing for.

「Just like what the much-younger Kim Dokja had been thinking, a long
time ago.」

Jung Heewon looked back at me with a puzzled expression, and I replied
with a weak grin.

"I like being with you, Heewon-ssi."

"Uhm, yes, me too."

"It's the same story with our other companions, as well. For now, that's as
far as my thoughts have gone. I apologise for being selfish like this."

She was lost in a train of thought for a little while but nodded her head soon
enough.

"Well… It's fine. Dokja-ssi, you are doing what you want to do, anyway. I
understand."

"Thank you. Ah, by the way. When our companions wake up, please give
them this."

"And this is…?"

"It's the information on the upcoming scenario."

The memo pad I handed over to Jung Heewon contained information on the
'Middle Island', our next scenario.

"Hang on, Dokja-ssi, again you…!"

Jung Heewon and her quick wits seemed to have realized why I was
handing this thing over to her.
"I knew that you'd show up around today or so."

I sought out Yoo Hoseong first before leaving the 'Small Island'. Whatever
the case might have been, he taught me the Story Control, so I wanted to
express my gratitude – well, that was a lie. I had an ulterior motive for
being here.

"May I ask, why did you accept our group?"

Yoo Hoseong frowned deeply after hearing my sudden question.

"…It's just the whims of an old geezer."

It was a rather bizarre sight to see a kid who looked to be ten years old or so
refer to himself as a 'geezer', but it wasn't an improbable spectacle, either.
Because the Invincible Fist Yoo Hoseong was an existence that had lived
far longer than your regular Demon Kings or Archangels, after all.

<The 0th Murim>, known only through legends being passed down. The
greatest expert under the heavens in that Murim was none other than Yoo
Hoseong.

"If you're done asking your questions, get out of my sight this instant. I do
not wish to look at your ugly mug any longer."

He was putting up the exact same act of driving away one's guests, just like
in the beginning.

"Don't you want to come with us?"

"What rubbish are you spewing now?"
"I'm aware that, once the scenario on the 'Small Island' concludes, you are
allowed to advance to the next one. The upcoming 'Great War of Saints and
Demons' is a scenario like that, after all."

Yoo Hoseong's brows greatly quivered, just then.

Even back in the original story, there was a turn where the 'Great War of
Saints and Demons' took place in the Isle of Reincarnators.

「The meeting of the 'New' and the 'Old'; a fusion scenario with the 1st
generation!」

Most likely, the Bureau should be busy with advertising this scenario using
such slogans on the outside. Which was by design, actually. It was a
scheme to use the 1st generation of Stories, only spoken through rumours
and hearsay, as the focal point of the advertisement itself.

The thing was, though, the Bureau's scheme to make lots of moolah could
also serve as an opportunity for the Forgotten who were left behind and
abandoned by the passing of the eras.

"It's possible that you might be able to leave this island by using this
chance."

The Isle of Reincarnators was like the living museum of the <Star Stream>.
The Reincarnators of this place could live forever in perpetuity on this
island, but at the same time, must suffer the curse of never being able to
step outside, all because of the contract these people signed with the 'Master
of the Island'.

"How long are you planning to remain as a relic of the bygone era like
some kind of a stuffed animal?"

Yoo Hoseong slowly closed his eyes. It looked as if he was trying to calm
his rising anger.
"What do you… expect from us after leaving here? The Forgotten being
strong is only applicable within this island. The 1st generation no longer
matters. Nobody wants to see such a tale."

For sure, he was right about that. The majority of the Reincarnators
wouldn't be able to properly display their prowess after leaving the island
where the 'Probability of the 1st generation' was still active.

The 1st generation of the Forgotten wouldn't be able to adapt to the outside
world ruled by the System, rife with powerful ki and magic. However, not
everyone would be like that.

"The Transcendents who studied under you are playing active roles in the
outside world even now. Meaning, there are definitely some who yearn to
see the Stories you have created."

"I'm sure there are. However, I'm also sure that such a thing can't become
the trend."

"Does it have to be, though?"

"What's that?"

"I'm asking you whether it needs to become the trending topic in order to
become a good Story or not. Since when did you start caring about such a
thing, anyway?"

Yoo Hoseong's eyes shot open and the proverbial flames were flickering
within them.

"Are you suggesting that, after all this time, I should become a plaything of
the Constellations once more?"

If I take one more step here, make that one last push, then I'd definitely get
my head blown away just like other Demon Kings. So, I couldn't take that
step. What I did take, though, was just half a step, instead.
"You've been listening to the story of the Stories for a long time."

I had to shake this guy up exactly to the length of my half-step, so that he'd
willingly take the other half by himself.

"Don't you think it's about time that you start personally telling your own
story?"

Yoo Hoseong's eyes opened even wider, clear ripples visibly spreading out
within his irises. I formed a wordless smile and turned around to leave.

[Story, 'Pebble and I', is cackling to itself.]

Well, I've cast my stone now, and the rest wasn't up to me anymore.
Because the one to make this seriously scary Transcendent move his butt
would be someone else, actually.




"Are you really leaving without saying goodbye?"

"Everyone is focused right now and I don't want to disturb them. Besides,
we should meet up again pretty soon, anyway. Also, there's something that I
must do after going there first."

I chose not to say any special goodbyes to my companions, but did say my
farewell to Jung Heewon. She carried a rather rueful expression, but it
seemed that she had accepted my decision as was.

"Please, you must survive."

"Let's meet again."

We lightly bumped fists.
Just before my departure, the villagers came to see me off.

"Would you like some bread on your journey? It's been freshly baked this
morning."

"I thought you liked stones, so I brought some of my collections."

Several villagers I had grown friendlier with during my stay gifted me with
some food. As the villagers grew further away in my view, I spotted Yoo
Hoseong among them.

He too wished for some kind of a change to take place. And that was why
he probably decided to teach me and my companions – while praying that
the skill he taught would change the island, flip the Great War of Saints and
Demons on its head, and eventually, transform the <Star Stream> itself, too.

[Story, 'Reincarnator of Ten Thousand Years', is singing a song of
farewell.]

[Story, 'World's Most Ancient Farmer', is wishing you godspeed.]

Some would leave, while some would remain behind. The moments of the
most distant things meeting and then parting again, would be remembered
by the Stories.

That was how this world continued to exist.

As I turned around, I heard Yoo Hoseong's voice projection enter my ear.

– It's possible that the 'Master of the Island' might become interested in you.
It'll be better for you to be more cautious.

I returned a light smile as my reply. There was this message that kept
repeating itself in front of my eyes since a while ago.

['Master of the Island' is paying close attention to you.]
I approached the village's giant brazier to find that Cheok Jungyeong was
waiting for me. "Let us travel together."

"Sounds good."

We'd get separated during our transfer to the Middle Island anyway, but
still, I felt somewhat more confident now that we were making our entrance
together.

"By the way, about the next scenario…"

The scenario of the 'Middle Island' was a preparatory one for the main
island's Great War of Saints and Demons. Cheok Jungyeong nodded his
head, seemingly having misunderstood what I said somehow.

"Now that I recall, you are a Demon King, are you not? Alright. If I'm
destined to fight you, then I swear to give it my all."

"N-no, hang on a sec. That's not what I…"

"This great one shan't be tethered to the unnecessary personal emotions of
fate during our true battle, so you can rest easy."

No, hang on. I'd much rather prefer that you be tethered to your
unnecessary emotions, though.

Somehow, I now had to pray fervently that I don't become Cheok
Jungyeong's target during the upcoming scenario.

[Tutorial Scenario has concluded!]

[Transfer to the 'Middle Island' has begun!]

[Main Scenario has been updated!]

Accompanied by the 'update' message, the surrounding view began
changing bit by bit.
[You have arrived on 'Middle Island No.3'.]

Thankfully, I couldn't see Cheok Jungyeong next to me.

The moment my transfer was complete, the acrid odour of blood stung my
nose. I was greeted by the grisly sight of dead corpses belonging to
Constellations and Incarnations strewn about on a vast plain.

This sight was more than enough to dampen one's spirit, but I was relieved
to see it, actually. It was far more advantageous to start this scenario later
than the others, as that would lower the odds of running into powerful
Constellations that had entered here beforehand.

['Probability of the 2nd generation' is active within the relevant area.]

[A portion of your skills have been unlocked.]

[A portion of your overall Stats have been restored.]

Along with the crackling noise, I felt my shoulders grow just a bit wider,
while my height grew, too. I had been feeling really constricted for some
time, but now, it felt like I could breathe a bit easier.

[A new Hidden Scenario has arrived!]

I quickly opened the scenario's info window.
  < Hidden Scenario – Snatching Modifiers >

  Type: Main

  Difficulty: ???

  Clear Conditions: Take away the 'Modifier Necklace' from the enemy
  designated as your target. (In case the participant does not possess any
  Modifiers, it will be replaced by his or her true name.)

  Time limit: -

  Reward: Randomly obtain one of the target's Stories, acquisition of a
  ticket for entry into the 'Main Island'.

  Failure: ???


This scenario was the final hurdle before advancing to the 'Main Island'.

The content of this scenario was simple in nature. I needed to take away the
mark of the Modifier from someone who was designated as my target. A
small necklace shimmering in silver already found itself dangling around
my neck by then.

[Demon King of Salvation]

It was the necklace with my Modifier written on.

[Number of survivors on 'Middle Island No.3' is 262.]

262, huh. That was a far higher number than I expected.

However, it wasn't enough to change my plan. Because the really powerful
Constellations should have advanced to the 'Main Island' by now.
No, the really important bit was just who got tagged as my target, but the
powerful ones had already disappeared from here, so it must be…

[Your 'primary target' has been decided.]

[Modifier of your 'primary target' is…]

Right after that, I discovered a group of Constellations busy running
towards this location from a distance – a group that was urgently running
away as if they were being chased down by something.

Along with the noise of the ground exploding, a part of the group became
bloody sacks of meat and flew away like a splitting ocean wave. And I
could see the one giving chase to the escaping Constellations through the
rising murky dust cloud.

…God damn it.

Why was that bastard still here?
             Chapter 364: Ep. 68 - Inaudible Words, IV


Bloody hell, I definitely didn't want to run into that guy here.

I quickly hid behind the mountain of corpses while witnessing the waves of
magical energy blowing around like violent storm winds. Not too long
afterwards, I heard the voices of those hurriedly running away.

[That crazy monster…!]

[Uwaaaahk!]

The Constellations were crushed mercilessly and were killed off, leaving
behind only their death throes. Stories flooded out among the bits of body
parts flying about, and the blood shed by the Incarnations dyed the land
crimson red.

[Run! Hurry!!]
Right behind them, the slaughterer responsible for this bloody spectacle
finally arrived on the scene.

I saw the purple-coloured aura bright enough to be visible even from
behind the tall mountain of corpses. All I could do was to silently watch the
proceedings, unable to even breathe properly.

[Giant Story, 'Torch That Swallowed the Myth', is growling.]

[Giant Story, 'Demon Realm's Spring', is shrinking back.]

Here came the possessor of the incredible Status that could even negatively
affect my Stories.

[Story, 'Flame that Annihilates Evil', has begun its storytelling!]

The 'Flame that Annihilates Evil' – one of the Stories that would display the
greatest effect when dealing with evil-leaning Constellations. I knew the
owner of this Story really well.

「Flowing locks of platinum-blonde hair, violet-coloured eyes. The radiant
wings of an Archangel spreading behind his back.」

He was the sole Archangel among <Eden> that displayed its hostility
towards me.

[Constellation, 'Saviour of the Corrupted', has begun its Judgement for
Salvation.]

…The 'Saviour of the Corrupted', Archangel Michael, a being who
possessed the same Modifier words, just like me.

Ku-gugugugu!!

The [Sword of Saviour] held in Archangel Michael's hands split the world
in half. The purple-coloured fog on the blade spread out, and this fog
ignited into flames that soon started burning the atmosphere itself. The
flames crossed the air in the blink and reached the Constellations trying to
escape.

[Aaaahhk!!]

Five or six Constellations running away screamed at the top of their lungs
and crumbled to the ground. Stories became ash within the purple-coloured
flames and scattered away.

The only things remaining on the spots once occupied by the dead
Constellations were 'Modifier Necklaces' gleaming in a silvery hue.
Michael flew in the air and landed beside them to confirm the dropped loot.

[It's still not here.]

He seemed to be searching for something. A bizarre light shot out from his
eyes as he began observing his surroundings.

[Feels like there's one more rat hidden somewhere nearby…]

Could I win if I was to fight Michael here?

I grew quite a bit stronger after learning Story Control, but still, I wasn't
confident of winning against that guy for the time being. Not only was he
the strongest battle angel in <Eden>, he was also infinitely closer to
becoming a Myth-grade Constellation, too.

If he decided to go all out, then he'd not be in a disadvantageous position
against even Poseidon who fought in 'Gigantomachia'. Even if I knew all
the info on the guy through 'Ways of Survival', well… Gu-ohhhhh!

Silvery light oozed out from Michael's two eyes. That was [Eye of the
Archangel.]
One of the exclusive skills possessed by Archangels that detected the
presence of 'evil'. It seemed that he could use that skill now after the
Probability of the 2nd generation had been unlocked.

His eyes, burning like the ghostly flames of Dokkaebi, began scanning his
surroundings. The range of his vision slowly shifted and was heading in my
direction.

My heart began beating faster bit by bit.

Should I make a run for it?

It was at that moment that the pebble the villagers gave me writhed within
my inner pocket.

[Story, 'Pebble and I', has begun its storytelling.]

And something quite unexpected happened next.

[Due to the effect of the Story, your detectable presence has become similar
to that of a 'pebble'.]

[The demonic energy emitted by you has become assimilated to the
surrounding nature.]

Michael scanned the mountain of corpses I was hiding behind without
much of a reaction, before eventually withdrawing his vision while
muttering to himself.

[Was I mistaken?]

He then complained with an unhappy-sounding voice as he rose up in the
air.

[All because the Scribe issued a time-wasting order…]
His wings spread out widely and his figure disappeared into the distance in
an instant. Only after his presence was completely gone did I stand up from
my hiding spot, while wiping the cold sweat off my forehead.

[Story, 'Pebble and I', is pestering you for praise.]

"You did well. Thanks."

[Story, 'Pebble and I', is giggling happily to itself.]

I had no idea that this Story could help me out in this manner. A Story that
could turn my presence into that of a 'pebble'…

I did feel a bit mixed about it, but still, it might come in handy later on. I
then quickly took a look around the devastated surroundings.

[Number of survivors on 'Middle Island No.3' is 224.]

In that brief amount of time, 38 people got slaughtered. Most of them were
Incarnations or Constellations only on the level of Historical-grade, but
there were some Narrative-grade mixed in among the victims, as well.

The sight reminded me of what it'd look like right after a natural disaster
swept by.

This was the true power of the Archangels. The high-ranking Demon Kings
should also possess a similar level of power, too.

「(Now that was a close shave. If things went wrong, I was planning to use
'revelation', even.)」

'You were watching?'

「(Yes. I was on a break.)」

I recovered a bit of my energy after hearing Yoo Sangah's clear voice.
Right, even if the enemies that I had to fight against were extremely
powerful, I too held several hidden cards up my sleeve.

「(…By the way, don't the conditions of the corpses seem a little odd?)」

I nodded my head and looked down at the sagging corpses. To be more
specific, I wasn't looking at the remains, but their 'Modifier Necklaces',
which seemed a bit off. Most of those had either disappeared, or a portion
of the Modifiers were damaged.

Yoo Sangah asked a question.

「(Even if we say that necklaces have disappeared after they were hunted
down as targets, but… Why would only portions of Modifiers disappear
like that?)」

[The Ancient □□□]

[The Aged □□□]

[□□ and □□□'s □□]

Several Modifiers were missing words here and there. It was as if someone
deliberately stole only certain letters and nothing else.

'Some people are exploiting the loophole'.

「(Loophole?)」

'Do you remember the condition to clear this scenario?'

「(Wasn't it, snatch away the 'Modifier Necklace' from an opponent
designated as your target?)」

'Correct. But in reality, there's no reason to hunt down your target. What's
important here is to get your hands on the necklace itself'.
Yoo Sangah replied in a surprised voice.

「(Ah, could it be…)」

Just as I nodded my head, a new message entered my ears.

[It is possible to collect 'Modifier syllables' in the corresponding area.]

[You can craft a new necklace with the collected syllables.]

'There are those who steal Modifiers from other Constellations and create
the 'Modifier Necklace' that their targets are wearing'.

Basically, a 'Modifier' was a combination of words.

For instance, my Modifier, 'Demon King of Salvation', was made up of the
following syllables – [De], [Mon], [King], [Of], [Sal], [Va], and [Tion].

Meaning, as long as you collected those syllables, you didn't have to snatch
my necklace away but would still be able to construct the same thing as
mine.

「(…Why is the Bureau permitting this kind of shortcut?)」

'The condition of snatching away the designated target's necklace can
potentially slow down the progress of the scenario. Also, there's a
possibility that your target has already escaped from this scenario too,
which will further complicate the situation'.

Constellations hated slow progress, and they really loved the fast-paced
action and the continuous rush of that refreshing feeling.

「(Which means, all these people were sacrificed for just a single
word…)」

I nodded my head again.
Most likely, powerful Constellations slaughtered the lower-classed ones
and combined the necessary Modifiers belonging to their targets. Well, that
would be a lot quicker than searching for a target that constantly ran away
from you, after all.

Rather than praying for the dead's safe journey to the afterlife, I began
rummaging through the discarded necklaces that now resembled corn on
the cob missing many of its kernels.

Yoo Sangah didn't say anything.

[You have acquired the Modifier syllable, 'Of'.]

There were almost no useful words remaining. The majority of them were
common adpositions. Without a doubt, all the necessary words had already
been collected by other Constellation as the pieces for their puzzle
combinations.

I did rummage through the pile of corpses that Michael left behind and
found a few useful items, though. As expected, it seemed that a
Constellation like Michael wouldn't hesitate to throw away items that
weren't 'Star Relics'.

Indeed, his wealth was on another scale. But, besides all that…

"…Why don't you come out already? Michael is far away by now, you
know."

My voice quietly resounded out in this empty, devastated location. No
presence of a person could be felt, but I still spoke up one more time.

"You should come out while I'm still being civil, okay?"

There was one other person hiding within the corpses. This person managed
to perfectly hide their presence, but I was pretty sure of them being there.
Why? Because I clearly witnessed them going into hiding just as the bloody
slaughter commenced.

Accompanied by 'Busuhsuh' noise, a corner of the corpse pile collapsed and
fell, as a certain someone stood up. An Incarnation that somehow managed
to avoid the detection of [Eye of the Archangel] revealed themself.

"…Demon King of Salvation."

A blonde-haired woman full of wounds was glaring straight at me. Blood
continued to flow out from both her torn arm and the grievous wound on
her stomach. Even at a casual glance, they seemed to be pretty serious
injuries.

I spoke while looking back at her. "Looks like things are not going as well
as you hoped, Anna Croft."




I recalled the moments when Anna Croft first made her appearance within
'Ways of Survival'.

The prophet of Asgard and capable of freely using [Precognition] and
[Retrocognition], she was the one character that possessed the skills to
counter the Regressor, Yoo Joonghyuk.

Because of that, she became his chief rival in the latter half of 'Ways of
Survival'.

…During the original storyline, that was.

A woman willing to bear any cost for the sake of her great cause. One of
the most powerful Incarnations, and a character who'd become the master
of 'Zarathustra' in the distant future, something that even Constellations
feared – such a person was sagging powerlessly right in front of my eyes.

I crushed one of the [Great Return Pills] I bought earlier and shoved it
inside her mouth. She opened her eyes around 30 minutes after that.

As soon as she did, she spotted me and while breaking out in a
nearconvulsion, stood up from the ground in great haste.

"Sit down. Your physical condition is still dangerous."

She confirmed that her wrists and ankles weren't bound, and quickly
stepped back, still being wary of me. "Why did you save me?"

"I've got a few things to ask you."

"And what makes you think I'll answer your questions?"

She growled like a wild beast. This was a slightly different appearance from
the 'Prophet' that I remembered.

"Why are you participating in the 'Great War of Saints and Demons'?"

"So I can earn a Giant Story, obviously. Could there be any other reason?"

"But, shouldn't you be getting ready to tackle a different 'Giant Story
Scenario' by now? Am I wrong?"

Anna Croft bit her lips after hearing my question.

In the original storyline, she shouldn't be taking part in the 'Great War of
Saints and Demons'. Because she was supposed to participate in another
Giant Story Scenario called 'Ragnarök', instead.

"That is…"
The light in her eyes shook visibly. And that was the same thing as me
hearing her answer.

"You've been discarded by the Nebula."

"This problem doesn't concern you."

She began gritting her teeth now. I could easily understand the rage
contained within those words, though.

Anna Croft and I clashed against each other a couple of times so far, and
that changed the 'future' of the original storyline she was supposed to live
out.

Back during the 'Gourmet Association', or back during 'Gigantomachia', she
didn't get to achieve any notable feats.

As her repeated failures accumulated, the Nebula <Asgard> simply
chucked her into the midst of the 'Great War of Saints and Demons', all by
herself, after she was deemed no longer useful.

…Was this because of me?

The future that I changed didn't just transform the fate of Yoo Joonghyuk
and my companions.

I spoke to Anna Croft as she glared at me with eyes filled with contempt.
"What if you get to earn a Myth-grade Story in this place?"

"…What did you say?"

"Wouldn't Asgard have to reassess you in that case, then?"

The Myth-grade Story – her irises quaked visibly after hearing that term.

"What are you trying to say here?"
"I can help you."

"I'm asking you what your motives are."

"I don't have any ulterior motives. I only wish for you and 'Zarathustra' to
grow without any issues. That is all."

[Character 'Anna Croft' has activated 'Lie Detection Lv.8'.]

[Character 'Anna Croft' has confirmed the applicable remark to be true.]

Her expression was dyed in pure astonishment, but it recovered quickly
enough. The light in her eyes reverted back to the one belonging to the
calm, level-headed Prophet from my memories.

"…And what do you want in return?"

As expected, prophets were quick on the uptake and that made my life
easier.

"Lend me your ability for a bit."

Most likely, Anna Croft had no idea that the first being I met on this
'Middle Island' happened to be her, and just how glad I felt about this lucky
encounter.




Somewhere in the mountainous region of the island. Asmodeus rubbed his
chin while looking at the 'Modifier Necklace' he 'earned' as he stood on top
of a tall, ancient tree.

[The Hunter of □dges.]
Now originally, Asmodeus was supposed to target the Modifier [The
Hunter of Grudges.]

Unfortunately, other competitors hunted down his target already, and
thanks to that, he was left with a tattered necklace that said [The Hun□ of
□□], instead.

"So, I've already acquired [Dges] and [Ter]… that means all I need to find
is [Gru]…"

The problem was, there weren't that many Constellations remaining on this
island that still possessed the Modifier containing [Gru].

'The side effect of participating later because I was taking care of my
dependents is fairly large, isn't it'.

Asmodeus stayed on top of the tree and scanned every corner of the island
to search for the remaining Constellations. It was at that point that the
Demon King heard the explosions ringing out from the forest up north.
Judging from their scale, he could guess who was behind them. Yet another
round of 'clean-up' had commenced, it seemed.

It'd prove to be entertaining if Asmodeus decided to stick his nose in there,
but…

But then, a familiar voice entered his ears.

"…According to [Precognition], he is somewhere nearby."

"Oh, really?"

Asmodeus's expression brightened up the instant he heard those voices.

He lightly jumped off from the treetop and arrived before the owner of the
voice with a gob-smacking turn of speed.
There they were, a man wearing a white coat and a platinum-blonde
woman.
Asmodeus smiled brightly.

['Demon King of Salvation', looks like we were fated to cross paths in this
manner.]

The Demon King of Salvation'. The object of his grudge was now standing
right in front of his eyes. However, the man didn't seem to be flustered at
all.

"I didn't come here to fight, Asmodeus."

[That's not something for you to decide. Because…]

"You need the syllable [Gru], right?"

[…!!]

"Killing me and taking away [Gru] is an option, sure. However, I have a
more interesting offer. Do you want to hear it?"

Asmodeus formed a dazed expression for a bit, before making his reply.

[It's already quite amusing that you are making me an offer, yet it's also
supposed to be interesting, too? Now I want to hear about it more than
ever.]

Asmodeus's voice was thickly dyed in excitement and madness already. He
even sported an expression that said he was seriously weighing the pros and
cons of devouring the tasty prey right in front of his eyes, or an even more
delicious potential prey later on.

He then continued on.

[However, if I don't find your offer interesting, then you will…]
"I'm not the only one with the syllable [Gru] on this island."

Another owner of [Gru]?

Asmodeus's expression shifted once more.

[Could it be…?]

"If we're participating in the 'Great War of Saints and Demons', we should
start acting more seriously now, don't you agree?"

The reflection of Kim Dokja in the eyes of Asmodeus was grinning like a
true Demon King at that moment.

"Are you interested in Archangel hunting?"
             Chapter 365: Ep. 69 - Archangel Hunting, I


'It's no fun when no one is fighting back'.

Michael stared at the corpses strewn about the field while smoking a rolled
tobacco. Ash-grey smoke mushroomed up in the air. This cigarette was
manufactured by the second generation of craftsmen. The reason why
Michael enjoyed hunting demons or going on a 'business' trip was because
he got to smoke the cigarettes he liked so much, to his heart's content.

In <Eden>, smoking was an 'evil', a sin.

Michael smoked through several cigarettes in a row and as he fell into a
chain of thought, stubbed it out by rubbing it against the exposed flesh of a
dead corpse.

'Have I taken too long?'

「What do you mean, too long? It's only just begun.」
Michael heard the voice reverberating within his head and frowned deeply.
'Shut up'.

「Hurry, wake me up. Unshackle me already.」

Michael pulled out a new cigarette.

He had been hearing this particular Story's voice for a long time. And
whenever he did, Michael simply had to burn through more cigarettes, one
after the other.

'Now isn't the time'.

Michael took another long drag of the rising smoke.

[Nebula <Eden> has issued a new revelation.]




[Archangel hunting, is it? It does sound rather interesting.]

Asmodeus grinned brightly to reveal two rows of pearly-white teeth after
hearing my offer.

[It's not just any other Archangel, but the 'Saviour of the Corrupted', too…
Are you being serious about this?]

"Of course."

[However, aren't you in a friendly relationship with <Eden>? If you do
something like this, won't you end up as their enemy?]

"Doesn't matter. I'm a Demon King, after all."
Even if I didn't mean it, I still had to say it out loud. Because… I'm trying
to convince none other than Asmodeus here. And the Demon King himself
seemed to be seriously agonising over my suggestion at the moment.

"Do give it careful consideration. You need the syllable [Gru], right? On
top of that, you'll be able to earn a Story concerning an Archangel, too.
「The One who Hunted Down a Great Archangel」… Doesn't the thought
alone excite you?"

Unfortunately, Asmodeus wasn't to be swayed that easily. No, rather than
that, he was shooting me a probing gaze as if to ascertain what my true
intentions were.

I decided to throw an even bigger bait at this juncture. "Well, that's
disappointing. As a member of the 'Gourmet Association', I figured that
you'd be different from other Constellations."

Asmodeus's long, slender brows quivered noticeably after hearing my
words.

[Your understanding of the Demon King, 'Asmodeus', has increased by a
great deal.]

[Your understanding of the applicable individual is quite high.]

[2nd Stage of 'Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint' has activated!]

Now that's the first time I heard such a message.

Finally, the skill level of the [Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint] had risen up
high enough to let me take a peek at the inside of selected Constellations.
And right afterwards, I could hear Asmodeus's inner thoughts.

「He's utterly, hatefully arrogant, this 'Demon King of Salvation'.」
His inside was like a thick, sticky swamp. Listening to the private thoughts
of a being looking back at me with a pair of quietly withdrawn eyes was
making me feel rather uncomfortable.

His thoughts continued on.

「A trap that I want to fall into this badly, is it…」

As expected, it wasn't for nothing that Asmodeus had climbed up to the
position of the 'Candidate for the future Great Demon King'. He had already
figured out that my offer was a trap.

「It's likely that the target of the 'Demon King of Salvation' is the 'Saviour
of the Corrupted'.」

「And he wants to use me and other Constellations to hunt down Michael
and steal the 'Modifier Necklace' afterwards.」

「It's commendable that he's using his brain so much, but well, it's a bit
irritating to pretend that I fell for his schemes, isn't it.」

Asmodeus's expression gradually changed into an icy one. Unsurprisingly,
it seemed that this much convincing wasn't going to be enough.

「Michael is a difficult angel to fight against, even when he's being
restrained by the Probability of the 2nd generation…」

Asmodeus's conflicting thoughts were gradually finding their heading now.
A faint killing intent seemed to ooze out from his long nails.

I could sense Anna Croft next to me tense up and get into her battle mode.
Maybe, she used the [Precognition] and saw something that was about to
happen.
However, I wasn't worried in the slightest. Because it was about time that a
situation even her [Precognition] couldn't have predicted began, that was
why.

Like clockwork, Asmodeus's expression became rather weird.

「…Mm?」

The demon's briefly-hardened expression shifted into one filled with
complicated emotions. His eyes danced around as if he was reading
something in the empty air.

And so, how much time passed by like this? Countless emotions flitted in
and out of Asmodeus's eyes before they finally landed back on me.

[Fufufu. Well, this is… It's so hard to figure out the will of the <Star
Stream> sometimes, you know.]

"…What do you mean by that?"

[I was just talking to myself. Very well. I accept your offer. Let's try out
this Archangel hunting thing, then.]

Asmodeus's announcement caused Anna Croft's eyes to go completely
round in shock. She then formed a puzzled expression next.

Completely disregarding her, the Demon King smacked his lips and
concentrated on sending a message to someone somewhere. He was
probably busy communicating with other 'Seekers of the End' right about
now. And at the same time, a message from a certain someone entered my
head.

「(Did I do well?)」

'You did. Thank you, Sangah-ssi'.
The reason why Asmodeus changed his mind? He probably read a certain
'revelation' just now. More specifically, the fake 'revelation' Yoo Sangah
and I had cooked up and spread around, that was.

It said, 「The corrupted Archangel will die by the sword of a 'Swordmaster'
on the island of the aged Forgotten People.」




"…Another revelation was made??"

The Bureau was also turned upside down by the news of a new revelation.
The first place to be affected by this was the sales department.

"Sir, we have a sudden spike in the sale of the Swordmaster-related skills!"

"Replenish their stock immediately! Call the related subcontractors and tell
them to speed up the output of the mass production-type Stigma!"

"B-but, even then, our stock is running low, sir!!"

"Damn it… Where did all the Story manufacturers disappear to?! Ah??
Who was it again? Right, if we request the 'Mass Production Maker',
then…"

In the meantime, Bihyung was quietly observing the developing situation
from within this crucible of confusion and chaos. The Great Dokkaebi
'Baram' addressed him from the side.

[Bihyung, you should start a new scenario.]

"…I've already done so, sir."
A new message was floating up on the scenario observation screen that
flickered into life just then.

[Sub-scenario, 'Archangel hunting', has commenced!]

Soon, the sight of the Constellations hiding within the forest and the plains
rushing somewhere en masse showed up on screen. They had all purchased
Swordmaster-related Stories from the [Dokkaebi Bag] just now.

"Will it be fine to open a scenario like this one, sir? Surely, <Eden> would
strongly oppose this."

[We have already obtained the Scribe's consent. He said that it doesn't
really matter. We've already compensated them, so there's no need to hold
back.]

"To think, he'd allow one of his angels to be used as the subject of a
scenario… That doesn't sound like what the leader of the Absolute Good
would do."

[That's how the 'Absolute Good' operates. For the sake of the Greater Good,
they would trample on smaller Good every now and then.]

"I'm aware of that, sir. But lately, it's becoming harder for me to understand
them."

[Regarding?]

"Just what are <Eden> and the Demon Realm thinking? Them agreeing to
go ahead with the 'Great War of Saints and Demons' scenario, and…
Wouldn't they all perish together if they do this?"

Baram stared at Bihyung with unreadable eyes before forming a smirk.

[There is a saying about how short life is, but 'art' would go on forever.]

"That's a saying from Earth, isn't it, sir?"
[Correct. Those are words that exalt the story's eternal nature. But, you
should be aware of this – such a notion is false. Even the greatest Story will
die sooner or later. It's just that, compared to the length of a Story's
lifespan, a human's life is simply far too short, that is all.]

Baram's voice seemed to contain the regrets of an innumerable length of
time. Indeed, those words belonged to a Dokkaebi that had continuously
told the tales of Constellations for a truly long time.

[Did you know? Once upon a time, stories with no distinction between
good and evil didn't exist within <Star Stream>.]

"Yes, I know."

[But, what about now?]

Screams from the Constellations killed by Michael's blade could be heard
coming from the screen. And there were other Constellations silently
peeping at this battle.

These Constellations were sponsoring someone else, they were busy
swearing at others, or were fully enjoying the show. Coins exchanged
hands, and cries of pleasure and despair continued to resound out.

And within this spectacle, not one person seemed to care about either good
or evil.

"Ah…"

As he spat out that short gasp, Bihyung finally understood the Great
Dokkaebi's wisdom. Baram addressed his junior once more.

[This is a war to stop them from disappearing.]
For the next two days, Anna Croft and I prepared for the hunt. Asmodeus
didn't act with us, though.

[Let us meet again on the hunting ground at midday, two days from now.]

He left those words behind and disappeared on us. I was pretty sure that the
Demon King was getting ready to hunt down an angel in his own way.

There were around 30 minutes left until midday. The promised location for
our Archangel hunting was the 'Fertile Forest' located on the north of the
island.

Just before we reached our destination, Anna Croft threw me a question.
"Do you really think we can pull this off?"

"You're going to help me out, aren't you?"

"Even if it's me, I can't predict the [Future] all the time. You already know
this better than anyone."

"It's fine to read the nearest future for the time being."

What I needed to avoid were the unseen variables that might happen in the
near future. And Anna Croft's [Precognition] was the most suitable skill for
avoiding such things.

"…What will you do if I decide to betray you? If my target is you, then…"

"I know that's not the case."

From the get-go, I couldn't have been her target. Why? Because she was
inserted into the scenario way before me.

She narrowed her eyes to a slit and asked me again. "…By the way, since
when did you stop using polite speech to address me?"
"Oh, now that I think about it, you're right… Should I address you with
polite speech again, Ma'am?"

"You're being a jerk right now, so please, just stop."

"Ah, right. How many times can you use [Precognition] today, young
miss?"

Anna Croft glared at me with a dumbfounded expression, before making
her reply. "Three times."

"Don't use them unnecessarily, and activate them only after I give you the
signal."

"Why should I listen to…"

"You should listen, so we can finish this shitty scenario for good."

From afar, we could hear the screams of the Constellations and
Incarnations. The hunting had begun already. Along with the horrifying
explosions, the oppressive voice of the aloof, proud Archangel rocked the
entire forest.

[You dare to use me as the subject matter for a scenario??]

Anna Croft and I hid in the nearby bushes and observed the battleground.

We couldn't spot Asmodeus anywhere yet. Instead of him, though, almost
all the participants still remaining on 'Middle Island No.3' had gathered here
in the 'Fertile Forest'.

Most of them just so happened to be 'Evil' or 'Neutral'-type Constellations.
There were many Historical-grade Constellations, and I even spotted a
lower-ranked Demon King, too.

It was 'Darkness of no Value' Belial, from the 68th Demon Realm. He
must've shown up here after heeding Asmodeus's call. Not just him, but
other Constellations were each carrying a longsword of the 2nd generation
at the moment.

[Attack him!!]

Michael watched the Constellations rushing towards him with Belial in the
lead and fumed in pure rage.

[A measly little lower-ranked Demon King dares to… You all must've gone
mad as a group!]

The Archangel used a stupendously powerful wind pressure to blow Belial
away, and activated his Status to generate a barrier of winds. However,
there were some who managed to break past the barrier to still take shots at
him.

[Constellation, 'Hard-work Specialist', has activated the skill,
'Massproduced Physical Sword Aura'!]

The exact same skill was activated simultaneously from the longswords
held by the participants. Waves of yellow, or even blue, coloured sword
auras physically manifesting themselves sliced past Michael's Status and
advanced forward. The Archangel formed a mocking grin.

[…Ether Blade? What a crazy bunch of fools.]

The revelation I leaked to the world through Yoo Sangah was fake. Without
a doubt, no 'Swordmaster' out there would be capable of killing Archangel
Michael. However, just because it was a 'fake' revelation, that didn't mean it
was complete rubbish with no odds of coming true, either.

Ch-ch-ch-ch-cheut!!

[Probability of the 2nd generation has granted a powerful buff effect on the
applicable skills!]
The [Physical Sword Aura] was currently being ridiculed as an exclusive
skill of the Transcendents. However, there was a period of time in the past
when the 2nd generation viewed it as the greatest skill ever.

[It's working! Keep cutting him down!!] Chi-

eeek!

Michael's wind barrier began melting away gradually from the continual
baptism of the sword auras. He got flustered and tried to activate a new
Story, but then, a jet-black light of Ether suddenly sliced down from the air.

Sliiiice!!

Like magic, space separated, as if it had been sliced away in its entirety.
Only the lengthy claw mark left behind by a Demon King was visible from
the gaps of the crumbling barrier.

[I always wondered whether an Archangel without wings can fly or not.]

Michael's torn wing moved with great difficulty in the air. Through the
falling feathers, Asmodeus's smiling mug revealed itself to the world.

[And I finally got my answer today. The wing's existence is not related to
the
Archangel's ability to fly.]

[…Asmodeus!!]

Taken over by his rage, Michael poured out his magical energy towards the
Demon. Unfortunately, he couldn't aim at his target properly after his
balance was affected due to the damage to his Incarnation body. He began
wasting his energy, instead.

On the other hand, Asmodeus used other Constellations to diligently pile on
further injuries to Michael.
As expected of Asmodeus; I couldn't help but marvel at this battle.

"We should get going. That Demon King might end up snatching away our
Myth-grade Story at this rate."

"No, it's not the time yet, ma'am."

My relaxed voice caused a flustered expression to form on Anna Croft's
face. As long as she didn't use up her [Precognition] allowance for today,
she'd never have guessed what was about to transpire soon.

[Story, 'Evil that Destroys Evil', has begun its storytelling.]

Pitch-black aura suddenly began gathering around Michael's figure and
enveloped him like some kind of a bud. It was hard to believe that such
corrupted energy actually belonged to an Archangel.

「And the 'Good' has chosen to walk the path of 'Evil' in order to destroy
other 'Evil'.」

Constellations realized that something ominous was about to happen and
they continued to pour out their barrage of powerful attacks, but too bad,
they failed to scratch that black bud even once.

Instead, it seemed to suck in nutrients by absorbing the power of the
surroundings, and slowly began blooming itself.

[Archangel Michael has become corrupted!]

While witnessing this overwhelming spectacle, I recalled a certain part of
'Ways of Survival' in my head.

「Not every Constellation of this world was divided into 'Constellations'
and 'Demon Kings'. There is just one creature, an existence that could use
the powers of a Constellation as well as a Demon King at the same time.」
The sole being within the lengthy history of <Eden> who ate the [Star Relic
Fruit]…

「No demon shall survive upon witnessing his true appearance.」 Ku-

gugugugu!!

"…Oh, my god," whispered Anna Croft.

Something was waking up from within the pitch-black darkness.

First, a black pair of wings. And then, the horns signifying a Demon King.

[Demon King, 'King of Corrupted Angels', is scanning the battlefield.]

The so-called 'King of Corrupted Angels' – that was Archangel Michael's
Modifier after he transformed into a Demon King.

Kuwaaaaaah-!!

With a simple flick of its hand, all Constellations leaning towards 'Evil'
were swept away clean. Even if they were seemingly on the same 'Evil' side
now, the difference in their classes was simply on another realm altogether.
This was the true power of Michael, an Archangel on the level of a Myth-
grade.

Even Asmodeus was forming a hardened expression now.

[This… wasn't in the revelation.]

Soon after, Michael's Status rained down, and several Demon Kings were
flung away helplessly. The body of Asmodeus's Incarnation must've
received a tremendous amount of damage, because he too, began faltering
about.

That was when I stood up from my spot.
"It's time."

"You want to join the battle now?!"

"Yes."

"…Didn't you see what happened just now? Even if your target is that
Archangel, this is…"

"What made you think that my target is the 'Archangel'?"

After hearing my question, Anna Croft could only blink her eyes in sheer
dumbfoundedness. Her [Eye of the Great Demon] began burning up in a
reddish hue.

"C-can it be…??"

We could see Asmodeus's body being flung away like a puppet with its
strings cut in the distance.

From the get-go, I wasn't planning to face off against the Corrupted
Archangel. And besides, he wasn't the only one possessing a Myth-grade
Story.

[Your targetted Modifier is 'Devil of Lust and Wrath'.]

I unsheathed my sword as the message popped up in the air and spoke to
her.

"Well, let's go and get ourselves a Myth-grade Story, shall we?"
            Chapter 366: Ep. 69 - Archangel Hunting, II


Anna Croft and I moved towards the battlefield right away.

Completely lost to madness now, Michael was ripping apart every single
Constellation and Incarnation near him to bloody shreds.

The 'Evil' born only to destroy 'Evil'.

After transforming into a Corrupted Angel, just Michael's combat prowess
alone would not lose out to that of Poseidon or Hades.

[Quite a few Constellations are paying more attention to the situation
unfolding on the 'Middle Island No.3'.]

[Constellation, 'Demon-like Judge of Fire', is looking at you with worried
eyes.]
Those Constellations who had either already made their way into the 'Main
Island', or hadn't participated in the 'Great War of Saints and Demons',
began shifting their gazes in this direction now.

After we reached the edge of Michael's firing range, Anna Croft spoke to
me. "Getting any closer than this will be dangerous. My [Covert
Operations] skill can only…"

I reached out and grasped her wrist.

[Story, 'Pebble and I', has begun its storytelling!]

[Story, 'Pebble and I', is puzzled by the existence of 'Anna Croft'.]

"Take care of this woman, as well."

[Story, 'Pebble and I', is looking at you with a slightly dissatisfied
expression.]

[Story, 'Pebble and I', has assimilated 'Anna Croft' into its effect.]

With that, we bravely ran through the battlefield. Michael and the other
Constellations didn't sense our presence at all. Most likely, we looked like a
pair of pebbles rolling around on the ground or some such.

Anna Croft asked me with a shocked voice. "What is up with this Story??"

"It's a Story for turning into a pebble."

Since we didn't have time, I replied to her like that.

Corpses of Constellations littered the pathways of the battlefield. Every
now and then, we spotted still-breathing ones, too. Such as the Demon King
from the 68th Demon Realm, 'Darkness of no Value', Belial.
After suffering from Michael's attacks, he was barely holding on as Stories
continued to leak out from his body. Wait, now that I thought about it, this
dude was also aiming for me, wasn't he?

Stab!

I oh-so-calmly sunk my Unbroken Faith in his body next.

[You have eliminated the 68th Demon Realm's Demon King!]

[Applicable Demon King is of a lower ranking than you are, and there is no
change to the ranking.]

[You have acquired the [Modifier Necklace], 'Darkness of no Value'.]

[You have murdered a fifth Demon King Incarnation Body.]

[Possibility of a new Attribute is opening up to you!]

"But, aren't you a Demon King yourself?! Can you actually kill them like
that??"

"Well, I'll just give up being a Demon King, then."

Anna Croft heard my perfectly-composed glib reply and formed a
dumbfounded expression.

Ku-gugugugu!!

We heard the noises of Michael's Status flooding out right behind us. If the
Probability of the 2nd generation was slightly weaker, the entire forest
would've been blown away by that power already.

"We don't have much time left, so let's hurry. Asmodeus should be in a state
similar to this guy."
The forest's path near our position was decorated by the fallen fragments of
a
Demon King's Stories. These traces belonged to a much-higher ranked
Demon King, one that couldn't be compared to Belial. You didn't have to be
a genius to figure out who they belonged to.

We brushed past the bushes for a bit until finally discovering a figure of a
person leaning against the foot of a tall, ancient tree.

[…So, you did show up.]

As if he knew that I'd show up, Asmodeus was waiting for me with a smile
on his face.

An arm and a leg of his Incarnation Body were cut off and missing; his
chest area had been crushed as well, and he was truly hanging precariously
on his last breaths.

[To think that Michael possessed the authority of 'Corrupted'… you knew
that from the beginning, didn't you?]

Asmodeus formed an expression of someone who had realized everything
now.

[And you're going to take away my necklace.]

"Correct."

Asmodeus's overturned [Modifier Necklace] gleamed brightly. If I took a
hold of all the words on that necklace, the Demon King should be kicked
out of the ongoing 'Great War of Saints and Demons'.

[In that case, you should hurry up.]

Asmodeus's Incarnation Body belonged to a girl of around sixteen years of
age. Even if this body died, Asmodeus's real self wouldn't die.
However, that body would die for real. And it… she, was the daughter of
Manager Han Myungoh.

"I won't kill you. Instead, let's make a trade."

[Trade? You want to trade after coming this far?]

"Kindly hand over a Myth-grade Story to me. Then, I won't eliminate you
from this scenario."

Asmodeus broke out into a loud peal of laughter before vomiting out a
mouthful of blood.

[Now that is a rather amusing notion. Are you threatening me right now?]

"I am."

For a brief moment there, palpable tension flowed between the Demon
King and I. Asmodeus glared at me, but the light in his eyes seemed to
contain a faint trace of resignation.

[You have become a true 'Demon King' now, haven't you. No one in the 72
seats would be able to deny that you're a true Demon King.]

"Thanks for the compliment."

[However, there is a problem with your offer. Your target is me, so with
what method will you not kick me out?]

"If you don't lose all of your words, you don't get eliminated from the
scenario. I'll leave you with one word remaining."

The word I was planning to leave behind was 'Of', which was something I
already had as a spare. Asmodeus spoke back.

[I'm so thankful that I might cry now.]
I extended my hand towards his [Modifier Necklace]. Syllables
began flowing out one by one from the item next. [Modifier syllable,
'Lu' has been acquired.]

[Modifier syllable, 'St' has been acquired.]

[Modifier syllable, 'And' has been acquired.]

[Modifier syllable, 'Wra' has been acquired.]

…

When around half of the syllables came my way, Asmodeus spoke up while
glancing at my own Modifier. No, more specifically, he must've been
looking at the 'Tion' of my Modifier.

[Now that I take a look from up close, your Modifier truly is a tempting
one.]

I quickly hid the [Modifier Necklace] under my clothes and replied.

"Don't try to kill Michael, and just try to steal one word from him. If it's
you, it should be more than doable, right?"

[Just one word, is it… Are you perchance speaking of this one?]

It was at that moment that a certain necklace held in his still-fine hand
caught my eyes.

[Hunter of Grudges]

His 'targeted necklace' with all of the words completed began emitting a
bright glow.

[Demon King, 'Devil of Lust and Wrath', has attained the scenario clear
condition!]
[Transmission to the next scenario has begun.]

I reflexively took a look at my own Modifier necklace. It still said
[Demon King of Salvation]. Meaning, that 'Gru' didn't come from mine.
[I knew that this was a trap the moment Michael became corrupted.]
…No way, during such a short window?

The transmission to the next scenario began and Asmodeus's Incarnation
Body slowly dispersed before my eyes.

[Did you really think that I wouldn't have made contingency plans for a
situation like this one?]

From the onset, Asmodeus fought Michael for the express purpose of
acquiring the syllable [Gru], nothing more. I belatedly reached out towards
the Demon King, but things were already beyond my ability to interfere
now.

[I pray you good fortune, 'Demon King of Salvation'. Because… you too
also need to collect just one more 'word' from now on.]

Accompanied by a brilliant flash of light, Asmodeus's body disappeared
from the spot. And the only things I had with me were those Modifier
words that he left behind.

[De□ of Lust and Wrath]

God damn it, why did it have to be [Vil]…?

I underestimated Asmodeus, didn't I? I turned my head around to find Anna
Croft glaring daggers at me.

"What about the promise with m…"

"Shh."
I reflexively placed my finger on my lips. Something felt off. Up until only
a few seconds ago, the whole forest was awash with the chaotic screaming,
but it was just too damn quiet now.

…As if all lifeforms had been killed off within the area.

Just as all the leaves and blades of grass in our surroundings stood up, so
did the hair on my skin. I almost instinctively shouted out.

"Activate [Precognition], now!"

Her [Eye of the Great Demon] glowed in a bright crimson colour. Then,
Anna Croft grabbed me and broke into a desperate sprint. After dashing
over a hundred meters in an instant, she took a quick look behind her. I, too,
was staring at the same spectacle as her.

Kuwah-aaaaah!!

The spot we were in only a moment ago was now being enveloped in a
gigantic explosion. A purple-coloured half-dome reminiscent of a barrier
collapsed in on itself in the blink of an eye and destroyed everything
trapped within.

That was the [Judgement Field], the ability to destroy everything that could
only be earned through 'Corruption'.

Anna Croft spoke in a despairing voice. "There's too much noise and I can't
see the future!"

"No need to see everything. You just need to read Michael's attack
patterns."

"You still wish to fight him? If we use that 'let's become pebbles' Story or
some such, we can surely escape from…"

"Didn't you see that guy attacking even the stones on the ground just now?"
The Archangel hell-bent on killing me was walking out of the crater where
purple-coloured smoke was rising up. Michael's Story, now triggered by the
[Fruit of Good and Evil], was controlling his entire being. The Corrupted
Archangel had already lost half of his reasoning.

[Demon King… of… Sal… vation…]

His powerful voice roused up all the goosebumps on my skin just by
hearing it from afar.

"…Yup, he's definitely not sane at the moment."

"Damn it, this is all your fault!!"

"Let's go with Plan B."

"Plan B? You haven't even told me about that yet!"

"I'm trying to come up with it n…"

I couldn't finish my sentence. Raging storm winds crashing in blew Anna
Croft away to a distance, that's why. Right after that, I saw Michael's large,
hulking frame rush towards me in a frightening turn of speed.

['Demon King Transformation' has been activated!]

Along with cracking noises, my body began changing; a pair of jet-black
wings and the horns of a Demon King rose up from my back and my head.
Thanks to the Probability of the 2nd generation, my own Status had been
strengthened further, as well. Of course, it'd still be a dog's death trying to
fight him with only this much Status, though.

[Attribute, 'Scenario Interpreter', has been activated.]

However, it wasn't me who would be facing off against this guy.
[Giant Story, 'Demon Realm's Spring', has begun its storytelling!] [Giant

Story, 'Torch that Swallowed the Myth', has begun its storytelling!]

Indeed, it would be the 'Stories' that I had earned so far.

KWA-BOOM!!!

The 「Demon Realm's Spring」 loaded up on my left hand collided with
Michael's own left fist. Almost at the same time, the holy flames of the
Torch burning on Unbroken Faith aimed for the Corrupted Archangel's
body.

[Giant Story, 'Torch that Swallowed the Myth', is crying out in enjoyment!]

Michael was instantly shocked by what happened and quickly retreated
while contorting his body.

The power of the 'Giant Stories' was truly amazing. To think, they were
able to face off against that frightening monster, even if he had been
restricted currently by the shackles of the Probability of the 2nd
generation. Indeed, it was not a waste of time to train under Yoo Hoseong
earlier. [Story, 'Evil that Destroys Evil', has begun its storytelling!]

[Giant Story, 'Eden's Demon', has begun its storytelling!]

Unfortunately, I wasn't the only one who possessed a powerful Story.

Kugugugugu-!!

The incredible pressure emitted with Michael as its center caused all my
Stories to gasp out in pain. My Status was not quite enough to fight face to
face with this Archangel, as it turned out.

[Giant Story, 'Torch that Swallowed the Myth', is roaring out in vexation.]
Sorry about that. If only I was a little stronger, you wouldn't have to hold
yourself back like this. Soon afterwards, a fearsome strike flew in and I
received an incredible, stomach-churning impact.

[Giant Story, 'Torch that Swallowed the Myth', is protecting you.]

[Giant Story, 'Demon Realm's Spring', is protecting you.]

[Story, 'King of a Kingless World', is protecting you.]

[Story, 'One who Opposes the Miracle', is protecting you.]

…

My Stories were dealing with the Archangel's attacks in my stead. For a
brief moment there, several thoughts brushed past my brain.

What if I used [Hell of Eternity]?

What if I activated [Electrification] and [Way of the Wind] simultaneously?

Awaken [Bookmarks] and call upon other characters?

No matter what I thought of, I just couldn't see a clear way out of this. So,
did that mean I only have that method left? But, I so wanted to avoid
ending up in that pathetic state again.

Michael took large strides to come closer as I vomited out a bucketful of
blood and backed away. He must've decided to end this right now, as
purplecoloured aura was oozing out from one of his hands.

Soon, a purple-coloured half-dome was generated within my surroundings.
There it was, the Stigma that couldn't be cancelled once activated – the
judge that punishes all 'Evil', [Judgement Field], was spreading out around
me.
It looked as if my punishment would be in the form of compression to
death.

"…Michael."

However, did he know this small fact? That I'd been waiting for him to
activate that Stigma of his?

"No, hang on… Corrupted Angel 'Lucifer'."

[Demon King, 'King of Corrupted Angels', hates that name!]

Originally, Lucifer was one of the main players that was supposed to lead
the 'Great War of Saints and Demons' to its conclusion.

「No 'Evil' in this world can defeat the 'King of Corrupted Angels'.」

This 'Evil' grew even stronger when confronting other 'Evil'. And
eventually, this monster would swallow up all 'Evil' out there. Heck, even a
highranking Demon King within the top 10 positions wouldn't be able to
kill this guy. Because he'd become the strongest existence in this world
while fighting against 'Evil'.

「However, what would happen if his opponent was not 'Evil'?」

All incredible power had a corresponding price to pay; while looking at the
[Judgement Field] that was only around ten or so meters away from me, I
reached into my inner pocket.

What I pulled out was a single apple – the [Star Relic Fruit] that I received
from the 'Scribe of Heaven' just before 'Gigantomachia' went underway.
"Hey, don't you miss the taste of this thing?"

Michael's eyes began to quake rather noticeably now. He should be able to
recognise this apple, because he too, had consumed this fruit once before.
"When an angel eats a [Fruit of Good and Evil], it'd go through [Demon
King Transformation]. But, if a Demon King eats this fruit, what will
happen?"

I could see the flustered Michael hurriedly extend his hand out.

Sorry, but it's too late now.

Just before the [Judgement Field] crushed my body…

…With a crunch, I took a bite out of the [Fruit of Good and Evil].
            Chapter 367: Ep. 69 - Archangel Hunting, III


This was a part of an ancient memory.

– Scribe, for how long am I supposed to repeat this war? A war that
doesn'thave any victors…

The times when he threw that question out, or how many times he asked it
– he couldn't recall them.

– Michael, there's no need to ponder too deeply about this.

The Metatron of his memories would always return the exact same smile.
For several hundreds of years, or maybe even for thousands of years.

Metatron continued to carry that grin from the far side of time that Michael
couldn't even remember anymore.

– Please, focus on hating the 'Evil' in front of your eyes, instead. That is
your'scenario'.
'…My scenario.

Just how long have I been hunting down the demons?'

Michael, for a long time now, could no longer remember his birth.

[The power of 'Fruit of Good and Evil' is going berserk.]

His memories were always incorrect, incomplete. All he could remember
were the final words of the Demon Kings dying at his hands.

– How lamentable, oh, the pitiful disciple of <Eden>. Do you really need
togo this far?

That was from the master of the 21st Demon Realm.

– Uwahahahaha!! You are now the same as us! Finally, Metatron has
gonemad!!

And that was from the master of the 9th Demon Realm.

– Which 'number' Michael are you?

And finally, from the lips of the master of the 4th Demon Realm.

Past the faces of the Demon Kings with names he'd forgotten, he could see
the dead Archangels, his companions, that fought alongside him.

– Michael, you must regain yourself. Please… This, this is wrong.

An Angel and a Demon, that's what he was.

Faces breaking down like debris scattered away in tens of thousands of
puzzle pieces, before gathering back together to create one giant form.
'Good' and 'Evil', in conflict against each other for eternity itself. And
Metatron's face, the one who had managed to endure all those years,
continued to carry the exact same smile for thousands of years.

– You need to be careful about one thing. When using this power, you
mustnever…

[The power of 'Fruit of Good and Evil' is going berserk!]

All of his memories were swept away in one go; Michael was enveloped in
horrifying pain akin to his head being ripped to tiny shreds.

Aaaaaaaaah-!!!!

All 'Good' in the world cried out in sorrow. From the blades of grass to
trees; from small insects to every type of 'Good' living in Creation fell into
a state of sorrow and cried out in grief.

[You have directed a fatal attack at an opponent on the side of Absolute
Good!]

[Story, 'Evil that Destroys Evil', is roaring out in bitter sadness!]

[You have broken the taboo!]

[You have been handed a terrible penalty!]

A grey-coloured angel covered in blood was smiling at Michael.




The moment I bit into the [Fruit of Good and Evil], the view of the world
changed.

[You have consumed a forbidden 'Star Relic Fruit'.]
[You are currently a 'Demon King'.]

[The power of 'Fruit of Good and Evil' has whispered the secret of the
'Absolute Good' to you.]

As the ginormous storm of magical energy raged around me, my ears were
inundated by the continuous stream of messages.

[You have experienced all facets of 'Good and Evil'!]

[You have achieved an impossible feat!]

[You have acquired the Possibility of a brand new Story!]

[<Star Stream> is stunned by your accomplishment.]

[<Star Stream> is pondering what your second Modifier should be.]

I felt the sensations of being a Constellation, the one I couldn't feel for a
long time after becoming a Demon King, once more.

['Demon King Transformation' has been cancelled.]

[<Star Stream> has completely restored your constellation.]

I saw a beautifully sparkling star high up within the pitch-black sky above.
That was my star.

['Angel Transformation' is activating.]

My body began to glow brightly after receiving the starlight. The feathered
wings dyed in black morphed into pure white ones, and the demon's horns
growing on top of my head withered away. Warm, pure energy filled up the
entirety of my Incarnation Body.
Unfortunately, I wasn't permitted enough time to relaxedly enjoy the 'Status
of an Angel'. The [Judgement Field] had shrunk down around me and had
begun crushing my body.

Kwa-dudududuk!!

My new wings were crushed and folded as I felt this horrifying pain. My
arms and legs, that couldn't endure against the pressure of the compacting
space, got crushed helplessly.

[Giant Story, 'Torch That Swallowed the Myth', is protecting you.]

[Giant Story, 'Demon Realm's Spring', is protecting you.]

I was able to barely hold on against that enormous pressure, powerful
enough to almost crush me in an instant, with the aid of my Giant Stories.

['The Fourth Wall' is protecting your mental state!]

[Probability of 2nd generation is weakening the ability of 'the Fourth
Wall'!]

It felt like several bolts of lightning were going off in my head. I thought
that I'd blackout at any given moment, and my vision darkened before
reverting back a few times, too.

However, I endured. I simply had to. So that I could grasp that one and only
chance soon to be coming my way.

「As the price for being strong against 'Evil', the 'King of Corrupted
Angels' possesses one weakness.」

The power of the [Judgement Field] crushing and wringing my body was
gradually weakening. The only weakness of this frightening monster
capable of destroying all 'Absolute Evil', was…
「The 'King of Corrupted Angels' cannot attack an opponent leaning
towards the 'Good' spectrum.」

If he broke this rule and attacked 'Good', then…

Craaaaack!!

The absolute Stigma [Judgement Field], capable of crushing a Demon King
to death, began splintering into pieces. Like a moth escaping from its
cocoon, I destroyed this barrier and spread out my wings.

Michael squatted down on the ground and grasped his head with both of his
hands while screaming at the top of his lungs.

[Demon King, 'King of Corrupted Angels', is writhing in great pain!]

This was my only chance.

"Anna Croft!!"

As soon as my words resounded out in this forest, a blonde woman ran
towards the rear of Michael. Her eye was now dyed in that crimson hue.
She had seen something through [Precognition] and was now in full sprint
while unleashing all of her Status.

Meanwhile, I gathered my remaining strength into my two legs and dashed
forward as if I was falling over. Now, normally, killing Michael with only
this much combined firepower was impossible, even if he had been
rendered defenseless like right now.

However, the story would be different while we were on this island.

[Character, 'Anna Croft', has activated 'Physical Sword Aura Lv.9'!]
As if we had a prior agreement, she unleashed several strands of powerful
energy from the tip of her shortsword like clockwork. I unsheathed
Unbroken Faith with my tattered right arm.

[Fragment of a Story, 'Right Arm of a Pitiful Sword Master', has activated!]

I had no clue that a Story acquired through the special attribute of
[Lamarck's Giraffe] once upon a time would come in handy like this.

[Probability of 2nd generation has reinforced your aptitude!]

The explosive magical energy of [Purest Sword Force] extended by over
tenplus meters from the tip of Unbroken Faith.

I managed to barely hold the sword level as it sunk about half-way into the
left side of Michael's neck. Almost at the same time, Anna Croft's
shortsword sliced into the right of his neck.

A fountain of blood shot up into the air and Michael's severed head flew up.
[You have killed the 176th Incarnation Body of 'King of the Corrupted
Angels'.]

[You have acquired a Myth-grade Story.]

[<Star Stream> is stunned by your accomplishment!]

[You have brought the 'Fake Revelation' to reality.]

[You have achieved an unbelievable accomplishment!]

[You have acquired an ungradable Story.]

[You have acquired the Story, 'Architect of Revelation'!]

As the stream of messages cascaded down, my barely-maintained
consciousness finally let go and scattered away.
When I reopened my eyes, I found myself all alone within a white space. A
single sentence was floating up in the empty air.

「The being who consumed the 'Fruit of Good and Evil' will face the truth
he had been avoiding.」

'…Where am I?'

Before I had a chance to ask that, images suddenly popped up on the
lefthand sidewall. Those were scenes from 'Ways of Survival'.

It depicted Yoo Joonghyuk and his companions clearing out various
scenarios. That was the world of 'Ways of Survival' where I didn't exist.
The companions who didn't buckle under all sorts of hardships and
continued to defeat their enemies… existed there.

['Fruit of Good and Evil' speaks to you. 'That story was your life, wasn't
it?'] I nodded my head. Indeed, that story was my life. I grew up while
reading those events.

['Fruit of Good and Evil' speaks to you. 'However, this is also definitely
your life, too'.]

The right-hand sidewall rippled and a new screen appeared there. It now
showed a boy, around 15 years old. He was looking at a computer monitor
while inputting something with the keyboard.

– What will happen to Joonghyuk next? Is he going to die again?

This was back when Yoo Joonghyuk was going through his 164th turn. I
was in the 3rd year of middle school, and in love with Lee Jihye back then.
And I was busy typing a comment.
– Argh… Really… I'd like to stop chomping on the sweet potatoes
now,please.

And then, when Yoo Joonghyuk was going through his 488th turn. I was in
the 2nd year of high school, around the same age as Kim Namwoon; again,
I was typing a comment within the screen.

…

…

…

As Yoo Joonghyuk went through more and more regressions, I too, grew
older and older. While reading about his deaths, my beard began sprouting.
I graduated from high school while spectating on his sacrifices.

And again, as I read his story…

– Wouldn't it be fine for him to just die during this turn, instead?

…Wait, did I ever write a comment like that before?

– The story is going down the drain, so maybe it's time to go back? see ya

Now, it was Yoo Joonghyuk's 662th turn.

I was a university student by then, still typing away on a keyboard.

– Joonghyuk is going to die again, yes?

The words I committed to record were in full display here. All those words
that I spat out under the excuse of being hurt by life and exhausted by living
itself, they were coming back inside my brain.

– Please, can you skip the earlier scenarios? It's getting repetitive.
…I couldn't say anything, not anymore.

['Fruit of Good and Evil' speaks to you. 'That is the total worth of the story
you told as if it was your entire life'.]

The tips of my fingers began trembling.

On the left wall, Yoo Joonghyuk and his battles; and on the right wall, there
was me, staring at Yoo Joonghyuk. And right in the middle wall, the scenes
of me glaring at the stars in the sky played out.

「"Enjoy the show while you can. The fee for your entertainment shall
become your lives in the end."」

['Fruit of Good and Evil' speaks to you. 'Do you really have the
qualification to tell ■■?']

My own words continued to float up above the screen.

「"Yoo Joonghyuk, I know the 'future you don't know'."」

「"Hey, Joonghyuk, we can save this world. You know this, right?"」

「"I'll finish your story in your stead."」

My voice, sounding so brazen and with not a speck of hesitation in it.

['Fruit of Good and Evil' speaks to you. 'You, who have deceived the entire
world by relying on the story only you know, and lived until now… Do you
possess the right to be saved?]

From some place deep in my chest, I thought I heard something break. The
whole world seemed to be shaking in my eyes.

['The Fourth Wall' is glaring at the 'Fruit of Good and Evil'!]
['Fruit of Good and Evil' is startled and is shrinking back.] Tch-

chuchuchuchut!!

A storm of Probability swept up my surroundings. As I stumbled and
faltered about, someone's voice cried out to me.

「(…Dokja-ssi! You need to move, now! Michael is still…!)」




After I opened my eyes again, I found myself leaning against a cavern wall.

"…I was going to abandon you if you didn't wake up in the next minute or
so."

A blonde woman was looking down at me. Bandages were tightly wrapped
around my belly and chest areas, and there were some crushed herbs
applied to my thigh that had suffered a penetration wound.

Warm liquid then flowed into my mouth. It tasted bitter, acrid.

I quickly regained my wits and after discovering the identity of the liquid,
nearly got scared out of them again. Because… Anna Croft had cut her
palm open to feed me her own blood. "What the hell are you…?!"

She used her other hand to calm me down and explained herself without a
hint of fluster.

"I possess the attribute [Elixir Maker]. My blood possesses the same
medicinal effects as all the elixirs I've consumed so far."

"…But, drinking a lot of this blood will place me under your control."
"That happens only when your Status is lower than mine."

She stemmed the blood flow from her palm and turned her head away.

It was nighttime already. I couldn't sense any presence or movements. I
sucked in several slow but deep breaths and asked her.

"What happened to Michael?"

"…He's dead. No, I'm not sure whether to call him dead or not…"

"By any chance, did his Incarnation Body get enshrouded in a blackish
fog?"

"…How did you know that?"

I wish I could explain to her, but this crippling pain assaulting my head
prevented me from easily recalling the contents of 'Ways of Survival'. I was
pretty sure that Michael wasn't dead. To be more specific, he did die, but
would revive again.

There were 'two moons' up in the sky outside the cavern, the symbol of
Stories from the 2nd generation. I must've drank a fair amount of her blood,
because under the pale blue light, Anna Croft's complexion was just as pale
and wane.

"Why didn't you abandon me and leave?"

"I thought that, by saving you, I'd earn a Story like [Prophet who Pays her
Debt] or some such."

She probably knew very well that such a Story wouldn't get created so
easily. Suddenly, I was overcome with this sense of rejection to this whole
idea in my head. The Anna Croft I knew was not like this. The woman I
knew was definitely a cold-blooded type of a person who, for the sake of
her cause, would not hesitate to sacrifice even her most precious
companion.

That was supposed to be the case, but…

"You should be able to move again in a few hours."

However, was the information I know of her, everything there was to know
about Anna Croft?

「Anna Croft is an Incarnation of 'Absolute Good'.」

…I couldn't be sure why I was thinking up such things. Maybe, it was
possible that I began thinking about lots more things after consuming the
[Fruit of Good and Evil].

I spoke as if I was sighing. "We should part ways around here. You must've
collected all the words necessary for your Modifier target, after all."

"It doesn't matter to me, but will you be fine?"

"Not sure who should be worried about who here. Even if you don't look
after me, let me assure you, I won't die. These injuries weren't severe
enough to kill me."

"No, if you were left alone, you would have been dead."

Not 'could have died', but 'dead', straight up. And I knew the precise
moments when Anna Croft would say something like that.

"But, you shouldn't have been able to see my future?"

"…Until recently, yes, I couldn't."

[Exclusive skill, 'Lie Detection Lv.7', has activated!]

[You have confirmed that the applicable assertion is the truth.]
"Starting from yesterday onwards, I could see little bits of your future.
Some 'things' past an indistinct, faint wall…" …She could see my future?

"What did you see?"

"…It'll be better if you don't know."

"Just say it."

Anna Croft's [Eye of the Great Demon] again emitted a crimson light. She
then spat out a soft sigh before slowly opening her lips.

"Twelve hours from now, you will die at the hands of the 'Supreme King',
Yoo Joonghyuk."
            Chapter 368: Ep. 69 - Archangel Hunting, IV


[You are a '1st turn' Regressor.]

The first time he chose to go back, he thought that he was given a great
opportunity – an opportunity to survive the scenarios by possessing more
information than everyone else.

[You are a '2nd turn' Regressor.]

When he chose to go back for the second time, he began thinking that this
life wouldn't be as easy as he thought.

And, after witnessing his companions die over and over again…

After losing the person he loved so much…

…He finally realized that he was destined to experience the same pain
many more times in the future. As the price for possessing more
information than anyone else, he had to lose his precious companions many
more times.

[You are a '3rd turn' Regressor.]

During his third try, he thought that maybe this was a curse.

「Just how many more lives like this one am I supposed to go through?」

He realized that, if he were to get to the end of all the scenarios, he needed
to kill off his emotions, that he must not live his life. And so, he decided to
become not 'Yoo Joonghyuk', but the 'Regressor', instead.

The fourth time, fifth… The timelines that he might've had experienced, but
a certain someone's unexpected words stopped him from regressing again.

–          Being able to regress at any time is the same as having no
meaning in'dying' anymore. However, there being no meaning in dying is
the same thing as the value of living disappearing, too.

–          Yoo Joonghyuk, you need to wake up. What I'm saying here is
that, don'tmistakenly believe that things will get better by repeating them
over and over again.

That was why Yoo Joonghyuk chose not to regress. He gave up on several
new 'lives' where he could've started off from a higher vantage point while
possessing more useful information than before.

[You have entered the 'Middle Island No.3'.]

Along with the blinding rays of light, he finally arrived on the 'Middle
Island No.3'. Participants who had arrived alongside him looked around and
murmured to themselves.

[What is this place?]
[Weren't we supposed to head straight to the 'Main Island'?]

Yoo Joonghyuk simply unsheathed his sword.

[Hidden scenario – 'Snatching Modifiers' has begun!]

And then, the slaughter began in earnest. The rampaging storm of
crimsoncoloured sword light sliced the heads of the Constellations off.
There was not one shred of hesitation in Yoo Joonghyuk's blade. He carved
out the hearts of the Incarnations and smashed apart the backs of the
escaping Constellations' heads.

[You have acquired a syllable from the Modifier of Constellation, 'Crow of
the Gloomy Sea at Night'.]

[You have acquired a syllable from the Modifier of Constellation,
'Beachfront Tactician'.]

There were a few supposedly-tough enemies here – enemies that would've
been difficult to fight against were he in the original 3rd turn of regression.
However, Yoo Joonghyuk was able to defeat them rather easily.

「The weakness of 'Birch Tree's Scorpion' is located below its tail.」

「You must attack the 'Sovereign of the Crescent Moon' repeatedly until
the starlight on his head fades away.」

The Yoo Joonghyuk of the original storyline wouldn't have known that
information. Indeed, he'd only get his hands on them after going through
the 4th, 5th, 100th, even 1000th regressions.

[You have acquired a syllable from the Modifier of Constellation, 'Birch
Tree's Scorpion'.]

[You have acquired a syllable from the Modifier of Constellation,
'Sovereign of the Crescent Moon'.]
The Yoo Joonghyuk of the 3rd turn knew all those information of the future
he hadn't yet lived already.

『Han Sooyoung – Records of the 1863rd turn (First)』

『Han Sooyoung – Records of the 1863rd turn (Last)』

It was all thanks to the records from the 1863rd turn in the distant future
that he might have gotten to experience if he lived as the story originally
intended for him.

"Fuuu…"

Less than a hour later, Yoo Joonghyuk's surrounding vicinity had become
deathly still.

Staaab!

He ended the life of the last remaining Constellation and continued to move
on. It wasn't just to quickly end this scenario, though.

After walking for a bit, he came across a battlefield soaked in blood.

'Fertile Forest'

He was greeted by the countless corpses of the Incarnation bodies. This
spectacle of slaughter seemed to be the handiwork of a certain someone.
While gathering the necessary Modifier syllables, Yoo Joonghyuk chased
after the direction of the slaughterer.

It didn't take him too long to discover a giant cocoon seemingly painted
entirely in a black hue. He knew right away what this thing was.

"…A monster created by <Eden>, is it."

It was none other than Michael's cocoon. It only appeared after the
Archangel was killed off by someone while he was in the middle of 'Demon
King Transformation'. Fairly soon, he'd gain a new life and emerge from
this shell.

…Just like how, after death, Yoo Joonghyuk would get to start his next
turn. If there was one difference, then it'd be with Michael losing a portion
of his memories whenever he came back to life.

The so-called 'Evil' created to eliminate 'Evil'. The existence of Michael
was the reason why Yoo Joonghyuk could never be friendly with <Eden>.

As the drizzling rain pelted down, Yoo Joonghyuk searched the vicinity of
the cocoon. Michael ended up in this state because someone managed to
defeat him.

Not too long afterwards, Yoo Joonghyuk discovered the fragments of
Stories belonging to a rather powerful Demon King. Someone did fight
Michael here and was gravely injured, it seemed.

The traces of these Stories glowed in brilliant white rays even within the
faint, blurry fog of rainwater. They belonged to a being Yoo Joonghyuk
was quite familiar with.

Shudder.

That was around when Michael's cocoon began to quake noticeably. It
emitted this gloomy, damp aura as its top began opening up.

Yoo Joonghyuk frowned deeply.

'Already?'

Dark emotions quickly permeated within the purple-coloured fog. Michael's
nude figure, reformed into a brand-new Incarnation Body, slowly revealed
itself inside the cocoon.
Yoo Joonghyuk got ready to escape from here.

[Demon King of… Sal… va… tion!]

Indeed, he'd have left this place were it not for those words. Yoo Joonghyuk
hesitated for a little bit, before approaching the half-open cocoon. Michael,
still not fully alive yet, lay in a defenseless sleep inside the shell.

Flash!

Michael's eyelids moved and shot wide open, and just as they did, so did
Yoo Joonghyuk's blade.

"You sleeping for a little while longer will be better for everyone."

Staaab!


His version of [Breaking the Sky Energy] penetrated straight into Michael's
heart. The still-weak Incarnation Body that hadn't activated either the
[Demon King Transformation] or [Angel Transformation] began to crumble
away from the Probability of 2nd generation.

Guuwaaaaah-!!

[You have killed the 177th Incarnation Body of 'King of the Corrupted
Angels'.]

Michael's cocoon rapidly shrunk down in size and reverted back to its
original status. He'd be reborn in the 178th Incarnation Body, then.

[Nebula, <Eden>, is displaying animosity towards your actions!]

[Constellation, 'Scribe of Heaven', is glaring at you.]

Yoo Joonghyuk faced off against the gaze falling from the sky and spoke.
"…I've told you this before, haven't I? I shall be the one to kill Kim Dokja.
Stop your unnecessary actions."

The sky didn't say anything else in return. Yoo Joonghyuk sheathed his
sword and his steps hurried after the trail of fragments scattered around the
forest.




After he disappeared into the forest's path, a small shadow revealed itself
next to Michael's cocoon. Bob-cut hair gently shook around below the
black raincoat's hoodie.

The master of the shadow grinned brightly after discovering all the items
discarded in the vicinity.

"Yup, a bus of the main character is the best one out there."

Han Sooyoung hurriedly shoved the items inside her pocket while giggling
happily to herself.

"In any case, that Regressor guy just doesn't understand the value of
items…"

[Constellation, 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon', is wordlessly staring at the
fragments of the Stories scattered on the ground.]

"What are you looking at?"

Han Sooyoung picked up the fragments the Black Flame Dragon was
pointing at. And then, her expression hardened in an instant.

[You have acquired the fragment of Story, 'King of a Kingless World'.]

"Isn't this…?"
<Star Stream> was blessed with countless types of Stories, but she knew of
only one person that possessed a Story with such a name. She abandoned
the items she'd been picking up and quickly ran in the direction where Yoo
Joonghyuk had disappeared to.




I'd die at Yoo Joonghyuk's hands.

「(Dokja-ssi.)」

Three hours from now, Yoo Joonghyuk would kill me.

「(Dokja-ssi!)」

I quickly raised my head and made my reply.

'Yes, Yoo Sangah-ssi'.

「(How long will you stay dazed like this? It's not like you, Dokja-ssi.)」

'I'm not dazed. I'm actually thinking about some things'.

「(Such as?)」

'On how to convince him'.

Honestly, I didn't feel confident about doing that. The Yoo Joonghyuk
showing up here to kill me wasn't the same Yoo Joonghyuk from the 'Ways
of Survival' that I read for over ten-plus years of my life.

The one coming to see me now was the Yoo Joonghyuk who realized that
he was just a 'character of a story', just like Yoo Joonghyuk from the
1863rd turn.
「(Is it because of your guilt…?)」

Sometimes, it felt as if Yoo Sangah could openly read my mind.

…And right now, she might have really done that, too.

'No, it isn't. It's something that I must do'.

[The power of 'Fruit of Good and Evil' is worsening your guilty
conscience.]

It was possible that this feeling had been forcibly triggered by the [Fruit of
Good and Evil]. Meaning, it might not be mine at all. However, I still
believed that this was the path I must take.

Anna Croft, supporting me during our journey, addressed me. "We
should arrive at the center of the island soon." I nodded my head as a
reply.

The 'center' of the island, the location of the portal to transfer you to the
next scenario, plus where I'd meet Yoo Joonghyuk in three hours' time.

"I don't wish to interfere with the future you have chosen yourself, but…
The outcome of my [Precognition] doesn't change all that easily."

"…Are you trying to jinx me?"

"I'm just trying to be honest with you. If you don't wish to die, it'll be better
for you to locate the syllable 'Vil' soon and get to the next scenario."

"I'm deliberately choosing not to go. There is a story that I must tell that
guy."

The story that I'd been delaying all along, something that I definitely had to
discuss with him.
"A story, is it… Does the 'Supreme King' really know how to listen to
stories?"

"If he doesn't, then I better make him."

Anna Croft remained silent for a little while. She must've been thinking of
something, as her eyes were looking up at the blackish-blue night sky
above. Several Constellations were looking down at us from up there.

"I'm sure that you know this already, but well, you can't convince every
single person."

She was a prophet. She probably experienced a similar situation as mine
many times before. After all, she reached this place by lying to Selena Kim
and deceiving Iris, didn't she?

"I think that we should say such things only after we try everything in our
power first."

"A person must bear the burden as weighty as the future she sees, you
know."

The center of the island could be seen in the distance now. And the giant
portal leading to the next scenario was there. Anna Croft withdrew her
supporting hands from me and spoke. "Well then, this is as far as we go."
She had gathered all the Modifier syllables, and was qualified to step
through that doorway now. Soon, she would continue to stride forward
towards the destination she sought after.

Just as I turned around away from her, she called out to me. "Kim Dokja."

Not as the Constellation 'Demon King of Salvation', but as 'Kim Dokja'.
She was calling out to 'me'.

"My aim is to change the master of this <Star Stream>."
Right away, I was beset with this uncomfortable feeling. Because… I could
tell what she was planning to say next.

"What is your goal, then?"

…I knew it.

"Do I really need to answer you?"

"I feel that only after hearing your answer, will I get to finally decide
whether to let you live or not."

She had placed me on a scale, basically – whether I'd be a help in her
pursuit towards her goal or become a hindrance, instead. If she thought that
I'd become the latter, then she'd not hesitate to make me disqualified here.

I quietly stared deeply into her eyes.

Would it be fine to tell her? Tell her what I truly want in this world?

Since she was a prophet, would she be able to understand me?

"I…"

Unfortunately, even before I could fully open my mouth, someone else's
voice interrupted me.

"His goal is to see the end of a certain insignificant story."

Icy-cold rage thickly permeated that voice.

And I knew that voice better than anyone.
        Chapter 369: Ep. 70 - A story that can't be shared, I


Anna Croft's expression hardened instantly and she sneakily pulled out her
shortsword behind her back. "…'Supreme King'."

Completely disregarding her, Yoo Joonghyuk spoke while taking large
strides to approach us. "You two seem to be getting along nicely. Do you
feel a sense of camaraderie from the fact that you both know about the
future?"

"…But, you also know the information about the future, don't you?"

"What I've experienced isn't the future." Kugugugugu-

!!

"It's simply the 'things that had happened'. It's the past."

Things that had happened, he said.
Yoo Joonghyuk had to live through the story that I read while welcoming
thousands of deaths in the process. As if to respond to all those years he had
spent, the [Black Heavenly Demon Sword] held in his hand began to cry
out viciously.

Anna Croft snuck a glance in my direction.

I replied to her. "You should go. This guy came to see me, not you."

"I pray that I'll get to hear your end goal through your own words next time
we meet."

Leaving behind those words, she vanished through the portal without a
trace. For sure, she had no reason to stay behind. She had paid her debt
more than enough by assisting me this far, after all.

Yoo Joonghyuk didn't try to stop her from leaving. If it was any other
times, he'd doggedly pursue her and cut her head off, but not today.

"Yoo Joonghyuk," I called out to him.

But, he didn't look at me. No, he simply stared at the empty, open mouth of
the portal.

So, I called out to him one more time. "Please, at least listen to what I have
to say. You used to call me your companion, once upon a time, didn't you?"
He shifted his gaze towards me and slowly unsheathed his sword.

"That was in the past."

The icy-cold rage permeating within his voice wasn't something that I could
readily unpack.

[Unique skill, the 'Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint' has been activated!]

And so, I took yet another step into the curse of omniscience.
[Your degree of understanding on the applicable individual is lacking!]
Unfortunately, Yoo Joonghyuk's inner thoughts didn't permit my spying
attempt, as if to assert that the person in front of my eyes was no longer the
same guy that I knew all this time.

"I can already guess what you want to talk to me about. It's probably about
that book of yours."

"…"

"Through that book, you peeked into my life, and used me as your
entertainment. Is there anything else I should know?"

I couldn't mouth any excuses. Because those were all truths. What I did was
no different from what other Constellations had been doing.

"I…"

I knew that. I definitely did. But…

But, was the sense of betrayal everything he felt?

[Your degree of understanding on the applicable individual is increasing
gradually bit by bit.]

Yoo Joonghyuk was waiting for me, as if he was the judge searching for
that yet-undiscovered opportunity to frame me even further.

Too bad, I had no idea what to say here.

His emotions flooded into my head and filled it up to full in no time
through the 'Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint'. All the texts that I knew were
steadily being overwritten by the words completely foreign to me.

The words that I should be saying, words that I wanted to say, they were all
being buried under the blackened waves of emotions crashing in.
And then, his sword moved.

Even at that moment, it still didn't feel real to me. Indeed, it felt far too
surreal that he'd forget about all those times we survived together and try to
kill me right here.

['Fruit of Good and Evil' is influencing your emotions!]

['The Fourth Wall' is shaking around violently!]

The moment I saw the blade flying in right in front of my nose, a guilty
conscience, as well as a sense of unfairness, welled up in my heart.

['Fruit of Good and Evil' is dragging out your dark emotions to the fore!]

I did my best in my own way. After these scenarios got underway, I really
tried my best. In my own way, I did my best to put what I read to practice.

I never once thought about hurting Yoo Joonghyuk or any of my
companions. All I ever thought about was these scenarios – what should I
do to minimise the harm? What should I do so that we could safely reach
the true end of everything?

That was all I did. Nothing more. Yet… Just

what made things to go so wrong like this?

Claaaang!!

Along with the explosive grinding noise, blue sparks danced in the air.

"Why are you standing around dazed like that, you dumbass?!"

Han Sooyoung was standing next to me now.
It was no coincidence that Han Sooyoung arrived on the 'Middle Island
No.3'.

While progressing through the 'Small Island's' scenario, she had a certain
dream. And it was about a man wearing a white coat dying at the hands of
another man wearing a black coat.

It was the same rubbish dream she had already a while ago, so she even
muttered to herself, 'It's that stupid dream again,' while dreaming it.
Because a dream would remain just that, a dream, and would never come to
reality.

…Just like a novel could never become reality, that was.

– Looks like the me of the 3rd turn is a bit of a moron, isn't she. I showed
herthe same image several times already, yet she doesn't seem to get it…

'What the heck was that?!'

Han Sooyoung in the dream nearly jumped up in fright and shifted her gaze
towards the voice. A woman wearing a black coat was standing there. This
mysterious person possessed a similar physique to her. And as if someone
deliberately erased her face, there were no distinguishing features at all.

That blank face continued to speak.

– Looks like this regression will end up as a failure if this keeps up, huh…

Han Sooyoung felt this instinctive fear and took a couple of steps back.
Unfortunately, she was still inside her own dream, and no person alive
could run away from their dreams.

– You see, me, I like throwing a wrench in someone else's schemes.

The moment this woman of the dream extended her hand, strange,
unexplainable information flooded into Han Sooyoung's head.
[Ability of 'Predictive Plagiarism' is being awoken inside you!]

And that was how Han Sooyoung woke up from her sleep. Unknown
information swam inside her head, and her consciousness moved on its own
volition to sort through her new-found knowledge base.

A short while later, this one sentence formed in her head.

– Yoo Joonghyuk will head towards the 'Middle Island No.3'.

She had no clue why such a sentence popped up in her mind. Even then, she
decided to heed it. She didn't know what that unidentifiable dream was all
about, or who that faceless woman within it was, but regardless, the thought
of 'I must do so' rang clearly in her head.

And that was how she reached this very location, this very moment.

"Get out of my way. I have no business with you."

Yoo Joonghyuk was glaring at her with a pair of frightening eyes.
Meanwhile, Kim Dokja was staring at her with a dazed expression on his
face.

Han Sooyoung slowly sucked in her breath. She still didn't know what the
dream was trying to show her. However, at least right in this moment, she
knew what her role was.

Han Sooyoung chuckled in her usual slimy manner and spoke up.

"I knew that you'd cause a problem sooner or later. There's no way the 'Yoo
Joonghyuk' I know would change like that."

"If you don't move out the way, then I…"

"What, you want to kill me, too? And what would you gain by doing that?
Is this the compensation for all those times you've been deceived?"
Yoo Joonghyuk didn't reply. Instead, his sword skill seemed to be forgotten
for a moment there. His blade sliced down from the air and Han Sooyoung
defended against the attack with a smirk.

"…You and Kim Dokja are exactly the same when it comes to not listening
to other people, you know."

[Constellation, 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon', is roaring out in rage!]

The power of [Black Flames] permeating within her entire figure clashed
against his sword swing.

The weight behind Yoo Joonghyuk's sword strike after being boosted by the
2nd generation's power was quite heavy. She bit her lip hard enough to
draw blood as she unleashed all of her strength.

He was indeed strong. However, it wasn't as if she was fooling around
doing nothing up until now.

[Story, 'Disciple of the Legendary Swordmaster', is shining brightly!]

That was the Story she barely managed to earn by scraping and clawing her
way through the scenario before coming here. The strength of a
Swordmaster swirled around her figure and explosively rose up within her.

Tsu-chuchuchuchut!!

In other places, it may not work, but if it was this place, then…

"When a person is saying something to you…"

The strengthened [Black Flame] rushed towards Yoo Joonghyuk through
the gaps of the dancing dark-blue sparks.

"…You! Should! Listen!"
The barrage of the strengthened flames rained down in sync with her words.
Yoo Joonghyuk's eyes shook around, hard, at the unexpectedly robust
resistance put up by her. She didn't miss that opening and loudly yelled out.
"All Kim Dokja did was read a novel! A stupidly long and boring novel!"

Seeing Yoo Joonghyuk get pushed back bit by bit, she thought that she
could pull this off. This was not a tough dilemma to solve. This
misunderstanding only came about because of people's words. That was
why she believed that more words could resolve it once and for all.

"So, just talk to him, will ya! Speak to each other without holding back!
Just like how everyone else does!"

The flames of [Black Flame] remained persistent and stuck on to Yoo
Joonghyuk's blade. He coldly spoke as he shook off the darkish flames.
"You don't know anything."

"No, I know already," growled Han Sooyoung, after hearing his words that
cold-heartedly excluded her. "What are you so pissed off about? About Kim
Dokja approaching you while knowing everything about you? But, aren't
you the same? Just like him, you acquired info for yourself and have
deceived everyone else until now, haven't you?"

Perhaps those words became the seed, because rage began filling up Yoo
Joonghyuk's eyes next. Their swords clashed in the air once more.

"Of course, I know that you were being sincere. I know that you did those
things to save people, to reach an even better world… But what about Kim
Dokja, then?"

"…"

"Tell me, just which idiot would throw his life away because a character
from a story is about to die??"
She saw Yoo Joonghyuk's blade freeze up for a moment there and
continued to pour out her words.

"Did you forget what Kim Dokja has done until now? Just because he read
that boring-ass novel a bit, you wish to pretend everything we experienced
during your 3rd regression didn't happen?"

Yoo Joonghyuk's Status was shrinking back now. Han Sooyoung could feel
it – that she was almost there. Just one more push, and this unnecessary
fight would come to an end.

"Calm down and think rationally about this."

Unfortunately, Han Sooyoung took a wrong step at the final hurdle.

"You are not that kind of a character."

"…A character, is it?"

Yoo Joonghyuk's expression was changing back. He wasn't asking a
question just now. She belatedly realized her mistake, but it was far too late
to take back what she said by then.

"You're the same as him."

Enormous waves of magical energy spread out from the contact point of
the two locked blades. Han Sooyoung's sword issued a cry of pain. The
force behind [Black Flames] was now being pushed back one-sidedly.
[Story, 'Torch That Swallowed the Myth', is roaring out!]

The [Giant Story] Yoo Joonghyuk had acquired was now going on a
rampage.

"I saw what you did during the 1863rd regression."

"1863rd regression? What the hell are you…??"
It was at that moment a certain something popped up in Han Sooyoung's
mind.

– In the 1863rd world-line of 'Ways of Survival'… Ah, right. You were
there, too. I couldn't tell which one of you was the real body, though.

For sure, Kim Dokja said something like that in the past.

'Can it be?'

Information in her head began consolidating; apparently, she existed within
the 1863rd turn. And in that place, she was living in a different regression.
In that case, the person she saw in her dream was…

Just as Han Sooyoung reached her answer, a momentary opening was
created. Yoo Joonghyuk's blade didn't miss that chance.




Why couldn't I move?

How come I didn't fight alongside Han Sooyoung?

While watching her speak for my stead, why couldn't I voice my own
thoughts with her?

"You… suck at telling your own story, that's why."

I pulled the fallen Han Sooyoung in as she looked up at me. Blood flowed
out like a river from her waist. It was so vividly red that it all came across
as far too unreal to my eyes.

She was bleeding, yet she was still talking to me. "Kim Dokja. I know the
end you've been wishing for."
She formed a smile as playful as ever. As if to wipe the blood on my cheek,
she rubbed my face while murmuring back to me. "What a pitiful guy you
are…"

I frantically tried to stem her bleeding while pulling out my recovery items.
Her internal injuries were too severe. She had been wounded far too
mercilessly.

Her innards were completely destroyed by the 2nd generation's sword force.

I could save her. If only I had a little more time, if I could just find a proper
healer and get her healed, then…

…But, would I be allowed to do that?

Her hand touching my cheek fell away lifelessly.

I called out Han Sooyoung's name. Over and over again. However, she
didn't wake up. What I heard was Yoo Joonghyuk's voice, instead.

"Stand up, Kim Dokja."

I couldn't sense any guilt, no shaken emotions within that voice.

It was at that moment something inside me snapped.

I slowly stood up from my spot.

[Yoo Joonghyuk.]

Stories were boiling over inside my head.

– There are some Stories that are simply too big and are difficult to read
properly. If your mind isn't centered right, you will end up getting swept
away by the Story, instead.
Yoo Hoseong told me that. I was aware of the dangers as well. The greater
the Story, the larger the burden I had to carry.

That was why I sought to make companions. And we worked together to
create history, to create our own Stories. All for the sake of reaching a
different conclusion than that of Yoo Joonghyuk's from the original
storyline. That wish was what brought us this far.

And the end result of that wish was this.

Did I need to keep reading this story, then?

[Giant Story, 'Demon Realm's Spring', has begun its storytelling.]

I've imagined the final goal where every one of us would be there together.
I truly believed that such a story was definitely achievable.

[Giant Story, 'Torch That Swallowed the Myth', has begun its storytelling.]

However, if that was impossible, then…

If all the histories that I've created so far were completely useless, then…

['Demon King Transformation' has been activated.]

…Then, the end I've been dreaming about no longer held any meaning.

[I shall kill you, Yoo Joonghyuk.]
       Chapter 370: Ep. 70 - A story that can't be shared, II


⸢"I shall kill you, Yoo Joonghyuk."⸥

Everyone within the Library was looking at that text.

⸢(…Looks like all of us might end up perishing at this rate.)⸥

['The Fourth Wall' is vibrating intensely!]

The entirety of the Library was shaking around. The books that had been
neatly arranged tumbled down and created a mess. However, no Librarian
tried to clean it up.

⸢(How frustrating. Why aren't they communicating with each other? As I
thought, these two lack enough desire to become one being.)⸥

⸢(Our Sooyoung didn't do anything wrong, yet…)⸥
The 'Squid' used one of its tentacles to lightly poke the round eye.

Meanwhile, the text continued on; every time Yoo Joonghyuk's and Kim
Dokja's blades clashed against each other, Nirvana's teeth issued clattering
noises.

⸢(Oii, newbie. What do you think?)⸥

When Yoo Sangah heard that, she stopped catching the books flying over
her head and looked back at the Librarians. Her hand was full of Kim
Dokja's memories – the book she'd been reading up until just now.

⸢(Mm. I have two opinions about it.)⸥

⸢(You have two of them??)⸥

⸢(One. Sooyoung-ssi isn't dead. I know her very well and she's not someone
to risk her life for a problem like this one.)⸥
The Squid's tearful eyes opened much wider from her reply.

⸢(What? But, you also read it, didn't you?)⸥

⸢(Looks like you still don't know how it works. The heroine loses her
consciousness, her hand falling away. And the male hero awakens! You
see, in all the movies I've seen so far…)⸥

Not minding what the Squid or the Simulation were saying, Yoo Sangah
composedly carried on.

⸢(Two. They are currently talking to each other.)⸥
Yoo Sangah spoke as she stared at the texts that continued to pile up.
⸢(Even though no one in this world would call that a 'conversation', but

still.)⸥




Fragments of Stories poured out from the cracked arm. They were stories
that we had created together.

[Story, 'Demon Realm's Spring', is pouring out its story!]

[Story, 'Torch That Swallowed the Myth', is growling threateningly!]

Like a dragon and tiger getting into a tussle, Stories collided with other
Stories. Yoo Joonghyuk, possessing the exact same 'Giant Stories' as I, used
the exact same power to fight me.

[Your share on the applicable Story is higher than your opponent's!]

Even though my share on the Stories was supposedly higher, the shares
held by Yoo Joonghyuk didn't listen to my commands. Maybe that was due
to all those years Yoo Joonghyuk had gone through already. He had been
telling his story far more fiercely than anyone else in <Star Stream>, after
all.

Ch-chuchuchuchut!!

The Probability of the 2nd generation was suppressing us. However, some
things still managed to escape its suppression.

[Story, 'One who Opposes the Miracle', is thunderously roaring out!]

[Story, 'One who Opposes the Miracle', is bellowing out in anger!]
The exact same Stories created by experiencing the same history collided
against each other.

['Master of the Island' is paying close attention to you.]

[Many Constellations are watching your battle.]

[Constellation, 'Demon-like Judge of Fire', is…]

The voices of the Constellations were getting fainter and fainter now.
[Unique skill, 'The Fourth Wall' is activating!]

We both swung our swords, fully prepared to kill each other in the process.
The blade that I desperately swung brushed past Yoo Joonghyuk's waist,
and his own blade attacking right back, stabbed into my shoulder.

His combat intuition was higher, but my 'Status' was much higher than his.

[Giant Story, 'Demon Realm's Spring', is protecting you!]

The Transcendent's sharp aura pierced past the thick layer of 'Status' and
flew straight in. From that sword energy, I was able to read his true
intention. I saw how desperately he was standing his ground right now.

He didn't bother to ask, and I didn't bother to reply. No, we just swung our
swords again and again. And instead of our mouths, our Stories told the
tales for us.

[Story, 'Paradise of Despair', is pouncing like a wild beast!]

The memories from the 'Paradise'…

[Story, 'the One who hunted the King of Calamity', is roaring out!]

Traces from the [Peace Land]…

[Story, 'Liberator of the Industrial Complex', is in mourning.]
The moments from the revolution…

⸢None of those existed within the pages of the 'Ways of Survival'.⸥

The times we've lived through didn't match up with any of the pages I read
in the past.

['Angel Transformation' is activating!]

Wings broke past my shoulder blades. My Status instantly increased and
permeated into Unbroken Faith.

Issuing a loud, explosive noise, Yoo Joonghyuk's body flew up in the air
after being unable to withstand the impact force.

"Come at me with everything you've got, Yoo Joonghyuk. Because I'll do
the same, too."

The light in his eyes changed. The outline of his Status rising up around
him began distorting visibly. It was powerful enough to twist the space
itself. The true power of the high-level Transcendent was being unleashed
for real now.

Yoo Joonghyuk's figure, wrapped in the brilliant golden light, disappeared
from my view.

[2nd Stage of the 'Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint' is still in activation.]

His blade moved so fast that my eyes couldn't even follow it.

Claaaang!!

One sword, against another. The louder the grinding metallic noises
became, the heavier my wrist got. Stories poured out from my thigh, and
Stories flowed out from Yoo Joonghyuk's shoulders.
And naturally, his voice could also be heard.

['The Fourth Wall' is activating strongly as if to fight back!]

Yoo Joonghyuk had begun telling his story now.

⸢You…⸥

I tried to guess which words would follow that. Without a doubt, he'd blame
me. Just as Han Sooyoung had said, you were that kind of a person, after
all.

⸢Why did you choose to remain in that particular turn?⸥

Memories of the 1863rd regression brushed past my head.

⸢"I won't return to the 3rd turn. I'll remain here and see this thing to its end
with the people of this place."⸥
The decision I made was coming back to me in full. The Unbroken Faith
was now issuing cracking, breaking noises.

Back then, that was the best choice available. I thought that, after
witnessing the end of the 1863rd turn, I would be able to return to the 3rd
turn safely. That was why I tried to find the story where everyone could be
happy.

However, what if Yoo Joonghyuk of the 1863rd turn didn't help me out
back then?

What if Han Sooyoung of the 1863rd turn carried murderous intentions
towards me?

Would I have been able to return to this world unscathed?
Even though I thought that I knew the scenarios better than anyone, could it
be that I just got lucky and managed to survive until now?

⸢Your companions are here.⸥

Yoo Joonghyuk's first sword slash sliced apart my shoulder. And…

⸢Your own world-line was here.⸥

His second strike split open my elbow.

⸢You told people to live their lives in this world.⸥

The third strike punctured a hole in my wing. It hurt like hell. But what hurt
even more than that, though, was the rage and disappointment contained
within Yoo Joonghyuk's voice.

⸢Incarnation 'Yoo Joonghyuk' is refusing to regress.⸥

Yoo Joonghyuk who gave up on the path of regression and decided to live
out his 3rd turn because of me was now looking back. The being who loved
this world more than anyone, and wanted to protect it because of that, was
staring straight back at me.

⸢But then, you…⸥

Certain types of rage and some types of betrayal couldn't be described in
mere words. No matter how omniscient one was as a reader, one would
never be able to read them.

Yoo Hoseong said as thus:

– A Story may not look all that amazing at first glance, but it'll present a
maze-like abyss to all those who dare to peek deeper into their inner core.
It's the same story, regardless of how small a Story is.
What I was seeing shouldn't be Yoo Joonghyuk's everything. I'd never get
to fully understand the reason why he was so furious like this. Because
everything could be his reason, or conversely, nothing could be his reason,
too.

But, one thing was for certain, and that would be Yoo Joonghyuk had
decided not to be under the thumb of anyone anymore.

Not controlled by me, and not controlled by himself. And, maybe not even
by those damn Constellations who should be watching right us now.

⸢Answer me, Kim Dokja.⸥

While receiving the outpouring of the sword strikes, I began faltering. Most
likely, Yoo Joonghyuk was aware of the truth – that I was still reading him
even right now.

But, even though he knew that I was reading him, he continued to think
nonstop.

⸢Answer me.⸥

Just like how I observed him past this 'wall', he too was ceaselessly writing
something just beyond it, hoping that someone would get to read it sooner
or later.

Unfortunately, I couldn't reply. Because if I do, then…

['The Fourth Wall' is getting thicker.]

…Then, you'd end up becoming a mere character of the story.

['The Fourth Wall' is getting even thicker.]

Because… you definitely couldn't become a mere character.
Ku-gugugugu!!

Yoo Joonghyuk glared at me with his trademark blazing eyes. Here he was,
existing in this place and time, destroying me in order to prove that he
wasn't just a mere character of a story.

⸢Is that so.⸥

His words floated up above the 'wall'.

⸢So, that is your choice.⸥

['The Fourth Wall' is getting even thicker.]

⸢Even during this regression, I didn't have any companions, then.⸥

If I were to say something, anything, as a reply, it was possible that he'd
have forgiven me. Maybe, a miracle might happen and he'd accept me,
even.

However, even if that happened, Han Sooyoung wouldn't return, and the
hurt we inflicted on each other would not be erased, either. We would never
become companions ever again.

Whether it was Yoo Joonghyuk or me, we both knew that truth all too
painfully well.

['The Fourth Wall' is getting even thicker.]

And that was why we held our swords as we dashed towards each other.

['The Fourth Wall' is getting even thicker.]

The full-on attack collided with another full-on attack and issued a loud
explosive noise. Thick, choking dust was kicked up in the air; neither of us
could withstand the impact force and crumbled to the ground.
The first one to stand back up was me.

I staggered towards Yoo Joonghyuk lying on his back, his entire body now
looking like a torn rag, and pointed my blade at him. He didn't offer any
resistance, but instead, looked up at me to speak.

"…I've persisted with this regression for far too long. So, end this."

Yoo Joonghyuk murdered Han Sooyoung. He had already crossed the line
that shouldn't have been crossed.

The sword aura of the Unbroken Faith trembled noticeably. And the
moment I raised my sword up high, I recalled what Han Sooyoung of the
1863rd turn told me.

– If my novel was a rip-off of 'Ways of Survival', then whose rip-off are
you?

The answer to that question was right in front of my eyes now.

⸢Kim Dokja had learned how to live from this man.⸥

This man was my father; my brother; and my oldest friend.

['The Fourth Wall' has increased its thickness.]

For a long time, I had been looking at him through this thick, thick wall. I
was saved by him many times, and while looking at his story, I managed to
survive.

The Unbroken Faith slowly clattered back on the ground. I couldn't kill this
guy. Nor could I beg for his forgiveness, either.

I had never learned to be that cowardly. No, I was taught to pay the price
for the things I've done.
Yoo Joonghyuk was still looking up at me. And I too, stared back at him.

⸢I'm right here, in this place.⸥

I know.

⸢Even then, you only chose to read and nothing else.⸥

…Because that is our way of living. You acted, and I read you doing it.

⸢If you're unwilling, then I shall do it myself.⸥

Yoo Joonghyuk slowly got back up and grasped his blade tightly.

I thought I could hear the sound of a story coming to an end. The 'Mass
Production Maker' once told me this – that a certain Story would end
without ever getting closer to the ■■. However, if this place was the
endpoint for all the stories, and if I was destined to die right here, then
wouldn't it be fine to at least say one thing?

"…Hey, Yoo Joonghyuk."

He stopped his actions when I spoke up.

"You probably know this already, but I'm not a prophet. No, I am as far
removed from such a being as you can get."

Ever since we got into a tussle back on the Dongho Bridge, I had never
introduced myself properly once. To Yoo Joonghyuk, I was the prophet, a
man with a mysterious background.

"I'm not the 'Demon King of Salvation'."

[Story, 'Demon King of Salvation', has stopped its storytelling.]

"I'm also not the 'King of a Kingless World'."
[Story, 'King of a Kingless World', has stopped its storytelling.]

One by one, my Stories stopped their stories. Excluding my own,
everything else became dead still.

"My name is Kim Dokja."

The wings on my back disappeared, and the ballooned-up muscles shrunk
back, too.

"Twenty-eight… No, wait. I was twenty-eight, and I was an employee of a
game company. My hobby was reading web novels…"

As if I was talking to someone I met for the first time, I continued to tell my
own story.

"It's pathetic, right? Well, this is who I am… Yoo Joonghyuk, who are
you?"

To me, Yoo Joonghyuk was someone I 'knew' since from a long time ago.
To be more specific, he was someone I read about all by myself.

That was why I had never heard about his story in his own words.

He finally opened his mouth.

"I am Yoo Joonghyuk."

His blade slowly moved and cut me down.

"Yoo Joonghyuk, a former Regressor."
      Chapter 371: Ep. 70 - A story that can't be shared, III


As soon as she opened her eyes, Han Sooyoung spat out a mouthful of
blood.

Only after the black-coloured blood filled up the ground in a rather large
quantity did she finally regain her wits. The first thing she saw was the
dense forest. It wasn't the location where she'd been fighting against Yoo
Joonghyuk just now.

"I really almost died back there. Yoo Joonghyuk, you son of a bitch…"

If she hadn't transferred her memories to a dummy Avatar on standby at the
very last moment, she'd have died for real.

[You have exhausted today's allotment for the authorisation of 'Memory
Transfer'.]
[From now on, the applicable Avatar will act as your true body.]

She'd been expecting something like this to happen.


[Story, 'Predictive Plagiarism', is hesitantly carrying on with its
storytelling.]

Han Sooyoung got to clearly witness several 'scenes' through this Story
called ⸢Predictive Plagiarism⸥, the one she earned after experiencing that
mysterious dream.

Such as, the various futures that would change according to the choices
she'd make – Kim Dokja's death, or maybe, even Yoo Joonghyuk's death.
And then, the sole future where both of those terrible choices could be
avoided altogether.

[Due to the penalty of 'Memory Transfer', your physical abilities will be
weakened significantly.]

"I swear, if either one of them is dead, then I…!"

Han Sooyoung complained unhappily to herself and tried to sense the
waves of magical energy from the surroundings. She still needed to locate
the direction where those two were.

Not too long afterwards, her senses picked up on two rather enormous
Statuses. She quickly ran in that direction.

Out of all the futures she read, this was the 'only one that worked out fine'.
Kim Dokja didn't die, and for the first time ever, those two idiots would get
to share a proper conversation.

That's what Han Sooyoung's [Predictive Plagiarism] had predicted, and that
was why she didn't try to dodge Yoo Joonghyuk's sword at the last second.
So, Kim Dokja should definitely be alive.
It was around here that she heard the sound of a sword clashing against
something else.

'…Are they still fighting?

These idiots, I even died so that you two could talk to each other, but this…'
She figured that she really needed to give these two men a harsh earful
when she arrived there. But, when she pushed past the bushes and stepped
forward, the ensuing spectacle freaked her out in a rather grand manner.

Kwa-aaang!! Bang!!!

Yoo Joonghyuk was mercilessly slamming his sword down on Kim Dokja,
currently sprawled out on the ground.

"Hey!! You crazy son of a bitch!!"




'…I guess it didn't work?'

Yoo Joonghyuk observed Kim Dokja lying on the ground. On the chest of
the unconscious man, the shallow wound left behind by his [Black
Heavenly Demon Sword] was clearly visible.

'But, I thought I saw it just now'.

Yoo Joonghyuk grasped his sword tightly and focused his mind. And
almost right away, he sensed the dark aura oozing out from Kim Dokja's
body.

That was the 'wall', the identity of the strange 'foreignness' he felt whenever
he was looking at Kim Dokja.

'I can see it'.
He could see a jet-black wall, composed of countless texts. He raised his
sword high up and powerfully smashed down on that wall again.

Now that a Transcendent began pounding on it with serious intent, the wall
started shaking around in an unstable manner.

['The Fourth Wall' is glaring at you.]

Not caring whether it was glaring or not, Yoo Joonghyuk continued to
pound on that wall.

'Beyond this wall, there might be…'

If it didn't want to open up, then until it did; if it couldn't be broken, then
until he broke it down. Again, and again.

But then…

"Hey, you crazy bastard!! Have you lost your mind?!"

Accompanied by a shrill voice, he felt a rather powerful impact in the back
of his head. Blood trickled down and blocked his vision. Through all that
red, he saw Han Sooyoung kneeling down next to Kim Dokja.

"Hey, Kim Dokja!! Get a hold of yourself! Wake u… What the heck? He
isn't dead?"

Yoo Joonghyuk scowled unhappily as he staggered on his feet.

"Han Sooyoung. Do you really wish to die today?"

"You already killed me once today, you bastard."

"I knew you wouldn't die from the beginning."

"Stop lying. My acting was beyond perfect, you know."
She growled angrily and pointed at her Incarnation Body (which was her
real body only until a few minutes ago) still lying on some forgotten corner
over yonder.

The Incarnation Body, currently crumbling away, showed the definite signs
of bleeding out. An [Avatar] wouldn't have bled anything in the first place.

Yoo Joonghyuk spoke nonchalantly. "An [Avatar] would bleed like the real
body if it was imbued with a certain amount of memories."

"Oh my? And how did you even find that out?"

"From the record you wrote yourself. Specifically, you from the 1863rd
turn, that is."

"Me of that turn wrote all sorts of crap, didn't I? God damn it."

There were plenty of things she wanted to ask, but she chose not to. Instead,
she poked Kim Dokja's cheek and spoke up. "Still, this guy looks like he
got completely fooled, doesn't he."

"Looks that way."

"How did it go?"

"He went crazy and attacked me."

Han Sooyoung smirked and lightly pinched Kim Dokja's cheek as if she
was proud of him. "By the way, what's the matter with his chest?"

"He's paying for making me eat dirt."

"…Dirt??"

"There is something like that."
She shifted her gaze back to Kim Dokja and his cheek that sagged without
any energy. In all honesty, he was only just barely alive, and not one part of
his body could be described as 'okay'. Indeed, the surrounding forest had
been completely levelled by the battle just now, so it'd be far stranger if his
body was left largely unscathed.

Han Sooyoung understood that this scene of utter destruction was the direct
evidence of the conversation that took place between Kim Dokja and Yoo
Joonghyuk.

"So? Did you hear the answer you wanted?"

Yoo Joonghyuk paused for a moment before making his reply. "A little."

She could clearly read the depths of emotions contained in that simple reply
of "A little". But they belonged to Kim Dokja and Yoo Joonghyuk, and no
one else. That left her feeling just a bit rueful, a bit lonesome.

"Anyways. You are coming back to <Kim Dokja's Company> now, right?"

Yoo Joonghyuk mulled over for a while, but then, turned around to leave as
if he had said everything there was to say.

She frowned deeply. "Hey, you! At least try to answer properly, will you? I
even helped you out, didn't I??"

"The 'Great War of Saints and Demons' is just around the corner."

Yoo Joonghyuk continued to walk further away. One step, two steps…

Just as Han Sooyoung was getting ready to shout out something else…

Tsu-chuchuchut!!
Sparks buzzed around Kim Dokja's body and a 'voice' suddenly came out
from him. ⸢(Yoo Joonghyuk-ssi, that stupid scenario isn't the most
important thing, you know.)⸥

Startled by this development, Yoo Joonghyuk quickly unsheathed his blade.
The imaginary wall enveloping Kim Dokja was actually moving. Past that
wall, someone was speaking to him.

⸢(Do you believe that it's the end when you leave after talking one-sidedly
like this?)⸥
No, to be more specific, it wasn't the wall, but rather…

⸢(You should experience it as well, what the 'feelings of being a reader' are
all about. To understand what it really is.)⸥

Tsu-chuchuchuchut!!

The wall that didn't want to break no matter how many times he hit it
suddenly developed a small hole on the side, and a hand popped out from
this mysterious hole. That hand proceeded to lightly grasp Yoo Joonghyuk's
head and then, slammed it right against the wall.




I was lying in pitch-black darkness by the time I regained my
consciousness.

What happened?

Did I die?

…By Yoo Joonghyuk?
As the thoughts continued to swirl in my head, I slowly stood back up. I
looked around but couldn't see anything. It was then, a bright light from a
lantern lit up in front of my eyes.

⸢(Dokja-ssi, so this was where you've been all this time.)⸥

'Is that you, Yoo Sangah-ssi?'

⸢(Are you alright?)⸥

'Where am I…?'

⸢(You're inside the Library.)⸥

Only then did I figure out what had happened. Most likely, I got
sucked inside [The Fourth Wall] as I blacked out again. '…By the
way, is it always this dark inside?'

⸢(No, it's just that the Library is in a state of chaos at the moment. The
aftershocks of the battle this time killed off all the lanterns inside, and all
the bookshelves have fallen down. Everyone is doing their best trying to
restore everything right now.)⸥

'My apologies. I have created a lot of trouble for you'.

Yoo Sangah grinned softly and shook her head.

⸢(No, not at all.)⸥

'Is there anything I can do to help…?'

⸢(Oh, no. It's fine. You should lay here and rest. I'll sit here and take a short
break, as well.)⸥
Yoo Sangah let out a grunt and lightly settled down next to me. Her face, as
illuminated by the dim light of the lantern was the exact same one from my
memories.

⸢(You really did well.)⸥

'…In regards to?'

⸢(When you said those things.)⸥

I didn't need a lot of time to figure out what she meant by those words. No
doubt, she would've borne witness to the spectacle of the outside from
behind [The Fourth Wall].

⸢(A proper relationship starts from the act of introducing oneself first,
doesn't it? It's possible that you two might become real friends this time.)⸥
'…That would be great if such a thing was possible, but…'

I wasn't expecting much, though. Honestly, I thought that it'd be a huge
relief with Yoo Joonghyuk's anger being soothed, somehow. No matter
what I said, it'd be quite impossible to soften the sense of betrayal he
must've felt.

Books discarded on the floor seemed to be rolling around everywhere.
Without thinking too much about it, I picked one up.

『Kim Dokja, Records from 15 years old, Volume #25』

I sneakily closed the book and chucked the damn thing deep into the
darkness.

⸢(Uhm, excuse me, Dokja-ssi?)⸥

'Yes?'
⸢(Actually, well, I read that book. Just a little bit.)⸥

'…How much did you read?'

⸢(…Almost the whole book, if I'm honest. I find these more interesting than
the 'Ways of Survival', you see… I'm sorry.)⸥
My face reddened from heat, but there was naught that could be done when
she had already read it.

'It's fine. I do feel a bit ashamed, but still'.

I did think that, with Yoo Sangah being a part of the 'Library', such
memories would possibly end up being exposed, anyway. She carefully
picked up the books rolling around on the floor, one by one, and dusted
them before gathering them all together.

They were all my memories.

Her expression, as dyed by the darkness, was hard to see, but I could
nevertheless sense how troubled she was feeling right now. Perhaps to
console her, I picked up one of the books she had been gathering.

'…Been a while, this thing'.

All these gathered books were my stories.

Kim Dokja, 15 years old. 18 years old. 23. 28…

I slowly flipped through the pages.

Kim Dokja, who didn't have a father.

Kim Dokja, who didn't have any friends.

Kim Dokja, who lost his mother.
It was a life that always lacked something, or something kept disappearing
from it. ⸢A lone existence is a being that doesn't exist. Kim Dokja was
always alone. And that was why he was the only child (dokja/獨子), and
the 'Kim Dokja'
didn't exist.⸥

What sorrowfully reasonable words those were.

⸢However, there was a sole moment where that Kim Dokja did exist; that
was when the dokja (only child/獨子) became the dokja (reader/讀者).⸥

A life story being told like a lengthy report on a single book, that was
basically my life in a nutshell. I spent my teenage years along with the
'Ways of Survival', and hid behind the wall this story created for me to
dodge the pointed fingers of other people.

⸢At last. He'd come to life only when reading the 'Way of Survival'.⸥

I sensed Yoo Sangah's gaze, staring at me from my side. I wasn't sure why,
but it also felt like it wasn't her alone; maybe, other Librarians were also
watching me from somewhere within the darkness.

It was right then, an unexpected text caught my eyes within the opened
page.

⸢I met a strange person today during the interview. That person's name is
Yoo Sangah.⸥

The moment I read that, I unknowingly closed the book shut.

…Could it be that, Yoo Sangah-ssi also read this part?

⸢(Haven't you ever wondered about this before, Dokja-ssi?)⸥
'Excuse me? About what…?'

⸢(What if 'scenarios' didn't start? What would have happened to us?)⸥

I hadn't thought about that.

What if, the 'Ways of Survival' didn't become reality back then?

What if, the novel 'Ways of Survival' came to its natural conclusion and
time continued to tick by, what would've happened to me?

…Would I still be alive?

Could I have been able to carry on?

⸢(Would we be still working for the same company as before?)⸥

'Well, my contract hadn't been extended, so… I guess I might have been
searching for a job in other companies'.

Right, I wouldn't have died that easily. I would've thought about dying
every now and then, and also, there could've been many a day when I fell
asleep while re-reading the 'Ways of Survival', but… Yeah, I wouldn't have
died. Not that easily.

I'd have continued to live on, somehow.

'In that world, I wouldn't have become a friend with you, Yoo Sangah-ssi.
My workplace would've changed, and we wouldn't have a reason to get in
contact with each other, after all'.

⸢(Even still, wouldn't we have tried to call each other some times?)⸥

'Well…'
⸢(I think we would have. I'm sure that, even after you left the company, I'd
keep on remembering you. You are a strange person, after all.)⸥
'…Are you trying to get back at me?'

Yoo Sangah formed a refreshing grin and carried on. ⸢(I'd probably
have gotten curious about your welfare. Is he doing okay? He's not
sick, is he? Did he find a new job? What about marriage…)⸥

'I don't think I'd have gotten married. I couldn't even take care of myself
properly back then'.

⸢(Well, it's true that one doesn't have to get married. I also found it easier to
live alone.)⸥
'Even you, Sangah-ssi?'

⸢(Yes. See, I told you. We'd have been good friends, I think.)⸥

'…You really think so?' ⸢(Yes, of course. We'd study Spanish together,

enter a rider's club and ride bicycles together, too…)⸥

'Or, to get ready for our old age, we start recommending savings plan or
retirement funds'.

⸢(After we grow old and can't move anymore, we'd help each other to get to
hospitals.)⸥
'I guess we could have lived pretty close by, in that case'.

⸢(Of course. Maybe, we might have lived right next to each other.)⸥
We continued to chat away. We talked about things that could no longer be.
Things that could never become a reality.

Just like how the 'Ways of Survival' was to me once upon a time.

Yoo Sangah continued on.

⸢(Along with Heewon-ssi, Hyunsung-ssi, and Jihye, too… It'd be wonderful
if other kids also lived nearby… Even Sooyoung-ssi, too.)⸥
Even if such a world did really exist, it was not possible that all of them
could be together. Because… they were characters from a novel. They
were…

'…Yes, it'd be really wonderful if that was true'.

⸢(Ah, Joonghyuk-ssi, as well. Although his personality is terrible, he's a
great cook, so I think it'll be nice to become his friend.)⸥
Without a warning, something welled up from deep inside my heart.

⸢(Heewon-ssi and Hyunsung-ssi would be… Fufufu, in any case. And so
we… We'd all be growing older, little by little. In a world without
scenarios, no Constellations, and no Dokkaebis. Where we'd meet up to
share our stories, and while sharing nice foods…)⸥

I recalled the countless world-lines that I witnessed together with the
'Secretive Plotter'. Among all those possible worlds, maybe, just maybe,
one of them could…

⸢(It'd been nice if such a world existed somewhere. Don't you agree?)⸥

'There might be one just like that, somewhere'.
⸢(Dokja-ssi.)⸥

'Yes?'

⸢(I really enjoyed being with you, Dokja-ssi.)⸥

'…'

⸢(I think it's time for me to go now.)⸥

'Yoo Sangah-ssi'.

Actually, I had realized it a little while ago – why she suddenly began
talking to me about such things.

['Master of the Island' is calling out to Incarnation 'Yoo Sangah'.]

By seizing the opening created by the weakening of [The Fourth Wall], the
master of these islands was calling out to Yoo Sangah.

…The King of the Reincarnators.

Finally, the moment we've been waiting for had come. Indeed, one of the
reasons why we decided to come to the Isle of Reincarnators was here.
⸢(This Library, it's a warm and cosy and nice place to be, but… But, I can't
remain here forever, you know.)⸥

'But, hang on for a second, Sangah-ssi. You don't have to be in such a hurry
to…!'

Yoo Sangah shook her head. Just like me, she too had read the 'Ways of
Survival' by now. What I wanted to say, she already knew them all.
⸢(There is almost nothing that I can do in here. As long as I'm here, I'll
always remain as a simple 'reader'.)⸥
I looked up at her with a resolute expression, my lips firmly shut.

I wanted to stop her. I wanted to ask if it'd be fine for us to talk for a bit
longer.

Unfortunately, I couldn't.

⸢(Dokja-ssi, you told me this once before that you have only one turn, and
that the world we need to live in is this one. That's why… I'll say it like
this.)⸥

White light enveloped Yoo Sangah as she placed her hand on my head, a
smile forming on her lips.

⸢(Let's meet again in the next life.)⸥
      Chapter 372: Ep. 70 - A story that can't be shared, IV


As I slowly regained my consciousness, I decided to activate [Omniscient
Reader's Viewpoint].

⸢Sooo, the method to clear the 'Middle Island No.4' is…⸥

After managing to master the 'Story Control', Jung Heewon had finally
entered the Middle Island's scenario and began massacring other
participants.

⸢…I dunno. Well, if they come at me, I'll just kill them all.⸥

⸢Our general is also a Narrative-grade, you know? Don't you look down on
us!⸥
Jung Heewon activated [Hour of Judgement], while Lee Jihye activated
[Demon Slaying] as they ran amok in their battlefield; around the same
time, the kids began clearing the Middle Island's scenario in their own
clever way. ⸢I've tamed the 'Invisible Wisp'. Let's steal that person's
Modifier using this guy.⸥

⸢But, we can just send insects over there, though?⸥

What a crafty method of clearing the scenario. So much so that I didn't need
to help them out at all.

⸢Keuh-euhk, keuheuk, groan…⸥

Lee Hyunsung found himself alone on a different Middle Island and was
being severely beaten up by other Constellations and Incarnations. He was
in a foetal position while glaring at his enemies with sorrowful eyes, but
then, he suddenly roared out like a huge bear.

⸢The one thing sadder then ending up all alone, is to get beaten up all by
yourself!⸥
Powerful rays of light exploded out from Lee Hyunsung's body, causing the
participants around him to explode en masse.

I was familiar with that technique. That was one of the special techniques
possessed by the 'Master of Steel', [Impact Release], that released all the
accumulated damage at once.

As expected, the folks from the original storyline were truly cheat
characters. In any case, I got to clearly see that Lee Hyunsung had become
stronger as well.

⸢[Character 'Jang Hayoung' has activated 'Breaking the Sky Force Punch'!]⸥

As for Jang Hayoung, she was clearing the scenario while displaying
overwhelming strength. To me, she seemed to be on the path to truly
becoming the master of the 'wall' she possessed. Well, she was a talented
person from the get-go, and was also capable of absorbing the techniques of
others rather quickly, as well.

⸢['Unidentifiable Wall' is evolving!]⸥

Her 'wall' had become far more stabilised compared to before. She could
chat to other Transcendents through her 'wall', and got to learn and
understand their abilities. In a way, one could say there were some
similarities between her method and me reading the book.

⸢['Unidentifiable Wall' has sensed your presence.]⸥

My view was instantly filled with white noise.

['Unidentifiable Wall' is staring at 'The Fourth Wall'.]

['The Fourth Wall' is staring at 'Unidentifiable Wall'.]

The moment these two walls stared at each other, my view suddenly grew
fuzzy, blurry.

[…The end of the world-line is approaching.]

As my view crumbled away, I could hear an unknown voice.

[Kim Dokja, they shall come to find you.]




Vrrr…

The moment I regained my consciousness, I felt my smartphone vibrate. I
switched the screen on without thinking too much about it, only to spot
today's date.
February 15th…

As we weren't on Earth, the local weather report didn't appear. All I could
confirm was the date. Even then, I couldn't say it was an accurate one,
either. The space-time indicator had long lost its meaning after I moved
around different dimensions willy-nilly, after all.

Everyone within <Star Stream> lived in a different time from the
others. That was the case, but now… 15th of February, is it?

I fell into a bit of thought regarding this date, before giving up and placed
the phone down. My head was in a disorganised mess, and almost every
part of my Incarnation Body was aching painfully, too.

I blinked several times while looking down at my upper torso to find
bandages tightly wrapped around my chest area.

…Where am I now?

The surroundings slowly filled my view. Firstly, the clean, white bedsheets,
followed by the elegant Oriental décor of the room I was in.

A certain someone leaning against the window and looking outside threw a
question at me. "You awake now?"

"You…?!"

Her eyes arched in a mischievous manner. "Ahh, so this is how it feels like
coming back to life after dying."

"But, didn't you die…"

"I did?"

Seeing Han Sooyoung snicker like that, the inside of my head grew even
more complicated. I immediately recalled the sight just before blacking out;
the events of her dying at Yoo Joonghyuk's sword, me fighting against him,
and then, passing out from his attack, and finally, sharing a conversation
with Yoo Sangah inside the Library…

Han Sooyoung approached the bed before I noticed it and pinched my
cheek.
"In any case, Kim Dokja. You can be really adorable sometimes."

Only then did I realize that she played me for a sucker. I took a closer look
and found a small IV needle stuck in her arm, too.

"…Where are we?"

"The waiting room of the Main Island. The place where that 'guy' and his
castle is."

It was then, I abruptly remembered something else.

['Master of the Island' is calling out to Incarnation 'Yoo Sangah'.]

Back then when that guy was taking Yoo Sangah away, there was another
message popping up in front of my eyes, as well.

['Master of the Island' is inviting you.]

The King of Reincarnators. The third protagonist of the book 'Three Ways
to Survive in a Ruined World' had summoned us to their territory.

"But, I'm pretty sure that I failed to clear the scenario? Don't I need to clear
the Middle Island's scenario in order to get here, so how…"

"Nope, you did clear it."

I quickly confirmed the message logs.

[You have cleared Hidden Scenario – 'Snatching Modifiers'!]
[Reward handout is currently on standby.]

It's true.

"But, how? I hadn't collected the syllable 'Vil', so how…"

Han Sooyoung wordlessly pointed at the necklace hanging around my neck.

[Devil of Lust and Wrath]

The completed necklace of Modifier was emitting a soft glow. Something
like this couldn't happen, though. One of the syllables should've been
missing on my necklace.

Han Sooyoung spoke. "Yoo Joonghyuk gave it to you before leaving,
saying that it's a leftover."

…Yoo Joonghyuk did?

But, why?

My thoughts were getting messy again. The things he said at the final
moments rang vividly in my head.

– Yoo Joonghyuk, a former Regressor.

Not the Regressor Yoo Joonghyuk, but a former Regressor.

What was he thinking about when he told me that?

"Where is he now?"

"The next scenario."

The sense of emptiness and relief brushed past me simultaneously when I
heard her. He again went ahead before everyone in order to clear the
scenario.
"…Who was his target, anyway?"

"You just woke up, but you're already so full of questions. How annoying."

I sat on the bed, eyes blinking like an idiot. She pointed to my chest again.
Upon taking a closer look, there were two [Modifier Necklaces] hanging
around my neck. One of them was Asmodeus's Modifier, [Devil of Lust and
Wrath], while the other one was…

[□□ of □□]

The places where my Modifier should've been were replaced by empty
holes, instead.

"No way?"

"Yes, way."

Well, at least he did leave behind 'Of'. That son of a bitch.

"It's my turn to ask questions now. Is Yoo Sangah still inside you?"

"…King of Reincarnators already took her."

"…Did she say anything else before going?"

I unsteadily rose up from the bed and walked over to the window. While
standing next to Han Sooyoung, I stared at the unfolding cityscape.

Reincarnators were busy roaming the streets that possessed the
unmistakable ancient Chinese vibe. Beings from other worlds were here;
beings that had chosen to live a new life in this place, along with different
names and different faces.

"She said, let's meet again in the next life."
To me, it'd still be this life but to Yoo Sangah, it'd indeed be the next life.
She'd earn a new body, a new life, through the power of the 'King of
Reincarnators'.

She'd get to live a new life in this world, in other words.

Han Sooyoung and I stared at the streets below without saying anything. It
was as if we were searching for Yoo Sangah hiding somewhere within
these nameless streets.

Han Sooyoung abruptly opened her lips to speak. "It's snowing."

She was right; bits of snowflakes were descending from the sky.


Originally, this particular world didn't have any snow. Yet, it was doing
precisely that.

Snow fell like starlight. And beyond the tall skies where snowflakes
continued to fall, Constellations were watching my tale. No indirect
messages reached me, but I could still feel that they were looking at me.
Probability they had gathered bit by bit until now was scattering gently in
the skies.

I turned my head to the side to find Han Sooyoung studying me. She
grasped my [Modifier Necklace] and grinned. "I guess you're no longer the
[Demon King] of [Salvation]. Shouldn't you get yourself a brand-new
Modifier now?"

I began recalling the days I spent as 'Demon King of Salvation' while
listening to her talk.

It hadn't been that long, but those days were the most brilliant moments in
my life.
As my vision grew wetter and blurrier, I could see Han Sooyoung giggling
away.

"Should I make one up for you, then? Mm… What will sound nice on you,
I wonder. How about 'I Pass Out Too Often-Man'? Or, 'Miraculous
Piehole'… Eh? H-hey, you are… crying?"

My face was reflected in her irises, her eyes widening in surprise.

Actually, I wanted to ask her, an author.

As she was a writer, maybe she'd be able to tell me straight.

Tell me that I did good until now – whether I made the wrong choices or
not, whether I would get to see the desired conclusion when I reach the end
of this story or not.

"Hey, why are you crying like that? I get it, okay? I get it, so stop. There,
there."

She must've thought up something, as she began rummaging through her
pockets next. Soon afterwards, something sweet and slightly sour entered
my mouth.

"Why are you crying on a nice day like today? I mean, it's even snowing,
too… I promise to think up a nice Modifier later on, okay?" Said Han
Sooyoung, before avoiding my gaze to stare into the far-off distance.

Today was the 15th of February.

That's what the smartphone said. However, the time of this place and that of
Earth weren't the same, therefore this indicator was simply an 'error'. It was
a coincidental date, with no meaning behind it.

Even then, what if there was some kind of a miracle and this date was
indeed true?
Then, today would be my birthday.

Han Sooyoung rubbed her eyes as she spoke. "I want to see the others
already."

I summoned up every ounce of my strength to make my reply. "…Yeah, me
too."

As if those words became the signal…

[Revised text has completed its update.]

A gift sent by someone arrived at my doorstep.

– Three Ways to Survive in a Ruined World (Final Revision).txt




Inside the scattering, falling snow, Yoo Joonghyuk was staring at the
'Castle of Reincarnators'.

Most likely, Kim Dokja had regained his consciousness by now. And Yoo
Sangah would be in the middle of reincarnation, having met the 'Master of
the Island' already.

'…That woman'.

A deep frown crept up on Yoo Joonghyuk's face.

He'd never be able to forget the moment when his head rammed into that
mysterious wall a few days ago. He got to forcibly observe that wall's
insides amidst the horrifying storm of Probability sparks. And that was
where he bore witness to fragments of a tale he didn't know before.
Some of them were as per his expectations, while some of them were
definitely news to him. Some of them even took him completely by
surprise, too.

It all happened for an instant, but he found the information he'd been
searching for from that wall, as well as the answers he wanted to find. And
now, he realized that it was time to put to practice the answers he found.
"Secretive Plotter."

He raised his head to greet the gaze of a certain scheming Constellation.

[Constellation, 'Secretive Plotter', is looking at you.]

The 'Secretive Plotter', the Constellation that made its first appearance in
this regression. And, an unidentified existence whose information or
evidence couldn't be found in any of the 1863 worlds.

[Constellation, 'Secretive Plotter', is looking at you.]

"Haven't I played along with your schemes long enough now? I'm sure that
I have the right to ask you a single question or two."

The 'Secretive Plotter' didn't reply for a brief moment. But then, a portion of
the skies suddenly became dyed in darkness, and a ray of black light fell
towards Yoo Joonghyuk.

Tsu-chuchuchuchut!

As the sparks from Probability crackled all around him, the space-time
within the near vicinity began distorting noticeably.

He was currently in the world ruled by the 'Master of the Island'; no
topranked Constellation would be able to exert that much Probability in this
place. Yet, the 'Secretive Plotter' was an existence who could do exactly
that.
A pitch-black shadow rose up within the darkness.

[What are you curious about, oh, the puppet of the Oldest Dream?]

"Why did you show me that book?"

The shadow of the 'Secretive Plotter' wavered about as if to mock him.

Yoo Joonghyuk continued with his questioning. "Did you want me to fall
into despair? You wanted me to kill Kim Dokja after reading that book?"

[Maybe. Maybe not.]

"Why did you plot something like that?"

[You think you can understand it after hearing the answer?]

Its arrogant voice was filled with the confidence of knowing that a lowly
being like him would never understand, even after hearing the truth.

Yoo Joonghyuk asked another question. "Why did you send Kim Dokja
to the 1863rd turn? Why did you order him to kill 'me' there?" [Let's just
say that such a scenario would've been fun to observe.] The shadow
wavered around as if it was cackling.

Yoo Joonghyuk remained calm and spoke his piece. "All of your schemes
were to destroy Kim Dokja."

[Why do you think that? Do you have any reasons to believe that's the
case?] "Maybe I do. Maybe I do have a pretty good reason."

This Constellation, holding a mysterious animosity towards Kim Dokja,
and at the same time, didn't exist in the 'original work', just like him.

Yoo Joonghyuk had been chasing after this Constellation for a long time.
And he had finally reached the answer to his pursuit in this very moment.

"Secretive Plotter. Are you the 'Kim Dokja' from the future?"
                Chapter 373: Ep. 71 - 50 years later, I


Four days passed by since we arrived on the 'Isle of Reincarnators'.

I confirmed through [Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint] that other
companions had completed their Middle Island scenarios and were ready to
tackle the next one.

Currently, I was staring at the screen of my phone.

– Three Ways to Survive in a Ruined World (Final Revision).txt

It was possible that the 'epilogue' I so wished to read was waiting for me at
the end of this text file. Was that all? If luck was on my side, I might even
discover some information on the current 3rd regression turn, too.

The guideline that told me how to act and how to clear upcoming scenarios
in order to reach the perfect ending might be there.

However…
⸢Wh at if the end of the story is tra ge dy?⸥

If, by any chance, the 'Final Revision' bit implied that 'it'll no longer
change'?

⸢Are you rea lly cap able of cha nging it?⸥

What if the action of me reading this thing only sets the ending in stone
instead?

"Kim Dokja."

I raised my head to spot Han Sooyoung, bandages wrapped around her left
hand, staring back at me. She was the only other existence remaining in this
world who read the 'Ways of Survival' besides me.

If she was in my shoes, how would she react?

If she was me, would she have opened this file?

"What are you looking at?"

"No, it's nothing."

I switched the phone's screen off.

There might come a day when I get curious about the contents of this story.
However, now wasn't it.

The 'epilogue' I wished to know probably wasn't in this file.

After finishing maintenance on her equipment, Han Sooyoung lightly
jumped off from the bed and spoke to me. "Let's get going. The longer we
dilly-dally, the further ahead that bastard Yoo Joonghyuk will get."

"We have someone to meet first before leaving, though."
"Who?"

"Looks like he's here already."

We heard knocking sounds as the door creaked open behind us.

The first thing we saw was the thick, brown-coloured Buddhist rosary hung
around the person's neck. Next up was the grey Buddhist monk robe, and
the firm, tough muscles peeking out from underneath it. He was a Warrior
Monk, who had gone through the repeated rigorous training for a very long
time.

"I've come to fetch you, Benefactor."

I nodded my head and replied back. "Guide me to your King, please."




{Three Ways to Survive in a Ruined World}

According to the analysis of the best expert alive on the novel 'Ways of
Survival' – me – the 'three ways' in its title referred to the three main
characters of the novel itself.

The first was the Regressor Yoo Joonghyuk.

The second was the Returnee Jang Hayoung.

And finally, the third was…

– There was another main character???

Han Sooyoung asked back hurriedly through [Midday Tryst], sounding a bit
flustered after listening to my tale. I remembered then that she wouldn't
have such information on her, since she only read up to 100 chapters or
so…

– But, then again, it'll be a huge ask to keep milking one main character
forover three thousand chapters, won't it?

…She still remained needlessly sharp, though.

– Besides all that, three protagonists, eh? As expected of this novel,
treadingon the sure-fire shortcut to the failed novel-dom like that.

I couldn't think up of a retort. Because that failed novel had messed up our
reality in a big way, hadn't it?

– So, the master of this castle is the 'Third MC', am I right?

– Yeah.

– How important is he in 'Ways of Survival'? As much as Yoo Joonghyuk?

– No, not really. Regardless of what, the main will always be
YooJoonghyuk.

For sure, the majority of the story spanning over 3000 chapters unfolded
with Yoo Joonghyuk as its focal point. The other two were called main
characters only according to the narrative description provided during the
story itself.

– However, the other two are just as monstrous as Yoo Joonghyuk,
alright.Especially in the current point of time, the 'third protagonist' is a far
stronger existence than Yoo Joonghyuk is.

– …Even more powerful than that dude?

I nodded my head while scanning the empty meditation chamber around us.
This was where the Reincarnators would perform penance and cleanse
themselves – a chamber designed to soothe one's mind, fatigued and frayed
by experiencing many cycles of Samsara.

I could hear the recitation of Buddhist scriptures coming from here and
there, but couldn't see the King anywhere.

"Where is the 'King of Reincarnators'?"

"The King is already with us."

"But, all I see are the baldy monks, though?"

Han Sooyoung's words were countered with an emotionless reply from the
Warrior Monk. "He is everywhere, yet at the same time, nowhere."

"I'm sure you didn't bring us here to crack jokes."

"He does not speak to those who lack the qualifications to see him."

"How amusing. Is that your way of bringing up the next topic of
conversation?" replied Han Sooyoung, as the corner of her lips curled
upwards.

I silently observed the expression of this mysterious Warrior Monk for a
while, before opening my lips to speak. "If your King is everywhere,
then that means anyone can become the 'king', doesn't it?" Geeee-iiiing!!

The Unbroken Faith held in my hand cried out sharply, and at the same
time, the illusory sword light shot out towards the Adam's apple of the
Warrior
Monk.

Tsu-chuchuchuchut!
As if an invisible wall was blocking it, the blade's tip pouring out powerful
magical energy came to a dead stop right in front of the Warrior Monk's
nose. He grinned and spoke.

[You've settled on a rather provocative solution. You're correct. Anyone
can become a Buddha once they become enlightened.]

His true voice reverberated throughout the space itself.

I withdrew my sword and observed the Warrior Monk once more. An
ethereal, subtle aura was oozing out from his entire body. His irises were
now dyed in pure white, and within them, the shadow of a mandala spun
anti-clockwise.

Most likely, this Warrior Monk was one of the countless Incarnations the
'King of Reincarnators' operated.

[However, you won't be able to continue on with the scenarios in that
fashion forever, oh, the apostle of ■■ who carries the weight of salvation.]

"Please, don't speak as if you're aware of all my methods."

I no longer thought of 'Ways of Survival' as a mere novel, and I definitely
didn't see my companions as simple 'characters' of it, as well. That didn't
mean that I would never utilise the information already in my possession,
though.

"It's a pleasure to make your acquaintance, the 'Mandala's Guardian'."

Even though [The Fourth Wall] was active, I was still subjected to a
considerable oppressive force. The 'friendly' Status in front of my eyes
wavered around gently. The true appearance of the formidable being slowly
materialised behind the Warrior Monk to our observing eyes.

There he was, the ruler of the most ancient stratum of darkness in existence.
Even if it were Metatron of <Eden> or the highest-ranked Demon Kings of
the Demon Realm, none of them could contend against this being within
this island.

['The Fourth Wall' is quivering its non-existent eyebrows.]

['Wall that Decides Samsara' is showing an interest in you.]

Tsu-chuchuchuchut!

Jang Hayoung's [Unidentifiable Wall], Metatron's [Wall Dividing Good and
Evil], and finally, the third wall – the 'Mandala's Guardian' was the owner
of the [Wall that Decides Samsara].

[I see that it's the 'fragment of the Final Wall'. I'm guessing that Nirvana is
trapped inside it?]

"You're correct."

[He was a child who could've become a good Bodhisattva. Unfortunately,
he met you and had to leave my path of Buddhism.]

"Well, I believe that the person in question feels satisfied."

It was around there that Han Sooyoung butted in to our conversation.

"Hold up… By any chance, are you the Buddha? THE Buddha?"

[There are many different types of Buddhas in this world, and I'm merely
one of them.]

Han Sooyoung now carried a dumbfounded expression on her face.

But then again, her reaction was wholly understandable, considering that a
Constellation claiming to be the Buddha had made his entrance. This
Buddha-nim carried a gentle smile as he spoke to me.
[I've watched your stories for a very long time, dear Bodhisattvas.]

"But, I don't remember receiving your sponsorships before?"

[There are those Constellations who would reveal their gazes and flaunt
their authority, and there are also those whose existence is a mystery. The
true Buddhist offerings aren't in the forms of sponsorships, but through
simple but meditative contemplations.]

"You sure can dress up the fact that you've been watching the show for free.
Alright, then. What is that you want from me?"

[What I want? Do you believe that this self wishes something from you,
dear Bodhisattva?]

I shifted my gaze over to the giant bell located in the middle of the
meditation chamber. A small soul wrapped in a blinding light was inside
the bell made out of transparent material.

I already knew whose soul that was.

"You've decided to reincarnate Yoo Sangah-ssi. Even though I didn't
request it of you."

[…]

"You have invited us here and allowed us to recover. Again, even though I
didn't request for your aid."

[Those are simply a part of one's path to attain Buddhahood.]

"There is this lesson I've learnt while dealing with Constellations until now.
And that would be, there is no Constellation in this world who doesn't
expect anything in return when helping you out."
[Dear Bodhisattva, you have arrived at a rather hasty conclusion. Only the
one placing faith in the exceptions of everything can discern the end of the
scenario.]

I wordlessly glared at the Warrior Monk, before pointing at the bell in the
center of the meditation chamber. I addressed the monk. "Don't confine the
Incarnation Yoo Sangah to this island, please. She is far more valuable than
you can imagine."

[All beings reincarnating on this island will become a part of the island.]

I shook my head. "Like what you said just now, there are exceptions to
everything, aren't there? She'll be able to pick up after where Nirvana left
off. Make Incarnation Yoo Sangah your new [Arahat]."

The 'Arahat', or the Seekers of Truth, were not shackled to the 'Isle of
Reincarnators', and were free to roam the worlds of scenarios and continue
to experience the cycles of reincarnation.

"I'm willing to make the deal with you when you do that."

[Making a deal, is it. Do you believe that you know what this self wishes
for?]

"Isn't it to stop the 'Great War of Saints and Demons'?"

[A futile attempt, that is. This self does not hold any interest in the
contradictory Stories such as 'Good' and 'Evil'.]

"Even when those contradictory Stories are about to make an unholy mess
out of your island?"

As if he found this topic rather amusing, the eyes of the Warrior Monk
arced rather elegantly.
The 'Mandala's Guardian' was neither on the side of 'Good' nor 'Evil'. If I
were to describe it in words, then he was an existence far closer to
'nothingness'. So, there was just no way that such a being would welcome
the authorities of 'Good' and 'Evil' growing larger within his territory.

"I'll try to stop the 'Great War of Saints and Demons'." [Do

you believe such a thing is achievable with your power?]

My Stories replied in place of me.

[Giant Story, 'Demon Realm's Spring', is bellowing out!]

[Giant Story, 'Torch that Swallowed the Myth', is growling menacingly!]

The air in the surroundings began trembling unstably as the two Giant
Stories revved their engines.

If my guess was correct, then the 'Mandala's Guardian' wouldn't be able to
reject my offer. Because he couldn't take part in the upcoming 'Great War
of Saints and Demons', that's why.

As a being who was neither 'Good' nor 'Evil', he had no pretext to enter the
war.

[…Is the Incarnation named 'Yoo Sangah' becoming this self's 'Arahat' your
only wish, dear Bodhisattva?]

"One other thing."

[You are a greedy Bodhisattva, it seems.]

"Allow my Nebula to start the Great War from the area we prefer. As the
master of the island, I believe that you can interfere with the proceedings at
least that much."
At that moment, I sensed the quickening of the faint magical energy from
throughout the entire temple. It was a riot of Status, as if to make its
existence known to me. It was a Status possessing a certain aura that wasn't
at all threatening or murderous, but nevertheless, something that I couldn't
even hope to come close to yet.

['The Fourth Wall' is strongly activating!]

['Wall that Decides Samsara' is smacking its lips.]

A short while later, the 'Mandala's Guardian' nodded his head.

[I agree to your conditions, dear Bodhisattva. Unfortunately, it's not
possible for the whole of your Nebula to start from your preferred area on
the Main Island.]

"In that case, I ask of you to send Incarnations Lee Gilyoung and Shin
Yoosung at the least."

[H-mm… Where do you wish to send them?]

"The Next City."

[The Next City, is it… Oh my, dear Bodhisattva, could it be…]

If it was the 'Mandala's Guardian', he should have cottoned onto what I was
planning here by now.

The Main Island of the 'Isle of Reincarnators' was where the Stories from
the 3rd generation had been stuck frozen in time. As these Stories boasted a
far wider spectrum of variety compared to 1st and 2nd generations, your
starting point played a factor in you acquiring unexpected Stories.

Even if others couldn't, I had to ensure that those two kids would start from
the 'Next City'.
[…In return, the rest of your companions will start in locations that this self
has selected.]

"Understood."

Han Sooyoung standing next to me, silently observing the unfolding
situation until then, sent me a probing glance after hearing my reply.

– Hey, you. What will you do if this baldy monk sends us to a weird place?

The Warrior Monk saw us get into a bit of argument and a strange smile
suddenly crept up on his lips. [Dear Bodhisattva, this self truly enjoys
watching your story, but… Unfortunately, the Stories you have
accumulated so far is simply too inadequate to contend with other Nebulas
participating in the Great War of Saints and Demons.]

Maybe she felt a bit triggered by the word 'inadequate', Han Sooyoung
began to retort in a snarky manner. "…Looks like you haven't heard the
news that we smashed apart <Olympus> not too long ago."

[The Stories dear Bodhisattvas have accumulated are indeed peerless, but
they haven't experienced the trials and tribulations of time itself.]

In the next moment, both Han Sooyoung's body and mine were suddenly
wrapped up in bright light.

[Constellation, 'Mandala's Guardian' has agreed with your transfer to the
next scenario.]

[Transfer to the next scenario has begun!]

…So suddenly?


I was taken by surprise a little, but quickly regained my bearings.
Finally, I was heading towards the location of the third Giant Story that'd
complete the 'Twist'.

Most likely, my other companions were in the middle of transferring, just
like me. I shifted my head to find Han Sooyoung looking up at me.

"Kim Dokja."

I reflexively extended my hand towards her and replied. "Do your best. I'll
try to find you as soon as possible."

"…Yeah, right."

The moment Han Sooyoung's fist bumped into mine, she was completely
enveloped in bright light. As I watched her figure disappear, I became
aware once more that she had become my companion for real.

Like back when Yoo Joonghyuk said it, Han Sooyoung had become an
indispensable existence for me to reach my desired conclusion.

On my way to this place, I ended up owing her a lot. So, it was time that I
pay my debt.

⸢However, Kim Dokja of then had no idea.⸥

It was also in that very moment that the screen of my phone began glowing
brightly, as well. Words from a page I didn't recognise began rising up line
after line in front of my eyes as if to foreshadow an ominous future.

⸢He didn't know that, by the time Kim Dokja got to meet her again…⸥

No, hang on a minute here.

⸢50 years had passed by already.⸥

…What the hell?!
                Chapter 374: Ep. 71 - 50 years later, II


50 years? What the hell was that all about?

As my vision grew blurrier, I caught the smile floating up on the Warrior
Monk's lips.

– Oh, dear Bodhisattva. Please, try to endure time itself.

[Transfer to the Main Island has begun!]

['Wall that Decides Samsara' is investigating information of your Stories!]

[Investigation has concluded!]

[The scenario location for you and your companions has been decided.]

This was the very last message I heard before losing my consciousness.

[Sub-scenario, 'Genre Selection', has begun!]
Ricardo stared into the pitch-black liquid filling up his transparent cup and
recalled the memories of the distant past.

⸢"Even if you train for 50 years, it'll be difficult for you to become a royal
court mage."⸥
That was back when he first started learning magic.

⸢"You don't seem to possess the suitable constitution to become a scholar."⸥

That was when the number one scholar in the Kaizenix Archipelago came
to tutor him.

⸢"Your hands are not suited to holding a sword."⸥

And that was back when he grabbed a sword for the first time in the royal
swordsmanship training grounds.

⸢"Some lives are like that. What's important is to never fall into despair and
continue to strive forward, son."⸥
Ricardo's father, Verchen Von Kaizenix, said those words.

That couldn't console him, though. A man who had no talent nor desire to
do anything wouldn't be consoled after hearing those words, anyway.

Even with no talent, he should strive forward regardless? What would he
become if he continued to live on like that, anyway?

Ricardo drunk himself into a stupor every single day. He hung around with
the archipelago's worst hooligans and did drugs. He even became addicted
to gambling and squandered away the fortunes of his family, too.
He even fell in love. Once upon a time.

She was older, and the most beautiful woman in the entire archipelago.
Unfortunately, even that had to end after she married his oldest brother.

Ricardo stared at that black liquid and muttered to himself.

"I'll just kill myself."

That resolution was the first time he swallowed the brave pill in his life.

He lightly grasped the cup, and as if drinking wine, he emptied its contents
in one go. Its effect manifested itself not too long afterwards. His
complexion became dark and lifeless, and his arms faltered to the side with
no energy.

And exactly four hours later.

Someone else opened his eyes in Ricardo's body.




Besides 'Ways of Survival', I had read quite a few other stories. When I was
young, I read those great works of literature my mother recommended, and
after I grew up a bit, I began selecting books on my own volition to read.

As an aside, the very first web-novel I read began with its protagonist
harping on about his misfortune while dying before waking back up again.

Just like now.

"Blergh…!"

"Your highness! Prince Ricardo! Are you alright, my lord?"
Someone was patting me on the back, and I vomited out the contents of my
stomach for a long time.

I wiped my mouth and raised my head only to discover a mirror. The
handsome face reflected in it was pale and charmingly attractive.

…It was definitely my face, but something felt unfamiliar about it.

Who was I?

…Ricardo…?

⸢"You probably know this already, but I'm not a prophet. No, I am as far
removed from such a being as you can get."⸥
I am…

⸢"I'm not the 'Demon King of Salvation'. I'm also not the 'King of a
Kingless World'."⸥
I am…?

⸢"Twenty-eight… No, wait. I was twenty-eight, and I was an employee of a
game company. My hobby was reading web-novels…"⸥
[Your Stories are resisting against the Giant Story that sets this world's
view!]

[Exclusive skill, 'The Fourth Wall', is strongly activating!]

I slowly closed my eyes before opening them again, and was immediately
overcome with the sensation of the world separating itself from me.

['The Fourth Wall' has impeded your character immersion.]

[Due to the effect of 'The Fourth Wall', your ego has been fully retained.]
[Probability of the Island is suspicious of your preferential treatment.]

I was greeted by the feelings of an unfamiliar body. This one didn't belong
to me.

⸢I am Kim Dokja.⸥

My consciousness returned to me in full, and the chain of memories was
organised in an instant. I was participating in the 'Great War of Saints and
Demons' scenario, and had just entered the Main Island.

It was awash with the various spectrum of 3rd generation Stories.
Different Stories created different genres of worldviews, and the one right
in front of my eyes was… "…Body possession." Tsu-chuchuchuchut!

[A term not aligned with the worldview has been spoken!]

[Penalty will be imposed!]

By the time I woke up again, two hours would have passed by.




"Your highness, are you feeling alright?"

Someone was calling out to me from beyond my hazy view.

"…Please, may I have some water?"

[You have used language not in line with the worldview!]

[Penalty will…]

"…Hand me some water."
"Here it is."

After drinking large gulps of cold water, I felt my reasoning return bit by
bit. My head was in a mess as the memories of someone else rushed in. I
was now occupying the body of a man who had already lived for over 30
years.

⸢In certain areas on the 'Main Island', words that don't align with the
applicable worldview will be prohibited from being spoken.⸥
I could just about remember some stuff from the 'Ways of Survival'.
Although this particular turn barely got a passing mention, the novel
definitely did feature a scenario such as this one.

The so-called 'Possession scenario'.

I'd be advancing the scenario 'Great War of Saints and Demons' from this
person's perspective from here onwards.

[It is impossible to summon a Dokkaebi when in the applicable area.]

[You are unable to receive indirect messages from the Constellations when
in the applicable area.]

…Not only that, strange restrictions were in place, too. This was a different
development from the 'Great War of Saints and Demons' that I knew of.

"…Looks like I'll have to collect information first."

[You have performed actions befitting the personality of the host body.]

[Your understanding of the applicable host body is increasing.]

Straight away, I began rummaging through the memories from the 'Ways of
Survival'.
⸢The Kaizenix Archipelago, the isle of heroes that led the Age of Saints and
Demons.⸥
I couldn't really recall any particularly useful information. Why did it have
to be an area that didn't get much of a mention in the 'Ways of Survival'?

But, it didn't feel like a completely foreign place to me, though…

Was that because of the memories of the person I had possessed
overflowing into me?

[Exclusive skill, 'Character List', has been activated!]

Now originally, I couldn't see my Attribute Window. However, if it was the
one belonging to the host body that I took over, then…
<Character Summary>

Name: Ricardo Von Kaizenix (Kim Dokja)

Age: 31

Sponsor: None (Currently, '1' Constellation has shown interest.)

Exclusive Attributes: A Gifted Hoodlum

Exclusive Skills: [Royalty's Outer Appearance Lv.3], [Soliloquy Lv.6],
[Roleplay Lv.5]

Stigma: None

Overall Stats: [Physique Lv. 10], [Strength Lv.10], [Agility Lv.10], [Magic
Power Lv.10]

Overall Evaluation: The person you have taken over is the 4th Prince of the
Kaizenix Archipelago. Unfortunately, he lacks talent in all types of combat
abilities, including swordsmanship, magic, etc.

* Currently afflicted by Abnormal Status Condition: 'Possessed'.


…Why was I stuck inside such a guy's body?

The scenario's message definitely told me that I'd occupy a 'host related to
me'. However, what did this wastrel prince have in common with me? Not
only that, this dude's natural muscular stat was 10. The only thing similar
between us would be our age, but even then…

"Your highness, are you immersing yourself in roleplay once more?"

"Roleplay?"
"Last time, you were imitating our First Ancestor… You're now wearing an
outfit that I haven't seen before, your highness. You're dressed like the
people from Earth's chronicles, sir."

I took a look at the mirror without thinking too much about it and spotted
the familiar outfit. Bizarrely enough, all my equipment had been transferred
along with my possession of the host body.

I replied in a dead-pan manner. "It's an outfit of a certain Demon King."

"…A Demon King, your highness?"

I reached into the coat's inner pocket, and fortunately enough, I could
feel the equipment I possessed still in there. I took out my smartphone
first. In order to acquire more info on this place, I needed to check the
contents of the 'Ways of Survival'… Tsu-chuchuchut!

[The applicable item does not line up with the worldview and therefore
cannot be used.]

…Screw this damn penalty.

The butler alongside me must've interpreted my actions in his own way,
since he spoke as thus. "Indeed, your highness, it'll be better to enjoy
yourself for one last time. Soon, 'his' majesty will call for you. Well, then."

Leaving behind those words, the butler went away from my side. And I was
left all alone in this small room.

⸢Kim Dok ja is lone ly.⸥

Right, it's a relief that at least you're here with me. I wonder what had
happened to my other companions…
According to the last message I heard, it was highly probable that they all
ended up in the same area as me. For the time being, I switched the scenario
window on. The backlogged messages rose up non-stop in my view.

[You have entered Main Island's 'Kaizenix Archipelago'.]

['Kaizenix Archipelago' is currently cut off from the 'Great War of Saints
and Demons' conflict region's space-time.]

[You can advance to the 'Great War of Saints and Demons' after solving the
applicable area's sub-scenario.]

I'd probably have to raise an army here and participate in the 'Great War of
Saints and Demons'. Meaning, this place would serve as a foundation to
enter that war.

[You can't view the information on the scenario yet.]

[The plot of the applicable scenario will change according to the route you
have chosen.]

The route I've chosen?

No, hang on a minute. At least I need to know what the conditions for
failure is, so I can…

[You won't fail the applicable scenario as long as you do not die.]

Now, this kind of situation would be my first.

In any case, I wouldn't fail this scenario as long as I stay alive, was that it? I
sat down on the bed and calmly organised my thoughts.

My name in the current worldview was Ricardo Von Kaizenix.

As this scenario was built upon the basis of 'possession', I had to perfectly
carry on acting like the prince I took over.
My current priority should be to search for the other members of <Kim
Dokja's Company>. It was highly possible that they were possessing other
people like me, so only after I find them would I be…

"Your highness, are you in? It's Knight Bilston."

Just as I began thinking, someone knocked on the door.

The Knight Bilston Framer – if Ricardo's memories were correct, then that
guy was supposed to be my escort knight.

"His majesty is calling for you, your highness."

The moment he pushed open the door to enter the room, I was immediately
taken over by this unexplainable feeling. The person standing before me
was a knight boasting white moustache in his early 40s. Without a doubt, I
should've been unfamiliar with his appearance. But then…

[Your Stories are reacting towards the applicable individual!]

[Exclusive attribute, 'Scenario Interpreter', is displaying its effect!]

The knight's face was changing bit by bit.

⸢"…Ja-ssi"⸥

A voice that I really missed entered my head, even though it hadn't been
that long since last I heard it.

⸢"Back when I was still in the military, there was an incident where I lost a
spent cartridge."⸥
The Story accumulated within the man was talking to me right now. Words
that lost the majority of their strength were desperately pleading with me
regarding something.
⸢"I told myself to never lose one ever again."⸥

I knew the owner of that particular Story well.

"…Hyunsung-ssi?"

When I spoke up, Lee Hyunsung stared back at me.

[Applicable individual does not understand your words.]

"It is you, isn't it? Hyunsung-ssi?"

[Applicable individual does not understand your words.]

[Applicable worldview has recommended that you perfectly act according
to the role you were given.]

Lee Hyunsung staring at me with vacant eyes soon formed an awkward grin
and replied back. "Hyunsung? Haha, are you still in the middle of your
roleplay, your highness? May I be permitted to inquire as to who you were
imitating just now?"

It seemed that Lee Hyunsung couldn't recognise me at all – along with an
expression of someone who didn't remember me on his face.

I called out his name. "Lord Bilston."

"Yes, your highness."

"Do you not recognise this outfit?"

"Mm… Is that the outfit of the Demon Hunters? Or, maybe, a member of
Revolutionaries…"

Although my current face was different, my current attire was the white
coat that I've been wearing all along. If this man was really Lee Hyunsung,
there was just no way that he'd not recognise it.
But the fact that he still failed to do so could only mean…

  Name: Bilston Framer (???)

  Age: 43

  Sponsor: None

  Exclusive Attributes: Loyalty, An Honourable Knight

  Exclusive Skills: [Rapid Reaction Force Lv.8], [Kingdom's Royal
  Swordsmanship Lv.8]

  Stigma: None

  Overall Stats: [Physique Lv.80], [Strength Lv. 80], [Agility Lv. 80],
  [Magic Power Lv. 80]

  Overall Evaluation: Once upon a time, there used to be two souls living
  within this body. He was a knight of the kingdom, and at the same time,
  a shield of someone else. The shield waited for his master to appear. He
  waited, and then waited some more. Finally, the master of the shield
  has appeared after a long wait, but the shield can no longer perform its
  role anymore.


While reading the explanation in the Attribute Window over and over
again, I recalled the Invincible Fist Yoo Hoseong's warning.

– When you get to the Main Island, be careful of the 'Giant Story'
– If it's a Giant Story, I think I can control it now.

– I didn't mean it that way. You will end up fighting against a Giant
Storyitself when you get there.

Only then did I understand the meaning behind those words.

I raised my head to sense the movement of a gigantic Probability encasing
the entirety of the archipelago. Something was staring at me. Something
that was neither a Constellation nor a Demon King.

[Giant Story, 'Kaizenix Archipelago', is avariciously staring at

you.] I clenched my fists and bit down on my lip.

The still-oblivious Lee Hyunsung continued to mutter to himself in the
meantime. "Hmm, if it's not the Revolutionaries, then maybe, another
kingdom's…"

The Lee Hyunsung that I knew had been swallowed up by this world and
disappeared already.
               Chapter 375: Ep. 71 - 50 years later, III


While on our way to the audience chamber, I continued to engage Bilston
in conversation. "Bilston-nim. By any chance, have you lost anything
recently? Maybe often, as well? For instance, an empty cartridge…"

"Pardon?"

[A term not fitting the worldview has been used and therefore…]

"I mean, such as misplacing a portable magical explosive…"

"Your highness, do I look like such a pathetic fool capable of doing

that?" I just couldn't think of what to say here.

When looking at that stiff walking posture or the firm pectoral muscles, or
even that slightly dopey expression on his face, this guy was definitely Lee
Hyunsung, but… But, according to 'Character List', he was not him, but the
character of this world's setting, 'Bilston Framer'.
I re-read the 'Overall Evaluation' portion at the bottom of the Character List.
– Once upon a time, there used to be two souls living within this body. He
was a knight of the kingdom, and at the same time, a shield of someone
else.

The 'knight of the kingdom' bit must be referring to 'Bilston Framer', while
the 'shield' bit must be referring to Lee Hyunsung.

– The shield waited for his master to appear. He waited, and then, waited
some more. Finally, the master of the shield has appeared after a long wait,
but the shield can no longer perform its role anymore.

The most important portion was this part. I kind of realized that Lee
Hyunsung had been waiting for other companions to arrive.

The issue here was with the number – just how much time was this 'long
wait' thing implying here?

"Your highness?"

I couldn't help but feel complicated when looking at the man staring back at
me with those dopey eyes.

There were only two things I could be sure of at the current juncture.

One, Lee Hyunsung had been entered into this scenario far earlier than me.

Two, he had been swallowed up by this world's Giant Story and his ego had
disappeared.

[Giant Story, 'Kaizenix Archipelago', is smacking its lips in your direction.]

['The Fourth Wall' is glaring at 'Kaizenix Archipelago'.]

In that case, could the others who didn't possess [The Fourth Wall] have
ended up in the same state as Lee Hyunsung?
"Your highness, did something happen?"

I wordlessly stared into Bilston's large eyes.

This guy was definitely Lee Hyunsung. But, could he really be called 'Lee
Hyunsung' right now?

"I'm sorry, Bilston-nim."

"I beg your pardon? Why so suddenly…"

"I must've put you through a lot of hardship. I know that it was difficult for
you to protect me until now."

I wasn't addressing Bilston Framer right now.

"I always used the excuse of being too busy and didn't take good care of
you. Even though you have saved my life several times already."

Lee Hyunsung helped me out many times during our journey towards this
scenario. I had enough chances to share a deep, meaningful and personal
conversation with him, but as it was the usual case, his spot in the queue
continued to get pushed back under the pretext of me preparing for the next
scenario.

I believed that we understood each other without the need to say something.
I believed that the Stories we earned together could ably sub for us in that
regard.

And the end result of that was this.

Bilston must've thought of something after he heard me because he wiped
his nostrils while shifting his gaze to the outside view.

"Your highness, you really do possess a warm, gentle heart."
[Character, 'Bilston Framer', has been moved deeply by you.]

…I wasn't trying to impress him but someone else, though.

Without saying anything else, we continued down the long hallway.

Portraits of the previous kings lined up the walls of the hallway in
sequence. The one that caught my eyes the most among them was a
depiction of a lone man holding up a broken sword in the middle of a
storm.

– The First Ancestor, the Storm King Ulysses Kaizenix the First.

I stopped walking for a moment and studied that painting.

"It has been my honour to serve you throughout my life, your highness."

I turned my head around, and Bilston began telling his tale as thick
teardrops formed around his eyes. He locked his gaze at the distant parapets
of the castle and continued on.

"Can you still remember it? I almost lost you when you were around seven
years old, your highness."

"…Mm?"

"Just by recalling the sight of you precariously dangling on the castle's
parapet still causes my heart to tumble to the pits of my stomach, your
highness. Was that all? When you were thirteen years old, you went to the
lavatory and then…"

Hey, hang on a minute, this dude… He's way too similar to Lee Hyunsung,
wasn't he?

"But then, you're still worried about this lowly one even until the last
moment…"
"Last moment??"

Bilston stared back at me with sorrowful eyes, before quickly avoiding
meeting my gaze.

"…We've arrived. Let us go inside."

The doors to the audience chamber were before us already; they opened up
to reveal the royal guards lining up on either side of the red carpet. And the
captain of the guards, decked out in the silver crest, stood proudly in the
middle.

"Bilston-nim, why are you so late?"

"I was sharing a final goodbye with his highness the prince."

There were several spots in their conversation that I wanted to butt in, but
thanks to the overall atmosphere, I couldn't squeak a word out.

Bilston, who had been in a tearful mood only a minute ago was now
carrying a grave, serious expression. The gazes of two people growling at
each other collided in mid-air.

The captain continued on. "A final goodbye, is it. A traitor found guilty of
high treason dares to enjoy unnecessary luxury."

"You better watch what you say."

The two of them got into a battle stance simultaneously. Bilston pulled out
a bastard sword, while the captain… Eh?

…Why was this person carrying that sword?

Indeed, the weapon held in the captain's hands was something that I was
intimately familiar with. I personally collected the materials and had it
crafted for the sake of a certain someone, after all.
[Sword of Judgement]

"Bilston-nim, do you wish to become another dewdrop of the execution
ground alongside your prince?"

The captain's red eyes wavered threateningly from beyond 'his' helm.

⸢"Oh, my king… If you will it, then so be it…"⸥

⸢"Dokja-ssi, you're trying to do it by yourself again… I told you not to do
that, didn't I?"⸥

I knew who this person was.

"Stop, both of you!!"

Bilston heard my urgent cry and stopped gathering momentum, and stepped
back. Meanwhile, the captain of the guard, glaring at me with hostile eyes,
removed 'his' helm.

And 'his' face matched exactly that of Jung Heewon's.

 Name: Erich Striker (???)

 Age: 37

 Stigma: None

 Overall Stats: [Physique Lv.75], [Strength Lv.80], [Agility Lv.90],
 [Magic Power Lv.70]

 Overall Evaluation: Once upon a time, there used to be two souls living
 within this body. 'He' was the Guard Captain of the kingdom, and at
 the same time, a sword of someone else. The sword waited for that
 someone to appear with the shield. 'He' waited, and then, waited some
 more. Finally, the sword met the one he'd been waiting for after all this
 time, but 'he' can no longer remember him.



Bloody hell, even Jung Heewon was in that state, too?

The captain staring at me with quiet, still eyes eventually spoke up. "It
seems that the prince is aware of the situation he is in. Guards, place the
criminal under arrest."

…Under arrest?
I was caught by the guards without a chance to resist. But then again, I
couldn't fight back even if I wanted to, what with this body's average Stats
being only 10.

I could see the guillotine beyond the lines of the guards. Only then did I
realize why I was brought to this place in the first place.

It was quite likely that this scenario would begin with my execution.




Among all the novels I read in the past, there was this genre referred to as
the so-called 'hooligan tales'.

The story usually went along the lines of the hooligan protagonist being
born as the last-born child of a royal family or nobility, and he'd become a
better person by going through all sorts of trials and tribulations.

Now normally, most of those stories began in a similar way.

⸢The Kaizenix Royal Family was ruined.⸥

Such as, the family being ruined even before the start, and…

⸢The ruler of the Archipelago died after being stabbed by the dagger of his
most trusted adviser.⸥
…And, he'd fall into moments of mortal danger after his parents and best
friends were killed off.

⸢The Second Prince, renowned for his mastery of the sword, and the Third
Prince, renowned for his magical prowess, lost their lives at the hands of
the usurpers.⸥
…What the hell. What was I supposed to do when such important
memories came back to me only just now?

"I shall guide the criminal personally."

All thanks to that, I ended up delivering myself to my own execution
ground like an idiot. Many different thoughts floated up in my head; I was
wondering why this wastrel killed himself, but huh, maybe he didn't want to
be executed?

Bilston, now being forcibly held back by the guards, could only call out to
me in desperation. "Your highness! Prince Ricardo!!"

The captain grabbed a hold of my hair and dragged me towards the gallows.
If Jung Heewon's consciousness was still here, this would've turned into a
rather amusing spectacle, but alas.

I spotted a lunette designed to perfectly accommodate my neck. In a short
while, I'd be forced up on the gallows and have my head cut off. And when
that happened, I'd fail this scenario.

[Unique Skill, 'the Fourth Wall', is strongly activating!]

I looked up at the face of the Guard Captain and asked 'him'. "Are you
really going to do this?"

The captain smirked back. "Oh, so you feel scared now that you've come
this far?"

"That's not it."

"Then what?"

"Didn't you promise to become my sword?"

A faint sense of fluster floated up on the Captain's face.
"What rubbish are you spewing now?"

"Have you forgotten your pledge already? Was that all a lie, your promise
of seeing the end of the scenario alongside me?"

[Character, 'Erich Striker', is feeling a small amount of confusion towards
you.]

"Looks like you've begun rambling nonsense now that you're about to die."

Just like it was with Lee Hyunsung, Jung Heewon's ego didn't want to
return that quickly.

The coldness of the wooden lunette surrounded my neck. It was at this
point in time that someone loudly shouted out.

"Her majesty is making her entrance!"

I heard the sounds of curtains being pulled back. Someone was walking
towards the audience chamber enveloped in still silence. The footsteps
sounded dignified, light, but at the same time, weighty. Accompanying
those footsteps, Ricardo's memories flowed into my head like a song.

⸢The enemy of my father and my brothers.⸥

⸢The Dark Magician of the Kaizenix Archipelago.⸥

⸢The regicide.⸥

⸢And…⸥

My heart began powerfully pounding away.

⸢The woman that I used to love.⸥
"Convict, raise your head."

I slowly raised my head and saw a short-statured 'king', decked out in a
black medieval-style cloak embroidered in silver, with neat and tidy tights
underneath.

"Do you have any final words?"

I dazedly stared at this 'king' and murmured something inside my mouth.

  <Character Summary>

  Name: ???

  Age: 50

  Overall Evaluation: The applicable individual's? overall? rating? is still
  being pre?pared.


The info on the 'King' didn't show up properly. However, her face looked to
be in her early 20s no matter how hard I looked.

I stared at the face of this king, the one that couldn't be the age as declared
by the Character Summary, for a long time.

Both Lee Hyunsung and Jung Heewon were characters from the pages of
the 'Ways of Survival'. However, what would it be like for someone who
wasn't a character, to begin with?
Just like me, who wasn't the character of the novel?

I was holding onto a certain expectation, a hope.

"I asked you if you have any last words."

If it was her, wouldn't she be able to remember me?

⸢He didn't know that, by the time Kim Dokja got to meet her again, 50 years
would have passed by already.⸥
Those were the words from the final revision of the novel that I saw just
before I was thrust into the scenario.

So, this was what they meant, huh.

"I have."

"Then, I permit the convict to speak."

"I…" I forced a smile and spoke up. "…I'm sorry that I came so late,
Sooyoung-ah."

Tsu-chuchuchuchut!

Powerful sparks wrapped around me from my declaration that didn't align
with the worldview's Probability. I had to say those words out loud, though.

It was unknown how Han Sooyoung took my words, but she simply
continued to look down on me without any movement whatsoever. But
then, she slowly lowered her head and matched my eye level.

Her emotionless eyes; the beauty spot just below one of them; and her lips
that always mocked me for fun, now arching up in a smooth line.

"Proceed with the execution."
The guillotine's blade chopped down. But, I didn't try to dodge it.

I had my reasons, of course.

⸢Scenarios of the Main Island are all based off on the '3rd generation of
Stories'.⸥

If my thoughts were correct, then 'Ricardo Kaizenix' would not be killed off
in this manner.

Ka-booooom!!

One of the castle's walls exploded, and at the same time, the guillotine
falling down was destroyed. I could see the broken blade of the guillotine
through the grey dust cloud rising up.

"It's the Revolutionaries!"

"Protect her majesty, now!"

Amidst the chaos, I could hear the loud shouts of the royal guards. Soon,
the audience chamber became the scene of pure pandemonium filled with
pained moans and screams.

"Damn it, it's the First Prince!"

"Stop him! You must stop him at all cost!"

It was the First Prince of the Kaizenix Archipelago – Ricardo's blood
brother, as well as a genius in swordsmanship and magic as well as
academia.

"I've come to save my dongsaeng."

I was greeted by this overflowing sense of happiness. When the
arrestinglybeautiful sword light danced and sparkled within the audience
chamber, the royal guards rushing in all collapsed one after another like
puppets with strings cut.

There was someone who'd never change even if the worldview or scenarios
around him did. Indeed, there would ever be only one such person even if
you searched through this entire world-line.

But, I closed my lips just as they opened up half-way. I wasn't sure why,
though.

[Giant Story, 'Kaizenix Archipelago', is enjoying the bloody, gory battle.]

My companions so far had forgotten about me. I was sure it'd be the same
story for that dude, too. In a way, it might be the best thing for him, I
thought.

[Story, 'Life and Death Companions', has begun its storytelling.]

It was then – the First Prince suddenly glared at me.

And then, a message popped up in my head.

– You fool. You must be Kim Dokja.
                  Chapter 376: Ep. 71 - 50 years later, IV


– Capture them! Apprehend the eldest Prince first!

– They are taking the Fourth Prince away!

Angry Reincarnators inside the screen were pouring out a barrage of arrows
and sword lights. And there were two men running within the thick,
choking smoke – Yoo Joonghyuk and Kim Dokja.

[Baat, baaaht!]

With a very restless expression on her face, Biyoo jumped up and down in
the air like a ball of mochi.

Arrows flew past Kim Dokja's head with barely any room to spare; some of
them even accurately fell towards his back, but the First Prince quickly
swung his sword to deflect them all.

– Retreat!
With that order, the revolutionaries receded away. And there were
Constellations watching this spectacle from afar.

[Constellation, 'Father of the Rich Night', is gazing at 'Kaizenix
Archipelago'.]

[Constellation, 'Queen of the Darkest Spring', is looking at the
Underworld's successor.]

[Constellation, 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon', is roaring out in frustration!]

Unfortunately, their messages couldn't reach the Incarnations within the
channel.

[Constellation, 'Demon-like Judge of Fire', is pleading for at least one
message to get through!]

[Constellation, 'Demon-like Judge of Fire', is requesting for the permission
to send indirect messages…]

[Baat, baaaht.]

With a sad look, Biyoo shook her head.

Dokkaebis might possess the authority to change broadcast set-up of their
channels, but the situation this time with the 'Isle of Reincarnators' was a
rather unique one.

[Constellation, 'Demon-like Judge of Fire', is glaring at the 'Mandala's
Guardian'.]

The one who offered up the stage for the scenario of the 'Great War of
Saints and Demons' was the master of the 'Isle of Reincarnators', 'Mandala's
Guardian'. He was not allowed to participate in this scenario personally, but
at the same time, was given the same level of authority to interfere as the
high-ranking Dokkaebis during this war.
[Oh, young angel, that is regrettably impossible to do so. Unless, you
decide to convert to the path of Buddhism through this opportunity.]

[Constellation, 'Demon-like Judge of Fire', is throwing a temper tantrum.]

[You should be mindful of your temper. Those with much anger in them
will get consumed by it later.]

[A great number of Constellations are expressing their indignation!]

Not caring whether they were furious or not, the 'Mandala's Guardian'
continued to stare with quiet, distant eyes at Kim Dokja inside the screen –
as if he was searching for a certain profound epiphany from that man's face.

[Channels nearby are momentarily being frozen!]

Tsu-chuchuchut…

It was around then that someone revealed himself in the air accompanied by
a sudden storm of sparks. The 'Mandala's Guardian' shifted his disinterested
eyes in that direction.

[This one doesn't recall giving entry permission to a Dokkaebi from the
Bureau.]

[I simply had to come with the situation being what it is, oh, 'King of
Reincarnators'.]

The one that appeared was the historical-grade Dokkaebi, Bihyung. He
courteously performed the Buddhist-style greeting and began his
questioning right away.

[I'm aware that you possess ten different names. Sakya, Sakyamuni,
Siddhartha, Tathagata, Sugata, Buddha… Which one among them are you,
exactly?]
The expression on the Guardian's face shifted ever so slightly after hearing
Bihyung's question. The fact was, he would transform into a different
existence according to the name he currently possessed.

[This one is currently Sakyamuni.]

[Sakyamuni, please cancel the abnormal scenario currently imposed on the
Nebula <Kim Dokja's Company>.]

[That is contrary to our prior agreement. Have you not handed over all
control of the preparatory scenarios to me?]

[I believe you were strongly requested to remain neutral in the upcoming
'Great War of Saints and Demons'.]

Bihyung's sharp gaze landed firmly on Sakyamuni. The Warrior Monk's
eyes quietly held that gaze, and the mandala within them reversed their
spinning direction.

[Well. This one isn't the first person to stop being neutral, it seems.]

[Can you clarify that, please?]

[I heard recently that there is an historical-grade Dokkaebi greatly
favouring Incarnations from a certain Nebula.]

Right after Sakyamuni finished replying in a subtle but accusatory tone of
voice, Biyoo popped up in mid-air and plopped her soft tummy on top of
Bihyung's head.

[Are you here because of the Bureau, or by your own volition?]

Bihyung lightly bit his lip, but didn't provide an answer. Instead, he looked
at Kim Dokja in the screen, currently breaking past the clouds of explosions
and running away.
[The trial you have put them in is far too excessive. It might be only a blink
to the Constellations, but that length of time is as much as one's lifespan
from a human's perspective.]

[This one was also a human once upon a time. And this scenario is a
necessity. Especially if they are to reach the ■■.]

[…Sakyamuni.]

[Oh Dokkaebi, the celebration of the end will soon commence.]

The mandala within Sakyamuni's eyes continued to spin. And the faint
figures of Kim Dokja and Yoo Joonghyuk could be seen above the spinning
Mandalas.

[Which ■■ will you vote for?]




With the aid of Yoo Joonghyuk, I was able to safely escape from the
audience chamber. The pursuit attempt by the guards proved to be
annoyingly persistent, but thanks to the sacrifices of a few revolutionaries,
we made it to the safe house in the end.

Yoo Joonghyuk chucked the unconscious Bilston – the host body of Lee
Hyunsung – on the floor and opened his lips to speak. "Why did you show
up this late?"

"It wasn't because I wanted to, okay."

[The worldview is growing suspicious of your conversation.]

['Midday Tryst' has been activated!]
Yoo Joonghyuk shot me his trademark murderous glare for a little while,
and then continued on with his story.

– I arrived in this place around two years ago.

I calmly listened to his experiences.

He suddenly became the First Prince of the Kaizenix Archipelago, and just
as suddenly, throne usurpation broke out.

Yoo Joonghyuk was thrown into the middle of that armed revolt and began
his bid for survival. He escaped from the royal castle and created the group
of freedom fighters. And then, he searched around for the rest of the
companions.

– By the time I arrived here, Lee Hyunsung, Jung Heewon, and even Han
Sooyoung were already in that state.

– Are the three of them the only ones here? Where are the others?

– Haven't found anyone besides them. It's likely that only they
weresummoned to this world.

Yoo Joonghyuk possessed the [Sage's Eye]. In some regard, that skill
allowed him to spy on far more complete information than my own
[Character List]. He had been relying on this skill to search for the other
companions. He probably discovered me through it, too – since the [Sage's
Eye] didn't work on me.

I observed the still-unconscious Lee Hyunsung.

Yoo Joonghyuk said he got here two years ago. In that case, just how long
was Lee Hyunsung trapped in this worldview for?

– They have all been swallowed up by the Giant Story, haven't they?

– Probably.
– What about you? You alright?

– You think a measly couple of years is enough to break me down?

I belatedly recalled what an amazing dude Yoo Joonghyuk was. The
trustworthy Lee Hyunsung, the driven Jung Heewon, and even Han
Sooyoung all broke down and lost themselves.

[Giant Story, 'Kaizenix Archipelago', is shooting a dissatisfied glare at
Incarnation 'Yoo Joonghyuk'.]

However, Yoo Joonghyuk was completely unscathed.

But then again, that was pretty obvious when I thought about it. The
method employed by this worldview's 'Giant Story' to break us down was
'time' itself. However, Yoo Joonghyuk possessed far stronger resistance
towards the passage of time than anyone. Well, he had already spent
hundreds of years in the Dark Stratum going through harsh training, after
all. [The worldview is expressing its puzzlement over your lengthy
silence.] I raised my head towards the sky.

The current scenario was governed by the rules set out by the worldview.
Even Yoo Joonghyuk seemed to have realized how we should start acting
from here onwards.

I finished preparing myself and opened my lips. "Hyung."

Yoo Joonghyuk's expression crumpled into something unsightly.

– Hey, don't make a face like that. This is the restriction of our current
scenario. Do you think I'm enjoying this, either?

Yoo Joonghyuk's eyes bubbling over like boiling lava finally softened just a
tad.
Yup, this guy was going to experience severe difficulties pretty soon;
according to Ricardo's memories, the original setting for the First Prince
was 'loving and warm-hearted big brother', that was why.

Yoo Joonghyuk opened his lips. "Speak, Ricardo."

"What are you going to do next? It looks to me that even the revolution has
failed now. No, besides all that, why did you even appear in the execution
ground, anyway?"

"I was planning to kill the false king."

[Character, 'Ricardo Von Kaizenix', is being agitated.]

I was pretty sure of him being dead serious here. The Yoo Joonghyuk I
know was fully capable of doing something like that, after all.

Too bad, that wasn't my style.

"But, should you be doing something like that? She's originally your bride,
isn't she?"

"Correction. She was supposed to be one. The throne was usurped on the
first day of the wedding, however."

Oh, I see. So, it's that sort of development? I felt just a bit relieved now.

Han Sooyoung and Yoo Joonghyuk as a couple? <Kim Dokja's Company>
hadn't allowed any dating at the workplace yet, so hell no.

It was at this point in time that an unexpected message entered my ears.

[The worldview finds your words interesting.]

[The genre of the applicable scenario has tilted slightly towards 'Romance'.]

…The genre had tilted?
Yoo Joonghyuk continued on. "It was already far late to save her. She
was stained by the corrupted magic and lost her original humanity." Oh,
really?

[The worldview finds Incarnation Yoo Joonghyuk's words interesting.]

[The genre of the applicable scenario has minutely tilted towards

'Fantasy'.] I gave another signal to Yoo Joonghyuk with my eyes.

– Did you hear that?

He nodded his head.

"In any case, we both are too late now. We can't save them all."

"No, it's not too late. Whatever the case may be, there are two of us, right?"

After saying that, I shifted my gaze down to Bilston on the ground, still
snoring away, and carried on. "Maybe, three."

"Those three will be everyone."

"Who knows? There might be more. Maybe, a miracle happens and an
existence crossing over from another dimension will help us out."

[The worldview finds your words interesting.]

[The genre of the applicable scenario has acquired the possibility of being
'Fusion Fantasy'.]

And in the following moment, new scenario messages popped up right
before my eyes.

[The Selection Point for the Sub-Scenario, 'Genre Selection', has been

[A new scenario message has arrived!]

"…So, this is how it was."

I raised my head and found Yoo Joonghyuk's dumbfounded expression.

I kind of understood how I should go about advancing the scenario now.
However, the problem here was the difficulty of figuring out which 'genre'
was the right one to select.

– We just don't have enough information. It'd been nice if only we
knewwhat the original plot of this world was…

It was unknown what kind of a conclusion we'd get after choosing a
particular worldview. What I wanted was to ensure the survival of everyone
and move onto the next scenario together.

But, what if someone were to die as the price for me choosing a genre?

Yoo Joonghyuk threw out a question.

– I guess your high and mighty book didn't mention this part, then?

I flinched slightly before making my reply.

– How can I know something that a Regressor like you doesn't know?

– But, I do know.

– What? You know what, exactly?

– The course of this scenario.

I stared at him in pure shock. Yoo Joonghyuk knows of this scenario's plot?
But, that couldn't be.

If my memories were correct, then the Yoo Joonghyuk of the 3rd
Regression turn had not experienced a scenario like this one. And he'd not
go through one in the future, either.
–I read it in a book.

–What book was that?

I momentarily wondered if he was talking about the 'Ways of Survival', but
quickly realized that was impossible. Because even that novel didn't contain
any in-depth information on this scenario.

– I read the diary written by Han Sooyoung from the 1863rd turn. She
experienced this scenario in that Regression.

– Han Sooyoung of the 1863rd turn? And why do you have her diary in the
first place?

– I got hold of it via special means.

I glared at Yoo Joonghyuk for a little while.

Well, I was slightly overcome with complicated feelings of betrayal.

Han Sooyoung from the 1863rd turn didn't mention any information on this
scenario to me. Why was that? Did she think that I must not know about it?
Or… Just to spite me?

My thoughts remained complicated, but I shook my head and got rid of
them. They weren't important right now.

– If you possessed such information, you should've told me that already,
youdumbass. Okay, so. How did the 1863rd turn Han Sooyoung clear this
scenario?

Whatever the case might have been, the important thing was that we did
have info on this scenario. If we had info, then that meant there was an
already-set method to clear it.

However, Yoo Joonghyuk's expression was gloomy.
– This world is not unfolding in the original direction.
– What are you talking about?
– 'Throne usurpation' didn't happen in the original plot of this world.Meaning,
  the event of the current king becoming 'king' shouldn't have happened.
– Which means…?
– Before we entered this world, someone changed the plot of this story.

  I was flustered.

  Currently, we were in a situation where neither of us – Yoo Joonghyuk the
  Regressor, and me, the sole reader – had any idea on the future storyline.
  Sure, there had been a few times when the progress of the story didn't
  match up with the 'Ways of Survival' in the past, but this would be the first
  time we couldn't predict what the future held for us.

  The 'Ways of Survival' I knew didn't contain any potential solutions to a
  scenario like this one.

  ⸢Ma ybe you sho uld have read the Final Re vision.⸥

  Regret belatedly rushed in.

  It was at this time that someone knocked on the door.

  "Enter."

  Almost at the same time Yoo Joonghyuk issued his order, the door was
  pushed open and the revolutionaries entered. They brought along an older
  man, currently tied up by them.

  "He says he's the secret envoy from the king. He wishes to speak to you,
  sir."
The older man turned out to be the same butler who handed me water back
when I first regained my consciousness after the 'possession'. His beard
trembled in fear; he sucked in deep breaths and addressed us.

"First Prince, and the Fourth Prince… Her majesty told me to give you
a certain item. Specifically… Her majesty from 40 years ago…" …40
years ago?

Yoo Joonghyuk and I exchanged glances. Meanwhile, the butler rummaged
through his inner pocket and pulled something out.

It was a certain book.

{Three Ways to Survive a Totally Ruined Scenario, by the author Han
Sooyoung.}
               Chapter 377: Ep. 72 - Three methods, I


I received the book and stood around in a daze, but somehow managed to
ask the butler in the end. "When was it that her majesty gave you this book,
again?"

"It was 40 years ago when she gave me the first manuscript. And for the
next ten years, she consistently gave me more manuscripts. All I did was to
bind them into a single book, your highness."

"Have you read its contents?"

"I swear on my life, I've not read a single line, your highness. Let me
emphasize it again that I only merely organised them and bound them, sir."

I quickly opened the book and was greeted by the clean, well-organised
table of contents.

'…'
Episode 13. Counterattacking Princes

Episode 14. One Prince and I

Episode 15. Three Methods

…

I frantically leafed through the pages. Although the collected book itself
was rather thick, I didn't have too much trouble reading it, thanks to the
special effect of my attribute.

Someone here was still unhappy about my reading speed, however.

"You're reading it way too quickly."

"It's you who's slow, 'hyung'."

"What does it say?"

I didn't reply right away.

As I flipped through the pages, this vague listlessness washed over me.
Each page was thick with the fatigue of the passing time and the sense of
desperation, an urgency. I couldn't be sure whether that was Han
Sooyoung's intention or not.

But, I was sure that she had foreseen the moment of me reading her book
arriving in the future.

I stopped reading the page I was on and went straight to the very last
portion of the book. That was where the <Author's Afterwords> were.

⸢Seriously now. There are always those folks who go straight to the author's
afterwords when first reading a book.⸥
The words greeted me as if they were waiting for my arrival. Even though I
knew that couldn't be the case, I almost broke out into an unconscious
chuckle, nonetheless.

⸢By the time you're reading this book, I…⸥

I steeled my heart and read the next line of the text.

⸢…I'd still be living a pretty good life, I guess. Hahah, were you scared?⸥

This idiot…

⸢In any case. If my prediction is correct, then the person reading these
words is Kim Dokja. Prince Kim Dokja, no less. What an unfortunate thing
that is, not being able to spectate on that sight.⸥

Han Sooyoung's trademark dry sarcasm could be sensed so vividly among
each and every word she wrote. ⸢You wanna know how I can tell? Well…
Actually, even I can't be sure. There's a limit to how much I can guess
what would happen, you know. It's just that, I looked at all the potential
circumstances on how you might arrive here, as well as countless cliched
conditions attached to it, and predicted the one with the highest odds, that's
all. Ah, of course, my prediction could be wrong, though.⸥

These words were written in a playful manner. However, the contents being
conveyed were definitely not a joke.

⸢In all honesty, I wish I was wrong, though. Me, waiting for someone for
decades and decades… You think such a thing is even possible? You crazy
fool.⸥

Han Sooyoung's <Author's Afterwords> wasn't written in one sitting, it
seemed. Most likely, she began collecting records the moment she
possessed someone in this world. And then, committed those records to
these pages once she was finally able to write them down.

Her records continued on.

⸢I'm sure you have figured it out, but well, I was born into that woman's
body. At first, I really thought that I had reincarnated, you know… I almost
went crazy out of boredom and frustration during the first year. If I hadn't
activated [Avatar] in my head and organised my memories, then I might
have really lost my mind back then. Things got better a little bit when I hit
four years old and began writing stuff. What a screwed up thing that is, me
being a wordsmith and needing to write things even in moments like this.
Maybe I want to be saved by writing.⸥

I didn't know whether to laugh or shed a tear. All I could do right now was
to silently turn the page.

⸢At first, I thought you'd show up in three years at the latest. I mean, you
did show up three years later before. But then, after three years went by,
then four, and five… (Don't be mistaken that time flew by just because I'm
writing like this, okay?) My thoughts changed. And from a certain point on,
I accepted it.⸥

It was getting harder and harder to flip the pages.

⸢I see. Kim Dokja isn't going to show up for a while.⸥

Han Sooyoung's handwriting seemed to be trembling just a little.

⸢That damn asshole told me to wait for him, yet he's still not here.⸥

What could I possibly say to her?

⸢However, I guess this can't be Kim Dokja's fault.⸥
What the hell. It was as if whatever I wanted to say already was conveyed
to Han Sooyoung just as she began writing this.

⸢My bad, I'm sure you don't want to read about something like this, either.
But, the thing is, it's not easy to complain in this place, you know?⸥
Her words continued on.

⸢I had no idea when I was still writing novels, but now that I've been living
in this place, there's just way too many cumbersome details that I haven't
thought of before. Like, the shower facility being really terrible, and there
are bugs the size of my fist crawling around in my bedroom, and as for
food… Let's not even mention that, shall we.⸥
On the sixth year…

⸢Did you know that my speech is becoming weird lately? I'm beginning to
sound like some kind of a high-class lady from medieval times or
something.⸥

And on the seventh year…

⸢Dear Kim Dokja-nim, just when will you come?⸥

Eighth year…

⸢Blergh…⸥

Finally, ninth year.

⸢This is like a bad joke, a person's life fleeting past this quickly.⸥
From here onwards, the records were occasionally cut off. The sequence of
time was not consistent, and I discovered parts that seemed to be added in
later on every now and then.

⸢God damn it.⸥

⸢Kim Dokja, you son of a bitch.⸥

⸢Just what the hell do you want from me, you stinking Dokkaebi bastards?⸥

…

…

⸢The years I've been living in this place is now almost the same as what I
spent living on Earth.⸥

…So, like, when you see me again next time, you better call me noona, got
that?⸥

Han Sooyoung's handwriting was changing bit by bit, with the distinct
feeling of it slowly becoming something no longer hers but someone else's.

⸢Honestly, I'm writing this because I can pretty much guess what will
happen to me in the future. And also, in a way, the future of this world
view, too.⸥
Decades would prove to be a short length of time for Constellations.
However, it'd not be the same for a human being.

Han Sooyoung had to endure yet another lifetime in this place.

⸢I thought that, this scenario probably isn't in the 'Ways of Survival'.
Because we've changed too much of the original storyline, right?⸥
'We'.

You have experienced that lengthy amount of time all by yourself, yet you
can still call me that…

⸢If I take the hands-off approach here, the idiot you and Yoo Joonghyuk
will probably go around doing dumb things and mess up the scenario,
instead… So.⸥

At that moment, it felt as if Han Sooyoung was standing right in front of
me. I mistakenly thought that she was here and speaking to me in her usual
confident and shrewd tone of voice.

⸢Oh, my sole reader. This is the tale of a certain woman who managed to
survive in the messed-up scenario.⸥
Goosebumps began slowly rising up from the ends of my neck.

This was the recorded history of Han Sooyoung's life; words containing her
rage, her resentment, and her longing.

I don't know whether you're a suitable guy for this 'three methods' or not,
but at the least, I'm sure of this one thing.⸥
The following words were eerily similar to a certain body of text that I was
familiar with.

⸢The you reading this story will definitely make it out of here alive.⸥

Han Sooyoung's afterwords came to an end there. For the longest time, I
couldn't tear my eyes away from the full-stop at the end of the sentence.

"Ricardo."

I looked to my side to find Yoo Joonghyuk staring at me.
"Did that woman possess the power to predict the future?"

"…Maybe."

Now originally, the [Predictive Plagiarism] was the 1863rd-turn Han
Sooyoung's power. The Han Sooyoung of this turn, the one responsible for
writing this book, also had acquired that power now.

And the result of that was this very book.

Here was the brand-new signpost for me to follow, me who had read the
'Ways of Survival'.

[The worldview is paying close attention to your conversation.]

[Genre of the applicable scenario has tilted slightly towards 'Fusion
Fantasy'.]

I flipped to the first page of the book. Now was the time to study the
required information in-depth. For some reason, a line of text that I glossed
over earlier caught my eyes.

PS: This novel is an original secondary creation related to 'Ways of
Survival', and not created for the purpose of monetary gain.⸥
I ended up smirking just a little then.

⸢Episode 1. Birth of an SSS-rank Reincarnator⸥

I read and re-read the words that Han Sooyoung had written with so much
care.

As if I was drunkard walking straight into another world, I voraciously ate
up her words. Because that was the only courtesy I could pay to the author
of this story as its reader.
And it was fun, god damn it. In some passages, much more so than the
'Ways of Survival'.

Just how long passed by like that? I finally raised my head.




Han Sooyoung had said this – that there were three ways of clearing this
scenario.

⸢The three clearing methods will represent each different genre.⸥

The three would be, Fantasy, Romance, and Fusion Fantasy.

⸢The course of 'dynastic revolution' will fall mainly to the 'Fantasy' genre. If
you select this route…⸥
All the available route had pros and cons; if you got something, then, in
turn, you'd have to lose something, as well.

However, there were certain things that would be lost regardless of which
route was chosen. For instance, the first thing to be lost would be…



"P-please, spare me! Your highness!! Spare me!"

…Lee Hyunsung's human rights.

"Roll to your left."

"Euh-euhk, Keuh-euk!"

"To your right."
"Y-your highness…!"

"I don't remember permitting you to speak."

Like a military drill instructor, Yoo Joonghyuk was in the middle of
'punishing' Lee Hyunsung. As for me, I was spectating that from the side.

"B-but, why are you making me do this?! Fourth Prince! Your highness!
Please, say something to your brother!"

"Can you recall anything now by any chance?"

"Euh, euh-euh… My, my back… I'm an old soldier, so why…"

In order to tread the route Han Sooyoung's [Predictive Plagiarism] had
foreseen, we need to make Lee Hyunsung regain his memories first. And
certain memories were better remembered by one's body, rather than one's
brain.

⸢This might be a cruel thing for Lee Hyunsung to go through, but…⸥

Unfortunately, we didn't have any other choice right now.

Even Han Sooyoung's book failed to record the life of Bilston as lived
through Lee Hyunsung's perspective. As we had no idea what kind of a life
he lived before he got swallowed up by this world, there was only so many
methods we could resort to for waking him up.

And so, how long did it pass by like this?

"Something feels strange."

Lee Hyunsung, his head planted on the floor, suddenly began rambling
nonsense.

"I feel more comfortable now."
[Character, 'Bilston', is under tremendous confusion.]

[Ego of the character, 'Lee Hyunsung', is wiggling

around.] Yoo Joonghyuk and I stared at each other

simultaneously.

Now normally, it'd been a tall order to wake Lee Hyunsung's ego with such
little stimulation. However, the story was a bit different right now. Because
I was here, and so was Yoo Joonghyuk.

[Beings sharing the same Story as you are in your near vicinity.]

[The bond between the Story is strengthening!]

Right now, three members of <Kim Dokja's Company> had gathered here,
in this place.

There was a certain old adage regarding this situation – 'Sam-in-
seongho'(三人成虎).

Which means, when three people gathered, they could create a fake story of
a tiger.

We might not be able to create a tall tale of a tiger, but it could be possible
to do something else, instead.

[Stories possessed by your Nebula are beginning to resist against the
'worldview'.]

…For instance, summoning back the memories that didn't exist within this
worldview.

[Ego of the character, 'Lee Hyunsung', is slowly opening its eyes.]

Faint rays of light were now being emitted from Lee Hyunsung's body.
[Giant Story, 'Kaizenix Archipelago', is glaring at your group!]

Han Sooyoung said that this scenario played out in a world controlled by
that 'Giant Story'. So, if one could escape from the Story's control, then it'd
be possible to regain one's forgotten ego.

"Euh, euh-uh, uh…"

Lee Hyunsung blinked his eyes laboriously, his lips bobbing up and down
like a newborn trying to form words.

"…D-Dokja-ssi?"

[Worldview is imposing a penalty on the words not aligned with the
Probability!]

Tsu-chuchuchuchut!!

"Uwaaaaahhk?!?!"

Lee Hyunsung writhed painfully as he got electrocuted by the sparks. I
shifted my head to the side and saw the battle-ready Yoo Joonghyuk
standing up from his spot.

The important preparations had been completed now.

Yoo Joonghyuk grasped his [Black Heavenly Demon Sword] and threw me
a question.

Which route are we choosing?

The one we'd been treading all along.

The author of this scenario was Han Sooyoung. Regrettably, there was no
guarantee of the work ending up as a success even if the author did an
excellent job.
Time to start our attack, Yoo Joonghyuk.

Because the ones to complete the story were the 'Characters', not the author,
that's why.

[A new 'Giant Story' is beginning to sprout in your Nebula.]
               Chapter 378: Ep. 72 - Three methods, II


Erich Striker was the captain of Kaizenix Archipelago's royal guards.

'She' wasn't just the archipelago's best knight in title only; 'she' was also the
first sword of the nation's ruler. And the sole reason why 'she' was able to
climb up to that position was due to her constant training throughout the
day and night.

Swiiiish!

Erich sliced and cut the silent night of the training hall over and over again.
Thick sweat drops fell non-stop. 'She' looked down on the droplets and
thought that they should've been someone else's blood drops, instead.

'I let them slip away. In front of her majesty, no less'.

The rebellion of the First Prince – the assault on the audience chamber three
days ago had found itself in the mouths of the gossipers already. Some
minstrels began singing songs about it, too. Most of them were singing
songs that extolled the First Prince.
⸢Oh, oh~ the great revolutionary Schweichen Von Kaizenix~.⸥

⸢Look at his wide shoulders and his back~.⸥

The bright sword light scythed past the darkness of the practice grounds.
The hateful face of the Fourth Prince, who had escaped alongside the First
Prince, floated up. It didn't want to disappear no matter how many times it
was cut apart.

The strange thing was, every time Erich recalled that face, 'she' felt a rather
subtle emotion float up, too.

Seeing the backs of the First Prince Schweichen and Fourth Prince Ricardo,
as well as Bilston Framer, getting further away, Erich was overcome with
this inexplicable longing.

Not wanting to acknowledge that emotion, 'she' continued to swing 'her'
sword. As usual, 'she' swung the blade over and over again, trying 'her' best
to shake off all the distracting thoughts.

Unfortunately, it seemed that today's training would have to end here.

'Is it a sneak attack?'

There was a slender shadow gently wavering within the darkness.

Erich quickly unsheathed the real sword mounted from 'her' waist. 'She'
thought of killing the intruder the moment it displayed any suspicious
behaviour. Quite unexpectedly, though, the opponent revealed his presence
first.

"Please, put away your weapon. I didn't come here to fight."

Under the faint light of the moon, a man with the slender physique walked
out from the darkness. It was Ricardo Von Kaizenix, the Fourth Prince of
this archipelago.
Erich loudly shouted out. "Are you out of your mind? With what balls have
you come here?"

"Even though the world has changed, you still enjoy swinging your sword."

Erich raised 'her' sword up high while emitting a dense murderous aura. The
Fourth Prince, however, placed his sword down on the ground, instead.

The former's eyes narrowed to a slit. "What are you planning here?"

"I know that in ten minutes, guards would show up to surround me. And
also, subduing me wouldn't be all that hard for you with your skillset."

"So?"

"I'm turning myself in. Meaning, I'll have you arrest me and take me to the
execution ground."

Erich knew that the Fourth Prince was not right of his mind recently.
However, 'she' didn't expect to see a situation like this one. It had been only
a couple of days ago that he escaped with the First Prince's help, yet he
walked right back in, of his own volition, so he could be executed?

Still being wary, Erich slowly walked over to the Fourth Prince.

Without a doubt, he was in a completely unarmed state. Erich didn't miss
this chance and quickly captured the Fourth Prince. A pair of pure eyes
sparkling under the moonlight met 'her' gaze now.

"In return, I'd like you to listen to my tale for the next ten minutes."

"And why should I do that?"

"I'm going to die anyway. Not hearing the last words of a dying man will
leave you with an unclean taste in your mouth."

Erich stared at the Fourth Prince with complicated eyes. "If you're going to
plead your innocence, I won't have any of it."
'She' knew that the Fourth Prince was not guilty. However, the throne had
changed hands, and Erich was the captain of the guards serving the new
ruler.

The Fourth Prince smiled and shook his head. "This story isn't about that."

"If not, what then?"

"Honestly speaking, I was in a serious dilemma on what to say here so we
could get the 'you' we know back. I couldn't even make a wild guess at all."

The unexpected opening remarks managed to make Erich flustered and 'she'
frowned deeply.

Was this a new type of underhanded scheme? Everyone in the kingdom
knew that the Fourth Prince used his silver tongue to seduce many women
in this land.

"A long time ago, there was a certain woman."

Regardless of what his listener was thinking, the Fourth Prince began his
tale.

"She loved kendo and was talented enough to enter the competition as the
representative of her own district."

Along with a faint bout of pain, an unknown emotion began stabbing 'her'
head.

"And with her sword, she rescued her precious companions many times."

Something that disappeared a long time ago…

"She swung her sword against the unfairness of the scenarios over and
over again, and with that very same sword, she also protected me." "What
are you even talking about? I'm solely the blade of her majesty." The
Fourth Prince looked up at Erich with emotions of lamentation.
"You really can't seem to remember anything."

It was then, another voice came out from within the darkness.

"Prince Ricardo. I'd like to say something."

Erich flinched in surprise and quickly raised 'her' body up. Since from when
did those two men appear in the darkness? She growled menacingly and
spoke. "So, it was a trap all along."

"No, it is not."

The one to reveal himself from the darkness was Bilston Framer, the only
knight she acknowledged in this kingdom.

"Erich-nim."

Bilston took a step towards 'her'. 'She' got startled and quickly issued her
warning. "Take one more step, and I shall cut off the Fourth Prince's head."

This is a trap. I must escape from here – Erich thought like that and scanned
the exit to the training ground.

However, something felt wrong.

[Stories related to you have begun going on a rampage!]

As if her entire body had become frozen, she couldn't move at all.

[Your Stories are resisting against the control of the 'Kaizenix
Archipelago'!]

"We promised never to forget, didn't we?"

Bilston stared at her with sorrowful eyes.

'No, but, his… name is…'

[Stories related to you are ruminating on the old memories.]
"Heewon-ssi."

[Forgotten Stories have begun their storytelling.]

At that moment, 'her' world crumbled away. Stories flooding in covered up
Erich's memories.

That was the story of the forgotten ten years. A story from when Erich
wasn't Erich yet, while Bilston was not Bilston, either.




It was exactly ten years ago when both Lee Hyunsung and Jung Heewon
arrived in this world.

"Hyunsung-ssi! It is you, right?"

"Uht? Heewon-ssi??" Tsu-

chuchuchut…!

They had become the 'possessors' at a similar point in time and luckily
enough, got to recognise each other pretty quickly.

– Looks like we'll have to resort to using voice projection in this place.

The two of them began gathering information on this world little by little.

First, they learnt that this was the final preparatory stage before they could
participate in the 'Great War of Saints and Demons'.

Two, that there were time differences between the summoning of each
member of <Kim Dokja's Company> to this place.

And that the scenario wouldn't begin unless all the actors had arrived.
– Besides all that, Hyunsung-ssi, it looks like you took over a person
prettysimilar to you.

– Heewon-ssi, you also suit your host really well.

And finally, their sense of self would steadily erode away with the passage
of time.

[Giant Story, 'Kaizenix Archipelago', is monitoring your actions.]

[Probability of the world is pressuring you to perform your given role.]

Whenever they sensed the gaze of the Giant Story, they acted out their roles
in order to not get on that thing's nerves.

– It seems that Sooyoung-ssi has completely forgotten about everything.
Itdoesn't matter what I say, she…

– Will we end up in the same situation as her?

– I believe that Dokja-ssi will show up before that.

And so, they waited, and then, waited for some more.

– Are Jihye and the kids doing well, I wonder?

– If it's them, they should be alright.

They only had each other to rely on in this world.

[Story, 'Purest Companionship', has begun its storytelling.]

In a world where no one knew of their story, they simply had to continue
talking to each other in order to protect themselves.

Claaang!

"Erich-nim! Please defeat it right now!"
"Let us get going, Bilston-nim!"

The hosts of the two being rivals came about quite naturally; they needed to
create more opportunity to stay next to each other, as that would increase
the opportunities to use [Voice Projection] to talk to each other.

– Looks like your swordsmanship has improved by a lot. Your title
of'Emperor of Steelsword' perfectly suits you, no?

– When we go back, I better ask Dokja-ssi to buy me a new sword.

Every time their blades crossed, they shared voice projections.

– At this rate, we might end up becoming Swordmasters before Dokja-
ssiarrives here.

One year passed by, and the second year went by just like that.

And they were assigned to different posts that matched their personalities.
Lee Hyunsung was thrust into Fourth Prince Ricardo's faction, while Jung
Heewon was put under the banner of the 'Dark Magician'.

Once their affiliation changed, the environment they experienced also
changed.

The two of them couldn't cross their swords as often as before. And they
had to live the lives of 'Erich Striker' and 'Bilston Framer' more and more,
and not as Jung Heewon and Lee Hyunsung.

They had to eat food as Erich Striker and speak as Bilston Framer. In the
process of acquiring something that wasn't theirs, Lee Hyunsung and Jung
Heewon began gradually forgetting some things about themselves.

The two of them were slowly and steadily becoming the characters of the
'Kaizenix Archipelago'.

There was a time when Jung Heewon, drunken out of her mind, came to
speak to Lee Hyunsung.
– I'm a horrible person, Hyunsung-ssi.

– Why are you saying such a thing?

– Isn't that reason why I'm being punished right now?

She then began talking about things no one had brought up until now.

– Do you remember… the Geumho Station's mother and her child?
Theyfought against Cheoldo faction with us.

– …Yes, I remember. We also met them in the Dark Castle, didn't we?

Lee Hyunsung recalled the mother-and-daughter duo from the Geumho
Station – the mother who fought to protect her child, and a little girl who
was holding onto the hand of such a mother.

The child's mother lost her life in the Dark Castle, and the girl was handed
over to the care of the wanderers.

– Both of them could have survived. If only I had realized the truth of
the'Paradise' sooner…

– It's not your fault, Heewon-ssi. That was not something we
could'veprevented.

– In all honesty, there were many smaller Stories then ours, right?
Thosestories that couldn't even become proper Stories.

The drunken Jung Heewon laughed out. When she did, the vestiges of
Stories staining her hands glowed brightly. All of them were the stories that
she had acquired along the way. Stories created by fighting against the great
and noble Constellations as a member of <Kim Dokja's Company>.

Jung Heewon was proud of that story, and lived her life without shame.

However, a slightly different thought had permeated her head lately.
– Maybe, the Stories we have collected so far were created after we
alsotrampled on such small Stories?

– Heewon-ssi…

– And maybe, it's our turn now to be trampled on.

Four years, then five, passed by like that. Both Jung Heewon and Lee
Hyunsung didn't give up.

– By the way, what were the surnames of Yoosung and Gilyoung?

– Wasn't it… Lee Yoosung, and Shin Gilyoung?

– Something sounds wrong, but…

Their memories disappeared bit by bit. And the sixth year passed them by.

– Where is Dokja-ssi and what's he doing right about now?

– I don't think he'll come this year, as well.

The seventh year passed by.

– Being seven years in arrears with our wages, isn't it completely an
evilcorporation?

– Let's definitely create a labour union later.

– Yes, we must. Let's not forget it.

Their initial promise of meeting up at least once a week to talk was changed
to once a month, and that eventually became once every two months,
instead.

The days they did meet but were unable to say anything increased, too.

And on a certain day during their eighth year, Jung Heewon asked him in a
dazed voice.
– Weren't we supposed to wait for someone?

Lee Hyunsung couldn't reply to that question.

– You know, Hyunsung-ssi. If I ever forget about you, then…– I'll

remember you.


– …Then, please kill me.

That was the last time they met.

A short while later, the 'Dark Magician' started a revolt. And Lee Hyunsung
stood on the side of the former royal family to face off against Jung
Heewon.

– Heewon-ssi.

Their swords clashed intensely several times in the air.

Wounds on Lee Hyunsung's body accumulated inside the storm of blinding
sword lights. The trajectories of her sword swings were definitely different
compared to when they were sparring in the past; each of her attacks
contained her clear will to kill him.

– Heewon-ssi!

Even when subjected to the repeated [Voice Projection], Jung Heewon
didn't reply. Her silence substituted for her answer.

As if she had been holding back until now, Erich's merciless sword swing
sliced Lee Hyunsung down. The latter's vision seemed to grow distant,
then. Even though he was staggering about, he still walked closer to Jung
Heewon.

One step, two steps…
Finally managing to get close, Lee Hyunsung stared into her eyes and, for
the first time ever, spoke the words he couldn't say for the longest time, and
quite likely, he'd not get to say ever again.

– I love you, Heewon-ssi.




[Story, 'Purest Companionship', has concluded its storytelling.]

I wordlessly read the unfolding Story. Some words were quietly sorrowful,
while some parts were painful enough to tear my heart out.

[Ego of Character, 'Jung Heewon', is waking up little by little.]

Faint light floated around the bodies of both Bilston and Erich. I could
sense that their souls were resonating with the Story.

Lee Hyunsung collapsed, but a smile remained etched on his face. I quietly
studied that face for a bit, before breaking the silence. "Looks like the
company's internal rules need to be changed somewhat…"

In any case, our second goal had been met. Next up would be…

"Over there!"

"Erich-nim is in danger!"

Yoo Joonghyuk picked up both the unconscious Jung Heewon and Lee
Hyunsung. But, before we could safely get out from there, the doors to the
training ground burst open and the royal guards rushed in.

However, it wasn't just them who showed up here. Someone else was
walking out from the line of guards and towards us.

⸢The First Triple Master of Kaizenix Archipelago⸥
⸢The genius who had reached the peak of Swordmaster at barely 18 years
old⸥

⸢The youngest-ever Ninth Circle Archmage⸥

⸢The ruler of the Archipelago who controls an evil black dragon⸥

No one in the Kaizenix Archipelago was capable of defeating her right
now. The 'king' with a silver-coloured crown was quietly smiling at us.

"You dare to steal away my loyal knight?"

The royal guards all knelt down before her.

Yoo Joonghyuk's expression hardened and he sent me a message.

– This is different from our plan.

– Actually, this is for the better.

Because our next target was Han Sooyoung, anyway.

There were four members of <Kim Dokja's Company> present right now.
The Story of the Nebula would be strengthened further if more of the
Nebula's members were in one place.

I looked at the queen's face and spoke up. "Your majesty, we didn't come
here to fight."

Without a doubt, Han Sooyoung's ego was lying inside that queen, asleep.
And I simply had to get her ego back from that character, no matter what.
And, with things like this, we could use our Story and…

"I'm aware. You came to tell me a story."

Feeling startled just a little, I stared at her.
[Giant Story, 'Kaizenix Archipelago', is sending a mocking jeer in your
direction.]

"Why are you so surprised? This one, too, enjoys stories very much.
However, this one enjoys telling stories rather than listening to them. So,
keep your ears wide open and listen well, Ricardo Von Kaizenix."

The queen spread her arms wide and grinned brightly towards me.

"No, should that be the 'Demon King of Salvation', Kim Dokja?"




              Chapter 379: Ep. 72 - Three Methods, III


I stared at the queen wearing Han Sooyoung's face.

That person was definitely not her. But then, how could she possibly know
what my name was?

The queen was still smiling away.

"I'm sure you're curious as to how I know your name."
She was the character from this worldview, and she was merely an
existence that acted according to the rules set out by the 'Giant Story'. So, it
was impossible for a person like that to recognise me not as 'Ricardo', but as
'Kim Dokja'.

On top of that, she spoke of things that didn't align with the worldview, yet
the sparks of Probability weren't suppressing her at all.

[Worldview is considering the possibility of expanding the genre types.]

[Giant Story, 'Kaizenix Archipelago', is condoning the current situation.]
[Probability restrictions imposed on some words has been relaxed.]

[Meta words related to the worldview have been acknowledged!]

I wordlessly stared at the queen before activating my skill.

[Unique Skill, 'Character List', has activated!]


  <Character Summary>

  Name: ???

  Age: 50

  Overall Evaluation: the applicable individual holds hatred towards you.


The queen's info still didn't want to appear.

I thought that was because it was Han Sooyoung in the beginning. I figured
that, as a person not registered with the Character List, her possession of the
host would make it impossible to check out the information on the queen
herself.

But, what if I was wrong?
"Are you Han Sooyoung?"

"I used to be called that once upon a time."

"What do you mean by that?"

The queen slowly blinked her eyes and continued on with her story. "Do
you know the tale of a certain woman who tried to endure decades upon
decades of time with nothing but her ultimately empty hope?"

"I do know of a man with a similar story."

It was Yoo Joonghyuk who replied in my stead, as he unsheathed his
[Black Heavenly Demon Sword].

The smile remained on the queen's lips as she spoke. "Oh, my pitiful former
lover, it seems that you've come to your own execution ground."

"Our engagement has been annulled already. Call me that one more time,
and I shall slice your head off."

Almost at the same time, the figures of both people disappeared from view.
And then, these two incredible existences collided against each other, as the
ear-shattering sounds of explosions rang out. The ceiling of the training
grounds blew away; the sword winds and magical energy clashed to create
a rising pillar of destructive winds kissing the heavens above.

At a casual glance, they seemed to be evenly matched, but if one were to
look deeper into the flow of the battle itself, then that was definitely not the
case.

After they exchanged dozens of moves in the blink of an eye, Yoo
Joonghyuk was left with a slight injury on his left arm. On the other hand,
there was not one scratch on the queen.

Yoo Joonghyuk was being pushed back. That inconceivably strong dude
wasn't quite powerful enough to contend with the queen of this worldview.
On top of that, Han Sooyoung's speciality, [Black Flame]'s aura was rising
up from the queen's left arm, as well.

"Dokja-ssi! You must get out of there!"

Lee Hyunsung protected me from the royal guards trying to rush in.

"…Dokja-ssi??"

It seemed that Jung Heewon too had somehow regained her wits. Sadly,
though, there was no time to pay them any mind right now.

The seconds ticked by and the previously-even balance of the battle rapidly
tilted away from Yoo Joonghyuk's favour. Because his opponent today just
so happened to be none other than the 'Triple Master'.

"Han Sooyoung! You need to wake up!"

I brought forth the power of the 'Giant Story' without hesitation.

[Giant Story, 'Demon Realm's Spring', has begun its storytelling.]

The Story I shot into the air above with all my power created a gap in the
fighting in an instant. I didn't miss that opening and jumped into the
battlefield.

The queen grinned and opened her arms wide.

"Oh, the 'Demon King of Salvation'. The woman you're searching for has
died a long time ago."

"Stop making me laugh. Han Sooyoung would never speak in that manner."

"Are you aware of what the lifetime of 50 years means to a person?"

No, I had no idea. I hadn't lived that long yet, after all.

[Giant Story, 'Kaizenix Archipelago', has begun its storytelling.]
The entire world seemed to wiggle around, and the figure of Han Sooyoung
living in this land floated up on the empty air.

This was her Story. Her history, as she lived in this world.

More specifically, the history as experienced by her host, 'Yuri di Aristel'.

⸢The beautiful esteemed daughter of an Earl.⸥

⸢A girl brought up for the sake of becoming a new queen.⸥

⸢"Once you turn 18, you shall enter the royal castle."⸥

The Han Sooyoung I know could be seen among the chaotically-rising lines
of texts.

⸢"Fine. In that case, should I become a Swordmaster before I turn 18?"⸥

She began fighting against the world itself. She was living in this world
with a clear, focused expression on her face.

She was experiencing this world with an expression I couldn't recognise.

⸢"Why is a young girl swinging around a sword?"⸥

⸢"Magic is nothing but an illusion."⸥

Certain cliches would try to hinder a person with the pretext of being
cliches. And the Han Sooyoung I know hated cliches more than anyone out
there.

⸢"Screw it, you think I'll marry just because you say so?! Bring someone
stronger than me, than I'll marry that person, then!"⸥
Countless men stepped forward to take possession of the Earl's beautiful
daughter. Among them were famed knights of the archipelago as well as
renowned magicians.

Han Sooyoung became stronger and stronger in order to defeat all the
potential suitors with her own hands.

At the end of the harsh training soaked in her blood and sweat, she became
the Swordmaster, and eventually rose up as the Ninth Circle Archmage, and
finally, the master of fear who controlled the powers of an evil dragon.

Her flesh became younger through the power of the Swordmaster, and the
aura from the evil black flame enhanced her air of mysteriousness even
further.

Ironically, though – the stronger she got, the world grew to desire her even
more.

Han Sooyoung continued to fight against such a world.

She spent a far longer life in this place than she did on Earth, and did her
very best to diligently endure that lengthy period of time.

Her Story carried on with its storytelling, but I couldn't hear it anymore
from a certain point onwards.

It was lonesome. I felt a sense of rebellion. Even though Han Sooyoung
was in this world alongside me…

…It felt as if she was so, so far away.

"This isn't Han Sooyoung's world."

"Who are you to decide that? You have known her for less than four years,
no more than that. And if you count the days you spent with her, it'd be less
than one year, even."

That was probably all true.
"What do you really know about Han Sooyoung?"

I recalled the Han Sooyoung that I knew in my head.

A person with a strong pride who didn't know how to apologise or take
back what she said; a person who pursued efficiency, but who'd readily give
up on that very efficiency for the sake of her companions.

A person who acted all selfish and the like, but who'd always go "You
guys can't do anything without me" and get ready to risk her life… …In
what kind of manner did she speak?

Was the Han Sooyoung I knew the real 'Han Sooyoung'?

Did she still exist in the story that I know?

"The Han Sooyoung you knew no longer exists. The past 50 years had
moulded her into a brand new existence. And that is precisely me."

The Giant Story rushing out from behind the queen's back emitted
incredibly dense fighting intent in our direction.

[Giant Story, 'Kaizenix Archipelago', is excluding your existences.]

In front of the time spanning 50 years, the memories of the short time Han
Sooyoung and I shared together gradually looked pathetic and insignificant.

To make sure that the memories wouldn't grow any more insignificant, I
forced out a smile and had to open my mouth. "As I thought, you are not
Han Sooyoung. She's not as serious as you, you know."

There was a faint trace of agitation in the queen's expression.

And from that hint of unrest, I became certain of 'who' this queen was.
Without a doubt, she was infinitely closer to being Han Sooyoung.
However, she could never fully be her.
"You are none other than 'Yuri di Aristel', the daughter of the Earl and who
just so happened to watch Han Sooyoung's life for the longest time. You
probably seized the opening created by the Giant Story swallowing Han
Sooyoung up and took over her body."

"…"

"Now, speak. Where is the real Han Sooyoung?"

Instead of a verbal answer, an incredible Status poured out from her entire
body.

Kwa-dudududu!!!

As if the intense battle we fought until now was nothing but a warm-up, the
waves of Status unshackled from her entire being crashed into us, causing
our bodies to become rooted to the spot – Yoo Joonghyuk, Lee Hyunsung,
Jung Heewon, and me.

The queen slowly made her way towards us as our movements were
completely sealed now.

I asked her. "Are you planning to kill us all?"

"Kill you?" A derisive smirk floated up on her lips. "Looks like you still
don't know much about this scenario. Since you all have survived this far,
that means none of you will die. I, and… Han Sooyoung, also wishes for
that."

"However, you tried to execute me earlier, didn't you?"

"That was your assigned test. And you were scheduled to be rescued by the
First Prince, anyway," the queen laughed as if she was Han Sooyoung.
"And now, the end of this scenario is upon us."

Sparks danced in the air and the new scenario message could be heard now.

[The deciding moment for the Genre Selection has arrived!]
[You must select this worldview's genre!]

The queen stared at the air and spoke. "The end of this world has always
remained the same."

A sense of desolation refined through a lengthy period of time brushed past
her expression.

The Isle of Reincarnators was a series of islands where the dead Stories
were put on display like stuffed animals. It was a grave of Stories that
managed to continue existing by supplying suitable stages to other
scenarios.

I could more or less guess the life she had lived until now.

The archipelago of Kaizenix must've offered up hundreds of 'possession
scenario' and hundreds of Ricardos and Schweichens must've resolved their
stories in their own preferred manner.

"The protagonist became a better person by braving all sorts of trials and
tribulations, and finally gets his hands on wealth, honour and the love of his
life, heading towards the inevitable happy ending. Although the progress of
this scenario had been a bit more peculiar… In the end, the conclusion
won't change. So, let us just end this already."

She spoke in a fed-up tone of voice. And then, issued an order to me.
"Marry me, Ricardo Von Kaizenix."

Yoo Joonghyuk stared at me with a dumbfounded expression. Lee
Hyunsung and Jung Heewon freaked out and began shouting something in
my direction.

I calmly asked a question, instead. "Is that the conclusion of this scenario?"

"That's right."

"If I marry you, are you going to let us move on to the next scenario?"
"Also correct, but with the exception of one person."

One person, she said.

The deep-seated shadow of avarice danced within the eyes of the queen.
"Han Sooyoung must remain in this world. You see, I really like her. And
you shall become the tragic lovers saying goodbye inside a scenario."
[Genre of the applicable scenario is tilting towards 'Romance'.]

[Scenario clear condition will be fulfilled as soon as the genre has been
confirmed.]

This world was negotiating with us for a deal, telling us to abandon Han
Sooyoung.

"Living in this world, and not in her original world, suits her better."

That might be true as well.


Rather than 'Han Sooyoung' of <Kim Dokja's Company>, 'Han Sooyoung'
of 'Kaizenix Archipelago' might be able to enjoy a happier life, instead. The
queen arrogantly staring down at me extended her left hand out.

"Stand up and kiss my hand. And say your farewell to your long-time
companion."

It was a white hand; Han Sooyoung would have fought against this world
with that hand.

On the back of her white hand, I could see dozens of scars and calloused
skin. Just, for what purpose did she fight so hard like that?

I recalled her book tucked away within my inner pocket and raised my
voice.
"…Just like you said, I do not know Han Sooyoung."

"Indeed, you've finally acknowledged it."
"That is why I definitely can't let her go."

"What was that??"

"You see, I haven't heard the conclusion of this story from her yet."

I slowly got up from my spot while summoning up every ounce of strength
I possessed, in order to resist this world's Story.

Tsu-chuchuchuchut!

[Giant Story, 'Torch That Swallowed the Myth', is roaring out!]

[Giant Story, 'Demon Realm's Spring', is nodding its head.]

The queen's expression changed and she glared at me. "You're ruining a
scenario on the verge of completion."

"Nope, this is the way it's supposed to go."

"…What was that?"

"I've been curious about this since the beginning. Out of all the potential
scenarios out there, why were we thrown into this 'Kaizenix Archipelago' in
the first place? However, when I thought about it, the reason was actually
quite simple."

I pulled out a certain sword from my inner pocket and spoke. "That's
because I am the legitimate heir to the throne in this scenario."

The Unbroken Faith glowed brightly and emitted blinding rays of pure
light.

[Worldview is reacting to the Star Relic 'Unbroken Faith'!]

[Applicable Star Relic belongs to this particular worldview.]

[Natural abilities of the Star Relic are increasing tremendously!]
The First Ancestor of the Kaizenix Archipelago was the legendary Storm
King, Ulysses Kaizenix – and this was his sword.

"T-that sword is…?!"

"That's the sword of the Storm King!"

The royal guards recognised the sword and they all collapsed down to the
ground. The queen fell into a state of panic and began pouring out her
powerful physical aura and magical energy in my direction.

Unfortunately for her, though, not even the power of a Swordmaster nor
that of an Archmage could do much in front of the Unbroken Faith.

[Star Relic, 'Unbroken Faith', is crying out!]

This was the true power of the 'Star Relic'; it would exhibit a
nearomnipotent level of power when inside the Story where it was created.

My hand gripping the sword began trembling non-stop. Sure, the Star Relic
itself might be powerful, but 'Ricardo Von Kaizenix' simply didn't possess
enough strength to hold the weapon for too long. That was why I needed to
end this as quickly as possible.

I smacked away the queen's magical energy waves and got closer to her, a
step at the time. By the time I reached her, she had fallen on her butt.

She was carrying an expression of resignation ever since she saw the sword.

[You have chosen the route of 'Dynastic Revolution'.]

[You must kill the queen.]

[Genre of the applicable scenario is tilting towards 'Fantasy'…]

Han Sooyoung's book said that there were three ways to complete this
scenario. Unfortunately, she left out the most crucial 'third method' in her
book.
If I kill the queen now, then Han Sooyoung would die, as well. But, if I
marry her, then she would be left behind. In that case, how should I
conclude this tale, then?

What would be the end of the scenario that Han Sooyoung wanted?

The queen spoke. "Hurry, and kill me."

"If I do that, then I'd become a true king. And end the scenario right here."

Han Sooyoung didn't tell me the correct answer. As if she was telling me to
use my own imagination for something like that.

That was why I decided to carry out what I thought was the correct
solution. The method to save Han Sooyoung without killing the queen and
still manage to seize the throne.

"The thing is, though, I'm already the 'king of a kingless world'."

"What was that?"

"Not only that, I'm the head representative of <Kim Dokja's Company>,
and the heir of the Underworld, too."

I looked at the queen's scar-filled hands. Han Sooyoung became a
Swordmaster and an Archmage through those hands.

The Han Sooyoung that I knew wasn't someone who'd set a simple goal of
'survival' in this world. Because she was an author who knew how to look
at the bigger picture.

I smiled and raised my voice. "You see, I'm really fed up with being a
king."

[You have chosen a course that has never been thought of before.]

[Worldview is flustered by your selection.]
I held the queen's hand and slowly helped her up. And rather than kissing
her hand, I placed Unbroken Faith in there, instead.

"What are you trying to do? This…"

"Don't be mistaken. I'm not trying to give you the ruler's position."

"Then, what?"

"The one who'll become the king isn't you, but my companion."

As the queen's eyes grew wider, I finished what I wanted to say.

"It'll be Han Sooyoung from <Kim Dokja's Company>."

In the following moment, there was an explosion of scenario messages
before my eyes.

[Error has occurred during the scenario's selection process!]

[Potential genre option, 'Fantasy', is falling apart!]

[Potential genre option, 'Fusion fantasy', is falling apart!]

[Potential genre option, 'Romance', is falling apart!]

[Hidden option, 'Genre: Kim Dokja's Company', is activating!]

…

…

And then, someone spoke to me.

⸢You've managed to figure it out, haven't you, Kim Dokja.⸥
              Chapter 380: Ep. 72 - Three Methods, IV


"…Han Sooyoung?"

I thought I heard her voice, but her aura disappeared rather quickly.

[Giant Story, 'Kaizenix Archipelago', cannot acknowledge your selection!]

[Worldview is displaying an abnormal reaction.]

Yuri di Aristel, inadvertently now holding Unbroken Faith, began trembling
and shouted out loudly. "You d-dare to do something like this…!!"

[You're a suitable heir to the crown of Kaizenix Archipelago.]

[Your throne is being handed over to the character 'Han Sooyoung'.]

[Worldview cannot understand your choice.]

Rays of bright light began leaking out from Yuri di Aristel's body.
Those were Stories that didn't belong to her; indeed, they were Han
Sooyoung's, stuff that I knew very well.

Yuri di Aristel hugged her shoulders as if she didn't want to let any of those
Stories to slip out of her.

"I won't let Sooyoung go like this!"

Tsu-chut, chuchuchut!!

"Be still! I told you that I'll take full responsibility, didn't I??" She wasn't
speaking to me right now. "I didn't want this sort of development, either! I,
I only thought that, if you continued to stay in this island…!"

I could guess who Yuri di Aristel was talking to, and what the topic of their
conversation right now was.

[Exclusive skill, 'Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint', has activated.]

The time Yuri di Aristel and Han Sooyoung had spent together was flowing
by like a river of fragments.

⸢"You said that you'll stay with me! You said that you'll become my
guardian, didn't you?! I really loved the scenario you've shown me. I can't
let you go like this! I…!!"⸥

⸢"My bad, Yuri."⸥

Blood bubbled out of her mouth and she staggered unsteadily before
collapsing on the ground. I hurriedly held her in an embrace. Most likely,
there was a war being fought between Han Sooyoung and Yuri di Aristel
inside this body right about now.

[Giant Story, 'Kaizenix Archipelago', is…]

[Giant Story, 'Torch That Swallowed the Myth', is…]
Giant Stories were bitterly fighting against each other in order to take over
her body.

The surrounding folks also fell into a pit of sudden confusion as well.

"Our king has changed?"

"But, with a method like this…?"

"So, does this mean that the legitimate king has appeared among us?"

The royal guards and the kingdom's citizens were exchanging glances with
complicated eyes and whispered amongst themselves.

"In that case, what about our world's genre…"

"Shh! Have you forgotten that such words are still prohibited? Just focus on
sticking to your role!"

Then again, I'd also form an expression similar to theirs if I heard that this
world's genre had suddenly become [Kim Dokja's Company].

Yoo Joonghyuk standing next to me spoke up. "Kim Dokja, we acted too
rashly."

"I know."

"This archipelago isn't prepared enough yet to accept Han Sooyoung as its
ruler."

"Since she had built up a good foundation already, I thought it was doable,
you know. I mean, she was the queen of this place up until a few moments
ago."

"She wasn't its rightful ruler. Because there is a faction unwilling to
acknowledge her that we still have the 'revolutionaries'."
A forceful change of the throne would always lead to a great deal of
birthing pain. For instance, Yuri di Aristel's 'throne usurpation' during this
scenario was not a part of the original 'Kaizenix Archipelago' scenario.

The queen's unpredictable action, and our subsequent actions, were
completely foreign events to the Reincarnators of the 'Kaizenix
Archipelago' who had repeated the exact same scenario over and over
again.

[Genre selection has been completed.]

[Applicable genre's clear conditions have not been met.]

This world was not yet ready to accept the brand-new genre that we had
created.




[<Star Stream> is discussing the topic of the applicable scenario's clear
condition.]

"Things have become complicated."

Yoo Joonghyuk and I were looking at Han Sooyoung lying on top of a
luxurious bed.

From a while ago, the sounds of chaotic explosions continued to ring out
from beyond the royal castle's walls. All the ruckus was made by two
factions fighting a bloody battle, one agreeing to the ascension of their new
ruler, and the other being the citizens who rejected her.

"Yuri di Aristel's rule was bound to fail in the end," said Yoo Joonghyuk in
a critical tone of voice. "As for us, we should've tried to gather the king's
flagbearers scattered around the powerful families in the kingdom. After
that, steadily erode away the king's influence, and unveil the Unbroken
Faith to complete the task. If that happened, the archipelago wouldn't have
fallen into chaos like this."

"Right, that would've been the best-case scenario."

"If you knew that, then why…"

"However, had we stuck to that plan, then…" I stopped there for a bit and
observed Han Sooyoung's face. "…Her 50 years would've become even
longer, you know."

"…"

"I didn't want to extend her 50 years by even one minute if I could help

it." I was being serious here.

The moment I arrived in this world and realized that Han Sooyoung had to
spend 50 years here, I just couldn't escape from this one overwhelming
emotion.

Someone was sacrificed again because of me.

Han Sooyoung who had to endure the time frame of 50 years – could she
still maintain a normal, functioning mind?

Was she able to maintain the ego of the Han Sooyoung that I know of?

"This is all because I made a deal with the 'King of Reincarnators'."

⸢It 'd b een be tter if I sac rificed myself ins tead.⸥

I turned my head to discover Yoo Joonghyuk glaring at me as if I was a
pathetic fool. His lips bobbed up and down several times, but then,
squeezed his eyes shut as if to suppress his anger and leaned his back
against the couch's cushions.
"I'd like to say something, but it seems that someone else will do that for
me, instead."

"What?"

Right in that next instant, fiery pain shot up from the back of my head.

"Hey, Kim Dokja!"

I looked back to find a familiar grinning face waiting for me.

"Everything's screwed up because of you!"

Han Sooyoung brushed her hair lazily and sat upright, before smacking me
in the head once more.




Once Han Sooyoung woke up, we immediately dove into an emergency
meeting. Other than her pale complexion, she was in pretty high spirits.

"I left behind methods for you to follow, didn't I? How come you lot can't
even do what's in the manual?! You guys are even worse than Lee
Hyunsung! You hear me?!"

I spotted Lee Hyunsung, guarding the door to our room alongside Jung
Heewon, peek his head inside through the open gap for a moment there.

"Kim Dokja. Recite to me the three methods I wrote down."

"First method, 'Fusion Fantasy' route."

"And what did it say?"

"Borrow the powers of the Outer Gods and clear the scenario… Hey, you.
That's a stupid idea from the get-go, isn't it??"
"Okay, then. The second one."

Even though I felt this inexplicable sense of unfairness, I nevertheless
continued to read Han Sooyoung's book like a school textbook.

"The second method, 'Fantasy'."

"The contents?"

"Start a revolt and kill the king. Hang on a sec, why am I reading thi…"

Her palm smacked me in the back of the head again.


God damn it, this punk…

"The third method, 'Romance'."

"And its contents are?"

"Marry Yuri di Aristel."

"And just what did you choose?"

"The third method?"

"And are we currently married?"

"Nope."

"And why the hell not?!"

I quickly evaded her flying smack and cried out. "Hey! There's no freaking
way that these are the correct methods! Did you write these down while
seriously expecting us to carry them out?!"

"You think I wrote them for your entertainment, then??"
Han Sooyoung breathed heavily like an angry bull and began wagging her
finger at me.

"If only you accepted the marriage proposal, everything would've been
resolved by now! If your legitimate claim to the throne was united with
Yuri di Aristel's martial prowess, the archipelago wouldn't have fractured
into pieces like right now!"

"But, if I did that, then you'd have ended up stuck…"

"I could've easily convinced Yuri! My original plan was supposed to begin
properly only after you got married to her!"

"…You were busy praising me for finding a solution on my own earlier,
though?"

"I was merely impressed by your stupidly bad interpretation of the
situation."

Damn it, that's how it was?

Han Sooyoung spat out a groan and continued on. "So? What are we going
to do now?"

The revolutionaries, or the royal guards – didn't matter which side we pick,
the situation would quickly descend into the worst situation imaginable.

[Error has occurred in the scenario.]

[Worldview cannot accept the conclusion to the applicable scenario.]

[Worldview is uncertain whether the character 'Han Sooyoung' possesses
the qualifications of the ruler or not.]

[<Star Stream> is discussing the topic of the applicable scenario's clear
condition.]
Citizens were fighting amongst themselves, and we were unable to leave
the scenario.

I looked at Han Sooyoung and spoke. "I'm really sorry for being so late."

She shrugged her shoulders and replied. "Yup, it's been long, these past 50
years."

I couldn't find the right words to reply to her relaxed attitude.

As if wanting to lighten my load, she continued on. "Actually, I can't
remember all that well."

"But, that doesn't sound right."

"Do you honestly believe that I'd really live out those 50 years, just like
that?"

"What then?"

"I forgot most of them. More correctly, I erased them deliberately. If I did
remember them, I'd probably have gone crazy by now."

Only then did I finally realize what her situation was. She possessed the
skill [Avatar]. And it was a pretty useful skill in erasing her memories,
depending on how it was utilised.

"The reason why I left that book behind was to preserve the stuff I'd
forget."

"You made a wise decision."

"It was a cowardly method, you know. Not something to be praised,
anyhow."

Han Sooyoung glanced at the corner of the room and spoke up. "Well, there
is a monster in the world who had lived far longer than I have and chose not
to forget a single thing, after all."
She didn't have to say who it was for me to know who she was referring to
here.

In order to lighten the awkward atmosphere, I resorted to making
exaggerated gestures while raising my voice. "Okay, let's not worry about
that and think up of a solution from now on. Speaking from the perspective
of a reader, the next portion of the story should be…"

Han Sooyoung realized what I was trying to do and quickly butted in.
"Nope. Judging from the perspective of a writer, the things we need to do
right now are…"

Han Sooyoung and I began yapping amongst ourselves with whatever we
could think up. Such as, summon a Dokkaebi and lodge our complaints, or
summon a low-ranked Outer God we are confident of dealing with, or even
smashing apart whatever was in our way, scenario or not, and try to escape
from here…

"Both of you, shut up."

…And both of us did shut up after hearing Yoo Joonghyuk's words.

Han Sooyoung studied his mood for a bit and stuck to my side while
muttering out loudly. "Well, it should be fine to trust the instincts of
the protagonist every now and then." I nodded my head in agreement.

Yoo Joonghyuk opened his mouth in the meantime.

"Later, today in the afternoon, the flagbearers of the archipelago will gather
at the royal palace. That's when we fight."

"A bog-standard tactic, then."

"That's the only method."

Yoo Joonghyuk was right, though.
Sometimes, the standard way of handling things was the best solution
available.




Night came knocking pretty quickly. Nobles dispatched by the influential
families had gathered in the audience chamber; we hurried our steps
towards there as well.

The whole of the archipelago was boiling over with this unidentifiable
hostility.

The faction arguing to distinguish the legitimate king; another faction who
sympathised with the Dark Magician; and finally, a faction utterly hostile
towards our entire group.

As we walked in the hallways filled to the brim with chaotic aura, Jung
Heewon muttered to herself. "…If only the kids were with us, it'd have
been so much better. How unfortunate."

True, if the kids possessing taming skills were here, or even Lee Jihye with
the ability to fight in a large-scale battle, we wouldn't have felt this much
pressure.

"They have things they must do by themselves. Most likely, they are in the
middle of their own scenarios."

"What about Hayoung-ssi?"

"Technically speaking, Hayoung isn't a member of <Kim Dokja's
Company>, so she should've been summoned to a different scenario from
ours."

If things were going according to the original storyline, then Jang Hayoung
should be performing her own role somewhere else. And that was
something I couldn't help her with.
I walked faster through the hallways under the protection of Jung Heewon
and Lee Hyunsung.

In front of us, Han Sooyoung and Yoo Joonghyuk were competing in a
mini foot race to see who could stay ahead. It felt like I was watching a
stork and a crow-tit¹ compete against each other.

Jung Heewon watching the same spectacle as me sneaked closer to whisper
something in my ear. "Dokja-ssi?"

"Yes?"

"I might be overstepping my boundary here a bit, but I think you should
know about this."

"Regarding?"

She locked her gaze on the backs of Yoo Joonghyuk and Han Sooyoung,
and hushed her voice even further.

"In regards to those two's relationship."



[1] Crow-tit and a stork – "If a crow tit walks like a stork, it will break its
legs" is an old Korean idiom meaning "do not bite off more than you can
chew."
              Chapter 381: Ep. 72 - Three Methods, V


"Those two, they are engaged."

"Pardon?"

I let my jaw drop at that huge bombshell and slowly shifted my head over
to Lee Hyunsung. He blushed his cheeks a little when our gazes met, and I
saw him look away soon after.

Yoo Joonghyuk and Han Sooyoung – the First Prince of the Kaizenix
Archipelago, and the esteemed daughter of an Earl.

Sure, there was quite a difference in height to overcome, but… When
looking at them some more, they did seem well suited to each other. Their
personalities were a bad match-up, but then again, they had a surprising
amount of similarities, too.

My mischievous streak reared its head and I raised my voice. "Oiii. You
two kind of resemble a black bear and a newborn chick…"
Almost at the same time, gigantic murderous intent flew in my direction.
"I'll kill you."

"One more word, and I'll tear your mouth wide open."

Cold sweat trickled down my backside.

Jung Heewon whispered in my ear. "Maybe it's better not to provoke
them?"

"I guess so. By the way… Didn't something happen on your side as well,
Heewon-ssi?"

"…Excuse me?"

I replied Jung Heewon's confusion with a grin and quickly got in between
Yoo Joonghyuk and Han Sooyoung. Their facial expressions were frozen
stiff as if they were unhappy about my joke earlier.

"Han Sooyoung. Your role is the most important one. You know that,
right? You gotta do your part properly, so that…" She didn't answer back.

"…Han Sooyoung?" Tsu-

chuchuchuchut!

Strange sparks suddenly danced around her figure. I instantly figured out
what happened; Yuri di Aristel's ego was pushing aside Han Sooyoung's.

⸢I'll never let you go.⸥

Yuri was crying out, tears streaming out of her eyes.

⸢Sooner or later, you'll regret leaving this place!⸥

⸢All the Stories you possess will wither away like ruins with no one visiting
them, and no one will remember them anymore.⸥
⸢And in the end, they won't even be able to stay frozen in this island and
vanish from this world!⸥
I looked back at her and made my reply. "That could happen."

⸢What was that?⸥

Yuri sounded dumbfounded. I quietly observed her for a moment.

Yuri di Aristel – this scenario's original heroine.

If the scenario unfolded as it should have, then by this time, she'd probably
have become the king's lover after experiencing a regular life of growing up
as someone's daughter.

⸢If you remain in this world, you'll all be safe.⸥

I could sympathise with her, who had no choice but to say something like
that, but at the same time, I could not claim to sympathise with her point of
view. Because we weren't living in the same Story.

In a way, you were simply reading the stories, no matter how many you had
read so far. Perhaps that was why, all I could do for now was not to
arrogantly convince her, but to simply imagine.

…What if Han Sooyoung was me, what would she have said right about
now?

⸢I'll ask the 'King of Reincarnators' for a favour. Let us remain in this place
together. And entrust yourselves to the Samsara's wall. When you do…⸥
"Then, we'd live on while carrying out the exact same scenario every single
time."

⸢What?⸥
I slowly blinked my eyes and asked her. "Yuri di Aristel. How did it feel
when you became the queen for the first time ever?"

Her irises quaked intensely just then.

⸢I…⸥

The 'Isle of Reincarnators' was basically a museum of ancient Stories that
had disappeared in the back alleys of the changing era.

The foundation of this world was one of the 3rd generation's
medievalthemed fantasy settings. Yuri di Aristel would've lived the same
life over and over again while repeating the actions and speeches as set out
by the Giant Story.

Han Sooyoung knew this, and she probably wanted to show her host the
possibility of new stories.

…Tell her that we were not slaves ruled by the Stories.

⸢I, only…!!⸥

Most likely, Yuri had realized it by now. Because Han Sooyoung was an
excellent writer, after all.

"You like Han Sooyoung, yes?"

⸢…⸥

"If you do, please believe in her. She will definitely not abandon you."

Yuri di Aristel looked at me for a little while before forming a complicated
expression; her presence vanished afterwards. A round of lightly-dancing
sparks later, Han Sooyoung's white irises reverted back to their normal
state.
She staggered a little bit as if she was struck by a dizzy spell. She then
looked at me as if impressed by my actions and spoke. "…Kim Dokja. Not
too shabby, eh?"

"I learned from you."

"Yuri might really want to marry you at this rate…"

"Stop with your nonsense and get ready. We're about to make our
entrance."

We pushed the doors to the audience chamber wide open. And almost
immediately, threatening air poured down on us from either sides of the
chamber itself.

At the same time, Jung Heewon stood next to me and spoke. "I'm sorry
about that time, Dokja-ssi."

I didn't have to ask her to know what she was apologising for.

"In return, I'll protect you properly this time."

"I trust you."

When Lee Hyunsung and Jung Heewon stood on my sides, the threatening
air pouring down on me softened by a good deal. I felt reassured with the
greatest sword and shield gathered in one place like this.

I scanned the crowd of people lining up on either side of the audience
chamber.

On one side, representatives from the revolutionaries.

And on the other, nobles and their flagbearers.

We walked past them and headed straight towards the throne. But, just as
we arrived before it, someone among the gathered crowd loudly shouted at
us.
"Who is the king?"

Who was the king…

They were here to get the answer to that burning question.

"Is it like what the rumour said and the Dark Magician is the new queen?"

"Show us the legitimate king!"

"Oh, dear Princes! Tell us the truth!"

The moment I saw their faces, a realization dawned on me; none of these
people were here on their own volition.

It was this world's Story that had summoned them here.

[Giant Story, 'Kaizenix Archipelago', has bared its animosity.]

Yoo Joonghyuk and I looked at Han Sooyoung simultaneously. She nodded
her head and took a step forward.

"I am the new ruler of the Kaizenix Archipelago."

The crowd immediately began protesting.

"You dare!"

"Where is the rightful heir of the Kaizenix line?"

"Kill that wench!"

Han Sooyoung didn't panic and unsheathed the sword.

"And this sword is the proof of my kingship."

Unbroken Faith emitted blindingly pure white light. Several of the crowd
recognised the weapon and went down on their knees, but still, the majority
were shooting the glares of distrust in our direction.
It was here that Yoo Joonghyuk stepped forward.

"She is indeed the Archipelago's new ruler."

The expressions of fluster appeared on the faces of First Prince's supporters
after he made that declaration. Vigorous opposition quickly rose up from
the revolutionaries.

"But, but, how can that be… Something like this has never happened
before!"

"There's a first time for everything."

"Our family cannot accept this result…!"

And at last, folks breaking character to voice their opinions made their
appearance, too.

"Your choice does not align with our worldview!"

"Our worldview simply wants…"

I addressed them with these words. "Your worldview? What could that
possibly be?"

The crowd shut their mouths. Without saying anything else, I shifted my
gaze above to the message floating in the air.

[Genre of the applicable scenario is 'Kim Dokja's Company'.]

There was no such genre called 'Kim Dokja's Company' in the world.
However, there being none didn't mean a story couldn't be told, either.

"<Kim Dokja's Company> isn't like any other genre," Yoo Joonghyuk
spoke up again. "<Kim Dokja's Company> is simply <Kim Dokja's
Company>."

Han Sooyoung raised Unbroken Faith up high, before stabbing it deeply
into the floor.
"Just like how <Kaizenix Archipelago> is simply the <Kaizenix
Archipelago>."

[Special effect of the Star Relic, 'Unbroken Faith', has activated!]

This sword utilised Ether of three differing attributes.

[Ether attribute is transforming into 'Fire'.]

Pure-white petals of flame rose up from the blade held tight in Han
Sooyoung's hand. I placed my own on the hilt of the sword.

[Ether attribute 'Darkness' has activated in tandem.]

And Yoo Joonghyuk's hand was placed on top of ours.

[Ether attribute 'Divinity' has activated in tandem.]

The three attributes of Unbroken Faith, fire, darkness, and light, began
burning up at the same time. The Archipelago's citizens had never
witnessed such a miracle before, and they stared at us in wonder.

Han Sooyoung addressed them. "The king? If you want to become one,
come here and give it a shot. That is, if you're confident of grasping this
sword."

No one tried to come closer. Everyone gathered here knew the truth already
– that the moment their hands touched that brilliant light, their bodies
would crumble away like fine dust. Even though the overwhelmed crowd
trembled in fear, some still managed to ask us questions.

"All of you, why are you doing this?"

"…What are you planning to do to this archipelago?"

This was an unprecedented development. And they had grown fearful of
this world's end.
The one who replied to them was Yoo Joonghyuk. "We didn't come here to
occupy the measly little 'Kaizenix Archipelago'."

"But, we came here to liberate you all," I quickly followed that up, and
several people began muttering among themselves.

⸢You already know what they mean, don't you?⸥

Neither Han Sooyoung, Yoo Joonghyuk, nor I said those words.

⸢We also can't repeat the exact same scenario over and over again.⸥

No, it was Yuri di Aristel who had raised her voice, instead. She had finally
realized what the conclusion to this scenario we've been wishing for was.
⸢I… plan to journey with these people.⸥
At Yuri's words, the crowd formed utterly stunned expressions. However, it
wasn't just her who had made up their minds. I felt my heart beat
powerfully all of a sudden, and someone began speaking through my lips
next.

⸢If she's willing to do so, then I shall do the same.⸥

These words belonged to my host, Fourth Prince Ricardo. Soon afterwards,
another voice came out from Yoo Joonghyuk, as well.

⸢I can't let my feeble brother go all by himself.⸥

That was from the First Prince Schweichen. After him, two more voices
came from Lee Hyunsung and Jung Heewon's position.

⸢My sword will accompany you wherever you go, your highness.⸥

⸢I'll protect you, your majesty.⸥
Both Bilston Framer and Erich Striker, too; it wasn't just Yuri who had
been watching our tales until now.

Indeed, the original protagonists of this world also had been watching us.

[Giant Story, 'Torch that Swallowed the Myth', is roaring out loudly!]

[Giant Story, 'Demon Realm's Spring', is looking at this world.]

"We will participate in the 'Great War of Saints and Demons'."

Everyone gathered here was looking at <Kim Dokja's Company>. As the
company's head representative, I addressed them once more. "And we will
liberate every person on this island from 'reincarnation'."

One by one, the crowd began kneeling down. These people, having been
playthings of the Giant Story's scenario for such a long time, were looking
at us now.

"Let's all go together."

The world was rocked by an intense vibration as soon as those words came
to an end. That was the sound of a world crumbling down. And…

[Giant Story, 'Kaizenix Archipelago', is crying out!]

…It was also the sound of a Giant Story collapsing on itself.

[Giant Story, 'Kaizenix Archipelago', is activating its authority to control
every citizen in the archipelago!]

The giant story exhausted its own existence to continue its life.
Unfortunately, what made a Giant Story a story was…

[Every Reincarnator in the Archipelago 'Kaizenix' is resisting against the
Giant Story's control.]

…None other than the people in it.
[Worldview has accepted your reply.]

[You have satisfied the scenario clear condition.] [Sub-

Scenario: 'Genre Selection' has concluded.]

[Scenario clear reward is being calculated.]

[The space-time of the applicable scenario's location is synchronising with
that of the 'Great War of Saints and Demons'.]

[Portal to the 'Great War of Saints and Demons' has been generated.]

An enormous portal emitting blinding rays of light was generated in mid-
air. It was the doorway leading up to the Great War.

"I'll go first."

Yoo Joonghyuk was the first to walk inside. Other Reincarnators, finished
making up their minds, followed after him and entered the portal's innards.

Someone even asked me this. "Do you believe we can really do this?"

"I do not know. I can only pray that you can."

"How honest."

The Reincarnator smiled awkwardly and stepped across the portal.

The waves of people flooded out of here. Han Sooyoung and I stayed back
at the end of the queue and watched them leave.

She opened her lips to speak. "You should go ahead first."

Most likely, she still had fond memories of this place. I figured that it'd not
be such a bad idea to let her have some alone time to reminisce a bit. But,
just before I could step inside the portal, she grabbed me.

"Hey, Kim Dokja."
It seemed that she wanted to ask me something. I quietly stared at her for a
bit, and eventually, she grandly sighed and waved her hand about.

"Forget it. It's nothing."

"What's the matter?"

"I said, it's nothing to worry about."

She tried to avoid my gaze while grumbling loudly.

I got worried somewhat and pulled my leg out of the portal with a sigh.

"You can just tell me. We went our separate ways in a similarly meaningful
manner the last time, and that's what's making me worried here."

"It's nothing major."

"Well, in that case, you can tell me no problem, right?"

"…Aren't you a persistent one."

Han Sooyoung sighed grandly once more and opened her lips. "In the
future…" Her gaze fixed to the floor slowly rose up as her words continued
on. "In the future when all the scenarios have ended, I may want to get back
to writing novels again."

It was the first time she looked at me with such serious eyes and that took
me by surprise just a little.

Meanwhile, she carried on. "When that happens, read my novel, okay?"

"Your novel?"

She nodded her head. "I'm giving you the opportunity to become its very
first reader."

"I'm not such a good reader, though."
"Don't be an ass and just read it when I tell you to."

"Fine, fine. I'll definitely read it."

I replied good-naturedly.

Well, it'd not be a problem to read her novel. I mean, I liked reading novels,
to begin with.

However, she must've found my response out of her expectation, because
she asked me back to confirm it. "…For real?"

"Yeah, for real."

She stared at me with disbelieving eyes. "But, it might be over three
thousand chapters?"

"That's probably right up my alley, then."

"It might be boring, too."

"It's you writing it, so that's not possible, you know."

Han Sooyoung's eyes grew wider after hearing my reply.

I felt somewhat embarrassed at myself, so I quickly said something else.
"What genre will it be?"

"I'll cross that bridge when I get there…"

"How about romance?"

"…How can I milk 'romance' for three thousand chapters??"

We shared such light-hearted banter while shifting our gazes back to the
portal. That's where Lee Hyunsung and Jung Heewon walking together
could be seen. I sensed this awkwardness in the air between them and it was
nice to see that.
"Well, those two might need three thousand chapters, and then some."

It was then, nice-sounding messages resounded out from the sky.

[Restriction on indirect messaging has been lifted.]

[Constellation, 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband', is cheering out in
happiness!]

[Constellation, 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon', is enjoying the warm
atmosphere!]

[Constellation, 'Demon-like Judge of Flame', is freaking out!]

It seemed that, with the conclusion of the scenario, the channel had been
reopened again.

[Constellation, 'Demon-like Judge of Flame', is shielding her Incarnation.]

[Constellation, 'Demon-like Judge of Flame', is being vigilant of
Constellation, 'Master of Steel'.]

[Constellation, 'Master of Steel', is feeling wronged.]

Han Sooyoung smirked and muttered to herself. "Romance, is it…"

She and I stepped across the portal together. I could see the Constellations
waiting for our arrival in the distance.

[You've come, <Kim Dokja's Company>.]

Finally, we reached the opening stages of the 'Great War of Saints and
Demons'.
         Chapter 382: Ep. 73 - The hottest place in Hell, I


Shin Yoosung opened her eyes because of the bright spotlights that danced
in the air. One of the flying drones circled around her head once, before
disappearing into the distant black sky.

"Urgh, my head…"

Under the head-spinning dizzy spell, she staggered unsteadily back to her
feet. The only things she could see around her were scrap metal and
rubbish. She couldn't see any of the companions she was with.

…Could she have landed in this place all alone?

"Shin Yoosung?"

A boy pushed his head out from among the scrap metal like some kind of a
baby octopus.

"Lee Gilyoung?"
Feeling happy now, she shifted her gaze over there, but then, the figure of
woman leapt out from the piles of rubbish while stepping on the boy's head.

"Get out of the way! You stink, you know!"

"Jihye unni!"

She figured out who came along with her. Her companions brushed away
all the trash stuck on their bodies and stood upright.

"What's this? Is it just us?"

"I think so."

"Heh, it's the reformation of Busan Alliance."

Lee Jihye spoke with a slightly excited tone of voice, but Shin Yoosung
was different.

Why did it have to be Jihye and Gilyoung? She alternated her gaze between
her two companions and made a resolution in her mind.

'I'm the only adult here. So, I gotta stay sharp'.

Whether they knew her thoughts or not, Lee Jihye and Gilyoung continued
their glaring contest, only to suddenly delve straight into deciding the
pecking order.

"Hm, hm. Hey, kids. We should choose the leader first, like how we've
done so far, right?"

"Noona, you were the leader back in Busan Alliance. So, it's my turn now."

"Hey, you. You weren't even born yet when I got admitted to the
kindergarten, you know."

"Ah? What's that got to do with anything?!"

"Shh. Both of you, keep quiet!"
The moment Shin Yoosung's voice was heard, all three of them pressed
themselves tightly against a nearby wall in unison. A millisecond later, a
drone flying around like some sort of an insect shone a spotlight on the
alleyway they were standing in just now.

Giiiiii-iiing…

The drone hovered in position for a little while, and eventually, it
disappeared beyond the alleyway, its sensors tilting this way and that.

Lee Jihye asked in a tense voice. "Hey, wasn't that a drone?"

It was right then, the system messages could be heard from the sky.

[Someone has interfered with the scenario system.]

[Due to the unprecedented power, you have been forcibly summoned to the
Main Island's 'Next City'!]

['Next City' is currently cut off from the space-time of the conflict region of
the 'Great War of Saints and Demons'.]

[You can advance to the 'Great War of Saints and Demons' once you solve
the sub-scenario of the applicable location.]

"Next City??" Gilyoung's eyes began sparkling. "Let's go and take a look!"

"Stop being childish, Lee Gilyoung. This isn't a game!"

Despite Shin Yoosung's warning, the boy broke into a sprint. Fortunately,
there was no drone nearby, and the spot they were hiding in was situated in
a surprisingly high altitude.

"Wow, this…"

They were treated to a magnificent sight where the whole city could be seen
in one take. Bright neon signs illuminating the night streets; androids
emitting blue light beams from their heads, roaming around said streets as if
putting on a protest march.

They could immediately tell what the worldview here was from this
spectacle.

Lee Gilyoung spoke confidently. "I'm gonna get super strong in this place
and surprise Dokja hyung later."

"He'll get even mooore surprised if you get killed here, instead."

"…Noona, why do you hate me so much??"

Disregarding the bickering duo, for now, Shin Yoosung carefully observed
the panoramic view of the city below.

If one were to discount the slight disturbance created by the protest, it
looked as if the city was functioning systematically according to a set of
strict rules. This was a sci-fi worldview retaining a level of social order
previously unheard of.

She remembered hearing that the 'Isle of Reincarnators' were graves of
fading Stories. If so, why did a world like this one meet its doom?

In the meantime, Lee Jihye and Gilyoung were excitedly yapping away,
without any care given for Shin Yoosung's concerns.

"Will they have stuff like a lightsabre here?"

"What a helpless sword otaku…"

"Shut up."

"Uh? Wait, I think they are really equipped with something like
lightsabres."

"Really? Where?"
They could see the guards patrolling the city sauntering closer to their
location. Maybe because of the worldview's effects, information windows
of the guards floated up in front of their eyes after they took a closer look.

[Lv. 12 Guard-type Android]

[The applicable unit is around 4 times stronger than you.]

Lee Jihye freaked out and muttered out loudly. "What the hell? Why are
they so strong?"

"I think it's us who got weak."

For sure, the density of the magical energy in the surroundings had
decreased noticeably ever since they arrived in this worldview.

[Your main Stats have been reverted back to their initial values in the
applicable worldview.]

[This worldview is subjected to the corrective effect of 'Level System'.]

"God damn it, they are coming this way!"

When did they realize it? Guards were suddenly rushing towards the
group's position. They looked up at the sky only to discover several drones
circling above their heads.

[Reaction to Story energy detected!]

[Reaction to Story energy detected!]

Along with the loud warning sounds, the guards increased their speed by
engaging the boosters mounted on their backs and pounced on the group in
a row. Lee Jihye, Shin Yoosung, and Gilyoung hurriedly pulled out their
individual weapons.

"Screw it, there aren't even any bugs here… Hey, Shin Yoosung, can you
summon the Chimera Dragon?"
"The cooldown time isn't over yet."

[Your current level is 1.]

[Earn experience points by hunting low-level enemies.]

With a deeply agonised look on her face, Lee Jihye unsheathed her
longsword. She was the only one specialised in close-quarter battles among
her group.

Quickly activating [Demon Slaying] and [Ghost Walk], she faced off
against a guard in order to protect the kids. Just as the android's lightsabre
collided with her longsword…

Giiii-iiing!

The lightsabre simply let her blade slide by and proceeded to cut her
forearm.

"Aaaahk!"

[Android 'Lee Jihye' has been seriously injured!]

[Please administer Story energy to preserve your life.]

She backed away quickly, but it was already too late by then.

"Get out of the way!"

Shin Yoosung pushed Lee Jihye aside and stepped forward. The latter's
complexion paled instantly and cried out towards the former; Gilyoung
stretched his arms out, too.

Unfortunately, the lightsabre was already descending towards the crown
of her head. 'Ahjussi'.

At that moment, the girl looked back on her short life. She felt this sense of
unfairness, knowing that it'd be over in a place like this; yet, at the same
time, there was also a sense of satisfaction, too, knowing that her choice
was correct.

Shin Yoosung thought that this was the final moments befitting the
Incarnation of the 'Demon King of Salvation'.

And then, in the next second…

[The applicable attack does not work on you.]

Along with the sparks going 'Tsu-chuchuchut!', the guard's lightsabre
stopped millimeters away from her nose as if blocked by a formless wall.
"Uh?"

And new messages popped up in the air one after the other.

[Error has occurred in the scenario's system.]

[Giant Story, 'Next City', is expressing its puzzlement over the existence of
Incarnation 'Shin Yoosung'.]

It was the exact same story for Lee Gilyoung, as well. The lightsabres
attacking the kids were all being powered down simultaneously.

The boy dazedly looked up at the air and muttered softly to himself.

"…What's going on?"

He could see letters written in the faint grey font on the top right-hand
corner of his vision.

[Current scenario's age restriction is 18+.]

[Due to the applicable worldview's consideration, murderous actions aimed
at children/teenage units are prohibited.]

Shin Yoosung and Lee Gilyoung exchanged glances.
'…Isn't this, like, huge?'

It was unknown how they ended up getting summoned here. However, if it
was this sort of a worldview, then…

Gilyoung formed a sneaky grin aimed at Lee Jihye and her wide-open jaw
behind him.

"Noona? Get ready for a free bus ride."

While watching the boy shove his shortsword into the guard's upper thigh
area, Shin Yoosung began thinking to herself.

'Maybe, remaining as a kid for a bit longer is…'

She didn't know what was waiting for her at the end of this scenario.
However, she was sure of one thing – at the end of this scenario, they
should be strong enough to utterly stun Kim Dokja.




I was left utterly stunned by the Constellations waiting for me on the other
side of the portal. Even at a quick glance, it was well more than one or two
here.

…Could it be that they knew we were coming?

"Dokja-ssi."

Lee Hyunsung's voice sounded tense, and I nodded my head at him. Yoo
Joonghyuk, Han Sooyoung, Lee Hyunsung, and Jung Heewon. Including
me, the five of us gathered in one spot like a constellation in the night sky.

Soon, though, scenario messages floated up in the air.

[Main Scenario has been updated!]
[You and your Nebula have entered the neutral zone of 'Great War of Saints
and Demons'!]

[You can select either camp of 'Great War of Saints and Demons'!]

Right after those alerts, a notice message dyed the sky in rainbow colours
next.

[Nebula, <Kim Dokja's Company>, has entered the 'Great War of Saints
and Demons'!]

Without a doubt, Dokkaebis must've been behind that. We had just got here,
yet they were advertising it all over the place already.

[Many Constellations have noticed your presence!]

[Some Nebulas are keeping an eye on your group's next move.]

It wasn't an ideal situation, but naught we could do about it, as it was spilt
milk. I met the gazes of the Constellations looking at us from the other side.
They were emitting pretty hefty Statuses, too.

I even spotted a familiar Constellation among them.

[You're late, Descendant.]

A man with a dignified smile was looking in our direction. I called out to
him in happiness.

"Goryeo's First Sword!"

He was none other than Cheok Jungyeong, the one we had to say goodbye
to during the 'Middle Island' scenario.

As expected of a Constellation who had reached the Narrative-grade, it
seemed that he advanced to the main island without any issues.

[You must've completed quite a substantial scenario. You've gained more
companions.]
His gaze was now studying the Reincarnators emerging from the portal
alongside us. They were people from 'Kaizenix Archipelago', entering the
main island with me.

"They are folks who'll participate in the 'Great War of Saints and Demons'
with us."

Cheok Jungyeong nodded his head.

[Higher number of combat forces can certainly help. More importantly,
however… Something seems to have changed with you, Descendant.]

He scanned me from top to bottom as if he was searching for something.

[I can sense this vague depth to your group's Story.]

"…Is that so?"

Cheok Jungyeong's gaze left me and headed towards Han Sooyoung. She
met his stare with a pair of impetuous eyes that said, "What are you looking
at?"

A strange light flickered within the former's eyes.

[…I see.]

I abruptly recalled what the 'Mandala's Guardian' told me.

– Oh, dear Bodhisattva. Please, try to endure time itself.

Our Nebula's Stories had experienced an unknown change after clearing the
Kaizenix Archipelago.

The time Lee Hyunsung, Jung Heewon and especially Han Sooyoung, spent
in Kaizenix was definitely not in vain. Everything that happened was
recorded as Stories, and they would raise our Statuses in turn.
It might have been due to what Cheok Jungyeong said, but well, I could
sense Constellations spying on us from behind, staring far more openly than
before.

[Constellation, 'Expert at Playing Both Sides', is getting interested in you.]

[Constellation, 'King of Archers', is observing you in great interest.]
[Constellation, 'Three Mouths But Only One Head', is sneering at the
Reincarnators from 'Kaizenix Archipelago'.]

Reincarnators from the archipelago retreated from the feast of Statuses.
Now that they have emerged outside the 'Kaizenix Archipelago', they were
no longer protected by their worldview.

[Constellation, 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon', is growling!]

It was Han Sooyoung who stepped forward as if to shield these
Reincarnators. The atmosphere wiggled and the aura of the Black Flame
Dragon manifested itself behind her. The folks from Kaizenix bowed their
heads to pay their respect to her, then.

Indeed, that must be what they refer to as the kingly air.

Unfortunately, some Constellations didn't seem to like her display. It didn't
take long for their aura to become threatening.

Ku-gugugugu!

[An Incarnation from a small Nebula dares to…!]

Feeling a bit annoyed now, I decided that I should stop the current flow
right about here.

[Giant Story, 'Torch that Swallowed the Myth', is glaring at the
Constellations!]

The activation of the Giant Story managed to startle the Constellations and
they took several steps back.
I didn't miss that opportunity and asked Cheok Jungyeong a question.
"Enough about that. Why have you been waiting for us?"

He formed a slightly troubled expression. The light in his eyes flickered as
he tried to decide whether it'd be okay to say it or not.

I could think up a couple of hypotheses just then, and chose to test one of
them out. "I know that this is the neutral zone. Have you decided on which
camp of the Great War to join yet?"

[No, not yet.]

…I see. He still hadn't chosen his side.

Cheok Jungyeong continued on.

[As you may well know, 'Good' and 'Evil' of the Constellations aren't the
same with that of the mortals. If I'm allowed to be honest, then I do not
wish to be a part of either camp.]

Cheok Jungyeong, starting as a mortal and reaching the ranks of
Constellation through his own power only, like me, wouldn't have agreed to
the concept of good and evil as claimed by the Archangels and Demon
Kings. That was why I could sympathise with his dilemma.

However, that story would always be his to mull over, no one else's.

I glanced at the Constellations behind him and asked. "They haven't chosen
their sides, I presume?"

Cheok Jungyeong nodded his head.

Behind him, scattered groups of Constellations could be seen loitering
around tents set up here and there on a huge open plain.

[What is the current war situation like?]

[From what I was able to find, it…]
Faint 'true voices' could be heard coming from them.

I smirked inwardly; in all honesty, it was easy to see what they were
thinking of by not having chosen a camp yet.

Constellations in the neutral zone were planning to stay back and observe
the proceedings, and then join the side with the advantageous position and
enter the Great War.

Yoo Joonghyuk and Han Sooyoung engaged [Midday Tryst] at the same
time to talk to me.

– I can tell what the current situation is like.

– These bastards, they are going for 'that', right?

I nodded my head.

The stronger the 'neutral' camp that hadn't chosen a side grew in power, the
potential benefits to be gained when it did choose would be even greater.

[Constellation, 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband', is looking down on the
Constellations of the neutral zone.]

[Constellation, 'Hell's Scribe', is letting others know that the hottest place in
Hell is reserved for those who maintain neutrality in times of moral
crisis…]

Didn't matter whether it was 'Good' or 'Evil', they were thinking of selling
their influence to the highest bidder out there.

Han Sooyoung broke out in a smirk.

– Their aim is so easy to see through.

It was right about then that Cheok Jungyeong ended his deliberation and
opened his lips. [There is someone who wishes to meet you.]

"Who is it?"
[A high-ranking Constellation from the Nebula, <Hongik>.]

Thought as much.

It seemed that Cheok Jungyeong was here to win us over.

I hid this faint sense of disappointment and asked him again. "But, didn't
you tell me that high-ranking Constellations of <Hongik> have all
disappeared?"

Indeed, I heard something like that a long time ago. Once, at the
'Constellation Banquet', and when facing 'Founder's Mother' back inside the
[Dark Castle].

[We did not disappear. Because there is one right in front of you.]

It was a true voice containing aloof, proud Status; the ranks of the
Constellation parted, and a Taoist hermit holding a pure-white folded fan
was walking towards us. From each of his steps, I felt the power of
vigorous winds.

…Hey, I think I know who this is.

[Kneel and pay your respects, oh, descendants of the Peninsula.]
         Chapter 383: Ep. 73 - The hottest place in Hell, II


This guy just popped out of nowhere and demands us to kneel down…

Han Sooyoung next to me carried a dumbfounded expression, while Yoo
Joonghyuk was already reaching towards his sword. Cheok Jungyeong was
massaging his forehead; it seemed that he expected a situation like this
already.

– My apologies, Descendant. I tried to talk him out of it, but I wasn't
successful.

True, he'd not enjoy situations like this. But, he owed <Hongik> a lot, so
he probably couldn't say no to them asking him to organise this meeting…
– I shall leave it to your decision.

I nodded my head and looked at the Taoist hermit.

[Constellation ruling over the Peninsula's Winds has revealed his Modifier!]

[Constellation, 'Heavenly Wind God', is now looking at you!]
The 'Heavenly Wind God' – the Constellation who founded <Hongik>
alongside the Heavenly King.

His real name was 'Pungbaek', although most of us simply knew him as the
God of Wind.

Ku-gugugugu!

The Status of the Constellation who had finally revealed his Modifier,
caused strong gusts of wind that resembled the flapping wings of a giant
Phoenix, to sweep past the surroundings. And then, all ambient noises
disappeared.

The Reincarnators outside the wind wall were shouting something in my
direction, but I couldn't hear them. Pungbaek had cut off all the sounds
coming from outside.

He probably didn't want others to hear our conversation.

[Oh, descendant of the Peninsula, I've heard the tales of your bravery. As
your fame spreads far and wide, the status of the Peninsula rises higher in
accordance. This god sees that situation as very satisfactory.]

I quickly sent a signal with my eyes to Yoo Joonghyuk busy raising his
momentum – telling him to hold it, let's at least hear this guy out first.

[However, I've heard disturbing stories that lately, you've been building
inappropriate relationships with foreign Constellations.]

…I began wondering whether I should keep listening or not, though.

[Archangels and Demon Kings are not Constellations originally from
East Asia, or the Peninsula. Meaning, they are foreign influences.] Han
Sooyoung shot me a sneaky glare.

– Hey, you. Are you just gonna let this guy be?
– I shall cut him down.

– What the heck, is the wire crossed or something? How come I can
hearYoo Joonghyuk's voice?

– I combined the Midday Tryst's space.

My declaration prompted an explosion of messages from her and Yoo
Joonghyuk.

– Hey! Stop messing around! You want me to listen to that arrogant
bastard'svoice in my head, too?

– You've taken words out of my mouth.

I sighed softly after seeing the two growl at each other.

– Stop it, both of you. That's not important right now, is it?

While we were squabbling inside our chatroom, Pungbaek was still
continuing on with his dull moral lecture.

[…meaning, descendant's friendly behaviour towards foreign influences has
caused much dishonour to the Peninsula, and this god considers that as a
weighty crime. However, if you, the descendant, reflect deeply regarding
this matter and repent, then…]

Hell, a Constellation that agreed with those words even made his
appearance, too.

[Constellation, 'Founder of National Isolation Policy', agrees in part with
the assertion of 'Heavenly Wind God'.]

Of course, not everyone was like that; our little peninsula boasted a
surprisingly wide variety of Constellations, after all.

[Constellation, 'Bald General of Justice', is polishing his head.]

[Constellation, 'First Sorcerer of Joseon', is clicking his tongue.]
[Constellation, 'Prisoner of Golden Headband', is yawning in boredom.]
[Portion of Korean Peninsula's Constellations thinks the declaration by
'Heavenly Wind God' is old-fashioned.]

[Who dares to hide behind anonymous Modifiers and run their mouths
off?!]

As Pungbaek's true voice rang thunderously in the air, the weather above
began shifting ominously. Suppressed by that tremendous aura, several
Constellations quickly shut their mouths.

Whatever the case might have been, he was an existence very close to the
ancestor god of the Peninsula.

Although the individual amount received differed, Constellations of the
Peninsula had indeed received benefits and favours from <Hongik>, and
none could challenge them face to face as a result.

Not even Cheok Jungyeong himself.

[By the way, why are you still standing up?]

Eventually, Pungbaek's gaze landed on me. The current atmosphere shifted
ever so slightly from what it was like earlier.

[Did I not tell you to kneel?]

Ginormous pressure pushed down on me. Not just me, though; it pushed
down on the entire <Kim Dokja's Company>.

[Stories from Nebula <Hongik> are observing <Kim Dokja's Company>!]

It felt as if a giant ancient tree had bent down to take a look at us – a giant
tree that salivated after the nutrients meant for a new-born sprout.

I quietly held that gaze for a little while, before making my reply. "I don't
want to."
[Indeed, you don't… What did you say?]

"I said, I don't want to."

[Constellation, 'Prisoner of Golden Headband', is liking your attitude.]

[Constellation, 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' is coaxing you to start with a
punch first.]

"I came here to participate in the Great War, not to kneel to you."

[How boundlessly arrogant. I looked favourably at your bravery and wished
to pardon your sins, but…]

"After you pardon me, what then?"

Pungbaek's brows quivered at my pointed reply.

"You were thinking of absorbing <Kim Dokja's Company> through the
authority of <Hongik>, were you not?"

As if his hidden plot had been accurately pointed out, emotions could be
spied on that stoic Constellation's expression now.

[It is only obvious that your group must come under the wing of
<Hongik>.]

"Why do you think that?"

[If <Hongik> did not exercise its might at the beginning, your Nebula
wouldn't have been born.]

As if he was a parent being betrayed by his child, Pungbaek began shouting
at me.

[<Hongik> is the founder of the Peninsula! We gave birth to you, we set the
morality you must follow, and we created the rules. It was us who
determined what you'd see, feel, and think. Because the Story of <Hongik>
exists, you exist here now, and through that Story, you survi…]
"Four years ago in Earth's time, 'scenarios' began on the Korean Peninsula."
I cut Pungbaek's words off. "When the Peninsula fell into mortal danger,
what did <Hongik> do at that time?"

[…!!]

"When scenarios began on the Peninsula, when the [Absolute Throne]
appeared, when Outer Gods and Calamities descended, and when the
Peninsula's Incarnations and Constellations had to work together because of
them…"

Certain memories began rushing back every time I spoke a word. Scenarios,
overcome by the gathering of people who had no one to rely on; the [Four
Yin Demon Beheading Sword] plunging down on the blind throne and the
Peninsula's Constellations who lent their Probabilities to that weapon.

[Story, 'King of a Kingless World', is glaring at 'Heavenly Wind God'.]

[Story, 'King of a Kingless World', has begun its storytelling!]

I didn't do anything, yet the Story began coming to life, anyway. 'King of a
Kingless World' was born as the [Absolute Throne] was destroyed.

I recited the story of this Story, and through me, this Story spoke of itself.
"During those times, where were you and the oh-so-great Constellations
of <Hongik>? And what were you all doing?" Tsu-chuchuchut!

[You bastard!]

Pungbaek glared at me as if he'd start vomiting blood at any second.

"Of course, I know that you and <Hongik> worked hard to aid the
Peninsula during its infant stages. I do acknowledge the value of the Story
you people possess. Unfortunately, that doesn't mean everyone from the
Peninsula must swear loyalty to you," I finished my speech while watching
Pungbaek's beard tremble from rage. "Everyone has their own way of
clearing 'scenarios'. Even if you're the Peninsula's highest-grade
Constellation, you can't interfere with the actions of <Kim Dokja's
Company>."

Cheok Jungyeong seemed to be enjoying my daring, fearless tone of voice.
It'd probably be his first time seeing Pungbaek get treated in this manner.
[You dare, you dare…!]

In place of the rendered-speechless Pungbaek, a Story's forceful aura rose
up from behind him.

[Giant Story of the Nebula, <Hongik>, is staring at you!]

[Nebula, <Hongik>, is extending its roots towards <Kim Dokja's
Company>!]

Giant Stories belonging to <Hongik> began rising up to the heavens one by
one like tree branches, and eventually, formed an image of a gigantic tree. I
knew what that was straight away.

⸢The tree that connects the Heavens to Earth below, as well as the totality of
all the Stories that <Hongik> puts to practice; the one Story that supports all
those Stories.⸥

⸢The Fabled Tree, Shindansu.⸥

Every Story of <Hongik> began with that very tree in front of my eyes.
Shindansu spread its holy aura all around and extended its branches made
up of Stories.

Seeing that admonition alone wasn't doing the trick, it was now trying
to show off its might, instead. What a bitter experience that was. The
truly bitter thing about this situation was, though…

"I see that the real highest-ranked Constellations of <Hongik> did
disappear."
[…What do you mean by that?]

This Shindansu was so much smaller and shabbier compared to the one that
I knew. Not only that, the ends of the tree's roots extending towards us were
all horrifyingly damaged. What I saw were Giant Stories failing to sustain
their shapes after not having absorbed nutrients for a long time; most of the
branches connected to these roots had withered almost beyond recognition.

That was the total sum of what <Hongik> currently possessed.

"I speak of these words because I pity you."

The 'Pungbaek' from the original storyline that I knew was not an obstinate
geezer like this guy. Sure, he wasn't exactly the warmest guy around, but
still, he was a Constellation possessing far greater class and righteousness.

However, something happened to <Hongik> and the Nebula's influence
shrunk back at a rapid pace. The reason why Pungbaek became so destitute
probably had something to do with that event.

[You dare to show disdain towards this god?!]

Pungbaek roared out and roused up the powers of the wind; giant storm
energy began gathering all around us. As the enormous Status suppressed
the entire land, Reincarnators from 'Kaizenix Archipelago' began writhing
around in pain.

Han Sooyoung urged me one more time.

– Kim Dokja.

I nodded my head.

Although the current appearance of <Hongik> was lamentable, at the end of
the day, it had nothing to do with us.
I took a step forward, prompting Yoo Joonghyuk next to me to unsheathe
his sword, while Han Sooyoung unfurled the bandages on her left arm. And
then…

[Giant Story, 'Demon Realm's Spring', has begun its storytelling!]

[Giant Story, 'Torch that Swallowed the Myth', has begun its storytelling!]

The Giant Stories that had been held back until now opened their mouths
simultaneously. Not only that…

[Giant Story, 'Kaizenix Archipelago', is repeating its storytelling as if it's
displeased.]

…Along with a Giant Story that wasn't even one of ours, too.

Shu-weh-eh-eh-ehk!!

The roots of the giant tree flying in towards us began crumbling away from
the billowing waves generated from our Stories.

[Body of the Giant Story, 'Shindansu', is in great pain!]

Those menacing roots extending out to swallow us whole faltered in their
tracks and scattered away – as if scared by the stories it could not devour.
The still-intact roots belatedly retreated, and the withered, bony branches
screamed out loudly.

[Body of the Giant Story, 'Shindansu', refuses to heed the orders of
'Heavenly Wind God'.]

[But, how…?]

Shindansu withdrew its roots and instantly vanished from the view.

Perhaps taken greatly by surprise from the Statuses of the Giant Stories we
possessed, the freaking-out Pungbaek staggered back several steps.
I sensed the Constellations scattered around the neutral zone looking in this
direction after getting startled by this disturbance.

[Baat!]

Biyoo suddenly popped up right above my head as if she was waiting for
this moment. At the same time, I sensed her channel opening up.

[A large number of Constellations have joined the channel!]

Biyoo's channel was connected to Bihyung's broadcast channel; I could
picture that Dokkaebi's pleased face already.

It was pretty clear why he had induced this situation; although I wasn't too
happy about it, this was something that had to be done sooner or later,
anyway.

[Constellation, 'Bald General of Justice', is paying attention to your voice!]

[Constellation, 'Maritime War God', is waiting for your story.]

[Demon King, 'Ruler of East Hell', is staring at you.]

[Constellation, 'Scribe of Heaven', is waiting for you.]

[Constellations of 'Good', 'Evil', and 'Neutral' are carefully observing you.]

Several indirect messages floated up one after the other.

I stared at Pungbaek and opened my lips to issue a warning not just aimed
at <Hongik>. "I will not say that everything we do will be righteous.
However, the paths we tread will be decided by us alone."

I declared loudly towards the Constellations of the world.

"And, no one can change our decision."
        Chapter 384: Ep. 73 - The hottest place in Hell, III


As if they were waiting for it, gazes rained down from the heavens.

[Constellation, 'Bald General of Justice', agrees with your words.]

[Constellation, 'Maritime War God', nods his head at your words.]

[Constellation, 'Prisoner of Golden Headband', asks you why you had to
repeat something so obvious.]

[Constellation, 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon', is coaxing you to quickly
punch that old bastard.]

Pungbaek heard what the Black Flame Dragon said in disbelief and shot a
glare at the sky. He was about to say something, but then, the next indirect
message made him flinch just a little.

[Constellation, 'Goryeo's First Sword', believes that 'Demon King of
Salvation' is correct.]
Pungbaek's head snapped towards Cheok Jungyeong right away.
[Jungyeong, even you…!]

As if he felt ashamed by it, the latter avoided the piercing gaze.

Honestly, even I was surprised.

No matter how badly it had fallen, <Hongik> was still the Korean
Peninsula's main Nebula. Even under the current circumstances, it wouldn't
have been easy for Cheok Jungyeong to go against <Hongik> and side with
me.

[Many Constellations are getting interested in the clash between <Kim
Dokja's Company> and <Hongik>!]

Maybe it was due to Cheok Jungyeong's declaration, I now could sense
the attention of other Constellations. Among the winds newly blowing in
the neutral zone, I could sense their wary eyes locked on me. I looked
back at Pungbaek. "Are you going to continue?"

Honestly, watching his eyelids tremble intensely like that was difficult even
for me.

I spoke as if to mock <Hongik> earlier, but in truth, it wasn't as if Pungbaek
had been doing nothing to help with the Korean Peninsula's scenarios. The
thing was, the Constellation who lent his aid to my mother back during the
'Returnees War' was none other than Pungbaek himself.

That damn event stole away her lifespan in its entirety, though. Maybe, that
could be the reason why I was so pissed off right now.

[The Wind shall never forget today's matter.]

Pungbaek glared at me for the longest time before snapping his fan shut to
vanish like specks of scattering dust.
[A large number of Constellations are impressed with your backbone!]
[Small number of Constellations will remember that the reputation of <Kim
Dokja's Company> is not unwarranted.]

[Gossipers of <Star Stream> have recorded the applicable incident.]

Yoo Joonghyuk, Han Sooyoung, Jung Heewon, and Lee Hyunsung –
everyone was staring at me. I couldn't spot any traces of fear in their
expressions.

Most likely, they were thinking something similar.

It didn't matter what others said about our Nebula. No, we only had to move
forward towards the story we believed to be the right one.

[A choice befitting you, Descendant.]

Cheok Jungyeong, observing us, spoke.

[Some Constellations will like that aspect of you and follow after you.
Truthfully, many Constellations of the Korean Peninsula are focusing more
on you rather than on <Hongik>. But… In return, those who hold animosity
towards you have grown in number, as well.]

I grew cognizant of the fact that the surrounding gazes now felt different
after hearing him; some Constellations were glaring at us, while some were
looking on with envy. And some even shook their heads, their eyes saying
that we'd eventually become just like everyone else.

⸢Once upon a time, we used to be like you.⸥

Suddenly, it felt as if the Stories these Constellations experienced were near
enough for me to reach out and touch them.

[Ancient Giant Stories are staring at the Story of <Kim Dokja's
Company>.]
Every Story was the evidence of one overcoming scenarios. At times, they'd
serve as someone else's entertainment.

Every Story that reached this far had to break down and bend over in order
to survive. The times when they had to make compromises with the reality
of <Star Stream>, and when they had to agree to the demands of the
Constellations and Dokkaebis in order to carry on; that was how they
managed to get here.

As if he was the voice of those times, Cheok Jungyeong spoke up.

[<Star Stream> hates stories that haven't been broken yet. Especially so,
with a story as pure as yours.]

Pure and not broken yet…

A chuckle left my lips after hearing that.

I was surprised that the world viewed us like that. Because that was
basically ignoring every road we've walked on so far.

"We had been broken over a dozen times already."

<Kim Dokja's Company> didn't stand on two feet from the word 'go'.

After the Korean Peninsula's scenarios began, it had to endure against the
Constellations' schemes and their inexplicable rage. Just like so many other
countless Stories, in other words.

"However, we managed to stand back up every single time. And now,
we've reached this far."

To us, the word 'pure' was more like an insult at this point.

[Giant Story, 'Demon Realm's Spring', is calmly staring at you.]

[Giant Story, 'Torch that Swallowed the Myth', is holding back its intense
crying.]
As if they were agreeing with what I said, the two Giant Stories showed
some reactions.

"And in the future, we will continue to get back on our feet."

[The germinating third 'Giant Story' has displayed fetal movements.]

Even the third Giant Story soon to awaken reacted the same. Cheok
Jungyeong observing us slowly nodded his head.

[I shall continue to watch your story.]

At the end of those words, he turned around to leave. Korean Peninsula's
Constellations under him glanced at us for a bit before disappearing
alongside him.

He had surpassed the level of Historical-grade and stepped into the
Narrative-grade. On top of that, he had been a Constellation for a far longer
period of time than I, and he would be one of the best allies to have on our
side as he was a gifted natural-born fighter.

Of course, that would be under the assumption of us fighting on the same
side.

I must've stood around looking too cool for my own good, since Han
Sooyoung, staring at me from the side, slapped my shoulder and jeered at
me.

– Hey, you. Some people might think you're the protagonist or something.

Feeling a bit sheepish, I sneaked a glance in Yoo Joonghyuk's direction, but
he wasn't looking at me but at the distant horizon, instead.

"It has begun."

[Scenario event has been generated!]
[Regional conflict for 'Great War of Saints and Demons' is scheduled to
take place in the near vicinity of the applicable area!]

Neutral-leaning Constellations and Incarnations sitting around their
scattered tents were stunned by the system messages and hurriedly stood
up.

[When entering the conflict zone, 'camp selection' will automatically
generate!]

The sight of two enormous factions marching forward could be seen from
afar.

The white-winged angels, decked out in armours brightly reflecting the
light were dyeing the land in a silvery hue along with Incarnations and
Reincarnators.

On the other side, Demon Kings stained in corrupted and demonic energy
were advancing forward with their dependents in tow.
[Updated Main Scenario has arrived!]


<Main Scenario #80 – 'Great War of Saints and Demons'>

Type: Main

Difficulty: Indeterminable

Clear condition: Participate in the Great War by siding with either camp
of Absolute Good or Absolute Evil. 'Good/Evil Points' of the camps will
increase when the affiliated camp accumulate a higher number of
victories in the scenario. Once the Points of a camp exceeds 100, the
victor in the war will be decided.

Time Limit: the applicable scenario's time limit is affected by 'Chaos
Points'


Reward: Story related to 'Great War of Saints and Demons', ???

Failure: Death


[Current state of Great War's progress]



Absolute Good Points: 56

Absolute Evil Points: 56

Chaos Points: 51

[Chaos Points will increase the longer the Great War is being fought. ]
[You must select a camp in order to participate in the applicable conflict.]

[The scenario rewards will be greater the sooner you choose your camp.]

We fell into a bout of silence while reading the scenario's contents. The first
one to break it was Han Sooyoung.

"Kim Dokja, what next? Do as we always did?"

[Constellation, 'Hell's Scribe', is letting others know that the hottest place in
Hell is reserved for those who maintain neutrality in times of moral
crisis…]

"That wasn't even something he originally said, yet why is he being so
damn chatty with that line??"

[Constellation, 'Hell's Scribe', flinches in surprise and has closed his
mouth.]

This 'Hell's Scribe' was actually the author of [Divine Comedy], Dante
Alighieri. And that famous line often credited to him actually had been
repurposed by the politicians of a later era. Still, that quote served to
enhance his fame in the long run, so he should have accepted that as a part
of his own Story.

⸢The hottest place in Hell is reserved for those who maintain neutrality in
times of moral crisis.⸥
It sure was a stirring quote when you first listen to it. Although, it was hard
to figure out what meaning was there to it in the world where even one's
moral choices served as someone else's entertainment…

"We need to decide this time. It'll be difficult to weasel ourselves out of this
one like in the past, unfortunately."

Whatever the case might have been, we were standing on the crossroads
just like the others, regardless of what Dante had said. Well, one couldn't
even participate in this 'Great War of Saints and Demons' if they hadn't
chosen a side from the get-go, anyway.

Yoo Joonghyuk stared at the message and spoke up. "The Great War during
the 1863rd turn ended in the victory of 'Evil'. Han Sooyoung chose the side
of 'Evil', that was why."

"Why is it me again?? Besides, this isn't the 1863rd turn, you know?!"

Han Sooyoung was right, though – this was not the 1863rd turn.

Indeed, this was the 3rd turn world of <Kim Dokja's Company>.

"Let's go."

The ferocious battlefield where the 'Good' and 'Evil' clashed could be seen
in the distance. One of the battlefronts belonging to the expansive 'Great
War of Saints and Demons' had raised its curtains.

[113th regional conflict of the 'Great War of Saints and Demons' has been
generated!]

[List of individuals participating in the applicable regional conflict has been
released.]

Right at the forefront of this Great War stood a Constellation that I knew
pretty well.

[Constellation, 'Demon-like Judge of Fire', is participating in the applicable
scenario.]




"P-please, spare me."

Staaaab!
"Archangel-nim, p-please…!"

Pained moans rose up from all over the place.

Heads belonging to the Incarnations who chose to side with 'Evil' at the
crossroad, were being sliced off by the blades of the Archangels.

This was the war of Stories.

Just because of your affiliation with the Story of one side, you'd be treated
as an enemy by the other side.

Leaving the fallen Incarnations behind, Uriel studied the battlefield with an
expressionless face.

Once upon a time, she sympathised with them. She felt sad at the
Incarnations being swept away and consumed by the great narrative, and
she was angry at the misfortune they had to suffer. She was like that for a
long time. At one point, doing that was the entirety of her life.

'…I wanted to catch up with all the <Star Stream> broadcasts I missed,
though'.

Uriel chewed her lip while looking at the waves of a Demon King's army
rushing in.

Being born to spread the 'Good' didn't mean you could live your entire life
doing only just that; truth was, the physical dangers didn't eat away at a
Constellation, but the erosion of one's mind did.

The emotional labour that lasted for an innumerable length of time had
instilled a deep-seated disillusionment of the world, as well as
unfathomable madness, inside her.

[Soul of Constellation, 'Demon-like Judge of Fire', is trembling unstably.]
Whether it was a strong Constellation or a weak one, there was not one
being who could take it easy inside scenarios. Because 'scenarios' were a
system like that, to begin with.
Gu-ooooh!

To forget that they were being consumed by the scenario, and to live for yet
another day, Constellations had to consume other Stories. They would
spectate on the scenario, get angry at someone's situation, pour out their
criticism, show respect, or be moved by what they saw.

It was the same story even for an Archangel like Uriel.

[■■■■■, get out of my way! I missed the initial broadcast because of you
lot!]

[Hell Flames Ignition] spewing out from Uriel's blade struck the Demon
King's dependents and turned them into ashes. She couldn't properly control
her own power unleashed out of urgency; also, hastily summoning only half
of her true body to participate in the war played a large role in that, too.

[Demon Kings participating in the regional conflict are shocked by the
Archangel's power!]

Of course, this half of a true body was none other than Uriel's. So, any ol'
Demon King couldn't even serve as her opponent.

[Demon King, 'Monarch of Stars and Logic', releases his Status!]

[Demon King, 'Grand Duke of Dragons and Foul Odour', unleashes a Giant
Story!]

[Demon King, 'Speed of Sound Demon King', lets out a crimson howl!]

[Demon King, 'Duke of Everywhere', is being taken over by excitement and
madness!]

The problem was, the Demon Kings participating this time were not some
run-of-the-mill types, either. Uriel's expression hardened after she spotted
the Demon Kings brushing past her [Hell Flames Ignition] to come closer.

[The crazed Archangel is right before us!]
[Do not fear! I, the Demon King, Buer, will be with you!]

Originally, the Demon Kings scheduled to enter this particular regional
conflict were not supposed to be them. However, they shifted around the
location of combat personnel, and that meant Uriel now found herself
having to deal with all these Demon Kings at once.

[You bunch of ■■■! Get lost!]

Arrows imbued with demonic aura blanketed the entire battlefield; Uriel
spread [Hell Flames Ignition] like a barrier to block them.

As she tried to look after the lower-ranked Angels retreating in haste,
several arrows managed to lodge themselves in various parts of her body.
[How amusing. Oh, great Angels, are you running away?]

[You bring dishonour to the reputation of 'Demon-like Judge of Fire'.]

[Shut up! You'd all be dead meat if only my full body had descended!]

Even under the barrage of attacks raining down, Uriel didn't moan once,
breathing angrily like a bull, instead.

[Stop ganging up on me like a bunch of cowards and face me one on one,
you ■■!! Fu■! If it's one on one, I can kick all your butts even if you're
Agares, Gamygyn, or Marbas!]

Yells from the agitated Uriel only elicited mocking leers from the Demon
Kings. They all knew how powerful she was; they knew, and that was why
four of them showed up to hunt down a single Archangel. And right up
until the last moments, they remained meticulous.

[This is war, oh dear Angel.]

[Hell Flames Ignition] of the Uriel covered in blood clashed with the
Demon Kings.
She was seriously strong; with only the strength of half a true body, she still
managed to cut the arm off of 'Monarch of Stars and Logic', and crushed the
favoured pet dragon of 'Grand Duke of Dragon and Foul Odour'. Not only
that, the 'Speed of Sound Demon King' even lost both of his legs.

Unfortunately, that was as far as she could go.

She looked behind the moment she felt a chilling sensation – and the dagger
belonging to the invisible Duke of Everywhere flew in squarely aimed at
her heart.

[I shall be devouring an Archangel's Story today.]

She belatedly swung her sword in desperation, but her Incarnation Body
had been slowed down by injuries and it was far too difficult to respond.
And in the next moment… Staaaab!!

A blade glowing brightly stabbed past the chest of the 'Duke of
Everywhere' from behind. Black blood splashed down to the ground.

The blade repeatedly pierced through the Duke's back, right up until the
broken Incarnation Body's breath finally stopped, fragments of Stories
bursting out in a grotesque fashion.

And a single stream of the white blade sliced off the head of the Duke next.

[Someone has killed the Demon King, 'Duke of Everywhere'.]

Uriel saw the two people standing behind the fallen Duke. The ones she'd
recognise no matter how far they were, they were standing so close to her at
this minute.

"There's no way I'll sit back and watch my Constellation get beaten up like
this."

Indeed, it was none other than her one and only Incarnation.

And then…
[Demon King, 'Demon King of Salvation', is victorious in the 'Demon King
Promotion'!]

[Demon Realm ranking is being adjusted!]

[Demon King, 'Demon King of Salvation', has become '50th Demon King'!]

The protagonist of the story she'd been watching for a long time addressed
her. "It's been a while, Uriel."

[Demon King, 'Demon King of Salvation', has chosen the camp to side
with.]
         Chapter 385: Ep. 73 - The hottest place in Hell, IV


There were times when a person's emotion of sheer happiness could be felt
so vividly. Those moments, when one would go, oh, so you can make that
sort of facial expression, too.

[Kim Dokja-!!!]

The current appearance of Uriel was just like that to me.

She extended her arms and vigorously embraced both me and Jung
Heewon, proceeding to rub her cheeks all over us for a long time.

In the end, Jung Heewon had to scold her a little. "Uriel, I can't breathe."

[S-sorry.]

She got flustered and backed away, but her eyes continued to sparkle.
Sometimes, I found it hard to fathom how such a pure-but-dumb Archangel
like her ended up with a Modifier of 'Demon-like'.
[How did you know this place? When did you get here? Huh? Did you
finish the 'Kaizenix Archipelago' scenario already? I barely managed to
catch a couple of scenes, because I didn't have a lot of spare time… I'm
really sorry! Y-you aren't angry because I didn't properly sponsor you,
right? I-it wasn't deliberate, you know…]

It wasn't just her expression, even her voice conveyed her happiness, too.

Jung Heewon and I looked at each other while listening to Uriel; she
must've felt something similar to what I did, probably.

The Angel spoke without a hint of elegance nor carefully-considered
pretence. Fortunately, some words conveyed a greater level of emotion
when the speaker was so earnestly over the moon like this.

"Uriel, we understand. However, we should discuss the details at a later
date."

[Huh? Ack, you're right! Now isn't the time, is it?]

Uriel's gaze on me quickly shifted and landed on the army of Demon Kings
glaring at us from the other side. I saw her expression cooling off in an
instant, and realized that my thoughts were perhaps premature.

This Angel was, without a doubt, 'Demon-like Archangel of Flames'.

[Demon King, 'Monarch of Stars and Logic', cannot understand your
actions.]

And then, there were Demon Kings willing to face off against such an
Archangel.

Ranked tenth in the Demon King Ranking, 'Monarch of Stars and Logic' –
'Buer'.

Eighteenth in the ranking, 'Speed of Sound Demon King', 'Bathin'.
Finally, 29th in the ranking, 'Grand Duke of Dragons and Foul Odour',
'Astaroth'.

Even after excluding the 'Duke of Everywhere' who died at my hands, there
were still three Demon Kings alive. Each and every one of them was not an
easy opponent to fight against. Especially so, the 'Monarch of Stars and
Logic', and the 'Speed of Sound Demon King'.

If both of Buer's arms were still intact, or for that matter, Bathin's legs, then
I'd probably have to risk my life here.

['Demon King of Salvation'!]

[What is the meaning of this?! Why are you fighting against other Demon
Kings??]

I shrugged my shoulders and glibly muttered my excuse. "I simply
continued on with the promotion battle, that was all."

[Do you honestly believe that such an excuse will…]

"Is there a rule that said the 'Demon King Promotion' battles shouldn't be
fought just because the 'Great War of Saints and Demons' is underway?
Such a thing happened pretty often back in the '1st Great War', too."

[What are you…!]

Bathin became incensed by what I said and formed an expression of a
creature wanting to cut my head off, but too bad, there was nothing he
could do when both of his legs were gone.

[You have re-enacted a portion of the '1st Great War of Saints and
Demons'!]

[Demon King 'Asmodeus' is getting interested in your unexpected actions!]

Actually, what I've done was exactly the same as what Asmodeus did back
in the 1st Great War. The 'Monarch of Stars and Logic' Buer's expression
hardened as he threw out a question. [You think you'll be fine after doing
something like this?!]

"Of course not." I remained utterly unfazed by the Demon Kings' auras
while awakening my Status. "However, I do think that you shouldn't be
worried about me here."

[You have unleashed the Demon King's Status!]

[Exclusive skill, 'Bookmark', is activating!]

[5th Bookmark has been initiated!]

[Exclusive skill, 'Electrification' Lv.23 (+13) has been initiated.]

[Your current physical constitution is different from that of the applicable
character.]

[Your 'Status' has overcome the physical constitution penalty.]

My shoulders itched as the wings broke past my skin and emerged out into
the open. And the buzzing sensation of the [Electrification] overlapped on
top of that. In an instant, my body was enveloped in lightning.

The three Demon Kings now carried flustered, panicky expressions after
witnessing my rapidly-rising 'Status'.

'Monarch of Stars and Logic' had lost one of his arms, 'Grand Duke of
Dragons and Foul Odour' had lost his pet Dragon and was wounded all
over, and finally, 'Speed of Sound Demon King' had lost both of his legs, so
basically, they were no longer relevant to the overall combat situation.

Jung Heewon next to me unsheathed the [Sword of Judgement] and
activated [Demon Slaying].

"I wasn't satisfied by the fight I had with a Demon King the last time
because it got stopped, so…"
Uriel saw the Demon Kings taking retreating steps and became triumphant
in no time at all. She opened her lips to speak.

[You bunch of ■■, weren't you so noisy back then? Why don't you say
something now?]

"…"

[Dokja-yah, Heewon-ah, let's go! Let's utterly smash those ■■ Demon
Kings apart…!!]

I reached out and grasped Uriel's shoulder as she tried to advance forward
with her broken Incarnation Body, currently fuelled by her incendiary
wrath. Her shoulder felt so feeble and weak right now. She formed a pair of
small rabbit-like dot eyes after being held back so helplessly by my hand
and looked back at me.

"Uriel, please step back."

[Huh? Ah… Are you worried about me? I'm fine. I'm Uriel, after all!]

She held my hand with a deeply-moved expression on her face. I felt a bit
sad watching her be like that, and could only form a quiet smile. "I didn't
mean it that way."

[But, what then…?]

[Demon King, 'Demon King of Salvation', has selected his affiliated camp.]

My participation message was floating up in the air. Most likely, she hadn't
read that properly yet. Soon, though, the body of the puzzled Uriel
gradually stiffened; her eyes grew wider and wider, too.

I stared into those eyes and spoke. "Please, be still. Uriel, this is going to
end very soon."

Maybe, she had seen the message I was looking at by now.
[Camp the Demon King, 'Demon King of Salvation', has chosen is 'Evil'.]




"Kim Dokja pulled another Kim Dokja stunt, didn't he?" muttered Han
Sooyoung, as she watched the battlefield in the distance.

The battle had entered a bit of a lull earlier, but after Kim Dokja made his
unexpected entrance, it was heading towards a chaotic conclusion now.

He was the Demon King who murdered another Demon King, yet didn't
hide the fact that he was 'Evil'.

She now could see the lower-ranked Angels moving to surround him, and
the same time, Jung Heewon and her troubled expression, too.

Lee Hyunsung asked, sounding worried. "Will it really be alright like that?"

"Even if it's not, what can we do? Tell him to side with <Eden> now? Kim
Dokja is originally a Demon King, you know," grumbled Han Sooyoung,
before shifting her gaze over to Yoo Joonghyuk. "You ain't gonna sit back
and just watch, right?"

"Of course not."

"You don't need to ask me – I'm 'Evil'."

Han Sooyoung's sponsor was 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon'. From the
getgo, she didn't have much of a choice.

"What about you, Yoo Joonghyuk?"

"…"

"What did your sponsor say? Or was there no answer?"
Rather than answering her, he stared at the Incarnation Bodies strewn about
the battlefield, instead. Corpses of Angels and Demon Kings could be seen
among them, but in reality, most of them belonged to humans – meaning,
Reincarnators.

"You see someone you know?"

Without saying anything, Yoo Joonghyuk observed the collapsed
Reincarnators. A few still surviving and writhing about extended their
hands towards him. Their wounds were too serious and it was too late to
save them. He lowered himself and stabbed his shortsword in each of their
necks. When he did, they all passed on with a peaceful expression on their
faces.

Yuri di Aristel watching that scene suddenly raised her voice.

⸢Sooyoung.⸥

'Don't worry, Yuri. I won't let that happen to you'.

She could see the souls of the dead Reincarnators scatter away.

The ones fettered to the Mandala would be revived even if they were killed
on this island. However, being an immortal certainly didn't mean that it was
okay for them to die.

[Giant Story that lost its name has ceased to exist.]

Every time they were mobilised for a different scenario, they would
gradually lose their own worlds. They'd forget their original lives, and
eventually, even forget about their own deaths, too.

[Oldest Good advises the Reincarnators to be virtuous.]

[Oldest Evil demands the Reincarnators to choose.]

The majority of the dead would be those who had never thought about the
concept of the greater 'Good' or 'Evil'. Han Sooyoung closed the eyelids of a
dead Reincarnator. The dead's face, his eyes now closed, was quite
obviously neither good nor evil.

[You need to select your camp in order to enter the applicable battlefield!]

"I shall choose my camp."

The moment Yoo Joonghyuk opened his lips to speak, Han Sooyoung
narrowed her eyes and asked him. "You, you ain't thinking of something
else, are you? Before you guys got to Kaizenix Archipelago, you two
fought like crazy, right?"

He didn't answer and simply stared at her. She could pretty much guess
what that frustratingly-stiff expression of his was implying, and just as she
got ready to yell at him, he finally made his reply.

"This war must not be the 'Great War of Saints and Demons', but a fight
between us. Meaning, this place must not become a battlefield of others."

Not the Great War, but the battle of Kim Dokja's Company – Han
Sooyoung immediately realized the meaning behind those words.

"Only then, neither 'Good' nor 'Evil' will win this war. And that
development should be what Kim Dokja wants."

"I get what you're saying, but that's gonna be really tough, you know?" Han
Sooyoung immediately came in with a tackle. "We do that, and we'll be
turning our backs on both the <Demon Realm> and <Eden> at the same
time."

"You said that this isn't the 1863rd turn."

Han Sooyoung pouted a bit, looking as if she got sucker-punched. "Kim
Dokja… He's a hardcore bastard, alright. He might be the only idiot who'd
come up with something this crazy as a solution in situations like this one."

"He's originally like that."
"It's the same story for you, too! You two are so damn similar."

At her rebuke, Yoo Joonghyuk retorted with a curt tone of voice. "You
aren't that different from us, either."

"Whaaat? I'm different from you two idiots. Anyway, let's stop yapping and
get cracking already."

They now could see Kim Dokja getting beaten up by the Angels
surrounding him in the distance. But then again, he suddenly declared
himself to be 'Evil' in their midst, so it was only natural that the Angels of
<Eden> would be quaking in rage born from the sense of betrayal.

Yoo Joonghyuk declared first. "I won't do it in half-measures."

"So what? I'm planning to kill you if things go sideways, you know?"

"Good. Only then is there some fun in fighting you."

"Fine. That match we didn't get to finish back in Kaizenix? Let's finish it
right here."

The figures of these two vanished towards the battlefield; Lee Hyunsung,
now left by himself and all alone, could only cry out in sorrow.

"H-hang on!! Sooyoung-ssi! Joonghyuk-ssi!!! What about me?!"

"Do whatever you want!"

[Incarnation, 'Han Sooyoung', has chosen her affiliated camp.]

[Incarnation, 'Yoo Joonghyuk', has chosen his affiliated camp.]

[Camp the Incarnation 'Han Sooyoung' has chosen is 'Evil'.]

[Camp the Incarnation 'Yoo Joonghyuk' has chosen is 'Good'.]

Finally, their own 'Great War of Saints and Demons' had begun.
On a wide-open plain of the 'Main Island', where Heaven's entire fighting
force had gathered.

The leader of the Heavenly forces, Metatron, was in the middle of listening
to the updates on the current situation from other Angels inside the barracks
designed to mimic his office back home.

<Olympus> has revealed their desire to participate.

<Vedas> has sent a dispatch, saying that they will participate.

<Asgard> has also declared their intention to participate. However, due to
their own Giant Story, it seems that not many Constellations will participate
from this side.

There hasn't been any contact, but we have spied some movements from
<Emperor> as well. They are famous for their stick-and-carrot strategy,
so…

'Hell's Scribe' is diligently moving inside the neutral zone. Thanks to
him,the participation rate has shot up irrelevant of whether they are
Constellations or the Reincarnators.

Metatron studiously took notes of every single report and after attaching a
suitable response, sent them back.

The 'Great War of Saints and Demons' this time was, as the name implied, a
war with the fate of 'Good' and 'Evil' on the line. That was why Metatron
was far more cautious and careful with this scenario.

[Absolute Good Points in the applicable camp is currently 56.]
And so far, the war was chugging along without any issues – with the sole
exception of the special limitation that was attached to this particular 'Great
War', that was.

[Chaos Points is currently 51.]

The so-called 'Chaos Points'; when he asked the Great Dokkaebi about it,
this was the answer he got.

– It's a very rare occurrence to present a stage of this magnitude for
aconflict between ancient Giant Stories. So, there needs to be a suitable risk
of danger in accordance with the Probability.

 – What does that mean?

 – It'll be no fun when detailed explanations are provided, so I won't offer
 youanything substantial. However, do remember this. No matter what
 happens, do not let the Chaos Points reach 100. Do you understand? If
 not, something truly horrifying will occur.

Great Dokkaebis couldn't care any less about the fate of a Nebula. No, they
were only hell-bent on creating more stimulating scenarios. So, these
'Chaos Points' must have been the fruit of their malicious scheme.

[This is boring, Scribe.] Michael, polishing his sword in the corner of the
barracks, spoke. [I shall bring the head of Agares. Send me out.]

Michael had tasted humiliation twice at the hands of Kim Dokja and Yoo
Joonghyuk on the 'Middle Island' scenario; his Incarnation Body had fully
recovered through the authority of revival and now, he found himself inside
the 'Main Island's' scenario, waiting.

Metatron formed a thin smile at Michael and his hotly-burning desire.

[If we do that, the war will end too soon.]

[Isn't it better to end a boring war as soon as possible?]
[No, not necessarily. This war must be longer and more wretched than any
other scenario in existence.]

Metatron looked at the screens being broadcast from all parts of the
battlefields. Beings who had chosen the side of 'Good' or 'Evil' through their
own decision were pointing their weapons at each other. Metatron knew
that, although they were participating in this war as nothing more than
simple mercenaries, their moral leanings would gradually change the longer
the time went on.

[Oldest Good is wishing for a magnificent holy war.]

Constellations participating in this war would eventually grow to hate each
other in the name of 'Good' and 'Evil', and that hatred would burn brightly
to create the next generation of Stories.

Michael, watching the battle, spoke in a sulky tone of voice. [In that case,
allow me to kill the bastards of <Kim Dokja's Company>, at least. I have a
score to settle with them.]

Metatron shook his head. <Kim Dokja's Company> was an important
variable in this scenario. That faction had to be used as much as possible.

[If it was before, sure, but it's not possible now. I have a different plan for
them. If you step forward, Michael, then…]

It was right there that a scenario message announced itself.

[113th regional conflict of 'Great War of Saints and Demons' has been
forcibly concluded.]

Metatron confirmed the attached information on the message. The 113th
regional conflict was the battlefront that Uriel participated in.

[…Forcibly concluded?]

There had never been a message like that before. It didn't end there, though.
[Chaos Points have increased by 5.]

[Chaos Points is currently 56.]

[Warning! Chaos Points have exceeded 55!]

…

…

…

[Something is writhing around in the hottest place in Hell.]

[The Calamity of Revelation that decides the end of everything has begun
its quickening.]
    Chapter 386: Ep. 74 - Great War of Saints and Demons, I


Bluish arcs of electricity danced in the air and the last android rushing
towards them collapsed on the ground.

Pu-shu-shuk.

Lee Jihye yanked her sword out from the bisected cables and wiped her
forehead.

[Level up!]

Gilyoung, watching her from the sidelines, picked his nose and spoke to
her. "Noona, you've gotten really good at this, haven't you?"

She oh-so-badly wanted to smack the boy in the head after listening to his
sky-high ego-filled words, but had to stop.

[You can't attack the target.]

Regardless of what else, these two kids were invincible in this worldview.
Nothing good would come from rubbing them the wrong way.
She alternated her gaze between Lee Gilyoung and Shin Yoosung before
throwing them a question. "What are your levels now?"

"84."

"I'm 87, unni."

"What?! But, you were 83 a few days ago!!"

"I lied, you dummy."

Lee Jihye watched the two kids bicker and replied with a lengthy sigh. "I'm
still 79, though…"

Still, she was able to level up quickly thanks to these two kids. Just as the
slang implied, her levelling-up was lightning fast, as if she was riding on a
bus, and that placed them on the list of the most wanted individuals of Next
City.

[Android Lee Jihye – 1888G]

More correctly, it was her alone. From the get-go, the kids couldn't be
attacked anyway, so they didn't even show up on the wanted list.

"I guess it's about time we escape from this worldview."

"I think it'll be over if we bring that down, unni."

There was a huge tower occupying the center of Next City where Shin
Yoosung was pointing at. There was a battleship parked on top of that
tower, and every time she looked at it, Lee Jihye would receive a message
from her sponsor.

[Constellation, 'Maritime War God', strongly recommends that you acquire
that Star Relic.]

"…Now that is surprising. Especially from our miserly general, no less."

[Constellation, 'Maritime War God', dry coughs.]
It wasn't as if she couldn't understand her sponsor's heart, though. Anyone
who clapped their eyes on that battleship's appearance would indeed
understand where he was coming from.

"I just can't figure out why that thing's parked over there…"

If they manage to commandeer that ship, then the skies of all the worlds
would become the 'Maritime War God's' ocean.

Lee Jihye tightly grasped the hilt of her sword and spoke. "Yeah, it might
be fun to shock the socks off ahjussi and my master. Hey, guys? Why don't
we clear this place now?"

"Sure! It was getting boring using the bug all the time, too!"

"Yes, let's."

The three arrived at a mutual agreement and began walking towards the
tower, only for a completely unexpected message to enter their ears.

[Emergency patch has been updated.]

[From tonight's midnight onwards, the applicable scenario will institute
'Shutdown' system.]

[From 00:00 to 06:00, children under the age of 18 cannot utilise the
applicable scenario.]

Lee Gilyoung and Shin Yoosung merrily running forward side by side
suddenly began faltering precariously.

The boy muttered in a flustered vice. "N-noona, I'm sleepy…"

"Unni, run…!"

The two kids plopped down after saying that and fell into slumber. Lee
Jihye placed her hand near their noses and confirmed that they weren't
dead.
[Applicable player is in 'Shutdown' state.]

For Lee Jihye, this was one flabbergasting situation.

"What the hell? I thought this worldview was 18+ from the get-go? Why is
this shutdown thing even introduced??"

Too bad, there was no time to relaxedly stand around and complain; the
tower's gates opened up wide and hundreds of drones began sortieing
simultaneously in order to kill her, that was why.

"…Oh, shit."

It seemed that this night was going to be a very long one for her.




[113th regional conflict has been concluded.]

[Outcome of the applicable regional conflict cannot be decided.]

This particular skirmish had no victors or losers. Heavily-wounded Demon
Kings supported each other and retreated, while panic-stricken Uriel
vanished from here along with the lower-ranked Angels. The only people
remaining in the empty battlefield were Reincarnators strewn about like the
remnants of a defeated army, plus five men and women among them
collapsed on the ground.

"…I had no idea this would happen," muttered Han Sooyoung in a
dumbfounded voice.

What <Kim Dokja's Company> did after entering the regional conflict was
pretty simple – participate in the war between 'Good' and 'Evil', and
suppress every other participant beside themselves. And then, the remaining
folks would go for it and slug it out for the war with no winners.
[Applicable battle's outcome can't be decided.]

[Lack of will to fight by the participants of the applicable battle has been
confirmed.]

The battle of <Kim Dokja's Company> was not a life-or-death fight but a
game, a sparring session, something with no determined winners or losers.
And that was why it was not a war between 'Good' and 'Evil', and naturally,
was not the 'Great War of Saints and Demons', either.

[Applicable regional conflict has been excluded from the category of 'Great
War of Saints and Demons'.]

[New 113th regional conflict is waiting to take place.]

The strength to forcibly break up a battlefield – that was the power <Kim
Dokja's Company> possessed right now.

"…My sponsor should be really sad and disappointed by now."

"It couldn't be helped this time, Heewon-ssi."

"If it's at all possible, I don't want to fight against Uriel."

"It's the same story for me."

With a slightly regretful face, Jung Heewon and Lee Hyunsung looked at
the Reincarnators of the battlefield. Although many had died and returned
to the cycle of rebirth, there were a few who still managed to survive.

They split the [Ellaine Forest Essence] in their possession and distributed it
to the survivors. Kim Dokja too, supported the surrounding Reincarnators
one by one and stemmed their bleeding by pressing their pressure points.

Han Sooyoung spoke while looking at him. "You started this whole thing
with a definite plan, right?"

"I always have a plan before starting anything."
"Then you should know that we can't keep this up forever."

The timing for this particular conflict proved to be fortunate for them, but
there was no guarantee that their luck would be as good the next time.

Besides, there were definitely beings among the Constellations on the side
of 'Good' or Demon Kings that the strength of <Kim Dokja's Company>
couldn't handle, and if they rushed into a battle with a too-great disparity in
combat strength, they might find themselves in mortal danger, as well.

However, Kim Dokja maintained a composed expression.

– We don't need to hold out for long, so it'll be fine.

Han Sooyoung heard his relaxed Midday Tryst voice and hushed her own in
reply.

– Okay, what then?

– We just have to hold on until the Chaos Points go past 90.

[Chaos Points currently is 56.]

As if it was waiting for this moment, the message floated up in the air and
Han Sooyoung shot a glare at it.

– What's this point thing about? It sounds different from the
'Good/Evil'Points, though?

– You're right.

Kim Dokja briefly explained what this 'Chaos Points' thing was – that it
would rise up when neither the 'Good' nor 'Evil' claimed victory and the
world's order collapsed as a result.

– What happens if that gets to full?

– The Calamity of Revelation will start.
– The Calamity of Revelation? …Hold up, are you talking about
the'Apocalypse Dragon'?

The Dragon of Destruction from the Book of Revelation, also known as the
Final Dragon of the Revelation – a being referred to as the so-called
'Apocalypse Dragon'.

A humongous calamity that descended on the 95th scenario during the
1863rd turn, it was capable of sweeping away the Constellations of the
<Star Stream> with just a single flick of its tail.

Kim Dokja grinned and nodded his head.

– Right. You knew about it?

 – …You want to increase these Chaos Points even after knowing that?
 Areyou insane?! What will you do if the Apocalypse Dragon is revived??
 Have you forgotten what happened during the 1863rd turn?

If the Apocalypse Dragon did wake up during this scenario, then it'd bring
forth a scale of destruction incomparable to that of the 'Great War of Saints
and Demons'.

However, Kim Dokja carried a determined expression.

– It won't revive.

– And how do you know that??

Kim Dokja shrugged his shoulders and turned around as his reply to her
question. She was about to fly off her handle and yell out at him, but
someone suddenly butted in.

"You're supposed to be a writer, yet you lack imagination."

"What was that, you bastard?"

Yoo Joonghyuk easily caught Han Sooyoung's small fist flying in.
She growled menacingly. "Why are you butting in on someone else's
conversation?"

"I couldn't endure any more of your pathetic mutterings, that's why."

"What bullshit are you talking about now?"

"He's not the only one who knows about what happened in the 1863rd turn
regression."

Han Sooyoung immediately understood what he was saying.

Indeed, Kim Dokja didn't hop over to the 1863rd turn alone; he departed
along with two Archangels in tow, and came back with one of them.

And what that implied was…

"…<Eden> also knows about the stuff in that place, then. And he's using
that fact to his advantage."

Kim Dokja's plan was pretty clear-cut.

Once the Chaos gauge reaches 100, the Apocalypse Dragon would be
unleashed. And <Eden> was well aware of what would happen if that
creature is released, since it had the information from the 1863rd turn.

If they wished to avoid the fate of being destroyed, then they should
immediately stop the 'Great War of Saints and Demons'.

That was the crux of the message Kim Dokja wished to convey.

Han Sooyoung felt ever so slightly flabbergasted while looking at him
consoling the Reincarnators with an utterly calm expression on his face.

Just who in this world was capable of threatening a large Nebula?

"That evil dude, he… He's basically telling them to choose between
surviving together, or perishing together!"
"If things work out well, that's what should happen. However, a future
where only we are killed could happen, instead."

Yoo Joonghyuk's expression was hard as he polished the 'Black Heavenly
Demon Sword'. It was the most dignified, serious expression he had in a
while.

She could see his resolution from that expression. Most likely, his head was
filled with thoughts of the worst potential situations – Kim Dokja's plan
ends up as a failure, then the members of <Kim Dokja's Company> are
annihilated in this place, and finally, he'd have no choice but to regress once
more.

Han Sooyoung complained loudly. "Is imagining horrible futures a unique
habit of regressors?"

"Only by thinking of the worst will you be able to prepare for the
aftermath."

"Someone might think you've regressed ten thousand times if they hear
you."

"In some other universe, that might have happened already."

"…Didn't know you could say stuff like that," smirked Han Sooyoung, and
she shifted her eyes back to Kim Dokja in the distance.

Him still wobbling about like that reminded her of looking at an inflatable
tube sky puppet shaking around against the wind.

Just as she couldn't read the inner workings of an empty sky puppet, she
also couldn't read Kim Dokja's inner thoughts. She sometimes felt as if she
could, but that was nothing more than some air leaking out from the puppet,
instead.

Why was she even trusting that guy, anyway?
Maybe, the one she couldn't really understand was herself. Why was she
fighting together with Kim Dokja?

She might find an answer if she used [Predictive Plagiarism], but Han
Sooyoung purposely didn't. She thought that she should not do that.

She looked to her side to discover Yoo Joonghyuk staring at the same
spectacle as her.

"Hey, I wanna ask you something."

"It's mystifying that you still mistakenly believe I'll answer you earnestly."

"Right, you were one hell of a stubborn dude. I mean, you didn't even moan
in pain once after you got tortured that badly during 'Kaizenix
Archipelago'."

His expression stiffened. "I thought as much. You were behind that, weren't
you?"

"I didn't order it, but my kind Yuri understood my heart, that was all."

[Story, 'Kaizenix's King', slowly nods its head.]

Yoo Joonghyuk never once revealed his identity or information related to
him even when subjected to Yuri's horrifying torture.

Han Sooyoung dusted her butt off and stood up. "In any case, you really
okay with this? You were trying to kill Kim Dokja earlier, right?"

"It doesn't concern you."

"A guy like you doesn't easily change his mind, so. That means you didn't
have a change of heart, but never planned to kill him in the first place…"

"…"

"Well, then. Who was egging you on? Metatron?"
Yoo Joonghyuk's thick eyebrow twitched slightly when Metatron's name
was brought up.

"H-mm, so, it was related."

"…It seems that you've done your homework."

"I don't have spare time to do crap like that. Nah, I just brought it up
because you suddenly mentioned <Eden>, you know… But, after seeing
your reaction, I guess 'Metatron' wasn't the main instigator, then."

Han Sooyoung's power of deduction caused both of his brows to quiver this
time.

"H-mm, who could it be… Who could have upset our precious Regressor
like this…?"

"He's not a being that someone like you would know."

"Yup, I knew it. It's the 'Secretive Plotter', right?"

Yoo Joonghyuk looked up at the standing Han Sooyoung.

Her lips twitched a little as if to say, why are you so surprised like that.
"Hey, I'm not a moron, I'll have you know! I can easily guess the stuff your
head manages to come up with."

[Incarnation, 'Han Sooyoung', is using 'Predictive Plagiarism'.]

"More correctly, it's the multiple 'mes', though."

A Story where hundreds, thousands, maybe even tens of thousands of Han
Sooyoungs gathered together to predict the upcoming events.

It was Yoo Joonghyuk's turn to ask this time. "Do you know something
about the 'Secretive Plotter'?"

"A really powerful Outer God, right?"
He formed a disappointed face for a bit before speaking in a convinced tone
of voice. "…I see that even if thousands of morons gather, they can't
become a single genius."

"Wanna die?? Fine, you know who that is, then?"

"There is one being that I can think of."

"Ho-oh? Who is it?"

Rather than answering her right away, Yoo Joonghyuk recalled his
memories, instead. "…That bastard knew all of my histories. From the 0th
regression to the far-flung futures, the ones I haven't even experienced yet."

"H-mm…"

"If my guess is correct, then there can only be one such existence in this
entire world-line."

Han Sooyoung nodded her head in agreement. "That sounds about right.
There's only one with high enough probability."

The two of them stared at each other for a little while, before muttering out
the answers they thought of.

However…

"…Who did you say it was?"

"What kind of bullshit was that?"

Their answers were different from each other's.
    Chapter 387: Ep. 74 - Great War of Saints and Demons, II


The first person to raise her voice was Han Sooyoung. "What the hell? How
can you even think that? Does one's intelligence get worse the more you
regress?"

"Taken words right out of my mouth. To think that a so-called writer would
cook up something so unpleasant."

She and Yoo Joonghyuk growled and glared at each other.

And the first one to back off was also Han Sooyoung. "Fuu… Right,
regressing three times could mess with your mind and cause you to dream
up weird things. So… You're saying that 'Secretive Plotter' is 'Kim Dokja
from the future'?"

"That's what I think."

"Fine, well. It's not completely impossible, I'll give you that. All sorts of
crazy things happen in the <Star Stream>, and…"
Han Sooyoung was about to say "A novel can also become reality in our
world" but quickly swallowed those words back. Even if that was true, she
thought that such a thing shouldn't be mentioned in front of Yoo
Joonghyuk.

So, she said something else. "Wouldn't it be quickest to ask the 'Secretive
Plotter'? Did you try to confirm it?"

He nodded his head. "I had a deal with him. If I do something for him, then
he'd answer a single question of mine."

"What did you ask him?"

"I asked if his identity was truly Kim Dokja from the future."

"And then, what?"

"He said that he wasn't."

"In that case, why are you…"

"Let me be more clear. He said, 'Once upon a time, I might have been
someone, but now, I am no one'."

…Might have been someone, but now, they are no one?

Han Sooyoung quickly realized what was wrong with that statement.

The 'Secretive Plotter' didn't implicitly deny being 'Kim Dokja from the
future' in that reply. No, what he said was much closer to 'I might be Kim
Dokja, or I might not be' than anything else.

In that case, Yoo Joonghyuk not backing away from his guess made sense.

Han Sooyoung asked one more time. "Was that all you asked him?"

"He knew of all the regression turns I've lived through."

He was something once upon a time, but now, just a simple 'Secretive
Plotter'; a being that knew every regression turn Yoo Joonghyuk had lived
in. "Anything else?"

"No."

"You kidding me? You fought like crazy just to ask him only that?" Han
Sooyoung yelled at him while panting like an angry bull. "That guy didn't
exist in your previous regressions, right? If you couldn't find out his real
identity, you should've at least tried to learn other info, you know?!"

"…I did hear what his goal was."

"What was it?"

"He said that there was something he wanted to change. And, someone he
wished to kill, as well."

It felt as if the more she heard, the deeper she was being sucked into the
quagmire. By flipping the term 'someone he wished to kill' around, you'd
get 'someone he can't kill yet'.

Was there a being on the level that even a godly existence like 'Secretive
Plotter' couldn't do anything about?

"That's all I've heard from him. That was all the questions I was permitted
to ask."

"You couldn't dig out more info, though?"

"That means I'll have to make another deal with him. If I do, then I'll have
to bear a heavier cost than the last time," said Yoo Joonghyuk, and he
shifted his gaze to the sky.

She also looked up as well and activated [Midday Tryst].

– Is he looking at us?

– I can't sense his gaze.
That was a slightly disappointing result; they were chatting away openly
like this so that the subject in question would hear them, but it seemed that
he wasn't even watching them right now. Should she say it wasn't like
'Secretive Plotter'?

Han Sooyoung spoke.

– Well, this is problematic. If a godly being on that level decides to butt
intothe middle of something important, then no matter how good our plan
is, it'll be useless.

Especially so when on a stage as important as the current 'Great War of
Saints and Demons'; if a small variable could flip the table on its head, then
there was no way she'd not be concerned by it.

However, Yoo Joonghyuk's thoughts were different from hers. "He
probably won't step forward personally."

"What makes you think that?"

"The evidence is with him using Kim Dokja or me to carry out his schemes.
If he was able to make a move, then he'd have done so already. An
existence of his level would need to exhaust a great deal of Probability if he
intends to make a move."

"…That makes sense. Who knew that the moment I'd thank the shitty
Probability would actually come?"

"I have something to ask you now."

"Huh?"

"I still haven't heard the basis for your unpleasant hypothesis. Why did you
say the 'Secretive Plotter' is 'that person'…?"

Yoo Joonghyuk's question elicited a smirk from Han Sooyoung. "What's
this? I thought you weren't interested, but I guess it does bug you."
"You never fail to add unnecessary comments, don't you."

Just before he could grasp the cold hilt of his sword, a rather sly voice came
towards them from nearby. "You two seem to be enjoying each other's
company."

Two people's cold, murderous glares squarely landed on Kim Dokja.

He formed a bitter smile and was about to wave his hands around while
backing away, but then, a new scenario message rose up in the empty air.

[New coordinates for the 113th regional conflict have been set.]

The gazes of the group were now fixed on Kim Dokja. Finally, time to
make another move had arrived.

"Well, let's go and cause another scene, then."

As if they were all waiting for it, Stories of <Kim Dokja's Company> began
clamouring loudly.

[New Story is sprouting in the Demon King, 'Demon King of Salvation'!]

[List of candidates for 'Demon King of Salvation's' second Modifier have
been generated.]




The Demon Realm's second-in-command was called by a variety of
Modifiers; 'Ruler of East Hell', 'Demon Realm's Proxy', 'Destroyer of
Sanctity'.

Even though he carried many varied names, there could ever be only one
true name for him.

The Master of the 2nd Demon Realm, Agares.
Ever since the Master of the 1st Demon Realm suddenly disappeared,
Agares had been protecting the Demon Realm for the past thousands of
years or so. He cut off the heads of Archangels salivating over his territory,
and protected those Stories that allowed 'Evil' to exist as evil.

While he tested the qualification of 'Evil', restricted, and even ruled over it,
he focused all of his being on only one question.

What did 'Evil' exist for?

Every time he ripped apart yet another living being, he immersed himself in
that question. It was not important whether this question had an answer or
not; no, that question simply enabled him to carry on.

[113th regional conflict has been forcibly concluded.]

[114th regional conflict has been forcibly concluded.]

However, this was his first time seeing such a spectacle in the thousands of
years he'd lived so far.

– Everyone, be strong for a little bit longer!

– We've almost suppressed them all!

There were people rescuing the Reincarnators from the chaotic battlefield.
The expendables being sacrificed regardless of the outcome of the great
battle between 'Good' and 'Evil' were being saved by someone.

Now normally, such actions would correspond to the side of 'Good'.
However, the problem here was that a Demon King was responsible for
performing that very action.

[Chaos Points have increased by 4.]

[Chaos Points are currently 60.]

[Warning! Chaos Points have exceeded 60!]
Chaos. Neither 'Good' nor 'Evil', it was 'something' that existed outside of
the world's Probability and its natural order.

[You want to increase the Chaos Points and stop the 'Great War of Saints
and Demons', is that it?]

Reddish horns sprouted up below the fedora pushed down deeply on
Agares's head, which was his unique quirk whenever he was intrigued by
something.

[Stop smaller-scale destruction with the threat of even bigger destruction. It
truly is an idea only the 'Demon King of Salvation' can cook up.]

The one to offer his opinion was the 'Devil of Lust and Wrath', Asmodeus.

Agares spoke, his fingers gripping the throne wagging to and fro. [Why
does he not side with 'Evil'? Surely, he'd not lose out by joining this side.]

[Once this 'Great War of Saints and Demons' concludes, his 'Twist' will be
completed. It also means that the ■■ he pursues is not on the path of 'Evil'.]
[Even then, he doesn't seem to be pursuing the ■■ of 'Good', either.]

This was a far more awkward situation than if he had chosen to side with
either the 'Good' or 'Evil'.

Agares asked again. [What are your thoughts?]

[Metatron will make a move first before we do. There is simply no way that
the aged Angel who had been thirsting after this war more than anyone else
would let his careful plans get thrown into disarray.]

Almost at the same time as those words came to an end, a single line
message arrived through the Demon King's line of transmission.

– Agares, I've contacted you with a matter I need to discuss.

The torn corners of Agares's lips curled up in a smile.
– Metatron, I'm sure we don't enjoy a relationship where we can relaxedly
chat away our spare time like this.

The highest authorities in the Demon Realm and <Eden> currently were
speaking face to face through a screen. Just from the exchange of their
gazes, a powerful burst of Probability's sparks exploded out.

– I don't mind shooting the breeze with you, but for now, it seems that I
needto borrow your power for a little while.

– Have you ever heard of a story where 'Good' and 'Evil' joins hands?

– Well, the stories of 'Evil' trying to achieve its goal by any means
necessaryare quite common, aren't they?

Even after hearing Agares's sarcastic tone of voice, Metatron remained
composed.

– There is a certain immature Nebula; young juniors, that believe they
arethe center of the universe.

It was pretty clear who those juniors were in this little story. Agares
chuckled and replied.

– To think, you'd use the hotline just so that you can trample on a
smallNebula. How amusing.

– If things go wrong, then even the 'Great War of Saints and Demons'
couldcollapse because of that small Nebula.

– Do you wish to instil discipline in them as a senior of the <Star
Stream>,then? Your 'Kkondae' disposition still remains, I see.

– Let's just say that I merely wish to teach them the true ways of the world.

– I decline. I don't need to join hands with someone like you,
becausecrushing a Nebula like that is nothing to me.
– I'm not proposing that we join hands.

– Then, what?

Rather than a verbal reply, Metatron floated a small crucifix above his
hand. It rose up in the air and continued to spin around.

– <Kim Dokja's Company> was able to ruin the battlefields due to the
factthat they have been exploiting how the forces are balanced, each side's
power being equal.

–So what?

– But, what if it's a battle where that balance has been broken from
thebeginning?

Metatron blew at the crucifix; when he did, its axis of rotation was slightly
disturbed and it began spinning unstably. Agares asked as if he was
displeased by something.

– Are you suggesting that we create a battlefield where one side is at
adisadvantage from the beginning?

– That's correct.

Unless the combat forces of either side were evenly matched, <Kim Dokja's
Company> would have to try to shift the balance if it had tilted to one side
already. If it had tilted towards 'Evil', then lean towards 'Good', and if it was
tilting towards 'Good', then push back to 'Evil'.

If that situation was exploited inversely, then it'd not be an impossibility to
engineer a regional conflict where <Kim Dokja's Company> would be met
with annihilation, too.

– And you want to start a battle with who in disadvantage now?
– We should play fair in this matter, at least. If we create a regional
conflictwith the 'Evil' side in a disadvantage, then I shall create another one
with 'Good' at a disadvantage.

– Interesting. I guess that you dearly wish to kill them even at the expense
ofsacrificing angels.

– We can't sit back and watch the Chaos Points rack up like this. Also,
bycreating several regional conflicts we will be able to disperse <Kim
Dokja's Company>.

– What if they don't react to this provocation?

– Wouldn't that still be enough, then?

Metatron's eyes, as seen on the screen, were glowing in white light.

– If they don't respond, then the ultimate victor of this war would end
upbeing 'Good' and 'Evil', after all.




[Gate leading to 115th regional conflict has opened!]

[Gate leading to 116th regional conflict has opened!]

[Gate leading to 117th regional conflict…!]

I chuckled hollowly while watching the Gates blanket space in real-time.

I knew it. There was just no way that Metatron or Agares would let this
matter slide like that.

Jung Heewon watched the portals that appeared and disappeared in real-
time and asked a question. "Dokja-ssi, what's going on?"

"They've started several regional conflicts at once."
"But, can that even happen?"

"Originally, no. Even if it's nominally a regional conflict, it can't start and
end that quickly."

[115th regional conflict has concluded.]

[116th regional conflict has concluded.]

Along with the battlefields that were concluding abruptly, the scenario
message floated up in the air as well.


  [Current state of Great War's progress]

  Absolute Good Points: 57

  Absolute Evil Points: 57

  Chaos Points: 60


The 'Good/Evil' Points were rapidly climbing up as if to compete against
the Chaos Points we had racked up. The one who eventually shot up from
his seat first was Lee Hyunsung.

"We can't just sit back and do nothing." He clenched his fist tightly and
continued on. "There must be Reincarnators being sacrificed in those
battlefields."

"Of course there are. But if we enter one of those, we'll all die," replied Han
Sooyoung as she chewed on her nails.

"…Excuse me?"

"Don't you get it? Those are all traps. They made up their minds to totally
destroy us, that's what."
Lee Hyunsung dazedly stared at me, and I nodded my head at him. "Han
Sooyoung is correct. Most likely, we will be attacked the moment we enter
there."

"It'll be the same end even if we don't enter."

The complexions of the group became gloomier after hearing Yoo
Joonghyuk's words.

Currently, the members of <Kim Dokja's Company> were split up among
'Good' and 'Evil'.

If the victor of the 'Great War of Saints and Demons' was declared in this
fashion, then the losing side would be met with a terrible fate. Obviously,
the Incarnation bodies would cease to exist, and even if one's luck was good
and they became a soul, one would be tortured by the intense heat of Hell
and his or her ego would be destroyed in the end.

We had no choice but to participate in the battles.

"…It can't be helped, I guess."

Sometimes, one had to step right in knowing that it was a trap.

I quickly divided the members. "Jung Heewon-ssi and Lee Hyunsung-ssi,
please participate in the 117th regional conflict. Han Sooyoung and Yoo
Joonghyuk, you two enter the 119th Gate…"

"Hey, hold up, what about you?"

"I'll enter the 121st Gate alone."

Yoo Joonghyuk glared at me and wordlessly grasped the hilt of his sword,
so I quickly made myself clear.

"N-no, I'm not saying that I'll really enter alone, you know."

"Then, who are you going with?"
"Folks who will become our allies."

This time, Han Sooyoung tackled me. "Who? Who'd wanna become our
allies in the current situation?"

Indeed, no one would want to side with us, normally.

However, if my thoughts were correct, then at least, there was one. No,
make that two.

[Nebula, <Underworld>, is waiting for you.]

I smirked and replied. "My parents."
   Chapter 388: Ep. 74 - Great War of Saints and Demons, III


After sharing brief goodbyes with my companions, I immediately sent a
message to the <Underworld>. A reply came back in no time at all.

[Constellation, 'Father of the Rich Night', has permitted your entry.]

[Constellation, 'Queen of the Darkest Spring', has permitted your entry.]

[Nebula, <Underworld>, has opened a portal that will summon you.] Tsu-

chuchuchuchut!

Now originally, it was not easy to leave beyond the scenario's boundaries
when a massive scenario was already underway. However, the
<Underworld> had willingly spent an enormous amount of Probability for
my sake.

I was really grateful for that.

I might be called their successor, but, I haven't even paid them a proper
visit to say hello after getting their help the last time…
Now that I thought about it, I was kind of apprehensive, too; what if the
reason for them permitting my entry without any issues was to beat me up
for not visiting the <Underworld> until now?

– Kim Dokja.

A message suddenly came flying in and startled me. I quickly looked up. It
wasn't via [Midday Tryst], which meant there could be only one who had
sent me this message.

 –        What's this? I thought you'd be busy after becoming the branch
 manager.But you still have enough leeway to mind what's happening this
 side, too?

 –        No, I don't. I made time, though.

Bihyung, floating in the air, grumbled a bit while sucking on leaf tobacco.
This guy… It looked as if he was fatigued from overworking after
becoming a manager recently. He stared at me with complicated eyes and
let a long sigh escape from his lips. I sensed the surrounding channels'
transmissions get blocked off temporarily.

 –        You're trying to do something really dangerous.

 –        When did I ever not do that?

 –        This is different from the past. This time, the entirety of the
 <Star Stream>is paying attention to the things you're doing.

 –        I think I've heard that hundreds of times by now.

 –        You keep this up, and all the Probability's karma you've
 accumulated so farwill blow up in your face. You know what that means,
 don't you?

I nodded my head. I clearly saw all the horrifying things that happened after
the twisted Probability exploded forth back in the 'Demon King Selection'.
And honestly, I'd been often feeling as if I was standing on a Jenga tower
missing quite a few blocks lately.

 –         You be careful now. You can't stay lucky forever. Even if you
 are underprotection by Great Dokkaebis or Outer Gods… – Under the
 protection of who??

 –         …Forget it. I shouldn't have said anything.

Bihyung shook his head and lightly spread some smoke in the air. When he
did, the frozen channels began opening up once more with the tobacco
smoke as the center.

 –         Come back alive. Don't die.

 –       Is that something you should say to a guy heading to the
 netherworld?

He didn't have to say anything, but I knew that, most likely, Bihyung had
been stopping all the interference attempts coming from the Bureau. He was
just a measly little low-ranked Dokkaebi the first time we met, but now, he
became big enough to help me out in this manner. Indeed, one had to live
long enough first to see something like this.

[Transmission through space-time has begun.]

All sensory perception seemed to split apart before me and when I opened
my eyes again, the blackened and withered grounds of the netherworld
greeted my presence. It was the <Underworld>. Originally, I needed to
utilise the services of the boatman Charon and cross the river first, but that
step had been omitted this time.

I walked on the gravelled banks of the dried-up river and headed off
towards Hades's palace for a while. The moment I stepped inside the outer
castle, though, tens of thousands of gazes landed on me as if they had been
waiting for my arrival.
From the three Judges of the <Underworld> to the innumerable number of
souls – judging from how ferocious the overall atmosphere was, I had to
conclude that their gazes were not friendly at all.

[Judges of the <Underworld> have discovered your presence!]

As expected, there was another purpose in summoning me here, wasn't
there?

Shu-shu-shut…

Emitting Statuses that might turn every living thing into withered,
mummified husks, the three Judges of the <Underworld> approached me as
if they were gliding in the air.

Each judge was a Narrative-grade Constellation.

I quickly grasped the Unbroken Faith attached to my hips. Even if I had
grown stronger, it was not going to be easy trying to fend off against these
three when we were in the <Underworld>.

It was right then that the leading Judge's eye level began lowering towards
the ground. That was the start; the second and third Judges also lowered
their eye level. All three of them were now kneeling before me.

…Uh?

And the army of the <Underworld> following after them all began settling
down like a violent but low tidal wave. I took a closer look, and that
volatile atmosphere I felt earlier was a bit different in nature to what I was
assuming earlier. In fact, the Judges of the <Underworld> were looking at
me while wiping away at their eyes – as if they were deeply moved about
something.

Ku-gugugugu!

The <Underworld> itself seemed to have knelt before me to open up a path.
It was the path that led into the inner sanctum of the palace. Only two
Constellations were allowed to walk on this path up until now.

[We welcome you to the Kingdom of the Night, oh, Heir to the
<Underworld>!!]

Along with the Judge's declaration, a system message floated up in my
view. [You are currently the Prince of the <Underworld>.]




While moving through the palace's interior, I couldn't help but feel a bit
strange inside.

I figured that something like this might happen after becoming the
'successor to the <Underworld>', but still, experiencing a near-vertical rise
of my station made the inside of my brain go all soft and mushy.

I had never been treated this warmly before in my life. On top of that, what
was up with this rather gloomy and decorative costume?

[Character, 'Ricardo von Kaizenix', asks you if you were also a prince.]

The Fourth Prince of the Kaizenix Archipelago, sharing the same vision as
me, decided to say something. As I deliberated on what my reply should be,
the Judge attentively studying me also decided to address me. [Excuse me,
your highness.]

"Yes?"

[I'd like to apologise for the matters of the last time.]

Now that I thought about, this ahjussi, he was the same Judge who 'greeted'
me when I entered the <Underworld> in order to recover Shin Yoosung's
soul. He was the one who drank lots of 'Yamata no Orochi's Snake Wine'
and helped me in secret… What was his Modifier again?
"No, it's fine. Things worked out well in the end so it's alright. I was
actually grateful back then."

The Judge lowered his head as if he was feeling apologetic, and pushed the
doors to the audience chamber wide open. [The King of the <Underworld>
is waiting for you.]

I tensed up and stepped across the doorway along with the Judges. The
confidence-inspiring Statuses from them guarding my side made me feel a
bit weird inside, though.

If I become the master of the <Underworld>, I'd get to order around
Constellations like them.

[…Fufu. I see. So that's what happened.]

Persephone's voice coming from the darkness interrupted my chain of
thoughts. She sat on her throne and was busy chatting away with someone
sitting on the top of her hand.

[Baat, baat. Abaat!]

[H-mm, it was the same story back then, too?]

[Baat, baat!]

It was a little 'mochi' bouncing around; I knew who that voice belonged to.
And even before I could say something, Biyoo discovered me first and
cried out in happiness.

[Abaat! Abaat!]

[Our young successor has finally arrived, it seems.]

I didn't know why Biyoo was here, but still, this wasn't a bad development.
Persephone seemed to be thoroughly entertained by her adorable antics,
after all.
Hades's stony gaze and Persephone's warm, gentle one landed on me
simultaneously. It felt as if my whole body was freezing up as this itchy
sensation travelled all over me. As expected, just the glance of a Myth-
grade Constellation contained enough power to overwhelm all existences.

I recalled Hades's incredible battle against Poseidon and went down on one
knee, bowing my head.

"It's been a while, oh, 'Father of the Rich Night', and 'Queen of the Darkest
Spring'."

[Indeed, it's been too long, my child. Have you been well?]

"Uh… Yes, I have. How about you, my queen?"

[Fufu, we've been doing well. Although, we were a little saddened that our
only son paid us a visit so belatedly like this.]

The conversation we shared had this festive holiday vibe to it. Since I didn't
have any experience in things like this, I couldn't figure out at all on how to
carry on with the conversation.

Hades sitting on a commodious throne was looking down at me with an
expression I still couldn't read, while Persephone carried a brightly-smiling
face as she continued to talk to me.

[The loneliness from your absence has been filled by our littlest
granddaughter here. To think, I'd get to see a Dokkaebi granddaughter in
our old age… Indeed, one needs to live long enough first to see such a
thing.]

She must've really liked Biyoo still going 'Baat, baat'; Persephone gently
patted the small Dokkaebi sitting on the back of her hand. [Although we
have a grandchild, you still regretfully lack a partner. When are you
planning to introduce us to your mate?]

"Ah, that, I still need to think abo…"
The top question nobody wanted to hear during the holidays flew in at me
right away.

It was right then the silent Judges decided to step forward.

[According to our investigations, there are several potential candidates,
your majesty.]

[Ho-oh, is that so?]

[Yes. This data has been compiled after investigating through the
Olympus's
Fate Matching System ⸢Cupid's Arrow Shot⸥ and ⸢Help us DUO¹ Venus⸥.]

[Judges, you seem to have done something productive for once.]

…N-no, hang on a minute here. Why were these geezers called Judges
investigating my private life??

Unfortunately, a hologram floated up in the air without giving me a chance
to stop them.

[Firstly, this is the Candidate no.1.]

What popped up on it was a certain footage.

– Dokja has a dokja's life to live, after all.

– A Dokja's life… Dokja-ssi, that's a wonderful assertion.

What the… Out of all the footages available, why did they have to go and
bring out such dark history?

The Judge spoke in a composed tone of voice. [Candidate No.1 is a deeply
considerate woman. Not only can she accept our Prince's peculiar
sensibilities with tolerance as vast as rivers and oceans, but she also
possesses a gentle, warm personality and natural decisiveness, as well as a
wonderful outer appearance. Honestly speaking, she may even perhaps be
out of our esteemed Prince's league…]

It felt as if the more I heard him speak, the more dazed I got.

[Next up is Candidate No.2.]

Following her, a certain woman sucking on a lemon candy and blessed with
prim eyes as well as a distinctive beauty spot just below one of them
appeared on the screen.

– Dummy.

– Why are you crying on a nice day like today? I mean, it's even
snowing,too… I promise to think up a nice Modifier later on, okay?

The Judge formed a contented smile while looking at the footage and
continued on with his story. [Although Candidate No.2 possesses an
abrasive personality and often resorts to biting, sarcastic remarks, she also
happens to share a special relationship with our Prince. She is the sole
existence who fully understands our Prince's dark hobby, and not only that,
they can even converse freely regarding that hobby. Truly, a special being,
with no one else like her in the…]

Yup, the match-making system of <Olympus> had definitely lost a lot of its
marbles, hadn't it?

Before the face of the third candidate could appear, I summoned up all my
courage and shouted out. "No, hang on a minute! I don't have any thoughts
of marriage yet!"

The Judge lowered his head as if he wanted to apologise and backed off. [If
the esteemed Prince isn't ready yet, then the introduction of the next
candidate can be delayed until the next time…]

[Hmm… I wonder who'll be able to tame this stubborn Prince of ours.]

Persephone complained in a tone of voice eerily similar to my real mother.
[Well, if all else fails, it'll be fine to bring the Dokkaebi that gave birth to
this child as your partner. Both Hades and I are not bound by humanity's
trifling and old-fashioned idea of one's preference…] Marry Bihyung? I'd
rather kill myself.

[Hades and I will not interfere even if you possess the sexual preference of
'Man Who Knows His Ignorance' and 'Sage of Idea'…]

[Judges of the <Underworld> are waiting for your choice with keen
anticipation.]

[A small number of Constellations are getting interested in your
preference.] [Constellation who enjoys changing genders is paying close
attention.]

I lightly sucked in a breath and quickly opened my lips to speak. "Mother."

Persephone's eyes trembled after she heard my words. [What did you…]

"I believe you already know why I came here."

[…]

"I've come to ask you for a favour."

Even if the time flow was slower in the <Underworld>, I couldn't dither
about for too long. From the get-go, I had only one reason to pay a visit to
this place, anyway.

"Please, lend me the army of the <Underworld>."

My words finally prompted Hades to break his silence. [Do you understand
what that implies?]

A voice that seemed to blanket the world in pure darkness began pressing
down on the entire palace.
An existence of the <Underworld> permitted to lead the army – there was
only one such being, and that was the master of this realm, the King of the
<Underworld>.

"I am aware."

[Does that mean you shall officially accept the position of the

successor?] I nodded my head.

[If you agree to become the King of the <Underworld>, then once all these
scenarios are over, you must remain here to rule this realm. Do you truly
understand what that means?]

"It means that I cannot go to the world of the living without special
circumstances."

[Are you saying that you shall willingly succeed the throne of the
<Underworld> and be locked up here for the rest of your life?]
"Yes," I unhesitantly replied.

Hades slowly stood up from his throne and stared at me with a certain air of
aloofness.

Even though I've grown much stronger, fighting against Hades was still out
of the question. My heart felt as if it'd explode from the nervousness, but
since I was doing it, I had to see it till the end.

The power of the <Underworld> was essential if I wanted to win the 'Great
War of Saints and Demons'.

"I shall become the official successor of the throne of the <Underworld>."




[1] DUO is a match-making company in South Korea, specializing in
finding marriage partners.
   Chapter 389: Ep. 74 - Great War of Saints and Demons, IV


I'd become <Underworld's> official successor; even though I was the one
who said it, it didn't feel all that real to me.

However, it seemed that I wasn't the only one who suspected the sincerity
of my declaration. The King of Tartarus and the ruler of the night, Hades,
was glaring at me.

[You have spoken a lie in <Underworld>.]

Accompanied by the icy sensation, cold enough to freeze my toes, 'death'
was now staring straight at me.

[Right after becoming our child, I see you're already learning to deceive
us.]

Hades rebuked me in a cold voice and stood up from his throne to walk
closer to my position. I wanted to stand up from my spot right then, but my
body didn't want to move.
The Status of a Myth-grade Constellation had currently suppressed my
entire body, that was why.

Thankfully, nothing untoward happened. Hades did get to where I was, but
then, unhurriedly brushed past me and walked straight out of the royal
palace.

I breathed a sigh of relief and turned my head around to find Persephone
rubbing her chin with a meaningful smile on her face.

[H-mm… Is this the conflict between father and son that I've only ever
heard about…?]

For a tone of voice coming from a troubled-looking face, she sure sounded
rather entertained.

[An eternal battle between a father and a son, with the mother in

between…] …That sounded like a narrative deeply stained by the ways of

Olympus.

As if to say I shouldn't worry, Persephone lightly patted me on the shoulder.
Only then did I sense the muscles of my body frozen by Hades's Status
loosen up.

[Do not be too concerned, for your father's personality has always been like
that.]

"…"

[However, your guilt in this matter is just as grave after daring to spout a lie
first. You've never harboured thoughts of staying in <Underworld> from
the beginning, have you?]

She perfectly hit the mark and I had nothing to say. I never wanted to take
over for Hades and become this realm's king. What I wanted was
<Underworld's> powers, not to inherit its throne.
Hades probably had cottoned onto my motives a while ago.

[It will take some time before that fellow's anger has sufficiently cooled
down.]

"I'm sorry."

[No need to apologise – it's true that both Hades and I already knew you
never planned to remain in this realm anyway.]

Persephone's eyes arched to a pair of gentle crescents.

[If it's alright with you, accompany your mother to a meal.]




Persephone's dining table I hadn't seen in a while remained pretty much the
same; slabs of well-cooked and delicious-looking steaks, as well as salad,
laid out in several layers on top of a large plate. On the outside, they
resembled foods commonly found everywhere, but I already knew very
well that those were no ordinary meal.

[Bravery of an Empress of Swords who Conquered the World]

[Wisdom of a 3rd Circle Magician who Spent his Entire Life in a Library]

[Will of a Swordmaster who Couldn't use Either Sword Strengthening or
Sword Manifestation]

I wondered if I saw something wrong here and read the menu one more
time.

[Hurry and have your fill. Do you not find the menu to your liking?]

"…No, it's not that, but…"
[Now that you've become a Constellation, you must consume proper Stories
to survive. You won't be able to absorb enough nutrients through the foods
of regular humans. I hope that, as you're an adult now, you've managed to
fix your picky eating habit.]

She sounded like my real mother by saying that.

[Your mother worries a lot about you – whether you're eating properly and
on time or not, if you're getting enough sleep…]

My hand moving towards the fork came to a stop at her words. "Have you
spoken to my mother?"

[Fufu. We've talked to each other a few times.]

If it was Persephone, then she was fully capable of doing that. The foie gras
placed before me had this name, even:

[Heart of a Mother Sending her Child Away]

…This couldn't have been my mother's actual heart, now was it?

I put the fork down and spoke. "I see that the type of foods has changed
since the last time. There were Swordmasters and Archmages here in the
past, if I recall correctly."

[The 'Isle of Reincarnators' have opened now, so we should enjoy special
dishes for a change, wouldn't you agree? I may look this way, but I'm still a
member of the Gourmet Association, so I shouldn't be eating the same food
every day.]

Her fork and knife moved; accompanied by rich gravy, aromatic paragraphs
leaked out from thinly-sliced Stories. Persephone's graceful hand
movements brought that food into her mouth. What she ate just now was
[Will of a
Swordmaster who Couldn't use Either Sword Strengthening or Sword
Manifestation.]
[And, some Stories will disappear if you don't make an effort to consume
them.]

Dying Stories were disintegrating at the end of the fork.

Stories that no one searched for were pouring out entrancing sentences on
the tip of Persephone's tongue right up until she consumed them.

I felt complicated while watching that sight; Persephone looked back and
smiled. [I'm aware that you are dissatisfied by the eating habits of the
Constellations. You probably don't like the way we easily consume the
joys, angers, sorrows, and pleasures of Incarnations.]

"…"

[However, every incident taking place in the universe is destined to be left
behind as a Story. You, me, other Incarnations, and Constellations. We'll be
consumed by something else eventually.]

The lives of all living beings would become the stories of the <Star
Stream>.

[If we're bound by such a fate, then the best any Constellations could do is
to act towards preserving the most varied spectrum of Stories… That is my
belief.]

Leaving behind varied Stories, and preserve varied types of stories.

Maybe, what Persephone said might not be wrong. In her own way, she was
pursuing what she believed to be right in the <Star Stream>. This was
probably the reason why she was a member of the 'Gourmet Association',
too.

But, I was sure that she didn't invite me here to speak of her philosophy
towards Stories.

"May I ask what is it that you really wish to tell me about?"
[In truth, Hades does not want you to remain in this place.]

"…Does that mean he doesn't want me to be his successor?"

[It's different from that. If I were to put it into words…] Persephone spoke,
as she began cutting the delicacy placed on the plate in the middle of the
table. [Hades, and I… We do not wish for you to stop as just the 'King of
the Underworld'.]

"That means…"

[Olympus has fallen. The Underworld, too, has lost its former glory. Being
satisfied with the position of the 'King of the Underworld', now that is no
different than placing your name on the coattail of a disappearing Story.]

"Underworld is a good Story."

[And it's a declining Story, too.]

Indeed, the power enveloping <Underworld> currently was not like this in
the past. An ancient and withered Story; a story that got progressively
spoken of less and less in the <Star Stream> would lose its power little by
little.

Persephone's unreadable eyes staring at the delicacies contained deep-
seated melancholy. Maybe, she had been constantly thinking about this,
even as she dined on and enjoyed many different Stories.

The fear that eventually, his and her <Underworld> would be buried under
the forgotten alleys of passing time and become another stuffed piece in the
'Isle of Reincarnators'.

[That is the undeniable way of time itself as long as we exist within the
<Star Stream>.]

The moment I heard her words, I was overcome by this unfathomably deep,
intense sorrow. It was the kind of sadness that I'd never experienced before.
Both Persephone and Hades would disappear. From the memories of
people, from my own memories – and the story they had compiled would
disappear forever.

I didn't like Constellations. I disliked their actions, and I disliked the way
they peeped on the world itself, too. But why…

…Did I not want to see Persephone and Hades disappear?

Maybe I didn't want to acknowledge this truth, because I unknowingly
spoke in a curt voice. "Why are you being so nice to me?" I bit down on my
lips before opening them again. "I merely came here to use you."

If I failed to acquire the power of <Underworld>, then <Kim Dokja's
Company> would end up in grave danger on the 'Isle of Reincarnators'.
Even then, I came out and said those words. Perhaps I wanted to confirm
something, as a human called 'Kim Dokja', and not as <Kim Dokja's
Company>.

['The Fourth Wall' is faintly shaking!]

['Fruit of Good and Evil' is worsening your guilty conscience.]

…Even if that confirmation turned out to be a useless waste of time.

Persephone quietly studied me for a little while, lightly wiped her lips with
a napkin, and extended her hand in my direction. Her eyes were gentle and
friendly, with not a hint of animosity in them. Flustered, I tried to get up,
but her Status had already reached my shoulder.

[A very long time ago, we have received a certain revelation from the 'three
sisters of fate'.]

"…A revelation?"

[It said, 'A successor to the darkest night who will end the most ancient
Myth, will appear'.]
Abruptly, I recalled the story Dionysus told me before.

– Several Constellations, including myself, believe that you will be the one
to reach the ■■.

The 'several Constellations' back then must've been Persephone and Hades.

Meanwhile, she continued on. [I was initially furious after hearing that
oracle.]

…Furious?

[Because I possess the 'Story that can't have children'.]

I had no idea that Persephone had such a backstory. Could it be that the
reason why she had no children until now was because of that?

Persephone lightly brushed my hair back.

[At first, I waited, wondering if it was possible. Maybe, I'd be blessed with
a miracle. Maybe, we'd be blessed with a beautiful child who'd remember
our stories. Even if only the darkness, hellish landscape, and prisons existed
here, we were confident of raising our child better than any of the 12 gods
of <Olympus> as long as given a chance. To teach our child the ways of
understanding the darkness of other beings, to tell him the kind of Hell that
others could never sympathise with, and to show him the merciless prison
punishing the evil that tramples on the righteousness of the universe.]

"…"

[For many hundreds of years, I lived on in that delusion.]

The ends of her fingers were trembling ever so slightly.

I couldn't dare to understand the meaning behind that tremor. I simply
couldn't even begin to unpack the pain and the hatred towards <Olympus>
contained in each word she spoke.
Persephone managed to sigh softly and continued on. [Hades and I forced
our way past many things for a very long time. We knew that we couldn't
have children, but we were never unhappy. Even if the <Underworld>
would come to an end in our generation and no one would remember the
Stories we had lived through – we are different from the 12 gods, that we're
different from those parents who forcibly passed on their Stories to their
children. That we are complete as just us.]

"…"

[But then, one day, you made your appearance.]

Persephone's eyes were now looking at me.

[Actually, he was the first one to discover you.]

She continued on in the voice of someone in a dream.

[He said that he started watching your history from when you managed to
survive in the subway. At first, I could hardly believe that there was a child
like you. Because I believed that such Stories were over in this world. I can
still remember his excited voice when he talked about you.]

"…"

[We watched a small Story that grew up all alone fighting against the world
itself. We watched, as you challenged the mighty Constellations, faced off
against the Outer God, and while resisting against Dokkaebis' scenarios…
managing to amass five Stories to be reborn as a small Constellation among
the stars.]

I recalled the moments of <Kim Dokja's Company> being born a long time
ago. Back then, Persephone was one of the five Constellations who
supported me.

[That was when we first began thinking about this – that we wanted to
become your parents.]
I barely managed to swallow back a certain something trying to well up. I
felt that I could just about understand the truth of the affection Persephone
had shown me all this time… Just a tiny little bit.

[Both Hades and I do not wish for you to end up as the 'King of the
Underworld'. We also do not wish for you to be bound to us, and do not
wish for the lives we've lived, our history, to become the rules that you
must abide by. No, all you need to do is to advance forward towards the end
of all scenarios, like you've been doing all along.] "But, I… I am the
Underworld's…"

[You're our son. That is all that matters.]

I didn't possess a single thing to repay that kindness. All I could give them
was just the promise of a future that hadn't been written yet, the one without
any guarantees.

"When I reach the ■■ of all scenarios, I… I'll definitely be with your
stories, as well."

Persephone formed a faint smile.

[Head to the terrace. Your father is waiting for you.]




I didn't have any good memories of my father.

My father, drunken out of his mind and beating me up; dissatisfaction
towards the world spat out like curses, and the inexplicable animosity
aimed at me.

I only had memories of a life where I simply had to endure and live on.

"Pardon me…"
Hades, possessing the shadow of the noble night, stood waiting at the far
end of the terrace. He was staring at the sight of the Underworld stretching
to the other side of the palace.

I didn't know what to say and could only stare at the wide expanse
endlessly; I saw the tributaries where the river of hell flowed within, and
beyond them, wandering souls looking in this direction.

[Do you see it?]

The deaths of countless people were there; sadness was there too, and so
were the joys and pains of life. All those cherished desires that failed to
come to fruition floated down the river's surface.

[This is the Underworld.]

While Constellations were fulfilling their desires in the scenarios, souls
sacrificed to those desires were swept into this place. The world of those
who were discarded, wounded, and broken by the scenarios – that was the
Underworld.

I shifted my gaze over to Hades.

He understood this darkness and became the 'King of the Underworld'.

…While never turning away from the tides of sadness rushing in from the
world of the living, while saving each and every one of those souls. While
listening to other people's stories for thousands of years, nay, even tens of
thousands of years.

At that moment, I thought for some reason, I could say the words I held
back for the longest time.

"…Father."

Hades didn't reply. Maybe, that word was just as foreign to him as it was
for me.
Still, he did reply. [Command the army.]

I looked at him again, utterly stunned now.

And in the next moment, I heard the sound akin to the darkness roaring out.

Souls in the near vicinity of the fortress walls were rushing towards the
palace. Some of them carried determined expressions, while others carried
heroically grim ones. And in front of them all, stood the Three Judges.

It was an enormous army, crashing in like a tidal wave. I had a hard time
trying to hide my heart palpitating from the powerful aura of the great
army that had not been seen before. [For the glory of <Underworld>!] The
first Judge shouted out.

[For the glory of the Underworld's Prince!]

The second Judge prostrated and looked at me.

And as the third Judge powerfully raised his spear towards the heavens,
every soul here began roaring out in a single voice.

[For the eternity of all scenarios and their epilogue!]

As the roar continued on, the 'King of the Underworld' addressed me.
[Now, go.]

Hades didn't even look at me when he said that.

Even though he didn't, he was still looking at me.

He had always been looking at me.

[<Underworld> is your ally from this moment on.]
   Chapter 390: Ep. 74 - Great War of Saints and Demons, V


Du-oong… Du-oong… Du-oong…

The beating war-drums resounded out from the other side of the Gate.

Han Sooyoung stood before the Gate leading to the 119th regional conflict
and looked behind her. "Hey, you ready?"

This battle would be fought alongside Yoo Joonghyuk. Their personalities
were a bad match, but there was no other ally that instilled as much
confidence as he did.

Unfortunately, that Yoo Joonghyuk was displaying a slightly strange
behaviour right now.

"Yoo Joonghyuk?"

Rather than getting ready to enter the 119th Gate, he was staring at the
newly-generated the 123rd Gate, instead. Now beset with a certain ominous
foreboding, she was about to call out his name, but then, his figure
suddenly vanished. And then, a strong repulsive force pushed her back
forward. [You're entering the 119th Gate.]

"…Uh?"

The last thing she saw was Yoo Joonghyuk's hard, emotionless expression.

"You go there alone. I've another battlefield to get to."

"Hey, you! You can't make that deci…!"

Even before Han Sooyoung could shout something in reply to that sudden
declaration, the surrounding space tore and swirled about to reveal a brand
new battlefield.

"God damn it…"

[Incarnation 'Han Sooyoung' has entered the 119th regional conflict.]

[Incarnation Han Sooyoung's affiliated camp is 'Evil'.]

She had already crossed the Gate and couldn't go back now. She simply had
to end this battle first if she wanted to return.

[Many Constellations have taken notice of you.]

The only person on the wide-open camp of 'Evil' was just Han Sooyoung
alone. On the other hand, frightful gazes from Constellations belonging to
the opposing camp were raining down on her one after the other.

[Constellation, 'Master of the Ark', is looking at you.]

[Constellation, 'Guardian of Youths and Travel', is looking at you.]

[Constellation, 'Morning Star Goddess', is looking at you.]

[Constellation, 'The One Who Faces God', is looking at you.]

[Constellation, 'Demon-like Judge of Fire', is looking at you.]
Han Sooyoung could only moan in horror as she confirmed the owners of
those gazes.

Even if she discounted the 'Master of the Ark' Noah, there were the
'Guardian of Youths and Travel', Archangel Raphael, and Goddess
Vakarine of <Guardian Tree>; 'The One Who Faces God' Archangel
Camael, and the 'Demon-like Judge of Fire', Archangel Uriel, too…

And then, the absolute riot of Valkyries standing behind with nary a gap
between right behind them.

Just looking at them alone made her nearly soil herself.

She knew this was a trap, but still, to think that they created a battlefield
with such a difference in the combat strengths. No, did this even qualify to
be called a battlefield in the first place?

"…I wonder if Kim Dokja will take care of my funeral properly."

[Oh, small 'Evil',]

The moment Han Sooyoung heard the true voice of the 'Morning Star
Goddess', she realized that this situation was not something to be made fun
of.

[Many in the 'Good' camp wish to judge you!]

Han Sooyoung bit her lower lip and just as she unfurled the bandages on
her left hand, someone suddenly stepped up to her side.

[Someone has joined the 'Evil' camp!]

…Someone entered such a disadvantageous battlefield?

But, who?

[I was originally going to sit back and spectate, but… You see, I have
someone I must settle a score with.]
It was such a uniquely-annoying voice that Han Sooyoung immediately
recognised who it belonged to.

"Asmodeus?"

[It's been a while, Incarnation of the Black Flame Dragon.]

It was right then, she recalled something Kim Dokja told her some time
ago.

– Raphael and Asmodeus have a history together. If these two ever run into
each other in the battlefield, try to use that to your advantage.

Asmodeus's claws extended out and even without Han Sooyoung doing
anything, the Demon King was already brimming full of desire to fight.
[Raphael. Finally, it's time to pay you back for the previous battle!]

Leaving black afterimages behind, Asmodeus dashed forward; at the same
time, two immense magical energies collided in mid-air. The Demon King
might be an untrustworthy being in any other situation, but at least, it was
better than not having any as an ally right now.

Ku-wahhhh!

Han Sooyoung avoided the explosion and rose up higher in the air. The
view of the battlefield as seen from above stretched on forever. Even if
Asmodeus was fighting against Raphael, there were still a lot of other
Constellations left.

"Screw it, Kim Dokja! And screw you too, Yoo Joonghyuk!!"

In order to fight against that huge army, she had no choice but to unleash
the hidden card she'd been saving up, until now.

"I, the master of the Black Flame, Han Sooyoung, shall awake the Dragon
of the ancient seal! Oh, the Constellation darker than darkness itself, oh, the
abyss deeper than the flowing night…"
She really didn't want to mutter out this chant even if she were to die, but
with the situation being what it was, her lips began reciting it all by
themselves.

Her left arm reacted to her incantation and wiggled around; a Dragon's roar
could be heard coming from a distant somewhere.

"Here in this place, reveal yourself!"

[Constellation, 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon', is getting ready for the
'Advent of Half-God'.]




On the other hand, Yoo Joonghyuk had entered the 123rd Gate all alone and
began searching for someone in this battlefield covered in bushes fluttering
in the wind.

'No mistaking it. It's her aura'.

The reason why he went against Kim Dokja's request and entered this
particular Gate was standing right before his eyes now.

– Yoo Joonghyuk, please become my ally.

He had never forgotten the moment of the distant past when he heard those
words for the first time.

Her elegantly-shaped nose and neatly arranged blonde hair; her eye with an
ominous red glint circling within, as if to ridicule everything in this world.

"Anna Croft."

She was just as he had remembered.

"You came, Yoo Joonghyuk."
[Incarnation, 'Yoo Joonghyuk', has entered the 123rd regional conflict.]

[Incarnation Yoo Joonghyuk's affiliated camp is 'Good'.]

The reason why he entered this battlefield was that he knew Anna Croft
would be here. And the Constellation who told him that was…

[Constellation, 'Secretive Plotter', forms a bizarre smile.]

Yoo Joonghyuk gritted his teeth and spoke. "It's time to settle the score
from the second regression turn."

He quietly unsheathed [Black Heavenly Demon Sword], and its blade let
out a sharp blackened cry.

The moment of vengeance he had been waiting for a long time was here.
He pointed his weapon at her as she remained composed in her spot.
"Take out your weapon."

"I have no desire to fight you."

"Then, just die."

He strode forward threateningly, yet she simply shook her head in reply.
"Are you really here to get even for the second turn?"

"…"

"Your revenge is meaningless. You should know that I'm not the 'Anna
Croft' from the second turn."

"Is the you of yesterday not you anymore?"

"What do you mean?"

"You have inherited the memories and the desires of the second-turn Anna
Croft. You possess the exact same ideal and goal as her. Without a doubt,
you are that 'Anna Croft'."

"…What determines one's existence is the Stories in one's possession. I see
that your views are the same whether it's the second turn or now."

Even though she was staring at Yoo Joonghyuk's approaching sword, she
still remained utterly defenseless. Seeing the signs of near-resignation in
her eyes, his expression hardened.

"Where are the Zarathustras?"

"They are not here."

"Don't make me laugh. It's not possible that you'd come alone."

"If it was the 'Anna Croft' you knew, then yes, she'd never do that."

He took another large step forward and her hair fluttered from his Status.
Her face, now revealed in full, displayed hints of wounds here and there.
What caught his eyes the most was the scar surrounding the [Eye of the
Great Demon]. It was as if someone tried to deliberately cut it out.

"…What happened to you?"

"Many things happened." She shoved his hand away and shot back at him.
"It means that the lofty Anna Croft you knew has fallen a long time ago
already."

Just as her words came to an end, some things came rushing in from the
other side of the battlefield.

Constellations that had chosen 'Evil' were dashing across the field while
fully unleashing their Statuses. As if he knew something like this would
happen, Yoo Joonghyuk moved to take Anna Croft as a hostage. However,
something felt off.

[A portion of Constellations from the Nebula, <Asgard>, have entered the
applicable regional conflict!]

[A portion of Constellations from the Nebula, <Vedas>, have entered the
applicable regional conflict!]

[A portion of Constellations from the Nebula, <Papyrus>, have entered the
applicable regional conflict!]

Anna Croft was actually smiling as she stared at the sword pointing at her
neck. "Please stop with your foolish actions, Yoo Joonghyuk. We're on the
same side, after all."

[Incarnation Anna Croft's affiliated camp is 'Good'.]

"…I thought Asgard was your Nebula sponsor?"

"I understand your grudge, but can you please postpone it until the next
time?"
They might have been talking about two different things, but they still fully
understood each other's situations.

Such a thing was obvious, however – one was a Regressor who understood
the past better than anyone, while the other was a prophet who used to face
off constantly against such a Regressor.

Yoo Joonghyuk withdrew his sword and spoke. "A fitting end for you,
Prophet."

"And it seems that I'll have to share this end with you."

Ku-gugugugu…

The great army of <Asgard> marching forward while kicking up dust
clouds finally came to a halt.

[Constellation, 'God of Fairness and Friendliness', finds this situation
regrettable.]

[Constellation, 'Flames of Muspelheim', wishes to burn everything within
this battlefield.]

[Constellation who likes to change genders is looking at Incarnation 'Yoo
Joonghyuk'.]

As if to show their final bit of consideration, Selena Kim and Iris stood at
the front of the marching army that had stopped advancing.

Yoo Joonghyuk could read many emotions written on their faces.

"Their final consideration, then."

Unfortunately, them stopping didn't mean that other Constellations would
do the same.

"Dodge it."
At the end of Anna Croft's words, both of their figures vanished from the
spot. And then, a massive explosion noise enveloped the entire battlefield.
A stupendously large crater could be found caved in on the ground where
they used to stand.

Kwa-rurururung!!

Currents of lightning could be seen encroaching the skies above; sounds
similar to laughter coming from shady, dark Constellations could be heard.

[Constellation, 'Black Wolf God of Death', has chosen 'Evil' camp.]

[Constellation, 'God-King of Thunderbolt', has chosen 'Evil' camp.]

Anna Croft's complexion paled as she confirmed the Modifiers of the
Constellations. The 'Black Wolf God of Death' was a powerful
Constellation from <Papyrus>, Anubis. As for the 'God-King of
Thunderbolt'…

"Oh my god, it's 'Indra'…"

If <Olympus> had its twelve gods, then Nebula <Vedas> had its eight
lokapalas, as well. And one Constellation lorded over those eight lokapalas
as their king.

[Constellation, 'God-King of Thunderbolts', has summoned the rain of
thunderbolts.]

And that was precisely the 'God-King of Thunderbolts', Indra.

[Many Constellations are pleading for the case of unfairness at the
'GodKing of Thunderbolts' involvement.]

It was not difficult to see why some criticised this situation; Indra was not
your average Constellation who should be appearing in a measly little
regional conflict, after all. It'd not be an exaggeration to call Indra the
strongest existence in <Vedas>, if one excluded its three main gods.
[Constellation, 'God-King of Thunderbolts', is currently in 'Advent of
HalfGod' state.]

On top of this, he was not in an Incarnation Body but Half-God state, as
well.

Anna Croft squeezed her mouth shut as she dodged the falling raindrops of
lightning. Even if she was an excellent fighter, and no matter how powerful
Yoo Joonghyuk was, it was impossible to fight against that Constellation
right now.

Meanwhile, Yoo Joonghyuk asked her a question. "Why did you betray
me?"

"…Is this the right time for such a conversation?" said Anna Croft, but
then, she saw his wordless gaze still locked onto her, and replied with a
sigh. "That was the best available way forward at the time. I believed that
I'd reach the end I thought of by doing that."

"So, did you reach that end, then?"

Anna Croft didn't reply this time.

The 'Ways of Survival', or the records from the 1863rd turn, didn't explain
which scenario Anna Croft of the second turn had managed to reach.

So, only she knew what her own result was.

However, she spat out her words in an angry voice, instead. "…Why do you
ask when you know the answer already?"

The 'Black Wolf God of Death' made its move, then. Anubis, the
Narrativegrade Constellation wearing a jet-black jackal mast and wielding
a black spear – its weapon accurately stabbed past the falling rain of
thunderbolts and took aim at Anna Croft's heart. But then… Ku-
dudududuk!
"I'll be the one to kill her," said Yoo Joonghyuk in a low, heavy voice as he
grabbed the spear with his bare hand.

[Constellation, 'Black Wolf God of Death', is stunned.]

An incredible Status began emitting from Yoo Joonghyuk's body – the
Status of a Transcendent. Now bathed in golden rays of light, magical
energy boiled within his body; Anubis's spear began rocking powerfully as
if it was having a seizure.

Anubis loudly declared as if it wanted to oppose this power.

[Oh, the one who resists against death, I am the God of Death, Anubis. I
shall reap your life in this place.]

"God of Death?" replied Yoo Joonghyuk. "You are no God of Death."

At the same time, blue light exploded from his right arm.

Just as Anubis screamed and backed away, the [Black Heavenly Demon
Sword] in his hand roared out once more.

"I've already seen the real God of Death."

This was one of the techniques Yoo Joonghyuk had been hiding until now.
   Chapter 391: Ep. 74 - Great War of Saints and Demons, VI


A battle fought on a beach not too long ago flitted in and out of Yoo
Joonghyuk's irises.

⸢On that day, the spear that separates the boundaries of the oceans clashed
against the abundant night.⸥
It was the battle of 'Gigantomachia' he witnessed back then. In that place,
he saw the boundless ocean and infinite night go head to head.

Poseidon and Hades.

A battle of Statuses between two Myth-grade Constellations; the brilliant
showdown of the enormous Statuses possessed by the Constellations
occupying the top rungs of the expansive <Star Stream>.

Yoo Joonghyuk bore witness to that battle and was shocked by it, felt
moved by it, and had to despair because of it. And he stood back up again.
He did what he needed to do in order to surpass those distant enemies.
This sword strike was a technique he created by copying those enemies he
couldn't surpass yet.

Breaking the Sky Swordsmanship.

Inner Mysteries. (奧義)

Split the Dark Ocean.

Yoo Joonghyuk's sword moved along with the illusion of the jet-black
ocean splitting apart.

It was a sword strike imitating Hades's scythe colliding against the spear of
the oceans. The Ether blade burning up in the blue hue was immediately
dyed in the black light, and the explosive magical energy from the
Transcendent substituted for the darkness of <Underworld>. And in the
next instant, Yoo Joonghyuk's [Breaking the Sky Energy] cut apart
Anubis's torso.

Gu-waaaaaah!!

The powerful sword strike tore through Anubis's body; it screamed and
collapsed to the ground.

Even if they were in the 80th scenario, this power to defeat a Narrative-
grade Constellation was…

[Many Constellations are shocked by Incarnation Yoo Joonghyuk's
godship!]

The power of a human that had finally exceeded that of Constellations
caused them to seethe in agitation.

[Attack him together!]

[Fire! Kill him!!]
Someone's cry became the signal for the bombardment to commence.
Arrows imbued with powerful magical energy rained down. Yoo
Joonghyuk confronted them all from the front.

Pu-shuut! Pu-shuuut!!

Even as the arrows pierced his side, shoulders, and thighs, he stood before
Anna Croft to deflect all of the attacks.

She had to ask him. "…Why?"

"You'll die."

"Then, why don't you let me?"

"Not in this place. That isn't a part of Kim Dokja's plan."

She bit her lips, hard.

Kim Dokja. Of course, she knew who he was. However, what was he,
anyway? Just what was his importance, that this proud and unyielding man
decided to bend his own belief for that guy?

Yoo Joonghyuk muttered loudly as if to answer her silent inquiry. "I
once glimpsed the memories from the regression turn of a far-flung
future." A far-flung future, he said.

Before she could say something, though, he continued on. "It seemed that
many things had happened."

"Well, looks like you've glimpsed something really fun, then. Did you also
happen to see the end of the 3rd turn, too?"

"I did not. However, I did see what your future was like."

Anna Croft's shoulders flinched a little from surprise.
She possessed [Precognition], but all she could spy on was snippets of the
future. She definitely couldn't see the distant future beyond this world-line.

Yoo Joonghyuk asked her. "Do you wish to know?"

"Not at all."

He ignored her and opened his lips. "Like how you've inherited the
memories of yourself from the 2nd turn, the you of the next turn will inherit
the memories of you from the 3rd turn. Just like that, you'll continue to use
[Retrocognition] to glimpse into the portions of memories from the
previous regression turns and inch forward into the future. Just like how
you've doing until now."

"You're speaking of obvious things. Someone who can't see the future can
also say stuff like that. What are you trying to tell me here?" replied Anna
Croft with a dismissive smirk.

But, Yoo Joonghyuk's expression remained unreadable. "Past the 700th
turn… Many things changed. You, me. Under the curse of remembering our
past turns, we grew weaker and weaker."

"…'We'? No, hang on!"

"And past the 900th turn, and then, the 1000th… One day, you told me
this."

Yoo Joonghyuk slowly blinked his eyes and recalled a certain passage he
read from the records of the 1863rd turn.

⸢Yoo Joonghyuk, I won't be transferring the memories of everything that
happened so far to the next turn.⸥

⸢I can't do this anymore. I'm not like you. I can't keep fighting on while
carrying all this burden.⸥

⸢From here on, you'll be alone.⸥
⸢Are you confident of carrying the burdens of everything?⸥

Anna Croft's complexion paled as she yelled out. "That can't be me. I won't
break down! I am…!"

"You'll change."

His words digging in like a sharp oracle made her entire body shudder. Her
empty eyes began quaking next.

Before she could say something, though, he opened his mouth
first. "However, I'd like you not to change." Her eyes opened
wider and wider.

"I wish to keep hating you. I plan to remember every single thing you've
done and never forgive you for them. For that purpose…"

He left the trembling Anna Croft behind and stepped forward while
unleashing his Status.

"…You must not go to the next turn."

As they broke past the endless rain of arrows, they saw a lone Constellation
standing on the field, waiting. He was the strongest being on this battlefield.

[All of you, step aside. I shall fight that human.]

It was the 'God-King of Thunderbolts', Indra. Countless other
Constellations could only tremble when confronted by his enormous power
that symbolised the Status of <Vedas>.

Ku-gugugugu!!

[Constellation, 'Thursday's Thunder', is keeping a wary eye on 'God-King of
Thunderbolts'.]

The Constellation who also symbolised 'thunder and lightning', 'Thursday's
Thunder', seemed to be burning with fighting spirit more than usual.
"Yoo Joonghyuk, stop! Even if it's you…!"

Yoo Joonghyuk ignored Anna Croft's words and dashed towards the
GodKing of Thunderbolts.

He already knew the Status of Indra well enough. This being's power
exceeded even that of Surya he fought some time ago. However, he wasn't
planning to cower before this being. Not at all.

'Still not enough'.

Indra was not his ultimate target.

Compared to the Myth-grade Constellations or Outer Gods he needed to
fight in the future, a being like Indra was simply another crossing on the
road he had to walk on.

Also, the being he wanted to surpass more than anyone else was…

[Constellation, 'Secretive Plotter', is impressed by your will to fight.]

[5000 Coins have been sponsored.]

Yoo Joonghyuk's figure soared high into the sky before shooting straight
towards Indra.

[How arrogant…!]

The thunderbolts fired by the God-King split the land apart. Ash-coloured
arcs of electricity danced violently as the field cracked open like a crashing
tsunami wave. The electrical currents pounced up and tore into Yoo
Joonghyuk's arm; they tore into his legs and penetrated into his stomach.
With every step he took in the air, he looked back to the time he had lived
so far, and thought about the lives he might have to repeat.

The 41st regression turn.

The 362nd regression turn.
Times Kim Dokja had shown him. And then…

…The 1863rd turn.


The future he got to spy through the 'Secretive Plotter' flitted in and out of
Yoo Joonghyuk's brain.

For him, this was a battle against himself.

The realm he couldn't reach no matter how hard he tried; there he was, the
3rd turn of himself struggling crazy hard, and then struggling some more,
so that he could surpass those moments.

Kwa-kwakwakwakwa!!

Yoo Joonghyuk ploughed forward as if he was borrowing all of the
possibilities of the life he'd have to live, and the lives he might have lived.

The 'Breaking the Sky Swordsmanship'.

Breaking the Sky Sword Saint once told him this – that he should not
permit the heavens existing above him. That he should destroy everything,
annihilate, and to disdain everything.

However, what was he supposed to do when, after destroying the sky
above, he finds there was something else up there?

The 'Secret Technique: Inner Mystery Transmission'.

[Constellation, 'God-King of Thunderbolts' is ridiculing you.]

The Constellations looking down on Incarnations from beyond the heavens
above – this sword strike was created solely to cut them down.

As he sensed the magical energy flowing within [Black Heavenly Demon
Sword], Yoo Joonghyuk recalled Cheok Jungyeong's sword.
With just one sword, he cut apart mountains. With that sword, he let the
world know that even the oceans could be cut.

So, what did one need in order to cut a star down with just a single sword?

Kaaa-boooom!!

One of Yoo Joonghyuk's legs exploded in mid-air. It wasn't because of
Indra's thunderbolts, however. His muscles, tightly bunched together to a
nonsensical degree, exploded with a loud noise; this noise was caused by
the Stories permeating into every corner of the muscle fibres, exploding to
create a forward thrust.

[Stop that! You bastard…!]

He saw the eyes of Indra freaking out.

Yoo Joonghyuk felt the time slowing down. No, it didn't actually slow
down, but rather, he had sped up, instead.

⸢In order to destroy a star, you must become a star yourself.⸥

This was the answer for someone like him, born as a mere human, to reach
the Constellations.

The speed that a lifeform couldn't withstand began tearing apart Yoo
Joonghyuk's entire body. That was the price to pay to become a star when
he wasn't one.

His body shot forward like a black supernova and broke past the walls of
the arcing electricity, shattered all the Constellations daring to block him,
and finally, reached Indra's heart.

The 'Shooting Star Slash'.

He felt a definite sensation from the tip of the [Black Heavenly Demon
Sword].
And then, there was the voice coming from a star splitting apart;
accompanied by the sound of something exploding in the distant cosmos,
Yoo Joonghyuk sensed his body falling from the air. His eyesight blurred
and he couldn't confirm the sight of the star he managed to cut. The muscles
of his body refused to heed his orders; not an ounce of energy remained in
him. He still felt someone catching him through his fading five senses,
though.

The one he hated the most was busy running away with him in her embrace.

"Yoo Joonghyuk, you're truly insane. But, I already knew that…"

While vomiting out more blood, Yoo Joonghyuk spoke to her. "…Indra?"

"He's probably dead. His Half-God Body exploded, after all. Even if he
survived that, he shouldn't be called a living being anymore."

Anna Croft's voice was infused with a certain, unexplainable heat. Just her
emotions conveyed in the tone of her voice was enough for him to
understand what he had achieved here today.

He had managed to destroy a star.

A measly little human had indeed destroyed one of the eight brightest stars
of <Vedas>, the lokapala.

[All Constellations belonging to the Nebula <Vedas> are furious at
Incarnation Yoo Joonghyuk.]

Sadly, though, there were still countless stars left in the sky.

"If I hadn't rescued you just now, you'd have died there."

He knew that she was speaking the truth.

Through her [Precognition], Anna Croft must've seen his death.
"Even though I did rescue you, it's nothing more than just delaying the
inevitable, though…"

Blood continued to flood out of the wide-open wound on his waist. One of
his legs was gone, and he didn't have any strength left to hold his blade
upright.

And eventually, her fleeing steps came to a halt, too. He couldn't see the
front, but he understood what her action meant.

They no longer had any place left to escape on this battlefield.

Anna Croft spoke. "…Yoo Joonghyuk, I don't have any desire to live up to
the 700th turn alongside you."

"I'm the same."

"But then, god damn it, looks like we'll have to live together in the 4th

turn." "That's not going to happen. Because I won't die in this place."

Yoo Joonghyuk didn't possess [Precognition] ability like her. He didn't
know what would happen next. Even then, he continued to speak in a
hushed voice. "Because…"

His voice was fading away, yet it was definitely not the voice of a man
preparing himself for death.

Almost at the same time, roars of crackling thunders could be heard coming
from the far side of the heavens. They did not belong to Indra's
thunderbolts. The space-time was distorting, and the noises were generated
by something crossing over a gigantic Gate.

Yoo Joonghyuk couldn't see that spectacle, but Anna Croft witnessed it in
his stead.

It was an army enveloped in pitch-black darkness; a single realm buried
deep inside an ancient Myth was currently crossing over to this world.
– Yoo Joonghyuk, you stupid bastard!!

Yoo Joonghyuk heard the loud yelling from the one standing at the
forefront of that army and spoke up. "…Because I have allies in this turn
who won't betray me."

[Nebula, <Underworld>, has joined the 'Great War of Saints and Demons'.]
   Chapter 392: Ep. 74 - Great War of Saints and Demons, VII


The strength of <Underworld> was incredible.

The army of the Underworld that entered the 121st regional conflict
completely swept away the combatants from both the 'Good' and 'Evil'
camps and reverted all 'Good/Evil' within the battlefield to 'neutral'.

[Advance!!]

Constellations participating in the 121st regional conflict saw the army of
Hell encroaching their battlefield and either they ran away, or ended up
being incapacitated.

[121st regional conflict has been forcibly concluded.]

[Applicable battle's outcome can't be decided.]

[Lack of will to fight by the participants of the applicable battle has been
confirmed.]
[Applicable regional conflict has been excluded from the category of 'Great
War of Saints and Demons'.]

I glanced at the now-concluded battlefield and without taking a break,
shifted my gaze over to the next Gate.

[117th Gate is currently in activation.]

[119th Gate is currently in activation.]

[123rd Gate is currently in activation.]

According to the plan, my companions should be in the middle of a
dogfight inside the 117th and 119th Gates right now, having split up earlier.
Jung Heewon and Lee Hyunsung were in the 117th Gate, while the 119th
was manned by Han Sooyoung and Yoo Joonghyuk.

Which means, I should help with the situation in the 117th, rather than
119th…

[Constellation, 'Mass Production Maker', says that you must enter the 123rd
Gate.]

…123rd?

But, there shouldn't be anyone there?

I focused on the blurry images of the battlefield that could be seen from the
Gate. And then…

"What the f…?"

…I immediately issued a new order to advance.

"All personnel, we march through the 123rd Gate!"

My order prompted 30,000-plus combatants from the Underworld to march
through the Gate. The great army of the netherworld riding on the
pitchblack clouds crossed the portal and began arriving on the skies of the
123rd regional conflict zone.

"Yoo Joonghyuk, you stupid bastard!"

There he was, bleeding profusely and dying. And then, Anna Croft carrying
him on her back.

I kind of understood why that fool decided to not stick to the plan and
participated in this particular battle.

"'Demon King of Salvation'!!"

I heard her urgent calling and at the same time, I spotted the enemies
hurriedly chasing after her and her human cargo.

They were Constellations from the very angry <Vedas> and <Papyrus>.
Most of them were Historical-grade, but there were a few Narrative-grade
among them, as well.

[Your affiliated camp is 'Evil'.]

Meanwhile, Yoo Joonghyuk and Anna Croft were on the camp of 'Good'.

In other words, the enemies pursuing them were 'Evil'. If this was the 'Great
War of Saints and Demons' of the original storyline, then they would've
been my companions, instead.

"…Kill them all."

Unfortunately, my allies in this battlefield were neither 'Good' nor 'Evil'.

[For the glory of <Underworld>!]

The Three Judges riding on the Hellsteeds burning in hell's flames roared
out in unison and dashed towards the enemy ranks.

Aeacus of Mercy and Righteousness.
Minos of Wisdom and Law.

Rhadamanthys of Impartiality and Incorruptibility.

When alive, they walked the path of the king, and now, they tread on the
paths of the netherworld's judges. They unleashed the auras befitting the
Narrative-grade Constellations that they were and began cutting down the
approaching enemies' numbers.

[How come the <Underworld> has…!!]

[Kuwaaahck!!]

I landed next to Yoo Joonghyuk and Anna Croft while watching the
enemies bleed out Stories and die.

His entire body was covered in grievous wounds. Even his coat featuring
strong resistance against heat couldn't withstand the high temperature and
had melted half-way down; I couldn't really hear his breathing, either.

I observed his left leg, now gone. There were traces of it 'disappearing' due
to the internal expansion force.

…This idiot, he must've used 'Shooting Star Slash'.

He might be able to fool the others, but there was no fooling my eyes. This
was a truly stunning rate of growth.

Originally, the 'Shooting Star Slash' was Yoo Joonghyuk's hidden trump
card that he barely managed to learn after going past the one-thousandth
regression turn. But here he was, managing to reach that realm on only his
third turn.

"He's still breathing."

"How did he end up like this?"

"He was trying to save me…"
"Yoo Joonghyuk was saving you??"

She quietly stared back at me, but her gaze eventually dropped lower. Her
ensuing voice sounded bitter.

"He said that my death isn't a part of your plan."

For a moment there, I felt at a complete loss.

Why would Yoo Joonghyuk…

I took over his care from Anna Croft. I pressed his pressure points to stem
the bleeding, and after laying him down, I took a better look at his current
condition.

The 'Shooting Star Slash' was a technique the current him couldn't handle
yet. The left leg that somehow managed to withstand the explosive forward
thrust was beyond saving. Limb dismemberments couldn't be healed even
with [Elaine Forest Essence].

I sighed for a brief moment there, before pulling out a certain item from my
inner pocket. And it was something that reminded one of a tentacle
belonging to a dark, sooty-coloured squid.

[Fragments of Squid Kim Dokja's seventh tentacle]

Anna Croft glared at the item with suspicious eyes. "What is that?"

"I got it as a gift not too long ago."

"A gift? …That?"

I was at a loss again as to how I should explain this.

Actually, this item was a 'not-for-sale' bonus article available only during
the
"Kim Dokja's Company Collaboration" event held by 'Mass Production
Maker' just before the 'Great War of Saints and Demons' went underway.
I remembered that those who purchased a brand-new [Ferrarghini] received
this on a first-come-first-served basis. I can still vividly recall the
conversation I had with the 'Mass Production Maker' back then.

 –        Thank you. All thanks to you, this season has been a huge
 success. Thetentacles of Squid Kim Dokja were all gone in less than one
 minute, you know.

No matter how hard I thought about it, this just didn't make any sense.
There were Constellations who bought Ferrarghini just to get their hands on
my 'legs'?

The 'Mass Production Maker' grinned slyly and asked me.

 –         What's wrong? Do you wish to know who they were?

 –       …No, not really. Besides all that, how did you acquire the
 fragments of mytentacles?

 –       Eh? Of course, they are not your real tentacles. No, those were
 simply[Kraken legs]. Here, why don't you take one yourself as a
 souvenir?

I was too lazy to explain all this to Anna Croft, so I simply handed the item
over to her and ignored her question altogether. Once she got a hold of it,
though, more suspicion clouded up her expression.

"Why is your name attached to this [Kraken leg]?"

"You don't need to know. Just activate the [Elixir Maker] attribute, instead.
Mix your blood with this item and have him eat them."

A [Kraken leg] possessed the effect of healing grievous wounds such as
dismemberment, as well as to maximise the user's base self-healing ability,
as well. And then, Anna Croft's blood carried the effects of elixirs, so when
the two were mixed together, it'd be possible to heal any serious injuries
pretty quickly.
For some reason, though, she seemed to be hesitating, however.

"But, if I feed him my blood…"

"He won't become your subordinate."

It had been said before; Anna Croft's blood possessed a power to make
anyone who drinks it come under her influence.

"Because the current Yoo Joonghyuk has higher Status than you."

She flinched slightly when she heard my words.

Meanwhile, I observed the unconscious Yoo Joonghyuk sleeping quietly on
the ground. He wouldn't become her subordinate or some such.

I didn't see any trace of him activating [Recovery], though. It seemed that
he was planning to keep that power to the last possible second. He made a
wise decision; if he wasted Recovery in this place, then I'd not be able to
borrow his powers when it was really needed later.

"…Gotta hand it to this sunfish bastard."

I grumbled a little and turned around to see the sight of the Underworld's
soldiers sweeping the enemies away like an incoming tidal wave. But then,
upon taking a closer look, I could see that wave falter unstably.

As if the ends of the wave were being blocked by a massive dam and were
crumbling away. And in the middle of the waves, a stupendous amount of
sparks were dancing and exploding.

[Constellation, 'God-King of Thunderbolts', is roaring out in pure rage!]

…The God-King of Thunderbolts?

Anna Croft spoke with a stiff expression. "But, that can't be… I witnessed
his Half-God Body getting destroyed, so how??"
With that, I could figure out more or less on what had transpired here. It
seemed that the 'star' Yoo Joonghyuk had cut down was that dude over
there. "Indra possesses many Incarnation Bodies. He must've called one
over here after paying for the Probability."

Out of all the Constellations of <Vedas>, Indra had so many Incarnation
Bodies that one couldn't count them using one's fingers.

It was a pretty famous anecdote of the three main gods of <Vedas> asking
Indra "Which number Indra are you?" all the time.

[Constellation, 'God-King of Thunderbolts' has summoned Star Relic
'Vajra'!]

Along with the loud boom akin to the skies splintering, the front of the
<Underworld> army began splitting apart.

The 'Vajra', Indra's main weapon capable of shooting thunderbolts
containing an incredible amount of magical energy.

But, I simply snatched up the incoming thunderbolt with my bare hand.

Tsu-chu-chu-chut!

And then, I threw it back where it came from.

I could see Indra making a stunned face. But, it's still too early for that.

[So, you're the 'Demon King of Salvation'.]

"And you're Indra."

[Why is the <Underworld> helping you?]

"Do I have a reason to explain that to you?"

Indra stared at me with a look of a person discovering a mysterious
lifeform. [You are 'Evil'. Behave according to the scenario's rules. I shall
overlook your disrespectful manners this time in consideration towards
other Demon Kings, so…]

"It was you who caused my companion to end up looking like that. Right?"

[So? What about it? That is the price to pay for an arrogant human when
he opposed a Constellation. Do you wish to avenge him, then?] Avenge,
was it?

"That guy hates it when someone else pays the debt for him. Right, he's the
kind of a guy who must settle the score himself even if it kills him. So, the
reason why I'm going to kill you now isn't because of Yoo Joonghyuk."

[A Demon King with a uselessly chatty mouth, aren't you.] Kwaaa-

boooom!!

Beams of blinding thunderbolts blanketed the sky and rained down on my
position. I managed to deflect a few and defended against others. Some did
land on me, but the pain was rather tolerable.

Indra did possess many Incarnations, but accordingly, the dispersion of his
powers was just as great.

On top of this, he suffered irreversible damage from Yoo Joonghyuk's
attack during his Half-God Body state, so he'd be unable to even summon
up half of his usual power right now.

However, Indra was still smiling away. [Oh, you foolish Demon King. You
shall regret this!]

[Nebula, <Vedas>, has blessed 'God-King of Thunderbolts' with its grace!]

The Nebula had spent Probability for him.

The power enveloping the God-King was growing even greater. Rapid
changes took place on Indra's Incarnation Body, and soon, golden rays of
light began shooting out from his entire figure. He grew humongous, and
the one thousand eyes he possessed began opening up one by one.

"We can't let him continue!"

Anna Croft must've seen something through [Precognition] because she
began crying out next.

…Hell, it looked like to me that Indra and <Vedas> had made up their
minds for good this time.

[Constellation, 'God-King of Thunderbolts', has activated the Stigma, 'Eyes
that Observe Everything'!]

When all those eyes fully open up, Indra would be able to display the power
of his true self through an Incarnation Body. Currently, about half of those
eyes had opened.

Ku-gugugugu!

At this rate, every Incarnation participating in the 123rd conflict would be
swept away by the overflowing electrical shock.

However, I was getting progressively happier watching that electrical
energy filled to the brim with < Vedas'> Probability, instead.

"Actually, I have a score to settle with your Nebula. Make that a very big
score."

I remembered everything the Nebula <Vedas> did to me. Well, anyone who
had suffered that badly would be the same as me.

I unsheathed Unbroken Faith and continued on. "Because of you lot, I had
to become a Demon King."

During the Dark Castle's last scenario, I became the 73rd Demon King.
"I had to order my companions to kill me, and in the process, ended up
inflicting them with terrible memories back then."

[You have activated 'Demon King Transformation'.]

The Status I earned after becoming the Demon King flooded out with my
heart as the center. Black wings tore out from the back of my shoulders, and
horns broke out from my head.

[Story, 'Demon King of Salvation', has begun its storytelling.]

Back when I lost my life to the swords of my allies and was cast out to the
scenario's horizon, I looked up at the heavens and swore to myself over and
over again.

⸢Wait for a little while longer. Because I will bring all of you down from
the damn sky.⸥
The stars in the distant sky, seemingly out of reach no matter what Stories I
managed to acquire.

The distance so far away that it induced despair.

Now, I could clearly see the locations of the stars that previously seemed so
high up.

I spoke in my true voice. [Back then, all of you seemed so high up…]

I grinned and stared at Indra.

[But it seems that you're all hung a lot lower than I thought.]
  Chapter 393: Ep. 74 - Great War of Saints and Demons, VIII


As soon as words left my lips, golden streams of aura flooded out from
Indra's entire figure. It was the same story back then with Surya; those from
<Vedas> must've had a thing for the golden colour.

Ku-waaaah!!

Waves of powerful Status formed a complicated network with Indra as their
center. Ripples of electrical energy crashed into me, and I could hear Indra's
laughter at the same time.

Indeed, this was a mighty power that no Constellation would dare to go up
against. A violent suppressive force that ripped through one's body,
pulverised it, and crushed it.

[Giant Story, 'Demon Realm's Spring', has begun its storytelling.]

However…

[Giant Story, 'Torch that Swallowed the Myth', has begun its storytelling.]
…I was withstanding it.
Sparks danced in the air like fireflies. I brushed past the currents of the
electrical energy and took a step forward, then another one after that.

[Many Constellations are startled by your 'Status'.]

Constellations on the other side of the battlefield were looking at me with
wide-open eyes.

[Exclusive skill, 'Bookmark', is activating!]

[Fifth Bookmark has been initiated!]

[Exclusive skill, 'Electrification' Lv.23 (+13), has been initiated.]

[Your current physical constitution is different from that of the applicable
character.]

[Your 'Status' has overcome the physical constitution penalty.]

I arrived before Indra's eyes as the blinding flashes of light continued to go
off.

[Ku-uhhhhk!]

My powerful kick to his stomach resulted in the opened eyes there to go
'pop' one after the other. Other eyes looked at me in pure shock as if they
couldn't accept this situation.

Not that surprising, really.

It was impossible for a newbie Narrative-grade belonging to a small Nebula
to exercise this much Status, after all. Indeed, it was impossible to exert this
much power with only the two Giant Stories that I managed to acquire.

[Giant Story, 'Kaizenix Archipelago', is aiding you.]

[Giant Story, 'Underworld', is providing you with Probability.]
['A Single Story' you have compiled has almost reached its 'Twist'.]

However, the story was different now.

With my two Stories and Kaizenix Archipelago's Story, as well as
Underworld's Giant Story all working together, I could exhibit power on a
similar level to a Constellation who had completed their 'Twist', at least
within the confines of this 'Great War of Saints and Demons'.

[How can you, with that much Probability… You bastard…!]

The current me wouldn't lose against an upper-rank Narrative-grade
Constellation.

[I am Sakra devanam Indra! The leader of the eight lokapalas, and the king
of <Vedas>!]

…Even if that Constellation just so happened to be the king of those gods.

[Constellation, 'God-King of Thunderbolts', is activating 'Thunderstorm of
Heaven and Earth'!]

Eyes found all over Indra began emitting bright light, and the entire world
became awash in pure whiteness. The sky was seemingly writhing within
the lightning itself.

I dashed towards that spectacle of a thunderstorm.

[Probability you've used far exceeds the limit by a great degree.]

[Blessing from Nebula, <Underworld>, is protecting your Incarnation
Body!]

[Vajra] and Unbroken Faith collided. Indra's lightning and the Status of
'Electrification' opposed each other as grey sparks danced in the air. My
sword was pushed back by <Vedas'> Status and flew up into the sky.

A smile of satisfaction crept up on Indra's face.
However, the sword was just a diversion from the get-go. I didn't miss that
moment the sword was sent flying and powerfully stomped on his leg.

[Ku-uhrk…!]

Just as Indra's massive figure crumbled, I grabbed the bastard's collars and
slammed him down to the ground. He crashed head-first and gasped out in
pain, unable to withstand the impact force.

I easily climbed on top of him now that he had lost his balance, and began
pounding on his face with my bare fists. Accompanied by the sounds of
flesh being squashed, lumps of Stories poured out from Indra's mouth.

[The measly Underworld dares to, Olympus' measly little low-ranked
Nebula dares to…!]

[Measly 'Underworld'? You want to belittle my family, is that it?]

The number of Constellations actually affiliated with <Underworld> was
less than ten. Even then, there was a reason why other Constellations feared
this Nebula.

[Nebula, <Underworld>, has handed down the divine punishment of
wrath!]

[You see, my parents? They can get really terrifying when they are angry.]

[Constellation, 'Queen of the Darkest Spring', nods her head.]

[Blessing from the Constellation, 'Father of Rich Night', is protecting you.]

Perhaps as a display of his final struggle, a baptism of electricity exploded
forth from Indra's body. My skin began burning up like charcoal, and my
heart being electrocuted pounded away irregularly. My vision flickered like
a broken lamp, too. I gritted my teeth.

This level of lightning? Compared to what I had to go through at Kyrgios's
hands, this was nothing.
I extended my hand out, and Unbroken Faith that got flung away during our
initial clash returned to my grasp. I powerfully stabbed Indra's heart with
the blade enveloped in the pure-white magical energy.

Along with the sound of 'Pu-shu-shuk!', Indra's Incarnation Body writhed.
How much time passed by like that? The trembling body eventually
stopped moving and sagged powerlessly.

I leaned closer and whispered to his ear. [Try reviving again and again. I'll
just keep killing you.]

And then, a series of messages cascaded down.

[Constellation, 'God-King of Thunderbolts', has suffered horrible damage to
his true body!]

[Constellation, 'God-King of Thunderbolts', isn't summoning any other
Incarnation Bodies!]

[Constellation, 'God-King of Thunderbolts', has given up on the applicable
scenario!]

[Another defeat has been recorded on the Constellation 'God-king of
Thunderbolts' Story.]

[You have become one of 'God-King of Thunderbolts' mortal enemies.]

[A portion of Constellations of the <Star Stream> are in awe of your
achievement.]

…

…

…

[Nebula, <Vedas>, has been inflicted with terrible damage!]
[Nebula, <Vedas>, is being swallowed up in the storm of Probability's
aftermath!]

Every Constellation on this battlefield witnessed a Nebula tasting
defeat right in front of their eyes and closed their mouths shut. [You
have achieved an unbelievable accomplishment!]

[A new Story related to 'Nebula' is germinating in you!]

I raised my body up from Indra's corpse, leading to the Judges commanding
the battle formations as well as the Underworld's soldiers to kneel before
me.

[Your Incarnation Body has suffered serious damage!]

I also felt like collapsing on the ground right about now. Just from thinking
about that made me realize how incredible Yoo Joonghyuk was.

He managed to defeat Indra in the Half-God Body State with one attack
without the blessing of <Underworld>.

Obviously, I must not lose to him.

[Is there anyone else who wishes to tour the depths of the <Underworld>?]

I couldn't display any weakness in this place. Plenty of enemies remained,
and I was the Underworld's Prince, after all.

[Constellations of the battlefield are fearful of you!]

I saw the Constellations previously fighting against <Underworld>
hesitantly retreat now. Constellations that had been looking down on me
from high up in the sky were now scared of me.

Of course, not everyone was like that; unlike the Constellations from
<Vedas> and <Papyrus>, the party from <Asgard> was still intact.
[Constellation, 'God of Fairness and Friendliness', is looking at you.]
[Constellation, 'Flames of Muspelheim', is looking at you.]

[Constellation who likes to change genders is looking at you.]

…Every single one of them were prominent Constellations.

The 'God of Fairness and Friendliness' must be the God of Light Baldr,
while the 'Flames of Muspelheim' should definitely be the Flame Giant
Surtr.

As for the 'Constellation who likes to change genders'…

"'Demon King of Salvation'."

The Incarnation stepping forward to represent Asgard's forces was someone
that I knew pretty well.

[Selena Kim.]

"We don't have any intentions to fight you."

[Is that the intentions of the Incarnations, or the Constellations?]

Selena Kim looked troubled by my question. Unfortunately, this was an
important distinction.

[Constellation, 'God of Fairness and Friendliness', finds it unacceptable that
it must be affiliated with the 'Evil' camp.]

[Constellation, 'Flames of Muspelheim', wishes for a fight that burns
brightly.]

Honestly, I'd be really grateful if that side decided to back away first.
Because it wouldn't be good for my side if we ended up fighting <Asgard>
here, too.
Whatever their reason was, several powerful Constellations from their side
had chosen to participate in this conflict, and <Underworld> would
definitely suffer some losses by fighting against them.

On top of this, I had to participate in other regional conflicts as well. Sadly,
though, the situation didn't unfold as smoothly as I hoped for.

[A portion of Nebula <Asgard's> Constellations are displeased with the
'Demon King of Salvation'.]

[A portion of Nebula <Asgard's> Constellations argue that they need to
make an example out of the 'Demon King of Salvation'.]

As expected, it couldn't be helped when it comes to a great Nebula, could
it?
Whether it was Constellations or humans, if a large number congregated…

[Constellation who likes to change genders is persuading <Asgard's>
Constellations.]

…Huh?

[Using masterful conversational techniques, the Constellation who likes
to change genders is arguing that this fight will not be good for either
side.] I couldn't figure out what's going on with this situation.

…The Constellation who likes to change genders was doing what?

[Constellations of <Asgard> are paying attention to the words of the
Constellation who likes to change genders.]

It seemed that both Selena Kim and Iris were surprised as well. For a while
there, the air was filled with indirect messages thanks to all the back-
andforth.

[Constellation, 'Flames of Muspelheim', says they can't trust the words of a
fool who likes to change genders.]
[Constellation, 'God of Fairness and Friendliness', says that one's preference
and credibility should be separate from each other.]

[Constellation, 'Thursday's Thunder', argues that, although that fool is
naturally a trickster, he can sometimes speak of sensible things.]

[A portion of <Asgard's> Constellations argue that they should not forget
the distress <Asgard> found itself in after trusting that Constellation's
words before.]

[Constellation who likes to change genders argues that <Asgard> will
suffer losses in this battlefield, unrelated to the worth of his own name.]
Well, this was a mess, alright.

In any case, I became pretty sure of who that 'Constellation who likes to
change genders' was by looking at the unfolding situation.

[Constellation, 'Goddess of Love and Cats', argues that by leaving this
battlefield, they will suffer losses related to the Giant Story of the 'Great
War of Saints and Demons'.]

[Constellation who likes to change genders argues that that might not be the
case.]

And so, just how long did they argue back and forth for?

[Constellations of <Asgard> have come to a decision.]

A short while later, I spotted Selena Kim's complexion brighten on the
other side.

She quickly opened her lips. "Constellation-nims are agreeing with us.
<Asgard> does not have any intentions to fight against you and
<Underworld>."

[Nebula, <Asgard>, makes it clear that there is no reason to fight you.]
I had no idea how that Constellation managed to convince his uptight,
stubborn fellows of Asgard, but there was no denying that this friendly
offer would be good for us.

I nodded my head, and Constellations affiliated to <Underworld> and
<Asgard> all withdrew their Status at once. I, as well, cancelled the
[Demon King Transformation].

[Constellation who likes to change genders is looking at you.]

[Constellation who likes to change genders is praising his own
accomplishment.]

…For sure, without that Constellation's help, an unnecessary fight might've
broken out. I briefly lowered my head as a sign of my appreciation.

[Constellation who likes to change genders wants a reward.]

"…Do you want coins from me?"

[Constellation who likes to change genders says he has a very small favour
to ask.]

"A favour, you say?"

[Constellation who likes to change genders adds that this favour is nothing
serious.]

A small, nothing-serious favour, was it. I was getting more worried,
instead.

I pondered it for a bit, before making my reply. "If it's not a favour that will
harm <Kim Dokja's Company>, then I can do it."

I carefully studied the modifier attached to the indirect messages, before
adding something else. "And yes, it must not be about changing genders."
[Constellation who likes to change genders says that it definitely isn't a
favour like that.]

If it wasn't, then well.

I nodded my head, and a sound similar to a child laughing could be heard
coming from the sky next.

[All beings in the 123rd regional conflict no longer hold any intention to
fight.]

Constellations from <Vedas> have lost their will to fight, while only a
small number of Constellations from <Papyrus> had participated from the
beginning – and they were unable to carry on due to Yoo Joonghyuk. On
top of this, both <Asgard> and <Underworld> currently were not intending
on fighting each other, either.

[123rd regional conflict has been forcibly concluded.]

[Applicable regional conflict's outcome can't be decided.]

[Lack of will to fight by the participants of the applicable battle has been
confirmed.]

[Applicable regional conflict has been excluded from the category of 'Great
War of Saints and Demons'.]

With this, the 123rd regional conflict had drawn to a close.

[Chaos Points have risen by 5.]

[Warning! Chaos Points have surpassed 70!]

The Chaos Points had already gone past 70.

There was no way that Metatron and Agares wouldn't feel the heat with
things like this. Especially so with the former, who had seen the destruction
of <Eden> during the 1863rd regression turn.
Thinking of participating in the next regional conflict with my other
companions in it, I looked up at the Gates in the sky.

[117th Gate is currently in activation.]

[119th Gate is currently in activation.]

One was where Jung Heewon and Lee Hyunsung were, while the other
Gate was Han Sooyoung's.

I quietly stared at the two Gates, before choosing which one to enter and
walked into it.

But then…

[You can't enter the applicable Gate.]

I can't? Why not?

[Applicable Gate's regional conflict has been concluded.]

…The battle had ended already?

I looked behind me and found Anna Croft staring dazedly at the Gate.

"Kim Dokja."

The moment I heard her, my heart grew cold.

Regional conflicts of the 'Great War of Saints and Demons' with no victor
among 'Good' and 'Evil' were treated as invalid and would enter the 'forced
conclusion' sequence.

However, this regional conflict had simply been 'concluded'. Meaning…

[Victor has been decided in the applicable regional conflict.]

…Meaning, <Kim Dokja's Company> that entered the Gate in question had
failed in their mission.
[Death penalty will be applied to the defeated participants of the regional
conflict.]
               Chapter 394: Ep. 75 - A certain heart, I


"…Oh, the noble and majestic master of the dark clouds, Black Flame
Dragon… What the hell, why is this incantation so lengthy? Hey, is this for
real??"

[Constellation, 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon', nods its head.]

Han Sooyoung spat out a series of expletives and dodged the incoming
spears of light. There was a 'Pu-shut!' and a streak of blood escaped from
her shoulder.

[Constellation, 'Master of the Ark', is grinning.]

The [Black Flame] Han Sooyoung wielded utterly disintegrated several
Valkyries in her near vicinity. Stunned by that evil power, other Valkyries
shouted out in unison.

[Kill her!]

[Absolute Evil must not be allowed to live!]
[We must stop her from finishing her spell!]

Han Sooyoung continued to smack away the Valkyries flooding her
position and muttered to herself. "Isn't it a common courtesy to wait for
someone to finish transforming?"

She bit her lower lip while watching the great army of Valkyries still
rushing in. Now normally, it'd not be any trouble for her to deal with lower-
class Historical-grade Incarnations.

The issue was with the skill these Valkyries possessed.

[Nebula, <Eden>, has currently activated 'Hour of Divine Punishment'.]

The 'Hour of Divine Punishment'; this skill was really similar to the [Hour
of Judgement] Jung Heewon used. Although the former didn't boast the
same level of buff as the latter, it still greatly enhanced one's combat
abilities against 'Evil'.

Valkyries blessed with that skill were numbering not in the dozens, but in
the hundreds.

[Raphael, your skills have become rusty!]

On one corner of the battlefield, Asmodeus was cackling away in madness
while swinging his claws around in the air.

And in the air, demonic energy and divinity collided to produce loud
explosions. Just above that, there was a piece of floating cloud.

Raphael was riding on that.

[Stop being snarky. Or get your piehole stuffed again.]

[Ahahahaha! Your propensity to quip is still the same, I see!]

The tone of the voice was playful, but the waves of Status contained within
were certainly not.
Han Sooyoung could only scowl deeply in silence. No matter how she
looked, that insane Demon King didn't seem to have any leeway to help her
out.

[Constellation, 'Morning Star Goddess', is deliberating on her participation.]

[Constellation, 'The One Who Faces God', is frowning at the demonic aura
coming from 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon'.]

[Constellation, 'Demon-like Judge of Fire', is looking at another place in
restlessness.]

Not only that, there were still three great Constellations on the side of
'Good' remaining, too.

[Constellation, 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon', says not to worry and
complete the spell.]

"…The darkest dark, the most legendary tale, greatest Dragon among them
all, the blessing of the Black Flame Dragon shall accompany this bod…
Screw this shit! You're doing this deliberately, aren't you? I'm not doing
this anymore!"

[Constellation, 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon', cackles and says that's
enough.]

In the following moment, incredible demonic aura exploded out from Han
Sooyoung's body.

She closed her eyes after sensing the vast Status rising up from the deepest
part of her. As her consciousness slowly submerged under the surface,
several things in her mind began snapping loose.

Thoughts of invalidating this battlefield, or <Kim Dokja's Company>
striding on the ambiguous ethical line between 'Good' and 'Evil', all broke
in half and became paralysed.
[Constellation, 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon', is starting 'Advent of
HalfGod'!]

When she reopened her eyes, she had become a different person.

[Incarnation Han Sooyoung's mind has been tainted by demonic aura.]

"Kuk, kuk, kukuk…"

Her irises were now dyed in the purple-coloured demonic aura. She covered
half of her face with her hand and wiped the blood on her cheek.

She licked the traces of fresh blood on the back of her hand and asked.
"How amusing. Is this all you can do?"

The shoulders of all the Valkyries shuddered after they sensed that
unknown aura, and they quickly distanced themselves.

Han Sooyoung shouted out loudly as bright light began emitting from her.
"Kneel before me! This is the difference of Status between you and…
Hey!! Stop spouting bullshit with my mouth!"

[Constellation, 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon', says that it can't be helped if
his true power is to be unleashed.]

"No, hang on. If you want to say something, then say stuff that makes…
Oraaa! Taste my Dark Shadow Phoen…!! Nooo, not something like that!"

Although her incantation effort was a bit of a mess, it still must've been
effective, as a huge shadow suddenly drew below Han Sooyoung's feet. The
land seemed to quake as the shadow grew even larger and eventually, it
took on the shape similar to that of a Dragon.

She had seen similar phenomenons as this one several times in the past.

Back in the [Peace Land] and in [Dark Castle], she saw Constellations
using this power before – the Constellation's shadow. Their darkness,
existing on the reverse side of their starlight.
Before long, she was riding on the back of a black Dragon, dozens of
meters tall.

[Constellation, 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon', is roaring out!]

This was it, the power that couldn't be unleashed until now due to the
restriction of Probability. The shadow of the Black Flame Dragon carried
her and soared high into the air.

As the pitch-black shadow was cast onto the skies above, the Dragon began
pouring out its Breath onto the ground below.

Kuwaaaaaahh!!

The battlefield was swept clean by the shockwaves; even the fleeing
Valkyries were turned to fine dust in an instant.

This absolute power rendered [Hour of Divine Punishment] and blessings
from a Nebula completely meaningless.

[U-uwah, uwaaah!!]

Perhaps he was reminded of a deeply unpleasant nightmare, the 'Master of
the Ark' hugged himself and began shivering away. That made sense,
though – any Constellation from <Eden> would possess a certain amount of
fear towards the 'Apocalypse Dragon', that's why.

And 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' was one of the strongest candidates
among the final Dragons from the Book of Revelation.

This was the true power of the 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon'.

Even as she suffered from the suppression of the Probability building up,
Han Sooyoung still trembled from sheer joy.

She did good. She really did good by choosing 'Abyssal Black Flame
Dragon' as her sponsor.
"Hahahaha! Die! Diiie! Die! Diiiie! …God damn it, stop it!"

As if she was suffering from schizophrenia, two different things jumped out
of her mouth at the same time.

[Your mind is being tainted by the demonic aura.]

This power of the Black Flame Dragon was indeed incredible, but it
couldn't be abused; the longer it was used, the ego of the Incarnation would
gradually be assimilated to that of the Dragon itself.

'At this rate, I might end up exactly like Kim Namwoon in a few years'.

Completely disregarding her inner worries, Abyssal Black Flame Dragon's
shadow proceeded to sweep away over half of the battlefield in no time at
all.

As if she couldn't sit back and watch any longer, someone finally made a
move.

[Constellation, 'Demon-like Judge of Fire', reveals her Status!]

For the first time ever, the Black Flame Dragon's Breath was blocked as the
deafening roar rocked the land. The essence of the white flames was cutting
down the darkness of the world.

The [Flames of Retribution].

It was Uriel's Star Relic, crafted out of the purest fire that burned in the
depths of Hell.

The Black Flame Dragon blotting out the sky broke into a grin.

[Constellation, 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon', says that he always wanted
to have a showdown.]

[Constellation, 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' is hardening her expression.]
The two Constellation went head-to-head and the surrounding space was
immediately flooded with the dancing blue sparks. Valkyries couldn't
withstand the clash of the Statuses and collapsed while vomiting blood.

[Oldest Good is enjoying this regional conflict.]

[Oldest Evil is enjoying this regional conflict.]

The great 'Good' and 'Evil' had selected these two Constellations as their
representatives. And in the midst of it all, there was Han Sooyoung,
currently being cooked into charcoal by the arcs of blue sparks.

"Kuk, kuk, kuk, die! You dumb Archang… Hey you, stop! This is no
good!"

[Constellation, 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon', asks why that's the case.]

"You idiot! If we start fighting Uriel here, everything will be over!"

Han Sooyoung, her face caked with soot, began throwing a wild temper
tantrum. She almost ended up fighting for real after getting swept up in the
atmosphere earlier, but she knew that nothing good would come out of
doing exactly that.

"And you, Archangel! You wake up, too! Are you really going to fight
me?"

[Constellation, 'Demon-like Judge of Fire', is looking at you.]

Uriel was forming a helpless expression. Anxiety was all-too-clear to see in
her eyes.

[Constellation, 'Demon-like Judge of Fire', forms a troubled expression.]

"You don't want to fight either, right? I know. So, why don't we stop here?
And please, why don't you persuade your friends while you're at it, too!"
Han Sooyoung's words only managed to make Uriel's anxiety run even
deeper.

However, the [Hellfire] activated separately from what her expressions had
indicated and persistently flew in Han Sooyoung's direction. The latter
didn't give up, though.

She believed that there had to be a reason why the Archangel was
participating in this regional conflict.

[Story, 'Predictive Plagiarism', has begun its storytelling.]

⸢Uriel must've known that this was a trap designed to kill <Kim Dokja's
Company>. That is why she had to come here personally.⸥
What an unfortunate thing it was that the duo showing up in this battlefield
happened to be 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' and Han Sooyoung…

Still, she was a member of <Kim Dokja's Company>. So, she decided to
bring out the cheat key she held back for the rainy day.

"What will Kim Dokja think of you if I end up dying here?"

Uriel's shoulders trembled faintly. Han Sooyoung quickly went for another
shot. "I'm asking you, are you confident of looking at Kim Dokja, free of a
guilty conscience, after killing me?"

[Constellation, 'Demon-like Judge of Fire', says that you and your sponsor
are 'Evil'.]

"God damn it! Who cares about 'Good' this and 'Evil' that? How is that
important? You people decided that on your own!"

[Flames of Retribution] brushed past the Black Flame Dragon's wing. Even
as her balance rocked unstably, Han Sooyoung looked at Uriel with
pleading eyes. The latter's sword swings had become much more half-
hearted than before.
Just a little bit more; one more push, and it'd be over.

[Constellation, 'Demon King of Salvation', is watching the battlefield.]

Goosebumps broke out all over Han Sooyoung after she heard the ensuing
indirect messages.

[Constellation, 'Demon King of Salvation', is looking at 'Demon-like Judge
of Fire'.]

'…Kim Dokja, you scary bastard.

You have enough leeway to look at this side, too?'

[Constellation, 'Demon King of Salvation', is looking at 'Demon-like Judge
of Fire'.]

Kim Dokja didn't say anything. Not a word of request for help, no asking
for favours, nothing – just him looking on.

[Constellation, 'Demon-like Judge of Fire', has stopped moving.]

[Constellation, 'Demon-like Judge of Fire', is falling into confusion.]

Han Sooyoung inwardly cried out in elation. Uriel's heart would be a
confusing mixture of emotions right about now.

On one hand, wanting to save <Kim Dokja's Company>, and on the other,
the desire to win in the 'Great War of Saints and Demons'.

Faint sparks were dancing all around her; Stories that made her who she
was, began colliding against each other. The Story that she loved the most,
and the Story she had been living with, were clashing with each other.

Was it <Kim Dokja's Company> she liked so much, or the one she
belonged to, <Eden>?

[Uriel! Why are you standing around stupidly like that?]
Her indecision prompted other Constellations to step forward; they were
unable to sit back and endure this situation any further.

[Constellation, 'Morning Star Goddess', has revealed her Status!]

[Constellation, 'The One Who Faces God', has revealed its Status!]

Han Sooyoung spat out a deep, painful breath rushing up to her throat and
frowned deeply.

[Your Incarnation Body has been damaged extensively.]

In all honesty, she tried to persuade Uriel not just because she didn't want to
fight the Archangel.

The adverse side effect of [Advent of Half-God] was already affecting her,
that was why. Every joint in her body was being paralysed, while she felt
like vomiting a huge amount of blood right now. The only reason why she
suppressed them all was to not display any weakness to these
Constellations, that was all.

[Constellation, 'Demon-like Judge of Fire', is looking somewhere else.]

Substituting for the dazed Uriel, Camael stepped forward, instead. He spoke
up. [My colleague seems to be in distress, so I believe that it'll be better for
us to wrap this up soon.]

[I expected much more because it was the Black Flame Dragon, but…
Compared to its Modifier, it's nothing much, isn't it?]

Vakarine's crystal staff containing starlight suddenly emitted bright light,
causing countless beams of starlight to rain down from the heavens above.
The Black Flame Dragon's shadow was gradually shaving away as the
beams of light touched it.

[Constellation, 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon', is roaring out in pure rage!]
The Breath fired out by the enraged Dragon's shadow poured down from
above Vakarine's head; she screamed in panic at the dark Ether rushing in,
and quickly retreated.

It was Camael who stepped forward to block that, however.

[This much is not going to be enough!]

Camael unsheathed a great sword and cut the Breath apart to advance
forward.

However…

"The darkest dark! The legend among legends! Fires of Red Flames!"

Han Sooyoung began spouting nonsense, and the Black Flame Dragon's
suddenly-amplified Breath began forcing back both Vakarine and Camael.

Vakarine's complexion paled as her coat burned up in an instant.

[How humiliating! Suffering from such a ridiculous technique…!]

[Uriel! What are you doing! You must regain yourself!]

Camael's true voice must've gotten through to her because Uriel seemed to
suddenly regain her wits just then. Han Sooyoung wiped away the streams
of blood and focused her blurring eyesight.

If Uriel decided to jump in wholeheartedly, then everything would be over.

Before that happened, she must…

[…Right, you're correct. This ■-up war must end quickly.]

And then, Uriel made her move.

[Constellation, 'Demon-like Judge of Fire', is revealing her true self.]
The blinding Status of an Archangel dyed the entirety of the battlefield; all
of Uriel's wings unfurled in full, and a crown with a crimson-red ruby
shimmered brilliantly above her flowing platinum-blonde hair.

Her emerald-coloured eyes proudly observed the world.

Uriel stepped forward while withstanding the incredible storm of
Probability's aftermath that came about after unleashing her true body.
When facing off against that boundless Status, Han Sooyoung felt her
consciousness waver despite the Black Flame Dragon's grace protecting
her. This was the true appearance of the 'Demon-like Judge of Fire'.

The Archangel of Conflagration that cut down tens of thousands of demons,
murdered Demon Kings, and eradicated all evil. The moment she saw those
eyes, Han Sooyoung realized that she was as good as dead already.

In front of that 'demon-like' existence, all 'Evil' would have to willingly
offer up their heads.

'Sorry, Kim Dokja'.

The [Flames of Retribution] rose up high to split the sky, and in the
meantime, Han Sooyoung sensed the approaching end for once.

[Story, 'Predictive Plagiarism', can't come up with what will happen next.]

And then, her vision was dyed in pure white. Like a completely blank page
with nothing on it.

However, no matter how long she waited, the expected pain never
materialised. Did she die even before she could experience pain?

She sneakily opened her eyes, only to be greeted by a completely
unexpected spectacle.

The [Flames of Retribution] that was definitely moving in her direction had
changed its shape to a ring and was emitting bright light on the ground.
[You, and you. Move an inch, and you'll die.]

More specifically, after it had tightly wound around the bodies of Vakarine
and Camael.

[My flames can get a bit hot, you see? I'm not kidding, so if you move a
muscle, you'll really die.]

Vakarine could only ask in a dumbfounded tone of voice at this sudden
development. [Uriel… But, why?]

[If you do something like this, the Scribe will…!]

Camael's words only made Uriel bitterly complain. [■ck. I'll just enjoy
some disciplinary actions or something later. You think that's important
right now?]

[This isn't simply going to end with some disciplinary action! What you did
was…!]

[Shut up! So what if those Chaos Points rise up or something?!]

Only after hearing Uriel's true voice did Camael realize that his companion
was being serious here.

[But you, why…]

It was at this point Han Sooyoung figured out why Uriel had to unleash the
power of her true self. If she were to subjugate another Archangel on the
same level as her, as well as a high-class Constellation without killing
them, she had no choice but to release her real power.

Uriel was suffering from tremendous pain of the Probability's aftermath;
and there was the faintest trace of demonic aura permeating into her dark
laces, too.

'Corruption'. The harshest punishment that would be bestowed upon her
after she refused to heed the divine order.
Just before Han Sooyoung could say something to her, Uriel took the
initiative away first. [I don't have time to explain this and that. Let's quickly
invalidate this regional conflict and end it!]

Her expression was really urgent for some reason.

It was at that moment that a thought entered Han Sooyoung's head.

Even if Uriel did make up her mind, there was no need for her to be this
urgent; if an Archangel was willing to deal with such a huge loss just to
start something, then there must be a very good reason for that. So, what
could possibly make her behave so urgently like this?

It wasn't that difficult to figure out the answer.

[My Heewon is in danger!]
              Chapter 395: Ep. 75 - A certain heart, II


"We can do this. We won't know it until we actually start fighting," said
Jung
Heewon exactly three hours ago. "Doesn't matter whether they are Demon
Kings or not, tell them to come. We aren't that weak anymore, right?"

The ones listening to her were the Reincarnators; the ones that chose 'Good'
during the past regional conflicts, as well as the lucky few that survived the
battlefields invalidated by <Kim Dokja's Company>.

These were people who had lost their worldview.

[117th regional conflict is commencing!]

[Your affiliated camp is 'Good'.]

"If I knew this might happen, I wouldn't have come…"

"…Can't we return to our old world?"
A few people began muttering in fear and the turmoil spread among the
crowd in an instant.

"H-how can we fight against something like that?!"

"Ah, aaaah…"

A ship of 'Evil' was surging in from the distance. It was massive. Without a
doubt, it was a Story weapon equipped with incredible functionalities.

Ghi-eeeeehhk!

The waves supporting the massive ship and flooding in were actually a
great army consisting of 7th-grade demonkind, Dark Warriors. There were
so many that it was near-impossible to count them all. At a casual glance,
there had to be several tens of thousands.

It was a spectacle that couldn't be described as a mere regional conflict.

"Uwaaaaah-!!"

Jung Heewon saw the eyes of the Reincarnators filled with fear and thought
to herself.

She couldn't demand everyone to be brave here.

It was only obvious that they would be scared.

They lived their whole lives inside the cages of their worldview, only to be
used by the invaders from the outside. Demanding such people to be brave
was the very act of violence itself.

Jung Heewon wanted to tell them; tell them that they didn't have to fight,
that she'd do something to resolve this by herself, somehow.

"Everyone, hide behind me."

There was one man who spoke up for her heart, though.
"I shall block them."

He was one of her oldest companions, as well as a man who bravely met the
adversity <Kim Dokja's Company> ran into from the forefront.

"Can you stop that all by yourself?"

"Of course, that'll be impossible."

Seeing Lee Hyunsung's generous smile, her frustrated heart seemed to
loosen up just a little. He used to have a seizure just from a simple touch of
a fingertip, but at this moment, she sensed that they had grown really close.

"Let's decide on our roles. I'll be in charge of taking on all the attacks.
Heewon-ssi, you should…"

"It's to attack, yes? Just like back in Kaizenix."

Back in the Kaizenix Archipelago, there were times when they fought
alongside each other like this. They shared memories of fighting against the
marauding invaders.

The toughest shield and the sharpest sword of <Kim Dokja's Company>.
Although simple, this tactic best optimised their individual strengths and
weaknesses.

"Shall we get going?"

[Story, 'Sword and Shield', has begun its storytelling.]

The first one to dash forward was Lee Hyunsung.

"Haaaaaaahph!!"

As befitting of a man believing in the superstition of 'the louder the roar, the
stronger one gets', he yelled out loudly enough to shake the world and
clashed against the dark waves.
[Incarnation Lee Hyunsung is activating Stigma 'Steel Transformation
Lv.10'!]

The steel carapace that had reached their maturity now covered his entire
body. The Dark Warriors colliding with the steel outer layer gleaming in
the bright white glare fell down like bowling pins and got crushed to death.

[Incarnation Lee Hyunsung is activating Stigma 'Great Mountain Smash
Lv.10'!]

His fist of steel rising up into the air powerfully slammed down on the
ground – the waves created by Dark Warriors wobbled about precariously,
causing the ship's movement to become dull, as well.

Not missing that opportunity, Lee Hyunsung activated his final Stigma.

[Incarnation Lee Hyunsung is activating Stigma 'Great Mountain Push
Lv.10'!]

It was a Stigma that could only pry open the stuck door of a subway in the
beginning. But now, that very Stigma was allowing him to push back
against a vessel the size of a battleship.

Tsu-chuchuchuchut!

Both of his hands currently covered in [Steel Transformation] were dyeing
in a pitch-black colour, and a portion of the carapace covering his body was
stripped away. However, Lee Hyunsung spat out another loud yell and
endured the pain.

"Haaaaaaahph!!"

He didn't back off even when subjected to the deluge of sparks.

His back leg dug deep into the ground below, and from afar, he resembled a
small nail stuck to the ground. But that small nail was successfully stopping
the forward movement of that battleship.
"It, it stopped!"

"Lee Hyunsung-nim has stopped the warship!"

The Reincarnators cheered on at this unbelievable miracle.

Unfortunately, the real battle would only begin from now on. The shield
had done its job, so it's now time for the sword to do hers.

Jung Heewon soared high into the air after stepping on Lee Hyunsung's
shoulders and landed on the ship's deck, before swinging the [Sword of
Judgement] around.

[Kuwaaahk!]

She unleashed the combination of [Demon Slaying] and [Hellfire]. She
didn't hold back at all, and a Historical-grade Constellation caught off guard
was killed off instantly, its Incarnation Body blowing up completely.

Jung Heewon scattering the bluish ghostly flames and emitting pure-white
light looked utterly noble, virtuous.

[A portion of Constellations like the 'Sword and Shield' story.] Kka-

gagagak!!

Unfortunately, it didn't take long for her sword to be stopped.

The culprit was a hand seemingly draped in a dreary black hue. A being
cackling ominously had grabbed onto her sword, before throwing her away
in the air.

She stepped on the air and spun around to land back on the deck safely.

Before her stood Constellations that already had created a battle formation.

Ku-gugugugu!

No, they weren't Constellations.
[Looking at the accursed Stigma, you must be the Incarnation of that
'Archangel'.]

[You must've known that this was a trap, yet… How foolish. To think that
you'd willingly step forward towards your own demise.]

They were completely enveloped in the pitch-black demonic aura; the
beings that occupied the darkness within the skies of the <Star Stream>.

Jung Heewon studied the five Demon Kings standing before her.

– This is a list of beings that you should be able to fight, as well as those
youshould never, Heewon-ssi. Please, you must memorise their
appearances no matter what.

She desperately recalled the contents of Kim Dokja's explanation.

The first Demon King her eyes shifted over to was the creature holding a
flaming spear and a head of a person.

– This guy is someone you can fight. If it's the current you, Heewon-
ssi,activating [Hour of Judgement] should suffice.

The master of the 58th Demon Realm, 'President of Flames', Amy.

– As for this guy… it'll be fine. However, if he suddenly raises up his
hornand pounces on you, things will get dangerous, so attack him first
without hesitation.

The master of the 48th Demon Realm, 'Golden-horned Ox', Haagenti.

– It'll get dangerous from this guy onwards. When you're at your
peakcondition, and when you can fight one on one, only then try to fight it.

The master of the 36th Demon Realm, 'Silver-clawed Owl', Stolas.

Judging from the leaking Status, she could feel it – up until this guy, she
could somehow fight them.
The problem was with the other two staring at her from behind the front
three. First of all, the handsome Demon King looking at her, wearing red
armour and a limp in one leg.

– Honestly speaking, your chances of winning are slim when we enter
thetop 20s. If Uriel was to perform 'Advent of Half-God', then things might
be different, but…

The master of the 16th Demon Realm, 'Demon King of Seduction and
Infertility', Zepar.

– And from here onwards, you must unconditionally avoid these guys.

She didn't need a reminder to understand it – the very last being at the back
of the formation of the five Demon Kings, silently observing the unfolding
situation. That was a being that the current her could never win against.

The master of the 8th Demon Realm, 'Merciless Hunter Against the Will of
Heavens', Barbatos.

The Demon King with a cowboy-style hat and carrying a rifle was smiling
at her through its cascading blonde hair.

[The tastiest despair is the 'impossible hope', indeed.]

Jung Heewon burned her fighting spirit and tightened her grip on the sword.

She had already fought against Demon Kings. Back then, she was not in a
condition to exhibit all of her abilities, but… What would it be like now?

[Exclusive skill, 'Hour of Judgement', is getting ready to activate!]

Her Attribute was 'Judge of Evil'.

It was the power of the Archangel that led the Valkyries in the past 'Great
War of Saints and Demons'.
No matter how powerful her opponents were, she'd still not lose as long as
they were 'Evil'.

Unfortunately…

[Majority of the Absolute Good-type Constellations are opposing the
activation of the skill.]

[Skill activation has been cancelled.]

Barbatos began laughing as if it already knew what was happening to her.

[How naïve, oh, Incarnation of Uriel. Do you still not understand what your
current situation is?]

Kim Dokja said that this 'regional conflict' was a trap.

He said that, even if they knew, they still had to participate in it.

[Angels enjoy the concept of the 'sacrificial lamb'. And it seems that you'll
be it this time.]

The goal of <Eden> was to win the 'Great War of Saints and Demons'.

And to achieve that goal, <Kim Dokja's Company> must not exist. Whether
Jung Heewon was 'Good' or 'Evil', she was simply someone to dispose of
from their perspective.

She already knew all of that. That didn't mean it felt real to her even now,
though.

'…I don't know about other angels, but even Uriel betrayed me?'

[I shall send you away peacefully.]

She heard Barbatos's rifle being cocked. Just as she sensed the back of her
neck suddenly grow cold, Jung Heewon threw herself outside the ship.

Ku-waaaaaah!!
The bullet fired in the air tore through the fabric of time and space to
puncture a black hole in the sky.

Her hand gripping the sword trembled slightly. She was about to throw
herself into a fight against such a monster just now.

– Regardless of what, you must never try to fight a Demon King ranked
tenth or higher one-on-one. You must run away without hesitation. And
wait for the rest of your companions to arrive. You must remember this.

In any other normal circumstances, she'd have gone against his words.
However, it was a different story right now.

"Hyunsung-ssi!"

Lee Hyunsung, busy smacking away the Dark Warriors to death at the front
of the pack, looked up at her falling body. That quick exchange of their
gazes was enough for him to figure out the current situation of the battle.

The ridiculing voices of the Demon Kings resounded out.

[Hahahaha! You made a wise decision.]

[Indeed, this battlefield is vast. However, how long will you be able to run
away?]

A violent tempest of demonic aura raged on in the sky.

The sword and the shield ran.

It was impossible to fight against the enemies they couldn't even stand
against. And they also couldn't afford to die here.

"Dokja-ssi and Yoo Joonghyuk-ssi will arrive soon. Let's hold out until
then."

Jung Heewon nodded her head. No matter how powerful their enemies
were, as long as the company had gathered in one place, they should be able
to overcome them. They had broken past battles even worse than this one
before. <Kim Dokja's Company> would not crumble in this place.

The two of them took care of the injured Reincarnators and continued to
crush the advancing 'Dark Warriors' while withdrawing their battle lines.

[Influence of your sponsor is weakening.]

To make matters worse, even Uriel's blessing had weakened. Her mind
cooked up only the worst-case scenarios, but Jung Heewon shook her head
to get rid of them. Most likely, Uriel must've been fighting in a different
regional conflict; there was simply no way that her sponsor would betray
her.

A frenzied true voice of a Demon King swept across the battlefield next.

[Get out of the way, trash!]

Reincarnators that lost their chance to run away were slaughtered in droves
everywhere.

The brave ones trying to fight back were the first to lose their heads, while
those backing away in terror had their hearts pierced through.

However, there were still some who could endure against the power of a
Demon King to put up a fight.

[Hoh-oh, a Swordmaster, is it? You're a pretty good fighter.]

Someone was defending against Haagenti's golden horn.

The Ether Blade coated this man's sword. The old man holding this weapon
was someone Jung Heewon knew very well.

"…Kyle?"

Kyle Berthe.
He was the top-ranked guardian knight that accompanied her during
'Kaizenix Archipelago'.

⸢Captain, it's been my honour to serve you.⸥

⸢Actually, I'm too old to step into the outside world, but…⸥

⸢I sincerely wish that my measly strength can become at least some kind of
aid to you in that place.⸥
Kyle fought well. He managed to deflect Haagenti's horn several times, and
he even inflicted a small nick on the arm of the bovine Demon King.

But, that was as far as he could go.

The Swordmaster's blade broke, and he went down on his knees. From the
beginning, his opponent was not someone an aged Swordmaster could fight
against.

His throat was captured and he was lifted up like a toy.

[Character, 'Erich Striker', is getting agitated.]

Erich's emotions rose up within Jung Heewon.

At this rate, Kyle would die. Her thoughts moved lethargically; the names
of <Kim Dokja's Company> members brushed past her mind.

The first one she thought of was Yoo Joonghyuk.

⸢"Reincarnators will revive even if they die."⸥

He'd not have tried to save Kyle. The 'Isle of Reincarnators' didn't permit
death, after all. One might lose their memories and become a different
existence, but nevertheless, the soul would carry on. So, he'd let Kyle die
for the sake of the bigger picture.
The next one to pop up in her head was Kim Dokja.

⸢We should save him. But, if you do that, you'll die instead, Heewon-ssi.⸥

Kim Dokja might say the right things, but because he was worried about her
life, he'd turn a blind eye to Kyle's plight.

⸢Why are you in a dilemma? Use that guy to smack the Demon King to
death. Simple.⸥
Han Sooyoung would say something similar to that. Well, she never was all
that interested in saving people's lives from the beginning, anyway. In order
to end the absolute-worst situation in the best possible circumstances, she'd
directly aim for the Demon King's neck by now.

And then, the dying Kyle's lips were mouthing the following words.

'Please, run away'.

However, his eyes were saying something else.

⸢Please… Save me.⸥

"Heewon-ssi."

She heard Lee Hyunsung's voice next.

She and he were the most similar out of everyone in <Kim Dokja's
Company>.

Sure, their personalities and adaptabilities might be different, but at least
when it came to a certain type of situation, they would always come to the
exact same decision.

[Exclusive skill, 'Hellfire Lv.10' is activating!]

There was no need to even hesitate here.
Because they too, were saved in the same manner in the past.
              Chapter 396: Ep. 75 - A certain heart, III


In that brief moment, the gazes of these two met each other.

⸢"Everyone knows how to deal with Demon Kings, right?"⸥

They carried the same pain, and they lived with the same hurt.

They had lost people they cared about right before their eyes.

⸢"Let's begin the final scenario."⸥

They had failed to save their companions many times over.

And that was why they could never turn their backs on the people dying
right in front of them.

The lives they had lived so far made sure of that.

"Let's go!"
Jung Heewon lightly jumped up and landed on Lee Hyunsung's hand, and
he powerfully threw her forward.

She flew like a streak of light and crossed the battlefield. The flames of
[Hellfire] drew a stylish arc in the air and shot forward, causing the Demon
King Haagenti to gasp out in pain.

The creature quickly put out the fire that managed to slice apart a portion of
its flesh and roared out viciously in reply. [So, that's where you've been
hiding!]

Haagenti didn't dally any longer and dashed forward while raising a thick
cloud of dust.

"Kuwahhhph!"

As Lee Hyunsung grabbed Haagenti's horn to start wrestle with the
creature, Jung Heewon began shaking the unconscious Kyle.

"Kyle! Get a hold of yourself! Kyle!"

It was as if she had reverted back to being Erich Striker; she desperately
called out Kyle's name. She placed her hand near his nose and much to her
relief, found out that he hadn't died yet.

⸢"Let's try one more time with the scenario…"⸥

These people came this far after they heard her voice and the words of
<Kim Dokja's Company>. They followed after her in order to find their
own stories.

That was why she simply couldn't let them die here.

"Allow me to take him away."

With good timing, guardian knights approached her and one of them placed
Kyle on his back.
"I'll leave him to your care."

"Please, leave him to us."

The knight nodded his head solemnly and quickly ran towards the back of
the battlefield. She then grasped her sword tighter, planning to help Lee
Hyunsung. But then, right at that moment…

…A chilling premonition tickled her entire figure.

She had never felt such a thing before in her entire life.

Not even when she was about to lose Kim Dokja in the [Dark Castle], not
when she lost him one more time back in the 73rd Demon Realm, and
then…

"Heewon-ssi! Get down!!"

At the same time, Lee Hyunsung bear-hugged her and rolled down on the
ground. A thin ray of light brushed past her forearm. It was at that moment
that she finally realized such a terrifying scream could come out of her own
mouth.

It was a bullet fired by Barbatos.

Lee Hyunsung's complexion had changed to pale blue; even before she
could ask him if he was alright, he spoke to her first. "You should evacuate
first. I'll try to buy you some time."

He stopped the advancing Haagenti with both of his hands, and he caught
the burning spear thrown by Amy in the distance with his teeth. Even when
subjected to the intense heat that melted his tongue and cooked his eyeballs,
Lee Hyunsung endured it with nothing more than his unyielding,
indomitable spirit.

– Hurry!
He sent a voice projection, the skill that connected her to Lee Hyunsung
when they were still stuck inside 'Kaizenix Archipelago'. With that very
skill, he was talking to her.

– I can still withstand this! But I won't be able to while trying to protect
you,as well!

Back then, or now; Lee Hyunsung always insisted that he could do things
he couldn't possibly do. That was why Jung Heewon couldn't escape.

She deflected the incoming silver-coloured claws of Demon King Stolas
and gritted her teeth. The flames of [Hellfire] were progressively getting
weaker, and cracks on Lee Hyunsung's carapace grew larger and more
numerous.

The 'Demon King of Seduction and Infertility' Zepar laughed. [What a sad
fate this is. But, I do enjoy a tragedy like this.]

"Shut up."

[A few Constellations are tearing up at the story of the Incarnations.]

Jung Heewon desperately wielded her sword so that she could leave behind
definite proof of their lives not being some stories of entertainment for the
others.

Reincarnators running away watched their struggle.

To save them, Jung Heewon and Lee Hyunsung fought.

[Influence of the Nebula, <Kim Dokja's Company> is growing larger.]

[Foundation of 'Great War of Saints and Demons' is being rocked.]

For the first time ever, the Demon Kings basking in a relaxed air changed
their expressions.

[It's regretful that we can't enjoy this anymore.]
And for one more time, another blackish beam of light exploded forth. The
bullet tore through space and flew forward. It was Barbatos's speciality,
[Star Destruction Bullet].

It couldn't be dodged this time.

Jung Heewon crouched into a huddle, trying to minimise the potential area
of damage, only for someone to cover her. Along with the sensation of a
dull, heavy impact, she heard something exploding away.

BLAM!

The bullet didn't end with just one.

BLAM!!

The first one, then the second, and another; bullets fired one after the other
blew up, broke, and destroyed 'something'.

[Story, 'Purest Companionship', is getting agitated.]

Jung Heewon struggled desperately and hugged the person protecting her to
roll around on the ground. It was a person's body, torn to bits by the bullets.
A bloodied face was smiling towards her. He was saying something, but
slowly, so slowly, he closed his eyes.

[Story, 'Sword and Shield', has stopped its storytelling.]

"Hyunsung-ssi?"

[Constellation, 'Master of Steel', has received great damage.]

"Hyunsung-ssi, please wake up."

As if they had reached the intermission, the gunfires came to a halt just
then.

Something inside her head snapped in that moment. Jung Heewon shook
Lee Hyunsung one more time.
"Hyunsung-ssi."

He didn't open his eyes. His lips didn't say anything, and his nose didn't
breathe anything out. His ears couldn't hear anything, either.

"Get up!!!"

But, she hadn't given him her answer yet.

"Get up! Get up already!!"

And then… the Demon Kings began moving again.

Jung Heewon quickly hoisted Lee Hyunsung's large body up and ran, hard.
She ran at the fastest speed she had ever produced before. She ran fast and
hard enough that muscles in her legs tore up and her heart began straining
itself. The gunfire soon resumed, and scars accumulated on her body.

However, she still continued to run. She continued to escape from
everything in this place.

If it was Kim Dokja; if it was him, he should be able to save Lee Hyunsung.

He saved Shin Yoosung, and he also managed to save Yoo Sangah, too. So,
he'd be able to save Lee Hyunsung for sure.

Death was nothing in this place.

Death could not separate them.

Jung Heewon ran as tears streamed down her face. Although it was nothing
more than buying time, that time was critical in changing everything.

So, she ran. And, she ran some more. How long did she run like that? Her
vision grew blurrier and eventually, she collapsed into a puddle of mud.
The putrid stench of dead Reincarnators filled up the landscape. There
wasn't a drop of energy left in her body.

As for Lee Hyunsung's heartbeat, she couldn't hear it anymore.
[Incarnation of Uriel, where are you hiding?]

She sensed the presence of Demon Kings approaching closer and held her
breath. Whether it was due to luck or not, her current Status had been
broken to an unrecognisable degree right now and it was difficult to
differentiate her from the other Reincarnators.

[If you don't want to come out, then well, we'll just kill the rest.]

Demon King Amy laughed and began swinging its flame spear.

There were still many surviving Reincarnators around her. They were
people Jung Heewon should be saving. They were people she should have
saved.

She squeezed her eyes shut.

'I'm sorry'.

Her sense of righteousness could only extend this far.

She heard the flames of explosions roaring on, and began picturing the
scenes she'd see after opening her eyes again.

The sights of the Reincarnators being burnt to death, demolished, and
blown up; the faces of the dying, filled with resentment towards her; their
expressions as they pointed fingers at her while trying to run away.

Jung Heewon prayed; she prayed that at least one more would manage to
run away. Even if it was only by a little further away, to endure until Kim
Dokja arrived.

"Here she is!"

And then, someone shouted out.

"I am Uriel's Incarnation, Jung Heewon!"
She opened her eyes in a fluster; the person who said that was someone she
knew very well. It was none other than knight Kyle, the one she saved not
too long ago.

And next to him was the knight that carried the injured Kyle away.

"No, I'm Jung Heewon!"

"No, it is I! I am she! Come and kill me instead!"

[…You bastards, have you all gone mad as a group?]

Reincarnators weren't running away.

Those that came along with her from the 'Kaizenix Archipelago', those she
managed to save during other regional conflicts, they were all standing by
her side to shout at the top of their lungs.

"I'm Jung Heewon!"

"I'm Lee Hyunsung!!"

Reincarnators stood up and spoke her name, and Lee Hyunsung's, as if it
was theirs. Even though they knew what would happen if they did.

"I'm Yoo Joonghyuk!"

Everyone here was staring at their own death.

"I'm Kim Dokja!"

"I'm Han Sooyoung!!"

They called out the names of their saviours, the names of <Kim Dokja's
Company>.

"I'm Jung Heewon!"
As if this was the righteousness they all decided to adhere to. Or, as if to
become the gods that would save them in turn, instead.

"Uwaaaah!!"

After crying out her name, Kyle began dashing towards the nearest Demon
King. Reincarnators running away in the opposite direction were now
coming back.

Some were in tears, some were in a rage, while some were in despair.
[Influence of <Kim Dokja's Company> in the applicable scenario is
strengthening even further!]

The Demon Kings became flustered and began unleashing their Statuses.

[How dare these insane fools…!]

Reincarnators were being ripped to shreds right before her eyes.

They couldn't even endure a light nudge from a Demon King. Even then,
they didn't stop shouting out. Some cried out Jung Heewon's name, while
some, Lee Hyunsung's. Some called out Kim Dokja's name while flinging
themselves into the embrace of death.

Trapped within this battlefield of complete pandemonium, Jung Heewon
began shuddering.

Why were they being killed off like this?

She looked at the collapsed Lee Hyunsung below, before casting her glare
up at the darkened skies of the <Star Stream>. Countless stars were looking
down at her.

Even though there were so many sparkling stars up there…

…Not one came down to help her.

Jung Heewon rose up from her spot.
"…I."

And then, she ran towards the Demon Kings.

"I am Jung Heewon!!"

[So, that's where you were!]

Claws flew in and scratched her back before going away.

[You have requested the activation of the exclusive skill, 'Hour of
Judgement'!]

Even if it's just this once, doesn't matter who it is – as long as they can lend
me their strength…

[Majority of the Absolute Good-type Constellations are opposing the
activation of the skill.]

[Skill activation has been cancelled.]

Why couldn't those she desperately wanted to, be judged?

What was 'Good', and what was 'Evil', then?

"…What rubbish is this 'Absolute' crap?"

Why are you arbitrarily deciding on that?

And why am I supposed to abide by it?

Barbatos's bullet flew in.

Her worn-down emotions became the kindling that began burning fiercely.

[All of your Stories are reacting to your misfortune.]

Every single one of her emotions was now pointing towards just one.
[All of your Stories are reacting to your will.]

And that was 'revenge'.

[<Star Stream> is now looking at your Story.]

⸢I wish to judge them all.⸥

[New Story is germinating within you!]

In the next moment, powerful rays of light exploded out from her entire
body.
The enormous explosion of light forced the trajectory of [Star Destruction
Bullet] off course, and at the same time, the Demon Kings in the near
vicinity were pushed back, as well.

Jung Heewon then heard the messages entering her ear.

[Evolution of Incarnation Jung Heewon's Attribute is approaching.]

[Opportunity to evolve your Attribute has come!]

The 'one who shrunk away' once upon a time became 'Judge of Evil' in
order to pass judgement on all the evils she encountered.

In that case, what would happen to the judge who was betrayed by 'Good'?

[You have acquired a legendary Attribute.]

An aura of brilliant white light exploded out from her sword; the boiling,
overflowing energy of the Story was released from her entire figure. And
then, the Ring of Chaos materialised within Jung Heewon's eyes as she took
in the sight of the Demon Kings.

[You have become 'Judge of Destruction'.]
              Chapter 397: Ep. 75 - A certain heart, IV


[Skills are evolving due to Attribute's evolution.]

[Exclusive skill, 'Demon Slaying', is evolving to 'God Slaying'!]

[Exclusive skill, 'Hour of Judgement's' activation criteria is being
modified!]

Jung Heewon looked down at both of her hands, currently covered in the
blinding aura. One hand was dyed in the pure-white light, while the other,
pitch-black.

['Isle of Reincarnators' is looking at you.]

The ones cheering her on were no longer the Constellations.

[Inhabitants of 'Isle of Reincarnators' are looking at you.]

No, it was people she had protected until now.

Demon Kings began glaring at Jung Heewon in utter disbelief.
[…Her Attribute has evolved?]

[Not bad. I see that the scenario has bestowed its grace unto you.]

However, they didn't seem to be panicking; no matter what, Jung Heewon
was still an Incarnation, someone who couldn't borrow Uriel's powers or the
blessings of <Eden>.

But regardless of all that, she still took a step towards the Demon Kings.

[Exclusive skill, 'Hour of Judgement', is activating!]

Haagenti caught onto what she was trying to do and began laughing in
derision. [You still haven't wisened up yet. Doesn't matter what your
Attribute evolves into, the Archangels will never lend their powers to you.]

Skill [Hour of Judgement] needed to borrow Probability from the Absolute
Good, so without the permission of the applicable Constellations, it could
not be used.

However, a string of strange messages suddenly popped out of nowhere.

['Hour of Judgement' no longer requires the consent of the Constellations on
the side of Absolute Good.]

['Hour of Judgement' no longer needs to borrow Probability from the
Nebulas on the side of Absolute Good.]

[Constellations on the side of Absolute Good are greatly flustered by
Incarnation Jung Heewon's change.]

"I don't need to get their stupid consent anymore," said Jung Heewon, now
neither 'Good' nor 'Evil'. "We decide who will be judged from now on."

Sparks danced wildly around her figure as she gripped the [Sword of
Judgement]. Demon King Haagenti took several steps back, almost
reflexively, after sensing her suspicious aura.
[What is this…??]

[Exclusive skill, 'Hour of Judgement', is receiving the blessing of <Kim
Dokja's Company>.]

[Voting rights have been distributed to the members of <Kim Dokja's
Company>.]

[A portion of the members are unable to participate in the voting.]

[Only the members that can, will participate in the voting.]

And then, the voting began.
[Incarnation, 'Lee Jihye', agrees with the judgement.]

[Incarnation, 'Shin Yoosung', agrees with the judgement.]

[Incarnation, 'Lee Gilyoung', agrees with the judgement.]

[Incarnation, 'Jung Heewon', agrees with the judgement.]

[All members able to participate have agreed with your judgement.]

Jung Heewon looked at the collapsed Lee Hyunsung.- at his cold,
unmoving body. This judgement would be for him.

Tsu-chuchuchut!

['Hour of Judgement' has activated!]

[Activation time will be curtailed due to an insufficient number of members
participating in the vote.]

[Your physical abilities will transcend the scenario's Probability for the next
4 minutes!]

[All of your Stories will transcend the scenario's Probability for the next 4
minutes!]

And her blade moved. With a speed that not even Demon Kings could
catch, in order to judge the ones she desperately wanted to judge.

At that moment, she thought that everything besides her had come to a
standstill.

They referred to themselves as stars, with such low speed?

Haagenti was blinking its eyes in sheer disbelief.

An enormous amount of Probability was spent and sparks exploded forth in
the air, perhaps to provide proof of Jung Heewon having judged 'something'
at this very moment.
[Uh, euh, keok…?]

Haagenti's heart, cut out from its body, was now palpitating on top of the
blade of the [Sword of Judgement].

Jung Heewon was bathed in the spray of the dying Demon King's blood.
She slowly opened her lips. "None of you will return alive."

She was given four minutes. But, that was plenty enough time for her.

Haagenti's head flew off along with the rising fountain of blood.

[Demon King, 'Golden-horned Ox', has died.]

[Demon King, 'Golden-horned Ox', has been defeated in the regional
conflict.]

The 'President of Flames', Amy, muttered in sheer astonishment. […
Haagenti??]

She exhibited the power capable of killing the 48th-ranked Demon King in
one hit. No Demon King alive had seen such a feat achieved by a measly
little Incarnation until now.

[But, such insane Probability can't be allowed…!]

Demon Kings now found themselves in the pit of sheer shock and couldn't
shut their slack jaws.

A tragedy for one side would become a farce for the other.

Reincarnators had been forced back by the overwhelming might of the
Demon Kings until then, but now, they began throwing themselves at the
miracle taking place right before their eyes.

"Let's go!"

"We can win this! Let's join forces!"
"Protect Jung Heewon-nim!"

Demon Kings watched the Reincarnators rushing towards them and roared
out in anger.

Jung Heewon had vanished from her spot by then; she reappeared like it
was some sort of magic, and the afterimage of her blade shattered Amy's
spear.

Craaaack!!

The Demon King witnessed its spear of flames that couldn't be broken by
any known object shatter into pieces, and its eyes shot wide open.

And along with its wide-open eyes, Amy's world came to a crashing end
with another single attack.

[Demon King, 'President of Flames', has died.]

[Demon King, 'President of Flames', has been defeated in the regional
conflict.]

It was an obvious result. Even the 48th-ranked Haagenti had died in a single
hit, so there was no way that the lower-ranked Amy could withstand Jung
Heewon at this stage.

The vigour of the Reincarnators soared even higher, and the fighting spirit
seething within the battlefield climbed higher, as well.

Wooung… Wooung…

Jung Heewon ran forward while fighting against the pain severe enough to
seemingly burn her eyes. She cut down the pouncing 'Dark Warriors', and
then cut some more – for the sole aim of taking yet another Demon King's
head.

[Oh, Incarnation, you're truly naïve. You're simply borrowing the strength
of a single 'Nebula', are you not?!]
The master of the 36th Demon Realm, the 'Silver-clawed Owl', Stolas,
might have lacked noticeable combat prowess, but it was still one of the
Demon Kings possessing a great pool of knowledge.

It had caught the presence of the 'Ring of Chaos' within Jung Heewon's
eyes and cried out loudly. [That is the power of Chaos. A power that is
neither 'Good' nor 'Evil', birthed from the beginning of everything, and
originates from outside the scenarios! If you use that power-!!]

"Shut up."

Jung Heewon jumped up and ripped Stolas's wings off. The Owl Demon
King screeched in pain, and its silver-coloured claws pierced into her thighs
and shoulders. Torn flesh flung into the air as the attack that disregarded her
own safety continued on; broken Stories sprayed onto the ground like real
blood.

However, she paid no heed and wielded her sword. She swung it again and
again regardless of whether her innards spilt out or her cheeks were gouged
out; her thoughts were dominated by the singular mission of shattering the
head of the Demon King before her and to end its life for good.

And so, after the blink of an eye where she swung her sword around fifty or
so times, the head of a dead owl could be found in her grip.

[Demon King, 'Silver-clawed Owl', has died.]

[Demon King, 'Silver-clawed Owl', has been defeated in the regional
conflict.]

"Pant, pant…"

She had displayed the combat power capable of slaying three Demon Kings
all by herself.

[Many Constellations are astonished by Incarnation Jung Heewon's
strength!]
[Constellations on the side of Absolute Good find Incarnation Jung Heewon
to be ominous and unsettling!]

[Constellations on the side of Absolute Evil are scared of Incarnation Jung
Heewon!]

Stars of 'Good' and 'Evil' had divided the sky, and beyond the divide, there
were other gazes looking at her. They belonged to those beings that didn't
hold any prior interest in her.

[Outer Gods are paying attention to Incarnation 'Jung Heewon'.]

As she was bathed by the numerous gazes of the stars above, Jung Heewon
continued to move forward. There were currently two Demon Kings
remaining.

[…My apologies, but I don't enjoy such a situation. So, farewell.]

Those words belong to a certain Demon King who had been reciting a
lengthy incantation the moment Jung Heewon had gone through her
awakening.

[Demon King, 'Demon King of Seduction and Infertility', is leaving the
regional conflict after paying an enormous amount of Probability.]

She belatedly threw her blade at the creature, but the 'Demon King of
Seduction and Infertility' Zepar had already vanished from the spot by then.

She gnashed her teeth and shifted her gaze into the sky.

Now, only one Demon King remained.

[The supposed master of the 16th Demon Realm running away with his
tails between his legs because of a mere Incarnation. How shameful.]

It was the Demon King who murdered Lee Hyunsung, the master of the 8th
Demon Realm, the 'Merciless Hunter Against the Will of Heavens',
Barbatos.
Even when it had witnessed Jung Heewon's abnormal feats, Barbatos didn't
try to escape.

[Demon King, 'Merciless Hunter Against the Will of Heavens', is
unleashing its Status.]

Barbatos was actually able to match Jung Heewon's speed with [Hour of
Judgement] still active. It chose its actions just as quickly as her, and could
attack at the same time as her, too.

It fought in an unbelievably skilful and destructive manner; Jung Heewon
was getting pushed back little by little.

As if it was enjoying this, Barbatos laughed out. [Your Story is
destructively beautiful.]

As the fight wore on, Jung Heewon gradually realized how truly strong
Barbatos was – the Demon King hadn't been going all out until now.

This was the difference between one's spent lifetime, something she
couldn't hope to catch up to, no matter what.

Blood poured out from her punctured side. She used the flames of [Hellfire]
to singe the wound. Barbatos didn't miss this opening and kicked her in the
stomach.

She vomited out a mouthful of blood and managed to barely force herself
back up.

[One minute of 'Hour of Judgement' activation time remaining.]

Jung Heewon fixed her grip on the sword, her hand now showing the bones
underneath the skin.

'Is it impossible with the amount of time I've lived so far?'

[Blessing from <Kim Dokja's Company> has strengthened!]
Something began granting additional power to her in that state.

[Giant Story, 'Kaizenix Archipelago', is looking at you.]

It was the history she lived in.

[Constellation, 'Master of Steel', is looking at you.]

They were the ones who loved the same thing as her.

Claaaaang!

Jung Heewon held the sword with both of her hands and defended against
Barbatos's bayonet attacks.

Bayonet fighting – a man she knew was also proficient in it. ⸢You usually
yell out louder and louder the harder it gets in the military. After I yell out
every morning, I get that feeling that I will be able to endure the rest of the
day somehow.⸥

"Haaaaaahph!!"

Jung Heewon yelled out exactly like Lee Hyunsung. Barbatos's bayonet
pierced into her waist, but she gripped the weapon tighter so that it wouldn't
get pulled out. Along with the sound, "Pu-ook!" the bayonet penetrated
even deeper into her waist. Even then, she took another step forward.

⸢…Even I start things without a plan sometimes. It's not like I've calculated
everything beforehand, you know.⸥
She summoned forth her courage like Kim Dokja, and…

⸢You shouldn't be wielding it like that.⸥

…And, swung her sword exactly like Yoo Joonghyuk.

Slice!
[Sword of Judgement] sliced into a part of Barbatos's forearm.

[…Ah?]

The Demon King saw the fragments of Stories dyed in crimson hue explode
forth, and its brows quivered greatly.

In that moment, she thought she could hear Han Sooyoung's laughter.

⸢You know this too, right? The last one to laugh is the winner.⸥

Jung Heewon spoke, exactly like how Ha Sooyoung would've done. "If you
want my bones, I shall give them to you. If you want my heart, then I will
gladly hand it over."

Her attitude of not caring about what kind of attacks her body had received;
her method of fighting, solely focused on destroying her opponent.

"However, you will have to risk half of all your Stories."

All facets of the Stories she had pushed to their absolute limits began
glowing brightly now.

Barbatos fell into a fluster and backed away while firing a barrage of [Star
Destruction Bullets]. However, she easily evaded them all. The bullets
simply couldn't match her speed as she grew faster and faster. The storm of
Probability's aftermath was slowly rushing in to arrest her entire body.

Her hair began to turn snow-white, the price to pay for exceeding her own
Status. Even then, she didn't back down.

All she wished for was to kill this Demon King.

Jung Heewon's blade flashed like a ray of light and sliced Barbatos's left
wrist off.
It couldn't hold onto its rifle anymore and the Demon King spat out a
pained groan. It then quickly hopped onto the deck of the battleship it
brought to the battlefield earlier.

[I shall destroy you. I won't even leave behind any trace of you.]

Barbatos's battleship began advancing forward as it emitted chilling blue
light. Jung Heewon watched all this unfold as a smile floated up onto her
lips.

The fact that it judged fighting her without borrowing the power of that
[Story Weapon] was impossible, now that was exactly the same as
admitting its own defeat.

The Demon King must've realized it as well, because rage was filling up its
expression now.

[Be gone.]

Jung Heewon stabbed her sword into the ground and stood tall. If it was
possible, she'd like to destroy that ship, too.

[Activation duration of 'Hour of Judgement' has ended.]

Unfortunately, she no longer had any time left.

The battleship's eagle statue dyed in the greenish hue, and its cannons
began spitting out flames next, seemingly with enough might to sweep
away the entirety of this regional conflict region.

Jung Heewon pulled Lee Hyunsung's sagging body closer and hugged it.

Hyunsung-ssi.

I really did my best.

I don't have a single regret left now.

I was not wrong.
Even if my scenario comes to an end in this place…

…I have lived this moment the way it's supposed to be.

The once-lethargic perception speed gradually reverted back to how it was.
She didn't turn her gaze away from the battlefield and continued to stare at
the magic shells raining down.

Sadly, though, her vision continued to grow fuzzier and she couldn't see.

Without a doubt, she had poured everything out, yet why were tears coming
out only now?

As her vision grew blurrier, she began crying in great indignation.

How could she not have any regrets?

"…Why is everyone from our Nebula like this??"

Someone suddenly spoke out in a loud ringing voice.

[Constellation, 'Maritime War God', is furious!]

Jung Heewon was stunned by the indirect message coming from a familiar
Constellation and quickly wiped her eyes away. Since she hadn't closed
them, she was able to see the miracle taking place right before her.

Ku-gugugugu!

A battleship even larger than Barbatos's was now dominating the entire sky
above the battlefield.

[Someone has joined the 117th regional conflict!]

The ship had a turtle-like back made out of futuristic metal. And three
people she loved so much were riding on top of its figurehead.

Kuwaaaaah!
With excellent timing, Barbatos's bullet flew in. Jung Heewon reached out
with her hand in great urgency and called out.

"Avoid it!!"

Her cries were buried under the loud cannon fires.

She plopped down to the ground as the ripples from the explosion
swallowed up the whole battlefield.

On the spot where the thick smoke dissipated, the battleship stood proudly
with nary a single scratch.

[Influence of <Kim Dokja's Company> in the applicable scenario has
strengthened even further.]

Lee Jihye and the kids revealed themselves as the smoke of the battlefield
abated.

With a perfectly-still expression, Lee Jihye raised her sword.

"Load the cannons."
               Chapter 398: Ep. 75 - A certain heart, V


The Demon King and its stunned expression could be seen in the distance.

The hull of the ship was unscathed even after getting struck by the [Star
Destruction Bullet] fired by Barbatos.

The bullet capable of erasing even a star couldn't penetrate past that
turtlelike back shell.

[Incarnation, 'Lee Jihye', has begun her command.]

[Incarnation, 'Lee Jihye', has activated Stigma, 'Ghost Fleet Lv.10'!]

A ghostly armada of twelve ships used the approaching 'Dark Warriors' as
the waves and floated up. Soon after, their cannons began firing in unison.

Barbatos gnashed its teeth at the sudden barrage of cannon fire. [You dare,
with such measly little…!]

The Demon King's own battleship, [Nighthawk], was truly sturdy.
Although it wasn't assembled with futuristic cutting-edge technology, still,
it was a weapon created by painstakingly gathering Stories of the Demon
Realm. [Ghost Fleet] alone was insufficient to deal with this enemy.

However, Lee Jihye didn't panic. No, she simply observed her enemy with a
calm, composed expression.

Ku-gugugu!!!

As the [Ghost Fleet] continued its barrage, the reddish light was gathered in
the dragon-like figurehead of the ship covering the sky.

[Giant Story, 'Next City', has begun its storytelling!]

Jung Heewon looked up at Lee Jihye's current appearance.
She had no way of knowing how the latter managed to come here or what
sort of a worldview she had experienced. The one thing she was certain of,
though, was the knowledge that the trio of kids managed to survive
something just as harsh as the tragedy she had to live through in the
'Kaizenix Archipelago'.

[A ship built upon crude Stories dares to…!]

Barbatos's side finished charging up its attack first and fired it.

Kuwaaaaah-!!

The force behind the shot was at least double that of the previous attack. No
matter how strong Lee Jihye's battleship was, it wouldn't be easy to defend
against this particular [Star Destruction Bullet].

Four, five ships at the front of the [Ghost Fleet] couldn't endure against the
magical energy behind the attack and were extinguished immediately.

Even then, Lee Jihye calmly waited. Until that cannon shell moving at a
slow-but-assured speed reached right in front of her nose.

Just a little bit more. A bit more.

[Constellation, 'Maritime War God', is looking at his Incarnation.]

Fragments of Stories, scattering in the air, brushed past her cheeks.

And just before the Story of [Ghost Fleet], being destroyed one after the
other, could reach her and her two companions like a wall of white
bubbles…

Lee Jihye lowered her sword.

"Fire!!"
Everywhere was seemingly dyed in bright light. Violent, vicious rebound
rocked the hull. Strong winds wildly whipped her already-undone hair
about.

The Story's energy shooting out from the dragon head swept absolutely
everything away in the vicinity. The [Star Destruction Bullet] dyeing its
surroundings in darkness had been extinguished already.

[Many Constellations are suspicious of the applicable Story Weapon's
Probability!]

The Story Weapon, [Turtle Dragon].

That was the name of the weapon that the 'Maritime War God' had
commissioned when he came to visit the Next City a long time ago, but
didn't have the chance to collect it yet.

[Many Constellations can't close their jaws due to their great shock!]

Accompanied by a loud explosion, the sounds of something being
destroyed could be heard, along with a Demon King's horrible scream.

Lee Jihye issued another order. "Fire!!"

Her voice didn't waver in the slightest, as if to spit out all of her
accumulated grievances.

The [Ghost Fleet] re-emerged and began their simultaneous bombardment
once more, while the [Turtle Dragon's] main cannon also spat out another
round, as well.

"Fire!!"

Everything on the opposing side of the battlefield was gradually
disappearing – Barbatos's battleship, the Dark Warriors, everything.

All those hoping to convert Jung Heewon's and Lee Hyunsung's story to a
tragedy were now the subjects of Lee Jihye's wrath.
'Our Stories aren't for your entertainment', she said.

She wobbled slightly as the shelling continued on. However, she never
faltered once. She was no longer that girl who feared the ocean, but a
commander of this vessel.

"Fire!!"

Kuwaaaah-!!

Under the explosions of the energy created by the cannon barrage,
Barbatos's Status was steadily being erased.

And until every single one of the Demon King's Stories were completely
gone, Lee Jihye didn't let up with the bombardment, and ordered their firing
again and again.

Jung Heewon looked up at that spectacle.

That girl was clearly straining herself.

Tsu-chuchuchut!!

Sparks now filled up the battlefield. Two kids broke past the continuous
chain of explosions and landed on the ground. They were Shin Yoosung
and Lee Gilyoung.

"Heewon unni… Are you alright?"

"Noona!"

Aided by the kids, Jung Heewon carried Lee Hyunsung to the battleship,
and approached Lee Jihye at the deck still commanding the bombardment.

"Jihye-yah…"

[Constellation, 'Maritime War God', is exhausting his remaining energy
right down to his limit.]
Their opponent was a top-ranking Demon King. Even if they acquired a
[Story Weapon], even if they borrowed the Probability of <Kim Dokja's
Company>, and even after the Narrative-grade Constellation 'Maritime War
God' had come to help…

A price had to be paid in order to create a miracle like this.

"Jihye-yah, it's okay now."

Jung Heewon knew why Lee Jihye was so furious right now. The moment
she stepped into the battlefield, she had figured out what happened here.
And that was why she didn't hold back at all.

['Ghost Fleet' is returning.]

The scenario messages could be heard coming from the distance.

[Demon King, 'Merciless Hunter Against the Will of Heavens', has died.]

[Demon King, 'Merciless Hunter Against the Will of Heavens', has been
defeated in the regional conflict.]

It was a truly splendid feat achieved by only three Incarnations.

A Demon King ranked 8th in the rankings, as well as three others, had lost
their lives in this battlefield.

Indirect messages continued to stream in among the outpouring of cheers
from the Reincarnators.

[Constellations leaning towards Absolute Evil can't take their eyes away
from this unbelievable feat.]

[Constellations leaning towards Absolute Good are forming complicated
expressions.]

[Neutral-leaning Constellations are cheering on at this impossible battle.]

[Many Constellations are paying the cost of the impossible scenario.]
[A big player in the sponsorship community has sponsored a large amount
of coins.]

[1,100,000 Coins have been sponsored.]

Lee Jihye wiped away the blood trickling down from her nose and smiled
brightly. Even though she was smiling, she was crying, too.

"Unni."

[117th regional conflict has concluded.]

[Reward calculation for the 117th regional conflict has commenced.]

[Victors and losers exist in the 117th regional conflict.]

Jung Heewon stared up at those messages with dazed eyes.

['Good' has won in the applicable regional conflict.]
  [Current state of Great War's progress]

  Absolute Good Points: 68

  Absolute Evil Points: 67

  Chaos Points: 70


The 117th regional conflict didn't end in the way <Kim Dokja's Company>
had planned.

Well, Lee Jihye belatedly joining the battle didn't know of the plans their
Nebula had for the 'Great War of Saints and Demons', that was why.

However, it wasn't as if their plan had completely failed, either.

[Power of 'Chaos' intervened in the applicable battlefield.]

[Chaos Points have increased by 5.]

[Chaos Points have reached 75.]

[Chaos Points' rate of increase is speeding up!]

[Shadowy Outer Gods are calling out to Incarnation 'Jung Heewon'.]

[Foreign Gods beyond the galaxy are paying attention to Incarnation Jung
Heewon's Status.]

Jung Heewon looked at the Infinity symbol that had appeared on the backs
of her hands. She acquired them after awakening the new Attribute, 'Judge
of Destruction'.

Kim Dokja hadn't told her about this marking before.

"…Hyunsung hyung?"
The eyes of Lee Gilyoung checking for the sagging Lee Hyunsung's pulse
grew wider. Shin Yoosung was taken by surprise too, and hurriedly pressed
her ear to the unmoving man's chest.

Jung Heewon watched them and spoke in a suffering tone of voice.
"Hyunsung-ssi is…"

…Dead.

She couldn't finish her sentence, however.

Because she thought that it'd become reality if she ended up saying it.

[All regional conflicts have come to an end.]

[Scenario's Chaos Points have increased too much and the main scenario
has been updated.]

[Scenario jump has occurred.]

[Linked scenario has been generated!]

They weren't even given enough time to grieve. In the world of the <Star
Stream>, the scenario would never look back to the past, that was why.

[New main scenario has arrived!]
  <Main scenario #84 – 'Great War of Saints and Demons'>

  Type: Main

  Difficulty: Indeterminable

  Clear condition: Someone who's neither Absolute Good nor Absolute
  Evil has made the 'Good/Evil' of the battlefield unclear. The Oldest
  Good and the Oldest Evil wish for a definite conclusion. They have
  agreed to decide the outcome on one 'great battlefield'. If you wish to

  Time limit: -

  Reward: Giant Story related 'Great War of Saints and Demons', ???

  Failure: Death



[The 'great battlefield' of the 'Great War of Saints and Demons' is opening
up!]

[Victor of this 'great battlefield' will acquire 30 Good/Evil Points.]

"…What's this?"

Just as Lee Jihye muttered out in confusion, the regional conflict zone was
rocked by a dull, heavy tremor.

The voice of a Dokkaebi could be heard within the wild explosion of sparks
going 'Tsu-chuchut!'
[You must've been bored stiff by being confined to small battlefields,
haven't you? The real 'Great War of Saints and Demons' will start from now
on!]

The time and space torn asunder by the heavens and earth violently
convulsing began coalescing back into one.

By the time they opened their eyes, Jung Heewon and the kids found
themselves standing on a seemingly-endless vast plain.

The skies were dark and gloomy, while the reddish ground was filled by the
Story fragments and broken skulls of angels and demons that had rotted
away a long time ago.

This very location was where the final battle of the first 'Great War of
Saints and Demons' took place.

Constellations and Incarnations participating in other regional conflicts
began gathering here.

[Nebula, <Papyrus>, has joined the great battlefield!]

[Nebula, <Tamna>, has joined the great battlefield!]

[Nebula, <Hongik>, has joined the great battlefield!]

[Nebula, <Guardian Tree>, has joined the great battlefield!]

"…Hey, Shin Yoosung, over there…"

"It'll be fine. We levelled up plenty, didn't we?"

[Giant Story, 'Next City', is protecting the children.]

The gathered Status was so great that just by standing in this field made
their spirits falter. Jung Heewon couldn't even begin to fathom just how
many Constellations were participating in this great battle.
[A great number of Constellations are showing animosity towards <Kim
Dokja's Company>.]

Gazes that had actual form behind them could become dangerous.

Jung Heewon stood at the front of the group even though it was hard to
steady herself. She was from <Kim Dokja's Company>. And that was why
she couldn't display any weakness in front of those Nebulas.

Just as another wave of enormous Status was rushing towards her…

"Jung Heewon."

…Someone supported her from her back.

[Incarnation 'Han Sooyoung' has joined the battlefield!]

[Constellation, 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon', is threatening the
Constellations of this great battlefield.]

"You really look terrible. And what's the matter with your hair?"

"I don't think you're in any position to talk about someone else."

Jung Heewon smiled dryly, causing Han Sooyoung and her soot-covered
face to shoot back a glare. The former then saw the Constellation following
behind the latter.

"Uriel…"

[Constellation, 'Demon-like Judge of Fire', is looking at her Incarnation.]

Uriel, full of wounds, was looking back at Jung Heewon. There were faint
traces of turbid aura around her wings. The latter saw that, and almost
immediately felt relieved for some reason.

Uriel hadn't betrayed her. Only a brief exchange of glances was enough to
know that.
[Constellation, 'Demon-like Judge of Fire', is…]

"It's alright, Uriel."

The Archangel closed her mouth shut. Jung Heewon quietly observed her
Sponsor for a little while longer, before casting her gaze lower to the
ground.

They were a Constellation and an Incarnation; they didn't need to say
something to understand what was on each other's minds.

[Constellation, 'Demon-like Judge of Fire', is closing her eyes in pain.]

A humongous Gate opened up on the other side of the battlefield. Its size
was on another scale compared to the ones before.

[Nebula, <Eden>, has joined the great battlefield!]

Archangels and Valkyries entered the battlefield as the golden-coloured
horns blew noisily.

[Constellation, 'Guardian of Youths and Travel', is looking at Incarnation
'Jung Heewon'.]

[Constellation, 'Friend of Justice and Harmony', is sympathising with
Incarnation 'Jung Heewon'.]

[Constellation, 'Lily Blooming in Aquarius', finds it unfortunate what
happened with Incarnation 'Jung Heewon'.]

…

At that moment, Jung Heewon's irises, cast down to the ground, began
blazing once more.

Sympathy?

Utterly disgusting.
If only you people consented to the 'Hour of Judgement' earlier. If only…

[Constellation, 'Scribe of Heaven', has entered the great battlefield!]

The leader of <Eden> made his entrance under the brilliant, blinding light
show. Jung Heewon squeezed the [Sword of judgement] tight and glared at
Metatron.

As if they were waiting for this moment, the others began making their
entrance from the opposing Gate.

[Demon King, 'Ruler of East Hell', has joined the great battlefield!]

It was the Great Demon King Agares, 2nd in the rankings, as well as other
Demon Kings.

[Demon King, 'Black Mane Lion', has joined the great battlefield!]

[Demon King, 'Immeasurable Austerity', has joined the great battlefield!]

[Demon King, 'Devil of Lust and Wrath', has joined the great battlefield!]

The top-ranked Demon Kings didn't cower one bit from the auras of the
Archangels. As their numbers increased, the complexions of Jung Heewon
and the kids got poorer.

Only then did they realize what kind of a battlefield this was. They also
realized what kind of Nebulas they were about to face off against.

And finally, how small <Kim Dokja's Company> actually was.
[Constellations and Demon Kings of the great battlefield are glaring at
<Kim Dokja's Company>.]

There were countless strong enemies present.

As the threatening, intimidating auras of the Constellations aimed at <Kim
Dokja's Company> bore down on them, the members heard their own
breathing become heavier and quicker.
[Nebula, <Asgard>, has joined the great battlefield!]

[Incarnation, 'Anna Croft', has joined the great battlefield.]

Jung Heewon flinched and took a look behind to find Anna Croft looking at
her with both of her hands in the air.

"No need to be that wary. I'm not your enemy right now."

Just before she could ask what those words meant…

[Incarnation, 'Yoo Joonghyuk', has joined the great battlefield.]

A corner of the sky seemed to collapse and a man wearing a black coat
made his entrance.

He proudly stood tall; the viciously-screeching edges of the [Black
Heavenly Demon Sword] bared its fangs at the Constellations.

The ends of Han Sooyoung's lips twitched as she made her comment.
"Again. You're acting like the MC again."

"Master!"

It was only one person, yet the atmosphere of the battlefield seemed to
change simply from his appearance.

Yoo Joonghyuk scanned the companions and spoke. "With the exception of
one fool, everyone's here."

"No, everyone is here now."

That last voice belonged to the one they were all waiting for. Jung Heewon
didn't know what to do with the emotions suddenly welling up inside her,
but still, shifted her gaze over in his direction.

She wanted to tell him. She wanted to tell him what those bastards of
Constellations did in this place, but…
"I know, Heewon-ssi."

Kim Dokja kitted out in his white coat was silently looking at Lee
Hyunsung on the ground.

[Demon King, 'Demon King of Salvation', has joined the great battlefield.]
             Chapter 399: Ep. 76 - Book of Revelation, I


– Kugugugugu!

Inside the screen, Constellations of 'Good' and 'Evil' were emitting scary
auras towards each other. The taut tension was stretched firm like a rubber
band, ready to snap at any given moment. And it was the smallest, but also
bright, Nebula that managed to maintain the balance.

[It's been truly a long time since I last saw everyone from 'Good' and 'Evil'
gather in one place…]

The 'Mandala's Guardian', Sakyamuni, was looking at the screen with an
unreadable expression on his face. Ancient memories were flowing within
his irises.

The scenario before the scenarios, the era when 'Good', 'Evil', and the
keepers of neutrality were working together. The tale of everyone working
together to fight the Dragon of Apocalypse, in order to prevent the advent
of the apocalypse itself…

– I'd also like to help my companions.
Sakyamuni heard that voice and shifted his gaze towards a small cistern. A
small ball of soul glowing faintly was speaking to him while hovering
inside the tank.

– When will I able to reincarnate?

[That place isn't your battlefield, oh dear child. You shall reincarnate as
a being born to carry out an even greater purpose.] – They are my
purpose.

Even after becoming a soul, Yoo Sangah's voice remained resolute.

– If I don't get to save them in that place, then my reincarnation will have
nomeaning.

[Meaning, is it…]

Sakyamuni shifted his gaze again, this time to another cistern located on the
opposite side of Yoo Sangah's. There was a female Incarnation Body
wearing a Buddhist robe inside this one.

[You shall be entering the body of a child that I cared about.]

– I'll enter someone else's body? But, I thought I was going to reincarnate?

[You'll reincarnate with that body as your Incarnation Body.]

– But, what about the original owner of that body?

Sakyamuni didn't reply.

Would Buddha feel sorrow, as well?

Yoo Sangah realized something in that moment.

– Is that person your 'meaning'?
Without saying anything, Sakyamuni continued to observe the Buddhist
robe-wearing woman inside the cistern.

[She has returned to the providence of the cosmos, that is all. Everything is
simply an empty revolution of the wheel.]

– Is that really how you feel? You cared about her greatly, yes?

[You shall understand it soon enough, child. Becoming a Reincarnator is
precisely that, after all.]

– I'm not a Reincarnator yet.

[You'll soon realize that there is no meaning in being bound by such
shackles – in how everything you held dear was simply an exercise in
futility.] – …Is jinxing someone else your hobby?

[I only speak of the truth, dear child.]

Sakyamuni looked at the battlefield inside the screen once more.
Constellations that had lived for a very long time were in there.

[Constellations suffer from insomnia for all of their lives. They can't fall
asleep without the scenarios, and even when they dream, they still
ingurgitate the Stories of others. Through this greedy devouring, they wish
to erase the scenarios they find themselves in. And they feel anxious all the
time, even though they don't understand why they feel that way.]

The most ancient Constellation among all of them, Sakyamuni, continued
to speak. [As if they are stuck in the eternal daydream, they can't escape
from the scenario. They look away from death, so they don't know its true
meaning. And because they don't know death, they can't wake up from the
scenario's illusion. They all mistakenly believe that there is one story
somewhere that might save them.]

Constellations either sponsoring <Kim Dokja's Company> or being hostile
towards them were sending indirect messages inside the screen.
Sakyamuni slowly moved its gaze towards the middle of that busy screen.

[However, Reincarnators are different.]

That was where the Reincarnators from this island could be found.

They had followed after <Kim Dokja's Company>. And they were still
being forced to slave under the great Story after joining the side of either
'Good' or 'Evil'.

Sakyamuni looked at them and spoke. [Reincarnators will live on forever
like Constellations, but they must die and be reborn again. They know what
it means to awaken since they understand death, and because they know the
meaning of awakening, they also come to realize that they are simply a cog
in the scenario's machination. Reincarnation is to comprehend the scenario's
true essence.]

Reincarnators with low Status will lose their memories along with their
death, but that was not the case for everyone. There were some who
retained their former memories, like Nirvana, when they reincarnated. They
would reincarnate into various species and various genders and continue on
with the scenario.

As a human, as a toad, as an Orc, as an Elf, as an ant…

Most likely, they acquired those expressions after experiencing countless
reincarnations.

– They all seemed to have resigned themselves.

[That's because they understand nothing will change regardless of who
wins.]

– Scenarios can be changed. That's what we have been doing so far.

[However, that hasn't changed the fact that it's still a 'scenario'.]
– So, you must give up now? Because no matter what you do, the
scenariowill remain as a scenario? That's just you trying to run away. That's
the same as conceding defeat without even fighting first.

[Oh, dear child. You're now insulting the lives of the Reincarnators. They
have continuously fought against scenarios through their countless lives…]
– Have you ever fought with everything on the line, not giving up on a
single lifetime in the process?

Sakyamuni shut his mouth after hearing that question.

Not giving up on a single lifetime, she said.

Before he could reply, though, Yoo Sangah spoke first.

– There is a person who hadn't given up on his life even if it went past
1800times.

Yoo Sangah looked at the screen. There was a man wearing a black coat
within it.

– There's another person who had lived that life alongside him, too.

And then, a man wearing a white coat standing next to him was observing
his companions. His gaze stopped last at Lee Hyunsung collapsed on the
floor.

[This body has experienced a far-too extensive period of time to count the
numbers. However, there is one number that I can still count.] Sakyamuni
continued on as he looked at Lee Hyunsung. [One more will be added to
this island's Reincarnators.]




"Not yet."
I felt for the unmoving Lee Hyunsung's pulse. It wasn't beating. He wasn't
breathing either, and only whites could be seen after his eyelids were
opened.

"…Really?"

Jung Heewon looked at me with a face of someone wanting to believe in
miracles.

I looked at her whitened hair and guessed what had happened here.

"For sure, he's not dead."

My companions all carried complicated expressions. Lee Jihye seemed to
think that I was lying out of good intentions, while Gilyoung looked as if
he'd believe me even if I was really lying.

Han Sooyoung asked me. "Have you decided to change the definition of
death now?"

"If Hyunsung-ssi has died for real, then the 'Master of Steel' would've been
kicked out of the scenario, too."

I looked up into the sky. Although I couldn't hear any indirect messages to
that effect, the 'Master of Steel' hadn't been ejected out of this scenario.

Jung Heewon urgently grabbed my arm. "Then, why Hyunsung-ssi is…"

"Just like how you've awakened, Hyunsung-ssi has also awakened,
Heewonssi."

I shifted my gaze down to the faint fragments of a Story flowing on Lee
Hyunsung's skin, the Story of 'Steel'.

It was not visible from the outside, but his inside should be filled to the
brim with the Story of 'Steel' by now.

[Character, 'Lee Hyunsung', is on the verge of Attribute evolution.]
It was not for nothing that Lee Hyunsung was referred to as 'the Greatest
Shield' in the original story.

Protecting someone by sacrificing himself would let the 'Emperor of
Steelsword' to reach the final stage of the 'Steel Transformation'. By the
time he regains his consciousness, he should have become the world's
sturdiest shield.

Jung Heewon asked me in a trembling voice. "In, in that case, he's still
alive?"

"Yes."

"Is that the truth? You're not lying?"

Tears trickled down her collapsed cheeks. She then placed her hand on Lee
Hyunsung's chest. His heart wasn't beating. While feeling that indifferent
silence, she spoke again in some difficulty. "But, I can't hear anything…"

"It'll be like that from now on."

"…Pardon?"

I looked at Lee Hyunsung again.

His heart had hardened like steel boasting a 100% purity rating. It'd never
beat again. The current Jung Heewon wouldn't be able to understand what
that meant, though…

"However, Hyunsung-ssi is definitely alive. So, please, don't worry."

"In any case, he won't be of any use to us now," said Yoo Joonghyuk
indifferently as he unleashed his Status. "Every one of you, keep your
wits about you. This isn't the time to wallow in sadness." Kugugugugu!

Two camps glaring at our Nebula could be seen on the other side of the
battlefield. One camp was 'Good', while the other, 'Evil'. To us, they were
simply enemies, though.
The centers of those two camps were manned by 'Scribe of Heaven',
Metatron, and 'Ruler of East Hell', Agares.

[Who defeated Barbatos?]

That question caused the murmurings to spread out through the battlefield.

Barbatos, ranked 8th in the Demon King rankings, had died. However,
rather than looking stunned, the Demon Kings present carried entertained
expressions, instead.

[To think you'd interfere with the 'Great War of Saints and Demons', you all
have lost your minds.]

Their gazes, locked onto my companions, were filled with clear ridicule.
Their jeers were filled with the confidence of knowing that we'd not be able
to rely on luck to survive anymore, like how we'd been doing until now.

Their guesses were right; the members of <Kim Dokja's Company> were in
no shape to fight properly at the moment. Yoo Joonghyuk's magical energy
reserve had almost bottomed out from the fight against Indra, while Han
Sooyoung was also in an extremely fatigued state after fighting against the
Archangels.

There was no need to mention the collapsed Lee Hyunsung or the worn-out
Jung Heewon, either.

The ones that would prove to be helpful were the three kids who went to the
'Next City'.

"Ahjussi, don't you worry. I'll sweep them all away."

Lee Jihye pounding her chest while saying that, and Shin Yoosung nodding
her head along, instilled much confidence in me. Like how I imagined it to
be, they must've experienced incredible growth in 'Next City'. Even Lee
Gilyoung's eyes were sparkling brightly, as well.
"Hyung, who should we start killing first? Who will give us the highest
experience points?"

Even though we were in an overwhelmingly disadvantageous position, he
spoke as if he was playing a game.

[Incarnation Lee Gilyoung's sponsor is looking at you.]

I shook my head.

It was too early. It wasn't the time to utilise Lee Gilyoung yet. And even if I
did, there was no guarantee of victory.

Anna Croft next to me asked a question. "Are you really going to fight?
You must know that there is no hope of victory for you here, yes?"

It was rather obvious what she was aiming for as she asked that question.
She was already a part of the 'Good' camp. It'd prove to be the most ideal
outcome for her to stab me in the back if things go wrong and join that side.

"We've never enjoyed good odds of victory, anyway. And yes, I'm planning
to fight them, and I'm also confident of winning. As long as you don't
betray us, that is."

Anna Croft narrowed her eyes at the mention of betrayal and raised her
hand up. When she did, Selena Kim and Iris standing behind her took a step
forward.

[Nebula, <Asgard>, is backing <Kim Dokja's Company>.]

Constellations and Demon Kings shouted out in sheer astonishment.

[Asgard, have you lost your minds, too?]

[The god of hammers must've finally hit his own head.]

[Oh, the god of mischief! Are you perhaps planning to cause chaos in this
place?]
Even as the true voices were confusedly flying around, there were a few
who still broke out in a smirk as if the situation was unfolding in an
entertaining direction for them.

Such as, the fifth-ranked Demon King, 'Black Mane Lion', Marbas.

[What a foolish decision, oh dear <Asgard>. Your Nebula might be
powerful, but the number of Constellations participating is low. It is simply
far too inadequate to rock this battlefield!]

"It's not just one Nebula."

[Oh, then who else is there? <Kim Dokja's Company>? You really want to
call the small group with you as its sole Constellation, a 'Nebula'?]

Loud peels of laughter rang out among the Demon Kings. But then…

[Constellation, 'Father of the Rich Night', is icily glaring at the
Constellations.]

[Nebula, <Underworld>, is backing <Kim Dokja's Company>.]

…The laughter came to a sudden end.

[…The <Underworld>??]

[Oh, <Olympus>! What is going on?! Isn't that a subordinate Nebula of
yours?]

Along with those words, a corner of the battlefield opened up and
<Olympus> made their appearance.

As expected, they were participating in this scenario as well. The one
standing at their forefront was a Constellation we were quite familiar with.

[M-mm, this is troublesome… We can't re-enact 'Gigantomachia' in this
place, either.]
It was the 'God of Wine and Ecstasy', Dionysus, carrying a deeply awkward
smile on his face.

"Dionysus, are you planning to fight us?"

[Fuu, you're making me hanker for some booze right now.]

He pulled a bottle out from his inner pocket and gulped down some wine.

[Argh, I don't care. I'll just worry about it after getting drunk first. 'Demon
King of Salvation', why don't you have a sip, too? We've got a lot of things
to talk about, right?]

"Thank you for the offer, but now doesn't seem to be a good time for that."

Dionysus smirked and raised a toast in my way. That was the same thing as
<Olympus> giving me an answer, though.

They wouldn't back us, but they wouldn't get hostile with us, either.

Now that a great Nebula had suddenly decided to postpone their
participation, a certain flustered atmosphere permeated into the camps of
'Good' and 'Evil'.

I didn't miss that opening and dug right in. "Well, looks like the
introductions are over and done with, now. So, let's start fighting, already."

My provocations aroused the wrath of Constellations and Demon Kings
from both camps.

Anna Croft must've not expected me to be this direct, because she was now
looking at me with an expression that said, "Are you insane?"

Han Sooyoung spoke up. "You're surprisingly slow in the uptake for a
prophet, aren't you? Just sit back and watch."

Anna Croft closed her mouth shut after being rebuked by Han Sooyoung.
In the meantime, a Demon King stepped forward while unsheathing a
jetblack sword.

Even though the situation was turning more volatile, both Agares and
Metatron maintained their silence.

[Many Demon Kings are displaying strong animosity towards you!]

Along with a sharp noise of air splitting apart, the Demon King's sword
moved towards me, but at that moment, a message popped up.

[Members of the same camp clashed against each other!]

[Increase in Chaos Points have accelerated!]

[Chaos Points have risen up by 1.]

[Current Chaos Points: 76.]

The Demon King blinked its eyes in sheer shock.

And in the distance, I could see the hardened expressions of Metatron and
Agares, too. They were now staring at the night skies of the <Star Stream>.
They must've realized it by now.

In order to attract the attention of the Constellations, I used my true voice.
[The opponents you wish to fight are neither 'Good' or 'Evil'.]

<Kim Dokja's Company> included members of both 'Good' and 'Evil'. And
becoming hostile with our Nebula meant that you were going against the
very essence of the 'Great War of Saints and Demons' itself.

[If you want to kill us, I'm sure you can. However, what will happen to you
if you do?]

On the far side of the sky, the clouds filled with the aura of chaos were
swirling around ominously.
When the Chaos Points go past 80, the countdown to the Apocalypse would
begin. Which meant that it'd be a game of chicken from now on.

[Oldest Good is glaring at you.]

[Oldest Evil is glaring at you.]

It was the game where the first one to get scared and back off would
become the loser.

[Which one will be faster, us dying or all of you getting annihilated by the
Apocalypse Dragon? Aren't you curious?] I unsheathed 'Unbroken Faith'
and smiled. [I'm really curious, actually.]
