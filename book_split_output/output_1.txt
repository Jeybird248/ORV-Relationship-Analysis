1: Prologue - Three Ways to Survive in a Ruined
                            World.


「There are three ways to survive in a ruined world. I have forgotten some
of them now. However, one thing is certain: you who are currently reading
these words will survive.

–Three Ways to Survive in a Ruined World [Complete]」

A web novel platform filled the screen of my old smartphone. I scrolled
down and then up again. How many times have I been doing this?

"Really? This is the end?"

I looked again, and the 'complete' was unmistakable. The story was over.
  [Three Ways to Survive in a Ruined World]

  Author: tls123

  3,149 chapters.



'Three Ways to Survive in a Ruined World' was a feature-length fantasy
novel with 3,149 chapters. Its shortened name was 'Ways of Survival'.

I have been steadily reading this novel since the third year of middle
school. Even when I was bullied by the delinquents at my school, even
when I had to enter a third-rate, local university since I screwed up my
entrance exams, even when I was assigned to a military unit at the
frontlines since the damn military draft lottery went wrong, and even now,
working as a contractor for a large subsidiary, still without a full-time job...
damn it, let's stop thinking about this. Anyway.

「Author's words: Thank you so much for reading 'Ways of Survival' up to
here. I will come back to you with an epilogue!]

"Ah… The epilogue still remains. Then the next chapter is really the last
one."

From the end of my childhood all the way to adulthood—a long journey
spanning over ten years. I felt a mixture of desolation that a world was
coming to an end along with a sense of fulfillment from finally being able
to reach the conclusion of that world. I opened the comment box for the last
chapter and re-wrote a sentence several times.

–Kim Dokja: Writer, thank you for everything in the meantime. I am
looking forward to the epilogue.
They were sincere sentences. Ways of Survival was my life's novel. It
wasn't the most popular, but it was the best novel for me. There were many
words I wanted to say but I couldn't write them. I was afraid that my
careless words would hurt the writer.

–An average of 1.9 hits per chapter.

–An average of 1.08 comments.

This was the average popularity index of 'Ways of Survival'. The number of
views for the first chapter was 1,2000, but it fell to 120 for the 10th chapter,
and then 12 for the 50th chapter. By the time it was the 100th chapter, it
was only 1.

Hits= 1.

I was overwhelmed by the feeling I got when I saw the numerous '1' that
appeared next to the list of chapters. In some cases, there was a '2', but it
was likely someone pressing the wrong button.

'Thank you'.

The author published a novel with more than 3,000 chapters with just 1 hit
per chapter over a period of 10 years. It was truly a story just for me. I
pressed on the 'Recommendation Board' and immediately started tapping on
the keyboard,

–I have a dope novel to recommend

The author wrote me a free completed novel, so I should give him a
recommendation. I clicked on the completed button, and comments quickly
appeared.

–It looks like a new anti. I searched for this person's ID, and they
recommended the same novel several times.
–Isn't his recommendation banned? The author shouldn't do this here.

Belatedly, it occurred to me that I wrote a recommendation a few months
ago. In an instant, dozens of comments were covered with rhetoric such as
"attention seeker" or "dumbass." My face became flushed.

I was sure the author would also read this. So, I hurriedly tried to delete my
post, but I only got a message saying that it couldn't be deleted because it
had already been reported.

"This…"

There was a bitter taste in my mouth at the thought that the sincerely
written recommendation ended up becoming a stain on the novel's
reputation. If they even looked a little bit, why didn't anyone try reading the
interesting novel? I wanted to give a donation to the writer, but I couldn't
afford it because I was a salary worker barely able to make a living. Then I
received a notification that a 'message has arrived'.

–tls123: Thank you.

A message flew in from out of nowhere. It took me a while to grasp the
situation.

–Kim Dokja: The author?

tls123—it was the author of 'Ways of Survival'.

–tls123: I was able to complete it to the end thanks to you. I also won the
competition.

I couldn't believe it. Ways of Survival won a competition?

–Kim Dokja: Congratulations! What is the competition? tls123:

You won't know it because it is an unknown competition.
I wondered if he lied because he was ashamed, but I wanted it to be true.
Perhaps I really didn't know. It might be a bit hit on other platforms. I was a
little sad, but it was good to have an excellent story spreading.

–tls123: I would like to send a special gift to you as a thank you.

–Kim Dokja: Gift?

–tls123: It is thanks to my dear reader that this story has come into the
world.

I gave the writer my email address as he asked.

–tls123: Ah, right. I got the monetization schedule.

–Kim Dokja: Wow, really? When will it start? This masterpiece should've
been paid from the beginning…

It was a lie. The Ways of Survival was a daily series, so I would've had to
spend 3,000 won a month. 3,000 won was one convenience-store lunch for
me.

–tls123: The monetization starts tomorrow.

–Kim Dokja: Then the epilogue coming tomorrow will be paid?

–tls123: Yes, I'm afraid you need to pay for it.

–Kim Dokja: Of course, I have to pay! I will buy the last one!

After that, there was no reply from the author. It looked like they logged
out of the site. A sense of despondency settled in. Were they leaving
without even replying now that they were successful? My admiration
turned into petty jealousy. What was I so excited about? It wasn't like I had
written the novel anyway.
"Will they give me a gift certificate? It'd be nice if it has around 50,000
won."

Those were the naive thoughts I had back then.

I knew nothing about what would happen to the world the next day.
          Chapter 2: Ep. 1 – Starting the Paid Service, I


"I'm Dokja."

I usually introduced myself to people like this, then the
following misunderstanding would occur. "Oh, are you an only
child?"

"I am, but that isn't what I mean."

"Huh? Then?"

"My name is Dokja. Kim Dokja."

My father gave me that name so that I'd become a strong man even if I was
on my own. However, thanks to this name that my father gave me, I was
simply living as a single man, unremarkable in my loneliness.

In short, my life was like this: Kim Dokja, 28 years old, single.
My hobby was reading web novels on the subway while going to and from
work.

"At this rate, you'll get sucked into your smartphone."

In a noisy subway, I raised my head reflexively. A pair of curious eyes
were staring straight at me. They belonged to an employee from the human
resources team, Yoo Sangah.

"Ah, hello." I greeted her.

"Are you going home from work?"

"Yes. What about Yoo Sangah-ssi²?"

"I was lucky. The manager went on a business trip today." Yoo Sangah sat
down soon as the seat next to me became vacant. A subtle scent came from
her shoulders, making me nervous.

"Do you normally take the subway?"

"That…" Yoo Sangah made a dark expression. Come to think of it, this
was the first time I'd met Yoo Sangah on a subway train. Starting with
Personnel Manager Kang to Finance Manager Han… There were rumors
that Yoo Sangah had men from the company driving her home every
workday. Yet unexpected words came from Yoo Sangah's mouth,
"Someone stole my bicycle." Bicycle.

"You commute by bike?"

"Yes! It's because I felt like I've been getting less and less exercise since
I've been working overtime a lot lately. And because there was also a bit of
an annoying matter… Things like that were why." Aha, so that's how it
was.
Yoo Sangah smiled brightly. Seeing her this close, I could kind of
understand why men found her attractive, but, ultimately, it didn't matter to
me. The genre of every person's life was already determined, and Yoo
Sangah was someone who lived in a genre different from mine. After the
awkward conversation, we looked at our phones. I opened up the novel app
I was reading on before while Yoo Sangah… What was this?

"Puede prestarme dinero."

"Huh?"

"Spanish."

"…I see. What does it mean?"

"Please give me some money," Yoo Sangah replied proudly. Studying on
the subway while going home… She truly had a genre different from me.
But where was she planning to use a phrase like that after learning it?

"You're working hard."

"By the way, what is Dokja-ssi looking at?"

"Ah, I…"

In the moment it took me to think, 'Oh, shoot,' Yoo Sangah's gaze landed on
the LCD screen of my smartphone. "Is it a novel?"

"Yes, well… You could say that I'm studying Korean."

"Wow, I also like novels. I haven't been able to read lately because I don't
have time…" It was surprising. Yoo Sangah liked reading novels…?
"Novels like Murakami Haruki, Raymond Carver, Han Kang…" Ah, of
course.

Yoo Sangah asked, "Dokja-ssi, what writers do you like?"
"You won't know even if I say their names."

"I've read a lot of novels. Who are the authors?"

At this time, it was really hard to say that I read web novels as a hobby. I
glanced at the title of the novel in the app.

[The World after the Fall]

Author: Sing Shangshong.

I couldn't say that I was reading 'The World after the Fall by Sing
Shangshong'.

"It's just a fantasy novel. It's… What was it again? Right, Lord of the Rings,
it's kind of like that…"

Yoo Sangah's eyes widened. "Aha. The Lord of the Rings. I've also seen the
movies."

"Yes, the movies are good."

Silence followed. Yoo Sangah was still looking in my direction and seemed
to be waiting for me to say something. It was getting awkward. So, I
decided to change the topic. "It's already been one year since we joined the
company, hasn't it? It was around this time last year, I think. Time really
flies."

"Yes, you're right. Back then, the two of us had no idea what was going on,
didn't we?"

"That's right. It seems like just yesterday, but the contract period is already
over." I realized that I'd said something wrong when I saw Yoo Sangah's
expression.

"Ah, I…" Yoo Sangah trailed off.
I had forgotten. Yoo Sangah received credit for a foreign buyer last month
and was already promoted to a full-time employee.

"Ah, that's right, that happened. My congratulations are late. Sorry about
that. Haha, maybe I should've worked hard to study a foreign language
too." "N-no, not at all, Dokja-ssi! There's still the performance review,
and…"

I didn't want to admit it, but the sight of Yoo Sangah speaking—it was
pretty cool. Her face seemed to glow with a brilliant light, as though the
world's spotlight was shining down on only one person.

If this world were a novel, the protagonist would likely be someone like
her. In fact, it was an inevitable outcome.

While I hadn't worked hard…

Yoo Sangah had.

While I read webnovels on the Internet…

Yoo Sangah studied diligently.

So, it was inevitable that Yoo Sangah would become a full-time employee
and that my contract would be terminated.

"Um… Dokja-ssi."

"Yes?"

"If you don't mind… Should I let you know the app I'm using?" All of the
sudden, Yoo Sangah's voice sounded distant.

It felt as though I was getting infinitely farther away from the world. To
rein in my mind which felt as though it would drift away, I forced my eyes
open and focused my gaze straight ahead.
A boy was sitting in the seat opposite mine on the train.

He looked a little over 10 years old.

The boy who held an insect collecting net in one hand was smiling brightly
as he sat next to his mother.

"…Dokja-ssi?"

What would it be like, if I had a life different from the one I had now? In
other words, what if the genre of my life had been different?

"Kim Dok…"

If the genre of my life weren't 'realism' but 'fantasy'…

Would I have been able to become the protagonist?

Who knows.

That was probably something I would never find out. However, if there was
one I did know, it was this:

"It's fine, Yoo Sangah-ssi."

"Pardon?"

"Even if you tell me the app, it won't be any use."

The genre of my life was plainly 'realism.'

"It's because a Dokja has a Dokja's life, you see."

"Hm? What do you …"

"It's just that some people are like that in life."

And in this genre, I wasn't a protagonist but a 'Reader'.
"A Dokja's life…"

Yoo Sangah was wearing a grave expression, so I waved my hand a bit to
show that I was really alright. I didn't really know why, but this person
seemed sincerely worried about me. Well, she was from HR… so she was
probably aware of my work performance already.

"Dokja-ssi says truly great things."

"What?"

"Then, I suppose I have my own life as well—a Sangah's life."

Yoo Sangah seemed to have decided something as she turned back to
studying Spanish. I gazed at her for a while before returning to the novel.
Everything had returned to normal, but strangely, my scrolling of the novel
didn't go well. Maybe it was because I realized the weight of reality that I
couldn't scroll down.

At that time, a notification appeared at the top of my smartphone. [You
have one new mail.]

It was from the author of 'Ways of Survival'. I opened the mail.

–Reader-nim³, my novel will become paid from 7 p.m. This will be helpful.
Good luck.

[1 attachment.]

The author said he would give me a gift. What was the gift?

…Like my name, I was also a reader by nature. So, I was excited to receive
the mail. Yes, it wasn't bad living as a reader. I checked the time. It was
6:55
p.m. I had exactly five minutes before the novel became monetized at 7
p.m. Then I opened up my list of preferred novels in the app. Since I was
the only reader, I should leave a congratulatory comment and give strength
to the author. However…

–The work doesn't exist.

I tried typing 'ruined' several times in the search box, but the result was the
same. The bulletin board for 'Ways of Survival' had disappeared without a
trace. It was strange. Had there ever been a case of a novel being deleted
without notification when it was going to be monetized?

At that moment, the subway lights turned off, and the inside of the train
became dark.

Kiiiiiiiik-! The subway train shook loudly and let out a metallic sound. It
caused Yoo Sangah to scream and grab my arm. Then I heard the sound of
other people getting stirred up. Yoo Sangah gripped my arm so tightly that I
paid more attention to the pain in my left arm than the sudden stop. It took a
dozen seconds for the train to stop fully.

Then I heard confused voices coming from everywhere.

"Uh, what?"

"W-What is this?"

In the dark, one or two smartphone lights turned on. Yoo Sangah still held
my left arm tightly as she asked, "W-What is going on?"

I pretended to be unconcerned. "Don't worry. It isn't a big deal."

"Is that so?"

"Yes, it is probably a disturbance from a suicide. The engineer will soon
make an announcement."

As I finished speaking, I heard the engineer's announcement, -Telling all
passengers on the train. Telling all passengers on the train.
The loud surroundings became calm. I sighed and opened my mouth, "See,
it isn't a big deal. Now an apology will air, and the power will come back
on…"

–E-Everyone run away… Run…!

'What?'

There was a beeping sound, and the broadcast turned off. The inside of the
train became a mess.

"D-Dokja-ssi? What is this…?"

A bright light flashed from the front of the subway train. There was a loud
drumming sound followed by a pop. Something was heading this way in the
darkness. It was just a coincidence that I saw the clock at this moment—
7:00 p.m.

Tick, it felt like the world was stopping. Then I heard a voice:

[The free service of planetary system 8612 has been terminated.]

[The main scenario has started.]

This was the moment the genre of my life changed.



[1] Dokja can mean 'only child', 'reader' or 'individualist' in Korean.
[2] ssi is a Korean honorific. It is the formal way of addressing
someone when you are talking to or about them.
[3] nim is a high-level honorific used to show respect.
          Chapter 3: Ep. 1 – Starting the Paid Service, II


「 Dokkaebi¹. The first time he appeared, someone said so. 」

I didn't know why but that sentence suddenly popped up in my head. The
stopped subway train, the dark room… These details gave me a sense of
deja vu. The subway had stopped before, but it was rare. Even so, why? I
remembered the familiar words from a novel… but it was ridiculous.
Wasn't it impossible?

At this moment, the door of car 3807 opened wide, and the electricity
returned. Yoo Sangah muttered by my side, "…Dokkaebi?"

My head was ringing. I trembled uneasily as the novel I knew and the
reality before me overlapped.

「With two small horns and wearing a small straw mat, the strange and
fluffy creature was floating in the air. 」
「 It was too strange to call it a fairy, too evil to call it an angel, and too
tranquil to call it a demon. 」

「Thus, it was called a 'dokkaebi'. 」

And I already knew the first thing the dokkaebi would say.

「&아#@!&아#@! …」

[&아#@!&아#@!…]
Fiction and reality overlapped precisely.

"What is this?"

"Augmented reality?"

Amidst the chattering people, I was thrown into another world alone. This
was unmistakably a dokkaebi—the very dokkaebi that opened the door to
tragedy for thousands of lives in Ways of Survival. It was Yoo Sangah's
voice that broke me out of my thoughts. "It sounds vaguely like Spanish.
Should I talk to it?"

I was a bit taken aback and asked, "…Do you know what that is? Will you
ask it for money?"

"No but…"

It was at this time that I heard the correct pronunciation of Korean. [Ah.
Ah. Does this sound good? Ah, I had a hard time because the Korean patch
didn't work. Everyone, can you hear my words?]

As a familiar language was being spoken, I could see people's expressions
relax. The first one to step up was a big man in a suit. "Hey, what are you
doing right now?"
[…Huh?]

"Are you filming? I have to go because I have to quickly get to an
audition." He seemed to be an obscure actor since his face was unfamiliar.
If I were a casting director, I would've picked him out for his brimming
ambition.
Unfortunately, the presence before him right now wasn't a director.

[Ah, auditions. That's right. This is also an audition. Haha, there was a
shortage of data. I just entered when it was monetized at 7 p.m.]

"What? What are you talking about?"

[Now, now. All of you, relax in your seats and listen to me. From now on,
I will tell you something very important!] My chest was becoming stuffy.

"What? Quickly get off the train!"

"Somebody call the captain!"

"What are they doing without the cooperation of the citizens?"

"Mother, what is that? A cartoon?"

There was no doubt about it. This was the development I knew. I didn't
want to be mixed up in this… but there was no way. The people present
wouldn't listen to the small and cute-looking CG creature. The only thing I
could do was stop Yoo Sangah who was trying to get up from her seat.

"Yoo Sangah-ssi, it is dangerous, so stay here."

"Huh?" Yoo Sangah's eyes widened. I spoke during a moment of
bewilderment, but there was no way to explain what I understood. To be
exact, I didn't have to explain.

[Haha, you are really loud.]
There was a presence with a stronger persuasive power than anyone else
right now.

[I told you to be quiet.]

I closed my eyes slowly as the dokkaebi's eyes turned red. Something burst,
and the subway became silent.

"Uh, uh. Uh…" There was a big hole in the forehead of the unknown actor
who had to go to the audition. The man who had spoken several times
collapsed on the spot.

[This isn't a movie shoot.]

There was a cracking sound once again. This time, it was the person talking
about the captain.

[It isn't a dream. It isn't a novel either.]

One, two… Blood sprayed into the air as the heads of some people started
to burst. They were all the people who had protested against the dokkaebi,
as well as the ones who screamed or went wild. Those who caused the
slightest fuss had a hole in their heads. Suddenly, the subway became a
bloodbath.

[This isn't the 'reality' that you know. Do you understand? So everyone shut
up and listen to me.]

More than half the people present here died. Blood and body pieces filled
the subway. Now, the people didn't scream. Like primitive apes in front of a
powerful predator, everyone just watched the dokkaebi with terror. I was
surprised and held tightly onto the shoulder of Yoo Sangah who was
hiccuping.
This was real. The strange message which entered my ears, the dokkaebi
had appeared in front of me, and the train car that had become a
bloodbath…

[Everyone, your lives have been nice so far. Isn't that right?]

In the special needs seating area, an elderly grandmother met the eyes of
the dokkaebi.

[You have been living too long for free. Isn't life too generous? You were
born and paid no price for breathing, eating, pooping and breeding! Ha!
You really live in a good world!]

Free? No one in the subway lived for free. The people strived to make
money in order to survive, and they rode the subway on the way home from
work. Yet at this moment, no one disputed the dokkaebi's words.

[But now the good days are over. How long can you continue living for
free? If you want to enjoy happiness, it is common sense to pay a price.
Isn't that right?]

The gasping people couldn't answer. Then at that time, someone carefully
raised their hand. "D-Do you want money?"

I wondered what type of person could speak in the middle of this situation,
but surprisingly, I knew his face.

"Yoo Sangah-ssi. Isn't that Department Head Han of the finance team?"

"…Right."

There was no doubt. He had friends up top in the company and was the
number one person newcomers avoided. It was Han Myungoh, department
head of the finance team. Why was this man riding the subway?
"I will give you money. Take it. Please note that I am a person like this."
Department Head Han pulled out his business card as people cheered him
on. It was the atmosphere of a savior fighting against terrorists. "How much
do you want? A big one? Or two?"

He was offering a sum that was overly large for a department head of a
subsidiary company. There was a rumor that Han Myungoh was the
youngest son of the leader of the affiliate company and now I thought it
might be true. I couldn't carry that many cheques in my wallet.

[Hrmm, you are giving me money?]

"T-That's right! The cash I have right now isn't much but… I can give you
anything if you let me out of here."

[Money, good. A plant fibre that many humans mutually agree on.]

The department head's expression brightened. It was an 'Indeed, money is
everything' expression. How pitiful.

"Now, this is all I have―"

[It only applies in your time and space.]

"Huh?"

At the next moment, flames appeared in the air, and the cheques in the
department head's hands burned up. Department Head Han let out a scream.

[That paper has no value in the macrocosm world. If you do this one more
time, I will blow away your head.]

"U-Uhhh…" Fear once again spread on the faces of the people present. It
was easy to read what they were thinking because it was just like the novel.

「 What the hell will happen now? 」
Only I knew what was going to happen in the future.

[Phew, the debt is piling up during the time when you are noisy. Well, yes.
Rather than explain it a hundred times, isn't it quicker for you to make
money yourself?]

The dokkaebi's horns rose like they were antennas, and its body floated to
the ceiling of the train.

A moment later, a message rang out.

[#BI-7623 channel is open.]

[Constellations have entered.]

A small window emerged in front of everyone's blank eyes.

[The main scenario has arrived!]



  [Main Scenario #1 – Proof of Value]
  Category: Main

  Difficulty: F

  Clear Conditions: Kill one or more creatures.

  Time Limit: 30 minutes

  Compensation: 300 coins

  Failure: Death
The dokkaebi smiled faintly as it became transparent and disappeared into
the next space.

[Then, good luck everyone. Please show me an interesting story.]



[1] Dokkaebi are legendary creatures from Korean folklore, also known as
Korean goblins.
          Chapter 4: Ep. 1 – Starting the Paid Service, III


People reacted differently after the dokkaebi disappeared. Some people
tried to get out of the train while others called the police. Yoo Sangah
belonged to the latter group. "Police, the police aren't answering! What,
what should I…"

"Calm down, Yoo Sangah-ssi," I said, staring straight into Yoo Sangah's
unfocused eyes. "Yoo Sangah-ssi. Have you ever played the game that the
development team made? A game where the world is destroyed and only a
few people survive."

"Huh? What are you say-…"

"Think about it. We are in a game right now."

Yoo Sangah silently licked her lips. "Game…"

"It is simple. Don't hesitate to do as I tell you. Understood?"
"U-Understood. What should I do?"

"Stay still."

Finally, I slowly controlled my breathing. I too needed time to properly
accept all of this.

[Three Ways to Survive in a Ruined World]

The descriptions that existed only in the novel were now unfolding right
before my eyes.

「The dokkaebi stretched out its antenna. 」

「 The bodies scattered like trash in the carriage. 」

「 The bloodied office worker shaking. 」

「An old lady groaning in her seat. 」

I watched every scene intently. It was like Neo in the Matrix, who
suspected reality. Observing, questioning, and then eventually being
convinced… I had to admit it. I didn't know the reason why, but there were
no doubts about it. 'Ways of Survival' had become a reality.

Let me think… How should I survive in this new world?

"Come on, everybody! Everybody calm down. Start breathing calmly."
Someone stepped forward exactly five minutes after the dokkaebi
disappeared. He was a sturdy man with short cut hair, one head taller than
the average height.

"Are you calm yet? Please stop your actions and pay attention to me for a
moment."

The people sobbing or making calls stopped. Once everyone's eyes were
gathered on him, the big man opened his mouth again, "As you know, in the
event of a national disaster, small disturbances can cause large human
casualties. That's why I will now control the situation."

"What, who are you?"

"A national disaster situation? What are you saying?"

Some people belatedly recovered and strongly resisted the world
'control'. Then the young man pulled a government official card out of
his wallet. "I am currently an army lieutenant serving in the 6502 unit."
Some people's faces became relieved. "A soldier, he is a soldier."
However, it was too early to be relieved.

"I just received a message from my unit."

People gathered in front of the soldier's smartphone. I was able to read the
contents without difficulty because I was near it.

–A level 1 national disaster situation has occurred. All troops gather
quickly.

I could hear gulps all around me. It was a national disaster situation. I
wasn't surprised because I had already expected this. In fact, I was surprised
because of something else. Army lieutenant Lee Hyunsung… That 'Lee
Hyunsung' was this man. I knew who he was. It was the first time actually
seeing his face, but his name was clear in my head. He was one of the main
supporting actors of Ways of Survival.

「 Steel Sword Lee Hyunsung. 」

A character from the novel had appeared. Now I really had to acknowledge
the situation.

"Soldier-nim! What is happening?"
"I have been trying to contact my unit, but…"

"The Blue House! What is the Blue House doing? Please contact the
president quickly!"

"I'm sorry. I am just an ordinary soldier and don't have a hotline to the Blue
House." Lee Hyunsung explained.

"Then why are you taking control?"

"For the sake of the safety of all citizens…" As Lee Hyunsung calmly
responded to the absurd questions, I realized that the descriptions in the
novel weren't wrong. However, did Lee Hyunsung originally appear like
this? While thinking about these complicated questions, I had a strange
hunch. As the only reader of Ways of Survival, I could assure you that Lee
Hyunsung's first appearance wasn't like this. The point at which he
appeared in the novel was at the end of the first scenario.

…Then what was this situation? My mind became confused. I would know
more clearly if I could read Ways of Survival once again.

"The prime minister is making a speech! It is really a level one disaster!"

Everyone turned on their smartphones at someone's cry. Yoo Sangah turned
her screen toward me. "…Dokja-ssi, look at this."

There was no need to enter a search term. It was because the first result for
all portal sites was 'Prime Minister's Speech'. Of course, I already knew the
content of the video.

–To all my fellow citizens, unidentified terrorists are currently active in an
unspecified number of areas, including Seoul.

The contents of the speech were simple. The current government would
mobilize all means and methods to fight the terrorists, and there would
never be any negotiations. Thus, everyone should confidently continue with
their lives…

I hadn't thought much of it when I read the novel, but now I was a bit
shocked when hearing those words. Terrorism… Yes, that would be more
comfortable.

"But where it the president? Why is the prime minister making the speech?"

"The president has already been hit."

"What? Really?"

"I'm not sure. A Naver comment―"

"Shit, then it is fake!"

Of course, I knew it wasn't a fake comment.

"Uwaaaaack! What?"

People dropped their phones as gunshots were heard from all over. It
originated from their smartphones. Chiiiik, there was a loud sound, and
blood filled the screen. After a moment, people held their breaths as they
realized what had happened.

"P-Prime Minister…"

The prime minister had died. His head had exploded in real-time. There
were several more sounds like gunfire before the screen became silent. The
next thing that appeared on the screen was a dokkaebi.

[Everyone, I've told you already. This isn't a game like 'terrorism'.]

People were at a loss for words as their mouths gaped open like dumb
goldfish.
[Do you still not understand? This won't do. Do you still feel like this is a
game?]

It felt so ominous because his tone was so relaxed. Subconsciously, I made
a fist using all my strength.

[Haha, according to the data, the people of this country are very good at
games. So, why don't I try raising the difficulty?]

Beeep. A huge timer appeared in the air. At the same time, it started
decreasing rapidly.

[The remaining time has been decreased by 10 minutes.]

[There are 10 minutes remaining.]

[If the first killing doesn't occur within the next five minutes, all lives in
that carriage will be wiped out.]

"W-What is this? Is it a joke?"

"Didn't you hear the message just now? Hey, didn't you hear it?"

"Soldier-nim! What do we do now? Why isn't the police coming?"

"Everyone, calm down and listen to me―"

The words of the dokkaebi caused the situation in the carriage to become so
severe that Lee Hyunsung couldn't fix it. I could feel Yoo Sangah gripping
my collar tightly. Still, I couldn't shake off the incongruity of this situation.
Lee Hyunsung, a supporting character, had already appeared. So, why
hadn't 'he' emerged? According to what I knew, I should've seen him by
now.

"T-There is a murder back there!"
A scene from the 3907 train car could be seen through the aisle window.
The complexion of the killer in that carriage was white.

"We have to keep them out! Don't let anyone in!"

People held tightly to the iron door, but it wasn't necessary. The enemy
wasn't there in the first place.

[All types of access to the carriage will be restricted until the scenario is
complete.]

Along with this message, people were thrown back from the iron door like
they had hit a transparent barrier.

"W-What is this?"

Once again, the voice of the dokkaebi rang out, [Haha, there are some
places that are quite fun while other places haven't started yet. Okay, this is
a special service. I will show you what will happen if nothing occurs in the
next five minutes.]

A giant screen appeared in the subway. The place that appeared on the
screen was a classroom. Girls in their navy blue school uniform were
shaking. A boy bit his fingernails and muttered, "…Is that the school
uniform of Daepong?"

Beep beep beep beep― An ominous beeping sound was heard. Then the
high school girls started to scream.

[The given time has run out.]

[Paid settlement will begin.]

Once the announcement ended, the heads of the high school girls sitting in
the front row exploded. One by one, one by one again… More and more
heads exploded. The high school girls screamed and ran toward the
classroom doors or windows.

"Ahh, uh, how―"

Cleaning tools broke and nails were torn out, but the doors didn't open. No
one could get out. The heads of the high school girls continued to burst.
Then a high school girl strangled her friend, who died with a groan. After a
while, the only thing that remained on the screen was the last schoolgirl
looking around.

[#Bay23515 channel. Daepong Girls' High School, Year 2 Class B
survivor: Lee Jihye.]

The figure of the girl on the screen disappeared. Then the dokkaebi said,
[How is it? Interesting?]

The dokkaebi spoke with a smile, but people weren't looking at the screen
anymore. The people who made eye contact were gradually moving away
from each other.

"Shit! What is this?"

Even Yoo Sangah released her hold on me. However, she didn't move away
from me. Both my hands were freed, and I turned on my smartphone. Why
was 'that guy' still not showing up? There was a mixture of information that
I knew from the novel and information that I didn't know. The only way to
break through this situation was to read Laws of Survival again.

However, where else could I find the novel? The novel wasn't popular
enough to be shared illegally… No, wait a minute.

[1 attachment.]

I was stunned for a moment as I saw the notification on my smartphone.
Perhaps… No?
I was confused the moment I opened the mail attachment. The name of the
attachment sent by the author was:

[Three Ways to Survive in a Ruined World.TXT]
          Chapter 5: Ep. 1 – Starting the Paid Service, IV


Laughter emerged. I had to clear my eyes and look again to see if it was a
lie. The file extension was TXT. Then this meant that this person… The gift
he sent me was a copy of his novel?

[You have obtained an exclusive attribute.]

[The exclusive skill slot has been activated.]

I heard a message in my ear after running the file. It wasn't surprising if the
world had changed into 'Ways of Survival'. All survivors of Ways of
Survival had exclusive attribute and skills. I quietly said 'Attribute Window'
in my mind. After all, I needed to know the attribute that I received.

[You can't activate the Attribute Window.]

What? I once again tried to call out 'Attribute Window', but the result was
the same. It was absurd. To think there was something like this? If I
couldn't use the Attributes Window, then I couldn't know what attributes or
skills I had. Knowing oneself and one's enemy allowed one to be invincible.

However, this was a situation where I didn't even know myself, let alone
the enemy.

After staring into space for a while, I gave up and decided to read the text
the author had given me.

[Your reading speed has increased due to the effect of your exclusive
attribute.]

I didn't know what the attribute as, but it took me less than a minute to read
the first act of Ways of Survival thanks to the attribute effect. Then I found
it. The place where my finger had stopped was at the beginning part of the
work, where the main character was doing some 'action' in the train scene.

「 He saw people gathered at the back door of the 3707 carriage. The wheel
of the lighter he held tightly in his hand was cold. In this life, he absolutely
couldn't make a mistake. He would use any means for his purpose.

The expression of fear on the people's faces…

He didn't feel any guilt. Everything was fleeting. He looked at the people
with merciless eyes. After a while, his fingertips moved, and fire rose. Then
it all started. 」

A chill went down my spine, and I had to read the passage again and again.
The reason for my discomfort was soon revealed.

"…3707."

I reflexively checked the number of the carriage I was riding—[3807]. The
carriage I was in right now was behind the carriage that the protagonist was
riding. My hands shook slightly.
…Wait a minute. How many people originally survived this carriage?

「 He looked through the blurred window at the 3807 carriage. It was
already too late. It was inevitable. Anyway, only two people survived in
that carriage. 」

Only two survived. It meant that everyone had died except for two people.
And I already knew who those two people were. I raised my head and
looked blankly at Yoo Sangah. Maybe this woman would die.

…Me as well.

"Dokja-ssi, shouldn't we stop this?" Something was starting in the place
where Yoo Sangah pointed. There was the sound of groaning.

A young man was crouching down in front of the elderly woman. "Shit. I'm
in a bad mood, and this old lady keeps whining and groaning! Won't you
shut up?"

The young man was a male student who had been leaning against the
entrance. He was thin and had dyed white hair. His name was written on the
badge attached to his uniform—Kim Namwoon. It was a name that I knew.

「 Only Lee Hyunsung and Kim Namwoon survived in that carriage. It
doesn't matter. They are the only two I need anyway. 」

"Didn't I tell you to shut up?" The agitated Kim Namwoon grabbed the
grandmother's collar. The grandmother's powerless legs staggered, and Kim
Namwoon's palm moved through the air.

Slap. Slap.

In normal times, somebody would run to stop this, but now nobody was
moving. It wasn't long before the slaps changed to punches.

"S-Save me. Save me…!"
I could hear the sound of a hard fist hitting flesh. Some of the men around
Kim Namwoon hesitated, but none of them wanted to go forward.
Surprisingly, the first person to act was Han Myungoh. "Young man, for
you to be treating an elder like this…!"

However, all he got in reply was a voice mixed with scorn, "Mister, do you
want to die?"

"…What?"

"You still don't understand the situation?"

"What bullshit is this brat saying?"

Kim Namwoon only laughed at the cursing Han Myungoh. He pointed to
the ceiling of the subway carriage with his finger. "Can't you see that?" On
the ceiling, a holographic screen was playing.

[S-Spare me!]

[Aaaack!]

[Die! Die!]

It wasn't just the train carriages or Daepong High School. This was a live
video of people dying all over the country. Kim Namwoon continued
speaking, "You still don't understand? The army isn't coming to rescue us,
and somebody must die."

"W-What are you saying…?"

"We have to choose a person to die." Han Myungoh wasn't able to answer.
The hairs of his exposed wrist were standing up. "Of course, I know what
you are thinking. You have to kill your fellow countrymen to live. It is
something only sons of bitches will do. But you know, it is a situation
beyond our control. Beyond our control. We will die if we don't kill. Who
will blame us? Are you going to die in the end because of your morals?"

"T-That…"

"Think carefully. The world you have known so far has just ended."

Han Myungoh's shoulders trembled. It wasn't only Han Myungoh. Cracks
were showing in the eyes of the other people present. It was a scene where
their vague sense of morality was collapsing. Kim Namwoon put a wedge
in that crack.

"A new world requires new laws."

Kim Namwoon was the young man who adapted to the world of Ways of
Survival the fastest. He turned around and resumed punching the
grandmother. This time, nobody stopped him—not Han Myungoh, the other
men… or even Lee Hyunsung. The soldier's fists were trembling as he
stared into the air with a lost expression. Maybe he had also made a
decision.

"Sigh… It is hard to kill. Are you doing to just watch? Do you want to fall
behind?"

People trembled at Kim Namwoon's words. Their facial expressions were
as easy to read as the sentences in a cheap novel.

「If there is no killing in five minutes, everyone in this carriage will die. 」

The emotions in the eyes of the people were changing.

「If the grandmother doesn't die, we will die in five minutes… 」

They now held the most primitive emotion that a living creature could have.
"Yes… This bastard is right. If we don't do this, everyone will die." The
first man rushed toward Kim Namwoon. He kicked at the old lady who had
collapsed and was curled up.

"Have you forgotten? Someone must die! So we can live!"

"Ah, fuck… I don't know."

The second and third, the people standing at an aloof distance away from
the grandmother, the cowardly men who had been lingering, the university
student filming this with their phone, the mother of the child, and Han
Myungoh… They all lynched the grandmother, aiming for her death.

"Die! Die quickly!"

They were like guards cooperating for the death penalty. Like guards
pulling the lever at the same time so they couldn't tell who killed the
prisoner, these people passively kicked and punched the grandmother.

…And I was watching all of this. I was standing by, like someone watching
something happening in another world. The grandmother whose name I
didn't know was someone who wasn't meant to live. In the original
scenario, the grandmother died. So… it wasn't a sin to observe that death.

At that moment, Yoo Sangah got up.

"You will be killed." I grabbed her reflexively. "I told you not to move."

The arm I was holding was shaking. Yoo Sangah made tight fists in an
attempt to hide her trembling. "I know, I know…!"

"Yoo Sangah-ssi will die if you go now."

Yoo Sangah's eyes were shaking with fear. Even so… I realized it. Despite
the genre of the story changing, some people still shone brightly.

"Yoo Sangah-ssi, sit down."
However, the person who could change this story wasn't Yoo Sangah. Yoo
Sangah wasn't the protagonist of this world.

"Huh? But―"

"Do as I say, just this once. I won't interfere after that."

After forcibly putting Yoo Sangah back in her seat, I took a deep breath and
turned around. I straightened my back and shook as I exhaled, slowly
loosening my ankles and wrists. In fact, it was a little early to come
forward. This wasn't my plan originally.

"…Dokja-ssi?"

I didn't answer her call as I looked at the people, the ones who were intent
on assaulting the grandmother. I wasn't staying still because I was afraid or
Kim Namwoon and the people, nor did I consent to their inhumanity. I was
just waiting. It was for this moment that I had to move. Thus…

Kwaang!

Right now.

"Ack! What?"

An explosion filled my ears, and the train shook. People cried out as smoke
rose from the front right corner of this carriage. It had started. So, I moved.
I kicked off from the ground as hard as I could with my right foot, passing
by the people screaming and sitting down toward the grandmother.

"What? Eeeeok!" Kim Namwoon collided with me and fell to the ground
with a scream. At first glance, it seemed like I was saving the grandmother,
but that wasn't what I was aiming for.
Where was it? I looked around quickly. Somebody had fallen toward the
grandmother due to the explosion. It was a kid crying in the middle of this
hell… the kid who was holding the insect collecting net before.

"Excuse me a moment."

I took the net from the child. Once I put my hand into the net, the chitin of a
grasshopper reached my fingertips. I took one out and placed it in the kid's
hands. Then I turned toward the people.

"Everybody, stop. You can't live if you kill the grandmother." My voice
was surprisingly clear due to the temporary silence after the explosion. One
by one, people started looking at me. "Let's say you kill the grandmother.
What next?" Their surprised faces looked good. Then let me tell them a bit
more. "The grandmother's death will be recognized for what the dokkaebi
calls the 'first murder', and some time will be bought. Then what next?"

"Ah…"

"If what the dokkaebi says is true, you each have to kill one thing. So, who
will you kill after the grandmother? Will you kill the person next to you?"

The people who thought about something retreated from each other. Horror
filled their eyes. In fact, everyone knew… The grandmother was just the
beginning. Kim Namwoon noticed the shaky atmosphere. "Haha, what are
you all worried about? Then kill him next! Cowards. Don't worry about
your turn in advance! The odds are equal!"

I figured that Kim Namwoon would say something like this. With a slight
wave of my hand, I cut him off. "There is no need to gamble like that.
There is a way for you to survive, even if you don't become a killer."

"What?"

"W-What is it?"
The people became greatly agitated, and Kim Namwoon's expression
distorted.

"Have you forgotten? The scenario clear condition wasn't to 'kill a person'."

Most of them were still puzzled, but a few people noticed something.

[Kill one or more living things.]

That's right. From the beginning, the word 'person' had never been specified
in the contents of the scenario. Kill one or more living things…

In other words, any life was possible. A quick-witted person shouted at the
collection net in my hand, "Insect! Insects!"

The locusts and grasshoppers were jumping around in the collection net.
Looking at them, the eyes of the people shone. I nodded. "That's right, the
insects."

Then I put my hand into the net and took out a grasshopper. It was a chubby
one that I had seen earlier.

"G-Give that to me! Quickly!"

"One only! I just need one!"

I stepped back slowly as I looked at the approaching people. Right now, I
was facing the explosive madness that tried to kill the grandmother yet a
smile emerged on my face. Why? Even in this breathtaking tension, why
was my heart beating with joy?

"Would you like it?" I waved the net like a trainer provoking an animal.
Several impatient people leaped toward me.

"Then keep it!" I smashed the grasshopper in my hand.

[You have achieved the 'First Kill' achievement!]
[100 coins have been earned as additional compensation.]

At the same time, I threw the net in my other hand as hard as possible
toward the opposite side of the area where the grandmother and the crowd
were gathered.

"This is crazy!"

The insects were released and jumped as hard as they could for freedom.
           Chapter 6: Ep. 1 – Starting the Paid Service, V


People panicked as they saw the insects running around the carriage.

"H-Hey! Why would you do such a thi―"

While some people were staring blankly, the quick-witted pushed toward
me.

"You son of a bitch."

"…You better find them soon. There are only three minutes left."

These words were a signal as people started to look everywhere among the
subway seats like beasts who had lost their minds.

"I got it! Aaack!"

The joy of those fortunate enough to obtain an insect, as well as the
malicious attacks on them, caused the carriage to become chaotic. "Hey,
why did you do that? Couldn't you have just given them the insects?"
Looking back, I saw Kim Namwoon raising his body.

I responded cautiously to Kim Namwoon, who was stretching his neck,
"There are 12 people remaining."

"…Huh?"

"There were three insects left in the collecting net."

Kim Namwoon frowned for a moment before smiling broadly. "12 to 3?
Hahahaha! Yes. Not all of them can survive anyway? So you threw that
thing?"

"Yes."

"Don't make me laugh."

"…?"

"A person with common sense wouldn't do such a thing for that reason."
Kim Namwoon's smile widened. "Tell me honestly. You just wanted to see
this scene, didn't you?"

I recalled the Kim Namwoon that I knew from Ways of Survival. At this
moment, I heard a message in my ears, [Exclusive skill, 'Character List' is
activated.]

Next, a window opened in front of my eyes. I still didn't know exactly what
my attribute was, but I looked at the window in front of me.
  [Character Summary]

  Name: Kim Namwoon.

  Age: 19.


  Sponsor: None (Two constellations are currently showing interest in this
  person).

  Exclusive Attributes: Chuunibyou¹ (General)

  Exclusive Skills: Unusual Adaptability Lv. 3, Knife Fighting Lv. 1,
  Blackening Lv. 1

  Overall Stats: Physique Lv. 3, Strength Lv. 4, Agility Lv. 6, Magic
  Power Lv. 4

  Overall Evaluation: A chuunibyou who was blackened by a special
  occasion. It is recommended that you don't get involved with him.


Most of the chuunibyou that appeared in Ways of Survival committed
suicide because they couldn't endure the nightmare that had become real.
However, the chuunibyou before me, Kim Namwoon, was different. He
was the Delusion Demon, Kim Namwoon. The young man, who later
became known by this nickname, wasn't an ordinary chuuni. This young
man had been waiting for the destruction of the world for a long time and
adapted to this world at an 'unusual speed'.

"Team up with me. How about it?" That young man was now making an
offer to me.

[The character 'Kim Namwoon' has a favourable impression of you.]
[Your understanding of the character 'Kim Namwoon' has increased.]

My immediate survival was guaranteed if I held hands with Kim
Namwoon. If I hadn't read Ways of Survival, my choice might've been a
little different.

"I'm sorry but I like to be alone."

"Really? Hmm, it is regrettable." Kim Namwoon licked his lips lightly and
stood close to me. "Then can you step aside? I have something to do with
that old lady behind you."

Hearing his words, I looked back to see that the bleeding and collapsed
grandmother was barely breathing. "What do you want?"

"Do you have to ask?"

"You aren't catching the insects?"

"Insects? Why would I catch that?" Kim Namwoon laughed. "I already
have a caught insect in front of me."

I could feel Kim Namwoon's murderous spirit. The character that had only
existed in the novel was facing me with vivid madness. Therefore, I felt a
little bit in awe. Kim Namwoon was really the person I had imagined.

[The character 'Kim Namwoon' has a slight decrease in favourability.]

"What are you looking at? Aren't you going to move aside quickly?"

"It is tough."

"What?"

"I won't move aside."
"Haha, are you now going to imitate the apostle of justice? Do you have
multiple personalities?" I didn't answer. A dark shadow slowly crept onto
Kim Namwoon's face, and his shining eyes were becoming cold. "No, wait
a minute. Did you throw the net over there to do this from the beginning?
Really?"

"…"

"You want to save the grandmother? Hahaha! Amazing! Really amazing!
No? Yes?"

I still didn't answer. As I looked closely at this guy, old memories
resurfaced.

"Ah, it turns out that you are the type of person I hate the most. All old
bastards are the same."

They were memories of all the times I had been frustrated by this brat
during Ways of Survival.

[The character 'Kim Namwoon' despises you.]

"What did you say?"

I considered the timing and lowered my head, avoiding the fist that flew
before the words were even over.

"Oh, not bad?" Kim Namwoon muttered.

Despite knowing it was coming, I felt a sense of heat from above my head.
It wasn't an ordinary punch.

[Blackening Lv.1]

A dark aura rose from Kim Namwoon's whole body. This was the exclusive
skill of the 'chuunibyou' attribute. It was rare to release a skill before the
end of the first scenario, but Kim Namwoon was already showing a skill.
There was a reason why the main character had recruited him, despite his
psychopath nature.

Peeok!

After he hit it, my right shoulder spasmed. There was no way to win if I
kept fighting this way.

…Should I use 'that' now? I was calculating the time when I heard a
message.

[Your understanding of the character 'Kim Namwoon' has increased.]

[You are close to the conditions of use for the exclusive skill 'Omniscient
Reader's Viewpoint Lv. 1.]

Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint? What was this?

[The conditions of use for the exclusive skill 'Omniscient Reader's
Viewpoint' Lv. 1 have been reached!]

Kim Namwoon's fist missed me and struck the ground.

"Haha, what? Haven't I become stronger?

A faint fist mark was left on the ground. Kim Namwoon was realizing his
current strength little by little. The fist that could break a bone with a single
blow kept hitting the ground. Kim Namwoon was frustrated and couldn't
control his temper. "Ah, why can't I hit you?"

Of course, he couldn't hit me. It was all thanks to my second skill.

[Exclusive skill, Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint Lv. 1 has been activated!]

As soon as this skill was activated, I was able to observe Kim Namwoon's
attack direction like I was reading his inner thoughts. For example, like
this…
「 Right side. 」

I quickly moved away from the direction of the attack.

「Right eye. 」

Then I quickly bent down and avoided the flying fist.

"You really are good at not being hit!"

It was unreasonable to counterattack because I was poor at sports, but I
could at least avoid most of the attacks.

「 Left thigh. 」

This was enough to endure it. The important thing was to buy time. I
avoided Kim Namwoon's first and pointed at the clock in the air. "There are
two minutes left, Kid."

The distressed Kim Namwoon alternated looking between me and the
grandmother. "Dammit!"

At the moment of choice, Kim Namwoon's gaze was fixed on the
grandmother's side. I was forced to grab the grandmother and roll away. If
the grandmother died, Kim Namwoon would clear the scenario. No matter
what, I absolutely couldn't send this guy onto the next scenario.

"Haha, I knew you would move like that." As Kim Namwoon took
something out of his bag, I had an ominous feeling. A blade shone in the
fluorescent light. It was a portable MacGyver Knife. I had forgotten. This
person was a diehard military otaku.

There was a link between the technical skill 'Knife Fighting' and the
strengthening skill 'Blackening'. The direction that the blade was pointing
was obvious.
「Heart. 」

It was an attack that couldn't be avoided even if I knew the direction. So, I
made a quick judgment. If I couldn't avoid the attack, it was better to be hit
somewhere with minimal damage, if possible. Chiiiik! The blade narrowly
missed my heart and made a deep cut on my shoulder.

It hurt. It really hurt. There was a searing pain in my skin. My vision shook,
and it felt like death was approaching.

"Haha, now die!"

The time remaining to the end of the scenario was 1 minute and 30 seconds.
I glanced toward the grandmother. I was sorry for the grandmother, but
now I really had to use 'that'.

"Chungil High School, 2nd year, Kim Namwoon. I have one question for
you."

"…What?"

"Do you think an insect egg is a living thing?"

I took out the body of the grasshopper I had killed earlier from my pocket.
The plump egg-sac was clearly abundant. There was the sound of
something popping, and something fluid spilled out. The disgusting feeling
spread over my hand as I heard a message.

…

[You have killed a living thing.]

[100 coins have been earned as additional compensation.]

[You have killed a living thing.]

[100 coins have been earned as additional compensation.]
…

Multiple messages bombarded my ears. Kim Namwoon frowned. "Insect
egg? What the hell do you mean? Are you trying to waste time?"

"I guess so."

"How would I know something like that? I was always sleeping in Biology
class." Kim Namwoon looked at my bloody shoulder and laughed happily.
"But there is one thing I know for sure. Do you know what it is?"

"What is it?"

"You will die right now!" Kim Namwoon moved his Swiss Army knife
before I could answer. It was an attack that was hard to avoid.

[A large number of coins has been acquired! Do you want to check the coin
usage tips?]

I omitted the explanation that entered my ears. There was no need to listen
when I already knew the contents.

"No, it is you who will die," I spat out while inwardly muttering something
else.

[2,700 coins have been invested into 'physique'.]

[Physique Lv. 1 -> Physique Lv. 10]

[Your physique level has increased dramatically!]

[The durability of your body has greatly increased!]

Kim Namwoon's knife penetrated toward my heart. To be exact, it looked
like it was penetrating. My skin was like solid rock, and the only thing that
remained on it was a scratch. Kim Namwoon's eyes showed that he was
astonished. "How?"
"I'll tell you the correct answer to my question. The answer is: an egg is a
living thing."

"W-What?"

"And in spawning season, grasshoppers lay more than 100 eggs at a time."

Egg, living thing, 100…

Unfortunately, the time left to understand the meaning of the information
was too short for the schoolboy with a bad brain.

"What are you saying?"

"It doesn't matter if you don't understand. There is one minute left."

Now fear appeared on Kim Namwoon's face. "Aaaah! Die! Die!"

The knife moved toward my neck. I didn't even bother defending against
the attack.

Kakakang!

Was it because the area was more vulnerable than the chest? The wound
was a little deeper than before, but it still didn't hurt much.

"Kim Namwoon." Behind Kim Namwoon, there were people who were still
crawling and looking for insects, as well as those who were willing to hurt
each other for their own survival. "You are right. I am the same type of
human as you."

Maybe I could've saved some of those people.

"Shit! Why won't you die! Why won't you just die!"

55 seconds… 50 seconds… 45 seconds…
The knife kept leaving only scratches. Blood flowed but the blade couldn't
reach under the skin. There were 30 seconds left when Kim Namwoon
opened his mouth. He dropped the knife and knelt before me.

"S-Save me."

25 seconds.

"Save me! Please! Help me!"

"Why should I?"

20 seconds.

"P-People's lives are important! That's obvious!"

"That is the rule of the old world. It is just as you said. A new world
requires new laws."

10 seconds.

"I don't want to, I don't want to! I don't want to die! Aaaaaaack!"

5 seconds. Kim Namwoon ran at me with a loud scream and aimed for my
eye. The moment that the knife tried to dig at my retina…

[The given time has run out.]

There was a loud sound, and Kim Namwoon's head exploded.

[Paid settlement will begin.]

Beginning with Kim Namwoon, people's heads started exploding
everywhere.

One, two, three, four…
The bursting heads were like fireworks announcing a new era. I watched
the scene with a bit of joy, a bit of guilt, and a mysterious feeling. Why?
Why was I so calm at the sight in front of me? It was like I was looking at a
novel.

[You have killed 124 living things.]

[Kill History: One grasshopper, 123 grasshopper eggs.]

[You have killed non-resistance living things, so the number of coins you
have acquired is reduced by half.]

[6,200 coins have been acquired!]

[The number of coins used for the stats level up is automatically
subtracted.]

[You have a total of 3,500 coins.]

[The 'Mass Murderer' achievement has been gained through excessive
killing.]

My face could be seen on the darkened window of the carriage.

It was a face I had never seen before, despite looking into the mirror
countless times in my life. I wiped at the blood on my cheeks. The blood
wasn't erased. It turned out to be blood on the window.

Kkiiik.

There was a lurching feeling, and the train started to move again. It made
the familiar train noise.

Soon, light flooded in, and darkness was lifted from the windows. We had
arrived at the surface ground section of Line 3 between Apgujeong and
Oksu.
Outside the window, the Han River and Seoul were revealed.

Ahh. Someone let out a moan. It was a moan which contained deep relief
that they survived.

However, it didn't take long for the meaning of that moan to change. Ah,
ah…

The landscape outside the window was no longer the Seoul that they knew.
Smoke and dust rose from the ruined city.

The Han River bridges had collapsed. The Han River itself was red with the
bodies of soldiers, while among the fallen buildings, a monster was
trampling on a K1 tank like it was a toy.

[Main Scenario #1 – Proof of Value has ended.]

[300 coins have been acquired as a basic clearance reward.]

[100 coins have been reduced for the channel usage fee.]

[Additional compensation settlement will begin.]

One world was destroyed, and a new world was born.

…And I was the only reader who knew the ending of this world.

                   Chapter 7: Ep. 2 – Protagonist, I


The subway train stopped around halfway past Dongho Bridge.

"Oh my god…"

Several survivors stood up and looked at the scene taking place outside—
the ruined Seoul and the collapsed buildings. Monsters reminiscent of a
giant snake were eating the wreckage of a fighter jet that had crashed into
the Han River.

"W-What the hell…!"

I recognized their identity at once. An ichthyosaur. A monster that was
commonly called a sea serpent, it would later be classified as a 7th grade
monster in the world of Ways of Survival. One of the ichthyosaurs looked
in this direction.

"U-Uwaaah! It is coming!"
People screamed with fright. However, I just looked apathetically at the
approaching ichthyosaur. These guys couldn't be a threat. The ichthyosaur
circled around the bottom of Dongho Bridge and vanished into an air
bubble. In the world of Ways of Survival, 'scenarios' took precedence over
anything else. As long as we were protected by the scenario, we wouldn't
have to deal with such monsters straight away. At least for now.

[Compensation settlement is delayed due to an unexpected scenario check.
Please wait.]

The compensation settlement should've started right now but only an error
message floated in the air. It was probably due to me. I looked down at Kim
Namwoon's body which only had the torso remaining. According to the
original Ways of Survival, Kim Namwoon killed most of the people in this
carriage and moved on to the next scenario.

However, I stopped it. If my thoughts were right, those who would be angry
at Kim Namwoon's death would appear. Here? Not here. They were in the
sky above.

[Due to the death of character 'Kim Namwoon', two constellations show a
faint hostility towards you.]

Constellations. They were mysterious beings in Ways of Survival. They sat
watching from the distant nebulas and were the masterminds of this
tragedy. Once the constellation's preferences notification appeared, I
realized that it was now starting in earnest.

It was funny. A day ago, our positions were opposite. Now they were the
ones watching me.

[A handful of constellations admire your scenario.]

[Constellations have sponsored you 500 coins.]
If there were some constellations who disliked me, there would also be
some who liked me. Either way, it was an uncomfortable situation.
However, I couldn't do anything about them right now. It was my turn to be
a clown. I picked up Kim Namwoon's Swiss Army knife on the ground and
thought— feel free to watch. They will end up paying the admission fee
with their lives.

"…Dokja-ssi? Are you okay?"

I looked up and saw Yoo Sangah's face. Her shoulders were sagging. Blood
covered her white blouse and there was a run in her stockings. The Yoo
Sangah I knew was gone. I held Yoo Sangah's hand and said, "I'm sorry. I
couldn't save the grandmother."

I looked down at the body of the grandmother that was missing its head. I
didn't know the name of the grandmother. In the future, many people would
die in a similar manner. Yoo Sangah looked at me with a complicated gaze.

"How is Dokja-ssi so…"

"Yes?"

"Ah, it is nothing. Rather… Thank you."

"What do you mean?"

"That, I…"

I belatedly thought back to the previous scene. I had thrown the net in Yoo
Sangah's direction. I knew what she was thinking and said, "It was just a
coincidence. It won't happen twice."

"Ah…" Yoo Sangah nodded silently. She didn't know the truth but she was
smart. She knew what I meant. Someone lived because of my choice and
someone else died. No matter how she survived, I didn't deserve a thank
you.
[Wow, amazing.]

The dokkaebi appeared in the air.

[What on earth happened here? I was just watching the other carriages…]

There was a mixture of delight and surprise on the dokkaebi's face.
Twinkling stars floated over the dokkaebi's head. I counted the number of
stars. One, two, three… Twenty, twenty one. Twenty one in total. He would
be happy.

[For 21 people to be connected to my channel… Haha, isn't this quite good?
Gosh, thank you for your sponsorship. Constellations. Haha, everyone! Did
you properly show off your value?]

The number of stars meant the number of constellations connected to the
channel. 21 wasn't a lot, but it was a strange number for a beginner
dokkaebi.

[The number of survivors is quite high? The fellow in the next carriage was
a nutter as well… It seems that things are quite interesting today.]

The dokkaebi manipulated something in the air. A moment later, a list of
survivors came up.

[Survivors from the 3434 Train to Bulgwang, Carriage 3807: Kim Dokja,
Lee Hyunsung, Yoo Sangah, Han Myungoh and Lee Gilyoung. A total of
five survivors.]

Five people. There were more survivors than I thought. I looked at the faces
of the survivors one by one.

Lee Hyunsung had a good physique and excellent motor skills, so it was
expected that he would survive. I even expected Yoo Sangah to survive—to
a certain extent. Additionally, there was Lee Gilyoung. If my guess was
right, 'Lee Gilyoung' was the name of the boy standing next to me. The
fluid of the crushed grasshopper was still on the boy's hands. He squeezed
the grasshopper I had given him.

The boy was looking at his mother, who lost her head. The boy's mother
had abandoned him to join in on killing the grandmother. The boy had just
watched the whole thing from beginning to end. I hesitated for a moment
before touching the boy's shoulder. It wasn't foolish sympathy. To put it
simply, this was…

That's right. Hypocrisy.

"Kid." The boy slowly turned his head and in his eyes, I could see the fear
of death that he experienced for the first time in his life. It was an
unavoidable instinct. This boy wasn't grieving his mother's death. He was
just afraid of his own death. It was natural. He was human. "Do you want to
live?"

The boy's eyes shook anxiously. His body trembled with a force that
couldn't be resisted. Then little by little, the boy's head moved.

"Then let's go together."

Lee Gilyoung moved slowly and came close to my legs. Yoo Sangah was
watching me with an impressed expression. I unintentionally caused
another misunderstanding. In fact, it was meant to be seen. However, the
target wasn't Yoo Sangah.

[A few constellations are impressed with your good deed.]

[Constellations have sponsored you 200 coins.]

I couldn't help thinking that it was a low move, but I also wanted to live.
Given the upcoming major events, it was essential to draw the attention of
the constellations right now.
"W-Will you release us now? Didn't you get what you wanted?" Han
Myungoh, whose shirt was torn, shouted from half a dozen steps away.

Department Head Han Myungoh. He was a lucky human. I couldn't help
wondering: Why was Han Myungoh riding the subway when he had so
much money? This was the man who had shown off a new Mercedes-Benz
S-Class not long ago.

[Hrmm, release? Haven't you looked outside? Do you really want to go out
there?] The dokkaebi chuckled. [It is somehow admirable. In fact, I didn't
expect much from this carriage but you managed to pass the first scenario.
This proves that even bugs deserve to survive.]

His words made us realize our position. Maybe we were like grasshoppers
in his eyes.

[Now now, shouldn't there be a reward for overcoming the hardships? As a
reward for the first scenario, you are entitled to the sponsorship of the
'constellations'. Waahhh! How about it? Aren't you looking forward to it?
Hmm, you are all unenthusiastic. This is really a big deal.]

The reaction was natural—I was the only one here who knew what
'constellation' or 'sponsorship' was. The sponsorship of the constellations.
The meaning was obvious. One of the key events of Ways of Survival,
'Sponsor Selection' was about to begin.

[Hmm, everybody has confused expressions. I can easily tell you. Right
now, you are incredibly weak. If you are thrown into the scenarios that will
take place, you will be killed when you meet a weak ground rat, let alone a
'kruk'. Benevolently, there are some great people in the universe who pity
you and would like to sponsor you. Do you understand what I am saying?]

Lee Hyunsung finally couldn't stand it anymore and opened his mouth,
"What are you saying? Who is sponsoring whom…"
[Hmm, my words are just entering dirty ears. Isn't there an old saying in
South Korea? It is better to see it once than listen a hundred times. So
experience it directly. Well, the less fortunate ones might not get the
chance. Hahaha!]

I was tense. From now on—a good choice here would make my survival in
the future easier.

"Dokja-ssi? Two strange choices suddenly appeared in front of me…"

"I don't know even if you ask me."

This was naturally a lie to avoid suspicions. By the way, there were two
choices. Yoo Sangah was quite lucky.

"Do it comfortably. Think of it as an aptitude test."

"Aptitude test…"

"Nobody knows what the situation is anyway. Why not do it comfortably?"
"Ah… I understand."

Yoo Sangah closed her mouth and started staring into space. It was a
profound expression, as if she had encountered something curious. The
others suddenly became silent. Everyone was reading the options in front of
them. I also had my own choices to look at.

[Sponsor Selection]

–Please select your sponsor

–Your chosen sponsor will be your strong supporter.

  1.       Abyssal Black Flame Dragon

  2.       Demon-like Judge of Fire
  3.         Secretive Plotter

  4.         Prisoner of the Golden Headband.

There were four choices like a riddle. It meant there were four
constellations that wanted to turn me into their incarnation. Four choices
wasn't small considering that the protagonist of Ways of Survival received
five options the first time.

The constellations never revealed their true name. Therefore, all contractors
must infer the identity of the constellations by words such as 'abyssal',
'demonic' and 'garden'. Of course, this puzzle was nothing to me, the sole
reader of Ways of Survival.

Let's see.

First, the 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon'. According to my memory, this
constellation was a powerful entity that led the group of constellations
called the Black Cloud. I forgot his real name but I remember it was a very
long name. The advantage of this constellation was that the contractor
could receive a very strong attack power. In the early days when physique
and strength were in urgent need, there was no constellation as strong as the
Abyssal Black Flame Dragon.

Of course, that was limited to the beginning. As the power of this
constellation was more frequently used, the mind became corrupted and the
contractor would become a mad murderer. This constellation usually
sponsored the people with the 'chuuni' attribute… I didn't know why the
constellation picked me.

I felt uncomfortable and excluded this guy.

The second one, the Demon-like Judge of Fire. I couldn't believe I was
actually seeing this option. Somehow, the strong emotions I felt were
enormous. At first glance, the name was overflowing with evil. However,
this was actually a trap for the wicked. The 'Demon-like' actually meant 'not
a demon'. Then the words 'fire' and 'judge' were added.

A being who wasn't a demon and who made judgments through fire.
Paradoxically, the identity of this constellation was an angel. If I recalled
corrected, it was Archangel Uriel… In fact, I remembered this because
someone in the novel picked this constellation as a sponsor.

It was a pretty decent choice. This was pending. The constellations of
'absolute good' imposed ridiculous constraints if you wanted to use their
enormous power.

The third, Secretive Plotter. It was the first time that I, the sole reader of
Ways of Survival, had seen this choice. This name might've been
mentioned in passing but… I didn't know it right now. If I could read Ways
of Survival more thoroughly then I might get a feel of the constellation.

However, I was certain that the owner of this constellation wasn't a very
strong entity. Apart from the obvious modifier, there wasn't one 'proper
noun'. Secretive Plotter, it was too simple for a constellation. This one was
also pending.

Finally, there was Prisoner of the Golden Headband. My heart jumped the
moment I saw the fourth option. I didn't expect this constellation to appear
so early. I doubted my eyes several times. Yet it was unmistakably 'Prisoner
of the Golden Headband'. At first glance, this name gave off a negative
image due to the word 'prisoner'. However, you had to pay attention to
'Golden Headband'.

Golden Headband. The smallest prison in the world. It was a hint that
anyone would recognize if they enjoyed reading Journey to the West as a
child. There was only one prisoner who was held captive by the golden
headband in the journey from east to west.
The master of the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit, who lived in suffering
due to the shackle on his head. The Handsome Monkey King with the
'goldengaze, fiery-eyes'. The Great Sage, Heaven's Equal, Sun Wukong.

Among the characters that appeared in the novel, there was one supported
by Sun Wukong. A wondrous power that could sweep through hundreds of
incarnations and to kill thousands with one lightning strike. The author had
described this part with a lot of energy so my memory of it was clear.

I didn't know why such a powerful constellation was showing me interest
but if I became the incarnation of the Great Sage, Heaven's Equal, I would
be able to survive in this new world more easily than anyone else.
However…

I quickly looked at the door connected to the carriage in front. Beyond that
door, 'he' was looking at the selection screen like me. If I chose The Great
Sage, Heaven's Equal… Could I win against him?

[There is one minute left to complete the Sponsor Selection.]

Time was running out. I breathed lightly and looked through my options.
My worries didn't last long.
                  Chapter 8: Ep. 2 – Protagonist, II


[Sponsor Selection has ended.]

I took a deep breath as I watched the messages floating in the air.

[Some constellations are greatly affected by your choice.]

Yes, it was starting now.

[The constellation 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' is greatly displeased at
your choice.]

[Constellations belonging to Black Cloud are shaken by the anger of the
Abyssal Black Flame Dragon. You won't be sponsored by any of the Black
Cloud constellations for a while.]

I wasn't surprised because it was an expected message. To make every
member of his group turn away because he was rejected…it seemed that
this guy was Kim Namwoon's sponsor in the original work. As expected of
the incarnation of this constellation.

[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' is disappointed in you.]

[She will persistently monitor your justice in the future.]

In the case of Archangel Uriel, it was just disappointment. In the first place,
the constellations of absolute good would rarely hate someone unless they
committed a great injustice.

[The constellation 'Secretive Plotter' is interested in your choice.]

[200 coins have been sponsored.]

The Secretive Plotter's case was unexpected. Given the characteristics of
the name, maybe he valued my caution.

[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' is interested in your
choice.]

As for the Great Sage, Heaven's Equal…

I was concerned. Did I make the right choice? I didn't know. Maybe I had
lost the tremendous opportunity right in front of me.

[You haven't selected a sponsor.]

However, choosing a certain constellation meant being limited by that
possibility. The sponsor contract was never a fair deal. I would survive, but
I would've survived by being their toy. If my expectations were right, there
was a way to become strong without a constellation. Maybe it was a way to
become stronger than the incarnation of the strongest sponsor.

[Haha, is this true…isn't there one interesting choice? Well, yes. There will
be another chance.] The dokkaebi's crescent moon eyes stayed on me for a
moment. [Now now, everyone has finished the selection. Rest here for a
while. I have to go prepare the next scenario. I'll see you in 10 minutes!]

After the Sponsor Selection finished, the dokkaebi disappeared. He told us
to rest, but these 10 minutes were really crucial. In 10 minutes, I needed to
sort out this situation and prepare for the following scenarios. I tried to
recall my abilities in my head.

[Character List] and [Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint]. I didn't know the
precise use yet but I had a general sense of these skills. This would work
somehow.

"Let's all gather together." The survivors gathered at my words. The first
one to reach out a hand was Lee Hyunsung.

"Hello, I am Lee Hyunsung."

"Kim Dokja."

"Nice to meet you…although I don't know if these words suit the situation.
As I said earlier, I am a soldier…well, I should say that I was a soldier."

"Can't you contact your unit?"

"…Yes."

The grip around my hand was considerable. As expected from the tanker
that appeared in the early stages of Ways of Survival. I must take Lee
Hyunsung with me. He might not look like much now but Lee Hyunsung
was an increasingly important figure in the latter parts of Ways of Survival.

"Ah, Dokja-ssi."

"Yes?"

"I wanted to thank you. If it wasn't for Dokja-ssi, we would all be dead."
"No, that isn't the case."

"Even if I had lived, I wouldn't have been able to live as a person. Thank
you very much. And…I am ashamed." Lee Hyunsung bowed deeply.

My mind was a bit complicated. In fact, Lee Hyunsung would've survived
even if I didn't do anything. Then somebody grabbed my shoulder.

"Haha, our contractor did one big thing. Dokja-ssi, do you know my
name?"

I could tell who it was without looking back. I took the hand off my
shoulder and said, "I know, Han Myungoh-ssi."

"Huh, Han Myungoh-ssi? Shouldn't you call me Department Head?"

Han Myungoh was still trying to use his position in this situation. He really
was the king of authoritarianism in Mino Soft.

"This isn't the company."

"Hah, look at this. Are you planning not to go to work now? Where did you
learn your basic etiquette?"

Once I saw Han Myungoh's angry face, I once again realized that the world
I knew was over. The man in front of me was a 'predator' of the world
before the scenario began and I was merely a prey to the predator. It had
certainly been like that.

"No matter how I think about it, your actions were too much. Yes? If you
had the insects then you should've tipped me off. Why would you throw
them like that?"

"…"

"Dokja-ssi, you have to be good to me. How much time do you have left on
your contract?"
All of a sudden, it became ridiculous. In the world I previously lived in, I
was too fragile. "Han Myungoh-ssi."

"Eh?"

"Shut up."

"W-What?"

"You still don't understand the situation? Weren't you hit by that bastard
earlier? Mino Soft? Do you think the company still exists when the end has
come?"

Han Myungoh's face was white and stricken. I turned my eyes towards the
other people. Since I was already saying it, I should make it stick. "Han
Myungoh-ssi isn't the only problem. Everyone, you need to wake up. As the
dokkaebi said, this isn't a joke."

"…"

"I think you should've all roughly noticed the situation. Exclusive skills in
the attributes window. A game-like interface. Is there anyone who still
hasn't caught onto facts?"

Indeed, no one raised their hand. It was easy to understand for a South
Korean. Due to the high penetration rate of smartphones, there wasn't one
person who hadn't played a RPG game. Even if they hadn't played a game,
they would've read a fantasy novel at least once.

Lee Hyunsung sighed, "This is like a novel I was reading while standing on
duty, but I still can't feel it. This really isn't a dream?"

"This is reality."

My stern answer caused Lee Hyunsung's eyes to slightly change.

[The character 'Lee Hyunsung' feels a faint trust in you.]
[Your understanding of the character 'Lee Hyunsung' has increased.]

Lee Hyunsung nodded. "It is good that you are certain. Then what do we do
now? Dokja-ssi, do you have an opinion?"

"We have to go." I answered without hesitation.

"G-Go? Are you insane?"

"Dokja-ssi, I don't think…" This time, Yoo Sangah joined in. It seemed
everyone still hadn't woken up.

"Then how long we will stay here?" In fact, my argument didn't make much
sense. Outside was a haven of monsters. However, I knew. Right now, we
have to get out of here. "Have you thought about your parents? Do you
think your parents are safe in this mess?"

"T-The line has been dead for some time. No Kakaotalk…" Yoo Sangah
cried out desperately. Indeed, Confucianism was still strong in South
Korea. Even Lee Hyunsung and Han Myungoh's expressions darkened at
the word 'parents'.

I grasped Lee Gilyoung's shoulder, whose head was bowed. The first person
to get up was Yoo Sangah.

"Go. I will go out."

"N-No! Didn't you hear what that thing said? Take a break here! If we
move then our heads might explode!" Han Myungoh cried out desperately.

"Let's take a majority vote."

Yoo Sangah raised her hand first, followed by me and Lee Gilyoung.
However, it was up to there.

Lee Hyunsung said, "…I have to go to my base but it seems dangerous to
move in this situation. There was also the warning."
"Shit, you all go by yourselves! I'm not going! I'm not going outside!"

I didn't care about Han Myungoh but the problem was Lee Hyunsung. I
had to take Lee Hyunsung with me no matter what… Kuuong!

The thick iron plate made a loud sound. The iron door to carriage 3707 was
slightly distorted.

"W-What?" Han Myungoh's cry was ignored as the iron door made a
deafening sound again.

Kuuong!

Someone was trying to break the door from beyond it. This was an
unexpected situation so I had to think. Was it the next scenario? No. The
dokkaebi hadn't come back yet. Then…

My brain moved quickly. Small hairs stood up and a short shiver struck my
body. It was that guy.

"W-What? Everybody stop it!" Han Myungoh shouted and moved towards
the door. Lee Hyunsung moved towards it as well but I stopped him.

"You can't stop it."

"Huh?"

"We have to go."

I looked at the iron door with heavy eyes.

"Huh? But…"

"If we don't go now―"

The only survivor of carriage 3707. I was well aware of who was beyond
the iron door.
"We will all die before the next scenario arrives."

Yes, that guy was finally coming. The 'real' protagonist of this story.
                  Chapter 9: Ep. 2 – Protagonist, III


I stared straight into Lee Hyunsung and Han Myungoh's eyes and said, "Do
you want to die from that guy beyond the iron door or do you want to try
your luck outside the train? Which one will you choose?"

"U-Uh…"

"Dokja-ssi, is there any guarantee that the person beyond the iron door is an
enemy?"

The Steel Sword appeared at the crucial moment. There was a reason why
Lee Hyunsung couldn't be leader of a party.

"Since they are coming from another carriage, it is likely to be a survivor. If
we meet…" I looked at the bloody room instead of continuing.

Lee Hyunsung followed my gaze and quietly spoke, "…I was too careless.
Let's find a way out."
"G-Go! Go quickly!"

At this moment, Han Myungoh and Lee Hyunsung were aware. The other
survivors of the carriages would've gone through the same thing as them.
They wouldn't have had the good luck of finding 'insects'.

"This is broken!"

"Damn, we can't go this way!"

While listening to Lee Hyunsung and Han Myungoh's cries, I also checked
the doors. There were no more barriers so the doors could now be touched.
Apart from the doors connecting the passageways, there were a total of
eight access doors on the subway. There were three exits that hadn't been
confirmed yet.

The iron door seemed like it could barely hold on for one minute. Despite
being the main character, I didn't think he would have such high strength in
the beginning. I was honestly surprised that he could break such a thick iron
door.

"Dokja-ssi! Here―"

I found a working manual switchgear.

"No!" The opening and closing device worked smoothly but the door didn't
open at once. They door opened around one fifth before stopping like it was
jammed. "…It seems to be broken here as well."

"How about other places?"

"This seems to be the only place where we can escape."

It was unknown for a child. But the gap was too narrow for men and
women to escape. Han Myungoh and Lee Hyunsung tried to pull the doors
open but they didn't move a bit.
[Coins Possessed: 4700 C]

One of the uses of the coins was to raise overall stats. I had already used
2,700 coins to make my physique level 10. This problem could be resolved

if I used the remaining coins to enhance my strength. But it wasn't wise to
use the coins when the situation was unknown. In the end, there was only
one way.

"Lee Hyunsung-ssi. Use a skill."

"Huh? "Skill…"

I quietly activated Character List.

[The exclusive skill, Character List is activated.]
  [Character Summary ]

  Name: Lee Hyunsung

  Age: 28 years old.

  Sponsor: Master of Steel.

  Exclusive Attributes: Soldier who Turned a Blind Eye to Injustice
  (General )

  Exclusive Skills: Bayonet Skills Lv. 2, Camouflage Lv. 2, Patience Lv.
  2.

  Stigma: Great Mountain Push Lv. 1

  Overall Stats: Physique Lv. 8, Strength Lv. 8, Agility Lv. 7, Magic
  Power Lv. 5.

  Overall Evaluation: The overall stats are very good. Despite turning
  away from injustice, he received the choice of a constellation. This is
  another opportunity for him.



Lee Hyunsung's information came to my mind without any restrictions.
Fortunately, the sponsor was the same as what I read in Ways of Survival.
"You should've checked it when you opened the attributes window. Lee
Hyunsung is a soldier so there must be a skill you can use in this situation."

"Well…I have one but how do I use it―"

"Just think about using the skill."

"…Will that work?"
"It will. I did it earlier."

Lee Hyunsung didn't say anything else as he took a deep breath of
determination.

"Haaap!" Lee Hyunsung's biceps swelled as he grabbed the door. It was the
appearance of Great Mountain Push. In fact, Great Mountain Push wasn't a
skill but a 'stigma'. And a stigma was a power from the constellation. I used
the word 'skill' in order to avoid suspicions.

Dudududu.

There was a sound like a huge spring turning and the door started to move.

"What? This guy has real strength!"

"That's it! It is really great!"

[The character 'Lee Hyunsung' has started to trust you.]

[Your understanding of the character 'Lee Hyunsung' has increased.]

Rather than doubts, my reliability had risen. Lee Hyunsung was a simpler
person than I thought.

"Come on, get off!"

I felt relieved and handed Lee Gilyoung to Lee Hyunsung. "Lee
Hyunsungssi. Carry the child on your back."

"I understand."

Now the iron door was almost broken. But if my prediction was right, the
problem right now wasn't that iron door.
[…Ah, this is really. I knew this would happen. Didn't I saw it earlier? I
told you not to go anywhere, Damn! The scenario isn't ready yet-]

The dokkaebi seemed to be angry as it floated over Dongho Bridge.

"Wahh! I knew this would happen! I told you not to come out!" Han
Myungoh wrapped a hand around his head, like he thought it would
explode. But there was no need to worry.

[Sigh…it can't be helped. You are really lucky humans.]

It was because the second scenario started the moment the train door was
opened.

[The second scenario has arrived!]

  Clear Conditions: Cross the broken bridge and enter Oksu Station.

  Time Limit: 20 minutes.

  Compensation: 200 coins.

  Failure: ???


"Dokja-ssi, something is strange. It says the 'broken bridge' but the bridge is
still…"

"Don't worry and just run! Quickly!"
"U-Understood!"

In fact, Yoo Sangah was right. The bridge hadn't been broken yet. In other
words, the 'bridge was going to be broken'.

"Dokja-ssi, come quickly!"

"I'm coming."

It hadn't been broken yet because we got off the train 'too soon'. The
dokkaebi said the preparation time was 10 minutes. But we escaped three
minutes earlier. Some people might call it cowardly but this scenario
couldn't be cleared without such a shortcut. Especially if I was stuck with
burdens such as Yoo Sangah and Lee Gilyoung.

"Pant, pant. Indeed, Lee Hyunsung-ssi is a soldier and has high stamina."

"Don't open your mouth. You will lose strength."

Lee Hyunsung was running first with the kid. He was a natural monster
who didn't invest any coins in his stats, yet the sum of his strength,
physique, and agility exceeded 23. The next one was Han Myungoh and
then Yoo Sangah with me in the rear. It would be close but I thought we
could make it in time.

"Ah, what is that?" At this time, Han Myungoh's scream was heard. There
was a huge whirlpool in the center of Han River, letting out splashes of
water. A giant monster was at the center of the splashes. It was an
ichthyosaur. The problem was that the ichthyosaur seemed to be twice the
size of the one I saw through the window.

This wasn't a sea serpent…it was a sea commander. A general sea serpent
was only a 7th grade monster. Given that a 9th grade monster, the ground
rat was difficult for normal humans to cope with, an average human would
be torn apart by a 7th grade monster.
In other words, the guy coming now wasn't a monster that could be caught
in the early stages. Of course, there was no need to catch it. It wasn't
created to be caught. The Han River surged like there was a tsunami and the
ichthyosaur moved. It was chewing on the legs of the bridge.

"The bridge is breaking!"

"Run! If we run then we can cross it!"

The remaining distance was around 200 meters. If my calculations were
correct, we could cross before the bridge collapsed at our current speed.

[There is no fun if the game is too easy.]

Of course, this was a story for when there were no variables.

[The scenario difficulty has been adjusted.]

[Scenario difficulty: E -> D]

The sound of the dokkaebi's laughter was heard.

[Is there any fun if you just run away? Let's create a bit of atmosphere!]

[The evil thoughts of the dead have returned.]

[The surrounding earth is filled with black ether.]

[The demonic people have woken up!]

There was the sound of something chasing us from behind. Yoo Sangah
muttered to herself.

"Z-Zombies?"

Zombie-like bodies were coming in huge waves. Some of them were people
from the same carriage as us.
"We just need to go a little further! Quickly!"

The distance to the ichthyosaur was now less than a hundred meters.
Fortunately, Lee Hyunsung carried Lee Gilyoung and had crossed the
safety line. The problem was the rest of us, including me. Han Myungoh
shrieked, "Y-You bastards!"

There were too many demonic people. If there were only corpses from the
subway, we might've gotten away. The problem was…

"Kuweeeoooh!"

The drivers who died on the bridge became demonic people. The path that
Lee Hyunsung broke through was covered with demonic people. I looked
between the demonic people on the road and the approaching ichthyosaur.

"…Everybody get down."

It was too late.

Kwaaaaang!

The legs of the bridge shook tremendously as the ichthyosaur's huge mouth
bit it. The scales of the ichthyosaur shone through the dust that poured
down onto Han River like rain. A fishy smell of blood and water filled the
area. I staggered and raised my body. Once the dust went away, the scenery
around me was clear. Piles of shattered concrete and cut steel. The
carcasses of the demonic people which the ichthyosaur had cleanly bitten
through. The legs of the bridge were broken.

"…Dok…ssi…kay?"

Yoo Sangah and Han Myungoh raised their bodies from a little further
away. One of Han Myungoh's legs seemed injured and uncomfortable from
the previous quake. Lee Hyunsung and Lee Gilyoung cried out from across
the bridge but their voices seemed blocked by the safety zone.
What should I do? I made plans on the basis of the bridge breaking. But I
hadn't expected Han Myungoh and Yoo Sangah to be with me. At that
moment, a voice was heard in the air.

[Someone has received the favour of a constellation.]

[The constellation's scenario 'Deus Ex Machina' has been activated.]

Along with the voice, a brilliant bridge made of light was created among
the remnants of the broken Dongho Bridge. Then a message floated in front
of me.


 [Deus Ex Machina – Even Bridge]

 Description: A bridge of light made by a constellation. Only an 'even'
 number of people can cross the bridge. The bridge will disappear as
 soon as an 'odd' number of people tries to cross it.


"Dokja-ssi. This, in my head, suddenly―"

I met the eyes of Yoo Sangah, who was talking nonsense. I could roughly
guess the situation. Deus Ex Machina. Constellations risked a huge loss by
intervening in a scenario.

"…It is Yoo Sangah-ssi's sponsor."

I didn't know what constellation it was but somebody had chosen Yoo
Sangah as their incarnation and wanted her to live. Deus Ex Machina was a
rare phenomenon in Ways of Survival. In addition, Yoo Sangah was a
person who should've already died.

I had a moment of doubt. What type of constellation was behind Yoo
Sangah?
[The information of this person can't be read in 'Character List'.]

[This person isn't registered in 'Character List'.]

I was a bit surprised. I couldn't see her with my skill? Why? Did she have a
special background? Or did she have a mental barrier? But if she had
something like that from the beginning…no, wait a minute. Perhaps this
was…

"Dokja-ssi, what do we do now?" I heard Yoo Sangah's bewildered voice. I
didn't have much time to think. The Han River was swirling. The
ichthyosaur had eaten one bridge leg and was turning its huge body around
on the other side of Han River. I bit my lips and once again read the
explanation of the bridge.

Only an 'even' number of people could cross the bridge. In the end, 'Deus
Ex Machina' was a toy made by the damn constellations who loved
tragedies. There was no way for everyone to survive. Han Myungoh's body
was shaking as his eyes met mine. In the end, somebody must die.
                 Chapter 10: Ep. 2 – Protagonist, IV


At this moment, Yoo Sangah shouted, "Dokja-ssi! Behind you!"

I reflexively leaned forward as a bloody fist came flying through the air. It
was a familiar fist covered with energy. I felt something falling towards me
and instinctively kicked out. I didn't need to look back to know what was
behind me.

A 9th grade human type, demonic person. Human mutants infected with
black ether. That's why demonic people were classified as a high-risk
species, despite being 9th grade. Demonic people made from a normal
human base were no different from zombies, but it was particularly
dangerous if their hosts were different.

I saw the badge of the school student with a damaged head.

"…Kim Namwoon."
The guy whose head burst a few minutes ago was now aiming for me as a
demonic person. Kim Namwoon's vocal cords that burst out were in a
bizarre shape.

"Kuweeeoooh."

[Exclusive skill, Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint Lv. 1 has been activated!]

[This person doesn't have any consciousness. The skill Omniscient Reader's
Viewpoint will be cancelled.]

Damn, it was as expected. My thigh was scratched by Kim Namwoon's
overgrown black fingernails. A pain that felt like a burn spread through my
leg. The skin which hadn't been cut by a knife was now torn by fingernails.
This was the main reason why demonic people were dangerous. The
demonic people became several times stronger than when they were human.

"Yoo Sangah-ssi, immediately―" I felt something as I spoke. Without
looking back, I could see what was going on.

"Let me go! Let go! Dokja-ssi! Dokja-ssi!"

Han Myungoh, who had just been limping, was carrying Yoo Sangah over
one shoulder and moving across the bridge at an astonishing rate.

[The constellation 'Secretive Plotter' admires how easy you are to trick.]

[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' is impressed with your
sacrifice.]

[100 coins have been sponsored.]

…Indeed. Planning to leave me? By the way, the way he was running was a
little strange. Despite being on one leg, he was running as fast as an
Olympic athlete. This couldn't be the exclusive skill of Han Myungoh, who
had a big belly. Therefore, it must be the stigma of his sponsor.
I already knew the constellation who provided that stigma. It was the
Onelegged Swift Horse. I used Character List on the distant Han Myungoh.

[The information of this person can't be read in 'Character List'.]

Once again, Character List didn't work properly. If I remembered correctly,
the stigma of 'One-legged Swift Horse' came from the constellation Lame
Trickster. Lame Trickster didn't give any stigmas in the mental barrier
system. In addition, Han Myungoh couldn't possess such a skill from the
beginning. In other words, my skill failed not because of Han Myungoh's
ability.

…I was stupid. I looked at the message window floating in front of me and
laughed.

[This person isn't registered in 'Character List'.]

I was thinking too hard when it meant literally that. Character List literally
read the information of characters. Yoo Sangah and Han Myungoh were
characters who didn't originally appear in Ways of Survival. They were
people who would've died if I hadn't saved them. It was natural that I
couldn't confirm their information with Character List.

"Gruk! Gruk! Gruk!"

On one side, the incoming Kim Namwoon and demonic people were
jabbering nonsense at me. On the other side, Han Myungoh was already
halfway across the bridge. Lee Hyunsung and Lee Gilyoung had already
entered the safety zone across the bridge so I couldn't ask for help from
them.

This was truly a predicament. I couldn't cross the bridge alone. My brain
moved quickly. Should I capture one of the demonic people and cross the
bridge? It was worth trying, but the success rate was too low. Unlike the
name, the demonic people were categorized as non-human, meaning they
didn't count as a person.
"Kuaaaack!"

Several demonic people lost their balance and fell down the bridge. The
fallen demonic people became the food of the ichthyosaur. Like a piranha,
the ichthyosaur broke the demonic people into dozens of pieces in an
instant.
Distant fear came flooding back in.

If the number of people on the bridge became 'odd' for even a moment, I
would be like them. It was impossible to cross alone. Then?

"…Let's take it slow." I muttered as I attempted to control myself. Right
now, I needed to remain calm. There were still a few usable methods, but
the important thing was to handle matters in front of me. I controlled my
breathing and walked to the demonic people.

"Kuweeok?"

Fortunately, it wasn't difficult to make them fall down the bridge using
inertia. I reduced their numbers by making them fall steadily. The
dokkaebi's stopwatch floating in the air was blinking. The time remaining
before the scenario ended was 15 minutes.

"Sigh…"

Nails flew from a blind spot and pierced my shoulder bone. No matter how
calm my mind, no matter how much information I knew, I couldn't help my
untrained body.

"Kuwoooook!" The wild Kim Namwoon's attacks were becoming
increasingly faster.

Left shoulder.

The right thigh.
The top of the head.

I had to break the flow. I barely avoided the flying fingernails and kicked
his legs.

"Kyah?"

This person lost all senses and wasn't hurt at all. I stepped back, hitting a
broken steel frame. I could hear the raging sound of the ichthyosaur at the
bottom of the pillars.

[A few constellations are rejoicing in your adversity.]

[Constellations have sponsored you 200 coins.]

It was a steady accumulation of coins. Now I held 5,000 coins. It was a
significant number of coins for the beginning.

[Wow, you are quite good at surviving. Now now! Will any constellations
help this poor friend?] It was the dokkaebi's merchant-like voice.

I wanted to tear it apart.

[Geez, there is really nobody?]

Of course. It would be strange for a constellation to support me after what
happened during the Sponsor Selection.

[What did I say? You should've chosen well when you had the chance. How
pitiful.]

Kim Namwoon attacked me again and again, resulting in damage to my
waist. Of course, I also injured Kim Namwoon's left side with the knife.
Thanks to that, his stomach was hanging out like a skipping rope. In order
to kill a demonic person, I had to completely destroy the heart. However,
the skin of a demonic person was hardest near the heart. The Swiss Army
knife wasn't able to pierce it with sharpness alone.
Dammit, it wouldn't be so hard if I had just one combat skill.

[The exclusive skill 'Bookmark' is activated.]

…Bookmark?

['Character Bookmarks' is activated.]

[Available Bookmark Slots: 3]

[Bringing up the list of available bookmarks.]


  [People Listed in the Bookmark Slots]

  1. The Delusion Demon Kim Namwoon (Understanding25).

  2. Steel Sword Lee Hyunsung (Understanding 35).

  3. Empty slot.


Bookmark. I've read over 3,000 chapters of Ways of Survival and I never
saw this skill name before. Still, I intuitively knew how to use it.

"Activate bookmark number one."

There was the feelings of pages turning in my head. It was the scenes of
Kim Namwoon in Ways of Survival.

「Hahahaha! I'm full of strength! 」

「Die! Die! Die! Die!」

「A new world requires new laws.」
Kim Namwoon's memories crowded in and all of my muscle nerves started
to tense up. The power of another person was spiking within me.

[The number one bookmark has been activated.]

[The level of the Bookmark skill is low, shortening the activation time.]

[Activation Time: One minute.]

One minute. That was enough.

[Your understanding of the character is low, so only a part of the character's
skill is activated.]

[Blackening Lv.1 has been activated.]

Kim Namwoon was breathing roughly as he rushed towards me. His body
was covered with a black energy that was threatening me. I firmly placed
strength on the heels of my feet and rushed towards Kim Namwoon. If we
had the same skill, I absolutely wouldn't lose.

At this moment, I really was Kim Namwoon. I was the crazy killer who
ruled the world of 'Ways of Survival' with the protagonist. In a situation
where Blackening was properly played, the Delusion Demon of the
battlefield couldn't be easily beaten.

"Kyaaack!"

The Swiss Army knife cut through uncomfortable sensations. It tore
through muscles and flesh. From the upper left arm to the heart. There was
the sound of a whole human being cut up as Kim Namwoon staggered. If he
still had eyes, he would be glaring at me right now.

"Kuoh, kill. Ohhh. D.i.e" The young man who felt pessimistic towards the
world and dreamt of breaking away from it. If Ways of Survival hadn't
started, he might've gone to university after sitting his CSAT¹ and enjoyed
campus life. "…Don't, want…to…die"

I watched Kim Namwoon falling down the bridge without saying farewell.
Despite him being a hated figure, I couldn't help feeling strange emotions.

[Your understanding of the character 'Kim Namwoon' has increased.]

[The number one bookmark has been disabled.]

A surge of fatigue overcame me as the power went away. It was hard, really
hard.

"Kuwoooook!"

There was 10 minutes remaining. There were still many demonic people
moving about. It was unreasonable to take on so many even with Lv. 10
physique. However, from the beginning, I had no intention of taking care of
them alone. It was a little late but he should appear around now.

Kwajik! Kwajijijik!

There was a crackling sound like he had been waiting. I knew it. I thought
he would do reckless things in order to gain achievements and donations.

Kwajijik! Crunch.

It was obviously the sound of a person's flesh colliding with another body,
but it sounded more like a mace crushing flesh. In fact, I had collected this
many coins and thought it would be worth challenging the protagonist.
Now I realized how mistaken I was. From the stationary train, the demonic
people were thrown away in a straight line, as if a tank had rushed through.
Was this really a scene caused by a 'human'?

"Kyaack?"
The headless demonic people realized that something was strange and
started turning around. However, it was too late. The man destroyed all the
demonic people threatening me and appeared in front of me. An
overwhelming force without any weapons. He beat the demonic people
with only two fists.

I had prepared my mind in advance but sweat still flowed down my back.
Dealing with this guy? It was absolutely impossible. I couldn't win even if
my overall stats rose by more than double what they were now.

"You, who are you?"

The man's cool gaze turned to me. I reflexively turned on Character List in
order to overcome the fear.

[The exclusive skill, Character List is activated.]

[There is too much information about this person. Character List is
converted to Character Summary.]

  Exclusive Skills: Sage's Eye Lv. 8, Hand to Hand Combat Lv. 8,

The list of exclusive skills continued endlessly. Before I could get to the
end of the list, a rugged hand appeared and grabbed my neck.

"You, how the hell are you alive?"
The 'first way' to survive in a ruined world. The one who proved that
method was right in front of me. Regressor Yoo Joonghyuk. The grand
tragedy of this world began with this person.



[1] CSAT – a South Korean standardized university exam.
                  Chapter 11: Ep. 2 – Protagonist, V


It would be quite a ludicrous sight if anyone else saw it. A large adult man
was being grabbed by the neck and hung like a monkey. I could see Lee
Hyunsung looking this way from across the bridge. His expression was
anxious but he couldn't actually see what was going on here. It was due to
the safety ward. I could see over there but they couldn't see here.

"Name." Yoo Joonghyuk demanded.

"What?"

"What is your name?"

Look at this indifferent way of talking, just like a main character. But it
wasn't good to provoke him here.

"Kim Dokja."
"A strange name."

"I've heard that a lot."

At this moment, my stomach sank in and felt turned inside out as Yoo
Joonghyuk's fist hit it.

"…Ugh."

Despite having skin that a knife bounced off, the attack was very painful.

"You have a solid body. Have you already mastered the use of coins?"

"It is the same with you…"

Bam. There was a hit to my stomach again. I barely managed to swallow
back a groan. This guy, the level of his strength was at least 15. It was at
this scale despite only one main and one sub scenario occurring. Indeed,
natural born monsters were different.

"Stop the unnecessary answers. Only answer what I ask from now on.
Understood?"

I didn't answer. I thought maybe this might happen. However, this was the
worst situation that I desperately hoped would never happen. In the
beginning, Yoo Joonghyuk was more intimidating than any other figure.
His personality had worn out after going through regression three times.
His principles were cut away in order to maintain his sense of self. The
current Yoo Joonghyuk would never hesitate for the sake of his purpose.

"Your answer?"

"…I will."

"Use honorifics."

"What if I don't want to?"
This time, I raised both hands to block the fist. The pain felt like my bones
had broken but the shock was dissipated. Yoo Joonghyuk's eyes widened
like he was a bit surprised.

[The character 'Yoo Joonghyuk' is on guard against you.]

Then it didn't matter. I wasn't going to be a punching bag just because he
was the main character.

"I'm sorry but you are younger than me, pro gamer Yoo Joonghyuk-ssi.
Therefore, you should be the one using honorifics."

"…You know me?"

"I know. I am the employee of a game company." It was a lie. Even if I
worked for a game company, it was impossible to memorize the names of
all professional gamers. In addition, until recently, 'Yoo Joonghyuk' was
just a character in a novel. "You are famous. At one time, I was a fan."

Being famous was just a setting of the plot. Still, it wasn't a lie that I was a
'fan'. I liked, hated, grumbled, and cheered Yoo Joonghyuk on. That's why I
stuck with Yoo Joonghyuk for over 3,000 chapters.

"Fan. I haven't heard that in a long time." Yoo Joonghyuk had a look of
nostalgia in his eyes, like he was locked in his memories. However, it was
only for a moment. "I'll forgive your impudence this time, but your
situation hasn't changed."

"I can see that."

I looked down at my two legs swaying over a blank space.

Yoo Joonghyuk said, "I have only one thing I want to ask."

"Ask."
"How did you survive on the subway?"

It was the question I expected.

"Will you spare me if I answer?"

"I'll see."

It was a lie. I could tell just by looking at his face. I was the only reader of
Ways of Survival. Numerous possible repertoires were simulated in my
head. What could I say to convince this damn regressor?

[Your understanding of the character 'Yoo Joonghyuk' is increasing.]

[Your understanding of this person is already very high.]

…Huh?

[The conditions of use for the exclusive skill 'Omniscient Reader's
Viewpoint' stage 2 has been reached!]

[Do you want to activate the exclusive skill?]

Then after a moment, I was able to read someone's thoughts like a waterfall
in my head.

「 Only Lee Hyunsung and Kim Namwoon should've survived in that
carriage. 」

「 Yet Kim Namwoon died and the others survived. 」

「 How did you survive? 」

「 Who the hell is this guy? 」

「 Dig up information. Then if I find any disturbing elements… Kill. 」
A dense flicker of thoughts. It was obviously a crisis situation but I couldn't
prevent the corners of my mouth from going up. The time remaining until
the scenario ended was 5 minutes.

I started telling the story. I told the story using as much concise, short, and
accurate vocabulary as possible. It was from the first moment the 'dokkaebi'
appeared in the subway to the end of the first scenario. Of course, I
excluded the skills I got and any important issues.

"…You cleared the scenario by killing insects?"

"We were lucky."

Yoo Joonghyuk was so surprised he seemed to have forgotten that his
mouth was open.

「 The future has completely changed. 」

He was shocked. Originally, the people in carriage 3807 would kill each
other in a battle royale, with only Lee Hyunsung and Kim Namwoon
surviving.

"You have keen eyes. How did you know there were insects in the
carriage?"

Killing Intent filled Yoo Joonghyuk's eyes as his thoughts brushed through
my head.

「 Is this guy also a regressor? 」

「If so, I have to kill him right now. 」

A person who commits a fault thinks that everyone speaks of it. I wasn't
surprised that he misunderstood me. I quickly opened my mouth, "An
explosion."

"Explosion?"
"I was able to find the insects due to an explosion from the carriage in
front."

Yoo Joonghyuk's body stopped at these words. "Explain it in a simpler
manner."

"When the explosion occurred, a kid fell and dropped his insect collecting
net. I picked it up by chance."

"…It is a suspicious coincidence."

"Coincidences are always suspicious. If you don't believe me, ask the
people beyond the ward. The boy standing there dropped the net."

Beyond the safety barrier on the way to Oksu Station, people were
looking over at this side. The scenario wasn't over yet so they couldn't
approach or talk to us. Yoo Joonghyuk looked over but showed no signs
of moving. His eyes changed and memories that seemed to belong to Yoo
Joonghyuk crossed my mind. 「 I see. 」

「 Explosion. 」

「This guy isn't a regressor. 」

「He isn't the one who changed the future. Rather, the future changed…」

「 Because of me. 」

I saw people dying painfully in a powerful explosion and Yoo Joonghyuk
blankly watching it.

「 It is because I started killing them, unlike the other turns. 」

Due to the impact of Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint, I could feel Yoo
Joonghyuk's mental pain and suffering.

"Are your questions over?" I asked.
"…Yes."

"Then can you let me go? In addition, let's move to Oksu together. There
isn't much time remaining to clear the scenario."

"It is difficult." However, a protagonist was a protagonist for a reason.
"Everything you said makes perfect sense."

I have never seen a protagonist as careful as Yoo Joonghyuk.

「 A beginner can't be so calm. 」

「He is abnormally well-adjusted to this changed world. 」

「He probably killed Kim Namwoon. 」

「 He has gone beyond being useful to being dangerous. 」

Yoo Joonghyuk's right eye started shining with a gold colour. I quickly
realized what he was doing. In fact, it would be weird if this guy didn't use
'that'. Sage's Eye. Yoo Joonghyuk's strongest detection skill. Sage's Eye was
the SS-grade skill that showed the target's attributes window as well as
hidden information.

As long as he used it, I couldn't avoid revealing my identity. On the other
hand, I thought it was a good thing. I still didn't know my 'attribute' and
'skills'. If Yoo Joonghyuk discovered my information, I would also be able
to know about myself. Then hopefully, I would be able to use the
information I learned to escape this situation.

[The exclusive skill, 'Fourth Wall' is activated!]

[Fourth Wall has detected the use of the detection skill Sage's Eye!]

Sparks flew in the air and Yoo Joonghyuk's body staggered.

「…Kuk, what? 」
Yoo Joonghyuk covered his right eye and watched me with confusion.
"You…what is your identity?"

I'm sorry but I was wondering the same thing.

[The exclusive skill Fourth Wall has blocked Sage's Eye!]

I didn't know that I had a skill that would defend against Sage's Eye. After
Bookmark, it was Fourth Wall. This complicated things. Yoo Joonghyuk
wouldn't believe me now.

「 I must kill him here. 」

He was a person who didn't trust what he didn't know.

"Yoo Joonghyuk." Then I also need to change plans. "You need a reliable
companion."

"…What do you mean?"

"You can't break through the 46th scenario alone. Shouldn't you be well
aware of it?"

Yoo Joonghyuk's eyes narrowed. "How do you know this? Perhaps you―"

"It doesn't matter how I know or who I am." I stared straight into Yoo
Joonghyuk's eyes and said, "The important thing is that I can help you."

「 He isn't a regressor. If he was a regressor, I wouldn't be unaware of him.
」

「 Then who is this person? 」

「 …Perhaps? 」
If I couldn't hide my hand and if I didn't possess the best hand, then there
was only one way out. It was to show a hand that would make the other
person misunderstand.

"Yoo Joonghyuk, I know the future that you don't know."

[The character 'Yoo Joonghyuk' has used the 'Lie Detection' skill.

[Lie Detection has confirmed that your words are the truth.]

Yoo Joonghyuk's eyes slowly widened. "…How?"

"How else?"

「 No way. There was a prophet other than Anna Croft? It is also in South
Korea? 」

Prophet. In Ways of Survival, it was the only attribute that could see the
future and had the passive of 'nullifying all detection skills'. In fact, only
one person had the attribute of 'prophet' in the world of Ways of Survival.

「 Only a prophet can defend against my Sage's Eye. 」

I didn't answer and Yoo Joonghyuk bit his lips.

"Can you perhaps use 'Future Sight'?"

"It is something similar."

"You knew I would come here."

"Yes."

「 I see. If this man is a prophet, all his actions are convincing. 」

The flow was changing. Yoo Joonghyuk's fluctuation was conveyed
straight away. This was the only chance.
"I know that Yoo Joonghyuk has special powers. You also know things
about the future. Isn't that right?"

"…"

"But that knowledge is never perfect." The only weakness of a regressor
was that the future changed when they used their information of the future.
In other words, all those who regressed would eventually live in a 'world
they don't know'. "Make me your companion. I can fill in the parts you are
missing."

There was no companion as good as a 'prophet' to the present Yoo
Joonghyuk. In fact, my present self could play a role similar to a prophet. It
was because I was the only reader of this story.

[There is one minute to the end of the scenario.]

Yoo Joonghyuk lowered his head and started to think.

「 A prophet will certainly be helpful. 」

[There are 50 seconds left to complete the scenario.]

「Not just the 46th scenario, but later when fighting the 'Zarathustra'.
But… can I really believe him? 」

[There are 40 seconds left to the end of the scenario.]

「 Companion. 」

Finally, Yoo Joonghyuk raised his head as I stared at the clock with an
irritated heart. "I have decided. I will make you my companion."

[Excessive immersion has severely worn out your mental strength.]

[Exclusive skill, Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint has been turned off.]
I wasn't sure if it was due to fatigue or relief but the exclusive skill was
released. Now Yoo Joonghyuk's face was as difficult as a philosophy book
with no commentary written. Yoo Joonghyuk started to take me across the
'Even Bridge'. Of course, I was still held by the collar but…I thought things
would be all right now. I persuaded this damn regressor and was in a good
position. We had almost crossed the Even Bridge and were right in front of
the safe area when Yoo Joonghyuk suddenly stopped.

"I will ask you one last thing."

"What?"

"If you are really a prophet, you should know your future. Isn't that right?"

The moment I saw Yoo Joonghyuk's serene eyes, goosebumps broke out.
His test wasn't over yet. The grip holding my collar tightened.

"Keok."

His hand raised me up a little bit and a gentle wind passed by my feet.
Underneath me was completely empty. The smell of blood mixed in with
the smell of Han River as the ichthyosaurs jumped towards their prey with
open mouths.

"Will I let go of this hand or won't I?"

For the first time, I started sweating. Let me think. Even without his
thoughts, I knew this guy more than anyone else. I closed my eyes and
thought about Yoo Joonghyuk.

[There are 20 seconds left to the end of the scenario.]

Then I came to a conclusion.

"Yoo Joonghyuk."
I was certain about what he would do. No matter how I thought about it,
there was no other ending when it came to Yoo Joonghyuk. I talked as I
watched a sea commander approaching in the water. "I will tell you two
things first."

"…What?"

"One, I'm not your subordinate. So I hope you will treat me fairly from now
on."

"…"

"Two, I will cooperate with you but you also have to promise to cooperate
with me."

Yoo Joonghyuk looked at me with interest and nodded. "Well, what is your
answer?"

I replied with a smile, "Release your hand and get lost, you damn son of a
bitch."

Then the power holding me disappeared. I was grabbed by the force of
gravity. I saw Yoo Joonghyuk's face as I was falling. Yoo Joonghyuk was
smiling brightly like something made him happy.

Son of a bitch.

"I believe you. You are definitely a prophet."

Waiting for me at my crash point was the mouth of the giant sea
commander.
I closed my eyes from the shock of the impact along with the cold water of
Han River. As I sucked in a breath, a warm and enormous darkness
swallowed me up.

[You have failed to clear the scenario.]
…Damn, I have to use that method after all.
                    Chapter 12: Ep. 3 – Contract, I


My body suddenly became heavy as I felt water entering my lungs. Then I
was sucked in somewhere. I wasn't torn apart because I fell with perfect
timing. However, I couldn't lose consciousness here. I had to stay awake. I
needed to wait for a while. Somehow, I managed to curl up and hold my
breath. 10 seconds, 20 seconds, 30 seconds… I was barely breathing when
my hands hit a tangible wall in the darkness.

"U-Uwek." I could barely breathe even after coughing up the river water
several times. My level 10 physique saved me from being killed by hitting
the water surface, but the large and small bruises all over my body were
very painful. In order not to fall into a panic, I controlled my breathing and
then turned on my smartphone. I was worried it might've broken in the fall,
but fortunately, it powered on just fine. It was good that I'd spent a lot and
bought a smartphone with waterproof capabilities.
The flashlight turned on, and the surrounding scenery entered my eyes.
There were huge walls with concrete by-products floating by. The insides
of an ichthyosaur's stomach were more disgusting than I'd imagined.

"Dammit."

Yoo Joonghyuk's expression as he released his grip on me without
hesitation and then got off the bridge was vivid in my mind. I'd expected it,
but it was still more shocking than I thought it'd be.

…If I wanted to be his companion, I had to survive. It wasn't that I didn't
understand. The weight of this word, 'companion', was too great for Yoo
Joonghyuk. Since his failure in the first round of regression, Yoo
Joonghyuk had never made a real 'companion'. It was rare for humans to
easily follow the growth of a regressor. As a result, he had solved
everything alone, was revered as a savior, and was naturally lonely. To Yoo
Joonghyuk, 'humans' were only subordinates or enemies.

Thus, this was a test. If I wanted to be in an equal position with him, I had
to solve this much alone.

…Well, this was when I looked at it from Yoo Joonghyuk's viewpoint.

"A companion like you… Crazy psychopath."

I barely doggy paddled to a floating styrofoam panel and raised my body
onto it. Thanks to the warmth of the stomach, I wasn't cold. However, the
problem was what was to happen from now on. I closed my eyes and
played the message log I'd heard.

[You have failed to clear the scenario.]

[Paid settlement will begin.]

[100 coins have been reduced for the channel usage fee.]
[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' has nodded at your
exciting remarks.]

[100 coins have been sponsored.]

[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' nods at your choice.]

[100 coins have been sponsored.]

[The constellation 'Secretive Plotter' is disappointed in your rash remarks.]

There were quite a few messages. Additionally, a few exposed
constellations sponsored me. Maybe it was due to the final conversation I
had with Yoo Joonghyuk. I felt a little down as I read through the messages
of the constellations one by one and collected the coins. If I had picked one
of these constellations in the first Sponsor Selection, this might not have
happened. However, I had no regret in my choice.

After encountering Yoo Joonghyuk directly, I was certain. The Great Sage,
Heaven's Equal might be a sponsor of the highest quality but he wasn't
enough. I needed more than just 'sponsorship' if I wanted to confront Yoo
Joonghyuk. That was what I would gain from here.

The walls of the stomach growled, and small waves rose inside. The sea
commander seemed to be moving somewhere. I turned on my smartphone
and calculated the time. According to Ways of Survival, the ichthyosaur
started to secrete stomach acid around three hours after ingesting food. In
other words, I didn't have much time left.

[Haha, it is sad that things turned out like this. It was very interesting.]
There was a sound effect before the dokkaebi's voice rang out.

"…Dokkaebi?"

[Yes, that's right. You don't seem panicked at all?]
"I knew you would come."

[Hrmm. It sounds like you were waiting for me?]

"Of course, I have been waiting."

A light turned on, and the dokkaebi appeared. I couldn't tell for sure from
his expression alone, but this guy was clearly interested. If I was pushed
here, I wouldn't be able to eat my meal. So, I deliberately spoke calmly,
"Are you doing to take coins from me?"

[…Coins?]

"You have to take coins in exchange for me failing the scenario."

[Hmm, not your life?]

"If it was my life, you would have written 'death' in the failure results
column, not three question marks. Doesn't this mean there is room to
negotiate?"

[…Hahaha. How interesting.]

In fact, there was a loophole in my words. The scenario message was
'Failure: ???'. This literally meant that the penalty of failure was unknown.
It was just my assumption that it was in exchange for coins. Nevertheless,
there was a reason why I was so certain.

"Am I wrong?"

It was because I already knew about this scenario.

The dokkaebi hesitated for a moment before nodding. [You are right. It's
amazing that you could determine this point with such a clue… As
expected from someone who is attraction the constellations' attention.] The
dokkaebi's tone was filled with sincere admiration. [As you said, you can
survive this sub-scenario if you pay coins, even if you fail.]
"How much?"

[Pay 5,100 coins. Then I will let you live.]

I looked at how many coins I currently possessed.

[Coins Possessed: 5,100 C]

I couldn't help smiling. This brat was messing around right now.

"That is too much."

[Haha, then won't you die? It is up to me to accept the coins or not. If you
do something wrong, I can just end it here.]

"Then kill me."

[…Huh?]

"Kill me."

[······.]

"You can't kill me?"

The dokkaebi didn't move. This was a natural reaction. After all, he was
having a lot of fun with me right now. Furthermore, he wouldn't have come
down here to see me if he had been planning to kill me. For this guy, I had
to survive here or at least to die miserably.

[Haha. You are really making me angry. Look, now…] The dokkaebi's
flatshaped eyebrows wriggled furiously. It was time to stop the taunts and
get to the main point.

"Low-grade dokkaebi, Bihyung. How are the activities of a streamer?"
If there was a crack in the face, it would look exactly like this. Dokkaebi
Bihyung showed confusion for the first time.

[H-How do you know my name?]

"You haven't been enjoying broadcasting lately, right? The constellations
are too stingy."

[W-Who the hell are you? How does a human…] Bihyung's horns shook. It
was a natural reaction. After all, an ordinary human couldn't know about
the Star Stream system. However, I wasn't an ordinary human.

[A few constellations have doubts about your existence.]

[The constellation 'Secretive Plotter''s eyes are shining at your plan.]

From now on, it wasn't a story for the constellations. I mouthed to Bihyung,
"How about we talk after you close the channel?"

Bihyung was worried and closed the channel.

[#BI-7623 channel is closed.]

Once the constellations left the channel, Bihyung showed his true colors.

[Feel free to speak. You… How can an ordinary human know about the
Star
Stream broadcasting?]

"That isn't important."

[Huh?]

"Bihyung, do you want to be 'king of the dokkaebis'?"

[What now―]
"Don't you wish to be the best streamer in the network, surpassing Dokgak
and Gildal?" Bihyung's complexion was changing. "Dokkaebi Bihyung,
sign a contract with me. Then I will make you the king of the dokkaebis."
                   Chapter 13: Ep. 3 – Contract, II


Star Stream system—the star stream broadcasting was designed to relay its
contents to the entire universe. The subscribers were constellations at the
top of the distant galaxies, the actors were humans like me, and the
storyteller that connected the two sides was the dokkaebi before me.

[Ha, hahahaha! You are crazy! A crazy human! I should've known it when
you refused the sponsoring of the other constellations!] Bihyung laughed
for a long time before opening his mouth again. [I don't know how you
know about Star Stream Broadcasting but I can't accept the offer. I'm a
dokkaebi, not a constellation. I can't be your sponsor.]

"You seem to have misunderstood. I never told you to sponsor me."

[Huh?]

"I am well aware that you are a weak dokkaebi. I don't need your strength.
I need your channel." [My channel?]
"Since you can't seem to understand me, is there a problem with your
Korean language patch?"

[No, what is this?]

"I will explain it simply. I want to sign an exclusive contract with your
channel."

Bihyung made a blank expression before belatedly regained his spirit. [Wait
a minute. Do you want to make a 'stream contract' with me now?]

"Yes."

A stream contract was originally a contract between dokkaebi and
constellations. The constellation's incarnation would appear on a particular
channel, and the dokkaebi would receive a portion of the coins earned by
the incarnation of the constellation as a commission. Originally, the person
who was the incarnation wouldn't be able to intervene in this contract. It
was called sponsorship, but the contracted incarnation was nothing but a
slave.

[Haha, this is a hit.] Bihyung laughed behind his small fingers. The
surrounding atmosphere was changing. [I don't know how you know about
such things, but to think that some human dares to mention the stream
contract? Moreover, it is a trivial bug with no sponsor?] As his tone
changed, the surrounding air was filled with killing intent. Indeed, even a
low-level dokkaebi was strong compared to humans. However, it wasn't
enough to make me back off.

"It is worth signing a contract because I have no sponsor."

[…What?]

"What do you think the purpose of a constellation is to enter a channel?" At
the sudden question, Bihyung looked like a bad student. From now on, it
was a special lecture time for the low-level dokkaebi. "You don't have to be
so nervous. You already know this information. But let's review it again to
see what it means."

Bihyung was caught in my pace and nodded despite himself.

"The Star Stream subscribers can be largely divided into two groups. One
group is the 'fun seekers' who seek to relieve their boredom with the
channel. The other group consist of the 'incarnation searchers' who want to
find an incarnation to contract with them. Isn't that right?"

[Yes. That's right.]

"For this reason, you must be able to satisfy one of the two groups in order
to become a famous channel in Star Stream. In other words, either stick to
the fun seekers or the incarnation seekers. You have to attract one of them
properly."

[You are moderately well informed. But so what? What does this contract
have to do with why constellations subscribe?]

"I don't know how many more hints I have to give you. This is why your
number of subscribers still isn't over three digits."

[…Shut up. Say it quickly.]

Seeing Bihyung thrust his small horns at me cutely, it was hard to believe
the dokkaebi had blown up people's head a while ago. Now it was time to
stop making fun of him and take a chance.

"What if there is a channel that can satisfy both the fun seekers and the
incarnation searchers?"

[What are you saying? Such a thing is impossible. Even if it is possible, it is
only for a while.]
Bihyung's words were correct. The reason why it was impossible to satisfy
all the constellations was due to the characteristics of the 'incarnation
searchers' group. The purpose of these constellations was to 'discover an
incarnation'. They changed channels as soon as the Sponsor Selection was
over. Due to this, the incarnation searchers group were just temporary
customers. However…

"That is a story for when the Sponsor Selection proceeds normally."

[What?]

"What if there is an incarnation who doesn't sign a contract with any
constellation? In addition, what if that incarnation shows an ability that
transcends all over incarnations with sponsors?"

The existence of a strong incarnation would attract the eyes of the
constellations. If this incarnation continued to reject selecting a sponsor, the
'incarnation searchers' group would also continue to subscribe without
leaving the channel.

[W-Wait a minute! You— Is this why you didn't select a sponsor…?]

"Yes, that's right."

[Ha… This is interesting.] Bihyung grinned at me. [Becoming the strongest
incarnation without a sponsor… If there is such a thing, it certainly
wouldn't be a dream to become the best Star Stream channel. But such an
incarnation can't exist.]

"Do you really think so?"

[…I admit that you aren't normal. You have attracted the attention of
constellations from the beginning, and thanks to it, I have also been having
fun. However, there is a limit to your delusions. Haven't you noticed it after
going through that? An ordinary human can never beat an incarnation. That
is the law of the world.]
"I don't know that."

[You have already missed the opportunity. Look around you. This isn't a
main scenario. You failed a sub-scenario, and now your life is at risk. There
are no constellations watching you―]

"Really?"

[…?]

"By now, the constellations must be in an uproar. Aren't they? Isn't
everybody clamoring for the channel to quickly be opened?" Bihyung was
silent. "Aren't they all going crazy with curiosity right now? Who is that
crazy person who went against the regressor? Is he really a prophet? Can he
really see the future? If he can see the future, why did he get eaten by the
ichthyosaur?"

[S-Stop! You are…]

"From now on, I'm going to show it. So shut up and do what I tell you. Do
you want to become the king of dokkaebis?"

The gaze with which Bihyung was using to look at me was changing, and I
could hear the sound of him gulping. Bihyung was worried. However, in
any case, there was nothing to lose if he believed me here. In that case…?
Bihyung's pupils moved quickly. [Then let's settle the scenario failure first.
Give me 5,100 coins…]

"What are you saying? I didn't fail."

[…Eh?]

"Maybe I've met the conditions by now…" I loosened my body and got up
from my seat. My cold body was stiff. Bihyung still had a stupid expression
on his face. "Open the channel. It will start soon."
[Start, what will―]

Then a message rang out in the air.
[The hidden scenario has arrived!]


  [Hidden Scenario – Commander Slayer]

  Category: Hidden

  Difficulty: A+

  Clear Conditions: Kill the ichthyosaur 'sea commander' and escape from
  its stomach.

  Time Limit: 10 days

  Compensation: 9,000 coins

  Failure: Death




"Look, didn't I tell you to be prepared?"

There were three types of scenarios in Ways of Survival. The main scenario
was in charge of progressing the main story, the sub-scenarios were
responsible for minor events, and the hidden scenarios were only opened
through special conditions.

[How on earth…?] Bihyung's lips were shaking with shock. Unlike the
main scenarios and sub-scenarios that a dokkaebi was in charge of, the
hidden scenarios were characterized by their automatic appearance when
certain conditions were met.
"You didn't even know. You low-grade dokkaebi."

[You… What on earth?]

"Anyway, if I can clear this, I will prove that I have the ability for the
contract, right?"

Bihyung watched the scenario screen with gloomy eyes. He looked at me
with a careful gaze and asked, [This scenario, the difficulty is A+. Do you
really believe you can clear it?]

"Yes."

There was a small wave as the Han River water crashed against the wall of
the ichthyosaur's stomach. Bihyung was silent for a moment before opening
his mouth, […Okay. If you succeed in clearing this scenario then I will
accept the contract.]

"The terms of the contract will be negotiated after the scenario is cleared."

[So arrogant… Then I will open the channel again. Please try hard.]

"Ah, wait a minute." It would be difficult if he left so soon. I had something
to check. "You have something left to do."

[…What is it now?] Bihyung's mocking tone was somewhat annoying.

"Fix a system error for me."

[System error?]

"My attributes window isn't opening."

[No way. The system can't have an error. The scenario system is perfect.]

"Take a look yourself."
Bihyung looked at me with suspicious eyes and started to mutter
something.

[The dokkaebi 'Bihyung' has used 'System Interference' on you.]

System interference—it was an absolute interference skill that could only
be used by dokkaebis with the right to interfere in the scenario. In fact, it
was unclear if the reason why I couldn't see the attributes window was an
error or not. However, at least the dokkaebi would be able to find out
something. That said, if he couldn't figure it out, that was also a profit for
me.

[The exclusive skill, 'Fourth Wall' is activated!]

In the next moment, sparks flew in the air and struck Bihyung.
                     Chapter 14: Ep. 3 – Contract, III


Looking at the situation, I got a sense of what happened. "What is it? Is
something wrong?"

[This isn't possible. How can there be a firewall preventing the system
interference…?]

It seemed Fourth Wall blocked not just the skills of an incarnation but the
dokkaebi's interference as well. If this was true, it meant nobody in Ways of
Survival could see my attributes window, including myself. How
interesting. It was the perfect condition to become a scammer.

"Forget about it."

[P-Please wait! I can do it. U-Uh. What if I do this?]

"You can't do it."
[Kuaaack!] Bihyung screamed like he had received an electric shock. The
white fluffy hair on his skin was burned black. [T-This! This!]

"It's okay. If you can't do it then stop. I will ask for another favour."

[This can't be! I am Dokkaebi Bihyung. If I can't solve this situation, the
honor of the dokkaebi―]

I looked at the clock. It had been an hour since the ichthyosaur ate. There
was no time to waste time like this.

"The Dokkaebi Bag."

Bihyung stopped his useless action of digging at the air. [What?]

"Open the Dokkaebi Bag."

[…How do you know about that?]

"Are you going to open it?"

[Only an incarnation with a sponsor can use the Dokkaebi Bag…]

"It is true that all incarnations that use the Dokkaebi Bag have a sponsor,
but there is no rule that an incarnation without a sponsor can't use the
Dokkaebi Bag."

[…Wait a minute.] Bihyung pulled out a manual and confirmed it. [At this
point, I don't know if I am a dokkaebi or you are. Are you actually a
dokkaebi?]

The smiling Bihyung raised both hands. […Okay, there is no problem if
you use it. However, the Dokkaebi Bag can only be used when the channel
is open for streaming purposes. Is that okay?]

"It's fine."
[#BI-7623 channel is open.]

[Constellations have entered.]

Then an electric current appeared in the air, and a transparent screen
emerged in front of me.

[Welcome to the coin shop, the 'Dokkaebi Bag'.]

The Dokkaebi Bag…

It was the moment when this damn world's 'cash store' was opened.




There were two ways to use coins in Ways of Survival. One of them was to
raise the level of the stats such as physique and strength. The other was to
use it as a common form of currency that could be used in various stores,
including the Dokkaebi Bag.

[Buy it now! A starter pack for your incarnation for 2,500 coins!] [A

today only special! A 300% growth package, grow faster than others!]

[Did you accidentally pick an incarnation with a bad attribute? Don't worry!
The 'Random Attribute Box' that can randomly change the attribute has
been released!]

There were numerous coin items, including various packages. All of the
advertisements in the Dokkaebi Bag were aimed at the constellations
raising incarnations. This was natural since the original customers of the
Dokkaebi Bag were constellations. I got rid of the pop-up advertising
windows one by one.
Although it was nothing compared to the 'disasters' that emerged in the fifth
main scenario, a sea commander ichthyosaur was no different from a
disaster for the early stage incarnations. To defeat the ichthyosaur, I needed
some items sold in the Dokkaebi Bag.

'Let's see…'

I looked at the catalog before glancing over at Bihyung. "Hey, are these the
only items I can buy right now? Is there a search function?"

[At that… Shit. Wait. Constellations. Please. Please calm down.] From the
moment the channel opened, Bihyung had been repeating explanations with
comic-like sweat drops on his face. [It was just a server error that shut the
broadcast off for a while! I didn't turn it off on purpose.]

There were a total of 20 stars above Bihyung's head. Since not too many of
them had left the channel, it seemed that quite a few constellations still
wanted to see what had happened to me. Of course, not all of the
constellations were friendly.

[A few constellations are questioning the fairness of the broadcast!]

[A few constellations are suspicious of the privileges you have received!]

It wasn't unexpected. While the broadcast was off, a hidden scenario had
started, and the Dokkaebi Bag had been opened. It was no wonder that the
constellations were surprised.

[No, preferences? Look at this, Constellations. I am a dokkaebi. Don't you
know that I will be extinguished if I do that? Don't you know that the
storyteller vow is never light?]

"Will you help me?"

[…There is a product search button in the lower right corner.]
"Thank you."

I ignored Bihyung and pressed the magnifying glass icon at the bottom of
the package window.

[The product search function is activated.]

[The product search function is limited to 5 times a day. Any additional
searches will cost 100 coins per search.]

In any case, it was the same for humans and dokkaebi. The total number of
free searches given was five. Two searches were enough to buy the
materials I needed, so I had three searches left.

[The constellation 'Secretive Plotter' is wondering about your plan.]

'Yes, be curious. If you are curious, keep watching'.

[The constellation 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' is looking angrily at your
actions.]

'Don't watch if you are going to get all twisted up'.

I opened my mouth to use the search function, "Search for the 'Ancient
Dragon' item."

[There are three search results.]

A small pop-up window soon emerged.

[ Ancient Dragon's Heart – Stock: ?

 Ancient Dragon's Bone – Stock: 1

 Ancient Dragon's Horn – Stock: 1]

I chose the Ancient Dragon's Heart.
[Item Information]

[Name: Ancient Dragon's Heart

Rating: SS

Description: A heart containing the magic power of the ancient dragon
'Ignitus'. It possesses near-infinite magic power, and the attribute 'Hellfire'
will be acquired if a heart transplant is successful.

Price: 1,500,000 C

Stock: Just sold out.]

As expected, it was out of stock. From beyond the catalog, Bihyung, who
was dealing with the constellations, looked at me with his jaw dropped
open.

[Crazy. How do you know the information about the ancient dragon?]

"I just called out a nice name."

[…It seems like a lie.]

I shrugged. In the original Ways of Survival, the owner of the Ancient
Dragon's Heart was already determined. If I remembered correctly, the
owner of the heart was currently in Italy. They were a person with good
luck, getting such a diamond of a sponsor. I called out several more product
names.

[The related product search is completed.]

[ Great Demon's Eyes – Stock: 0

 Purest Sword Force – Stock: 1]
The Great Demon's Eyes were sold out… It seemed the hands of the
constellations were really quick. Well, I couldn't buy the item anyway since
the selling price was 1 million coins. At any rate, it was good to have a
sponsor. Now the incarnation with the Great Demon's Eyes would grow and
destroy the beginner scenarios.

[What are you really? What type of cheat are you using? How do you know
about items that can only be found in the search?]

"I just said plausible names."

Among the three items that I searched for, only the Purest Sword Force was
in stock. Furthermore, the price was 10,000 coins, so I couldn't buy it now.
I put it in the shopping cart for now.

[What, are you buying it?]

"Not right now. I am just window shopping."

[Sheesh, what a waste of time.]

"I am going to buy something else, so bring up the items I call out from
now on."

I called out several item names. After a moment, a list of items emerged in
front of me.

[* Mucus of the Hammer Seahorse – Stock: 124

* Stone Hog's Pointed Thorn – Stock: 17]

I compared it to the list in my memories. The hammer seahorse, which was
the food of the ichthyosaur, and the stone hog, which was the nemesis of
sea species… There was no doubt. This combination was the best when it
came to attacking an ichthyosaur.

"Four mucus, four thorns. It is 800 coins?"
[Yes, but… where are you going to use these miscellaneous items?]

"You don't need to know."

[…I don't want to be nosy but why don't you buy something else? For
example, this Woryeong Sword Technique. It is originally 8,000 coins but I
will now sell it for 4,000 coins. Wouldn't buying this be more helpful to
clear the scenario?]

"Thank you but I will just buy this."

Bihyung wasn't satisfied but received the payment anyway.

[800 coins have been consumed.]

In the darkness, a sparkling powder gathered, and the four elongated thorns
and four pockets of black mucus appeared.

[I can't give a refund if you regret it now. Do you understand?]

"I know." I nodded briefly and started working. I took off my top, tied it
around my waist, and stuck the thorns in the gap between my top and my
waist, while the pockets were hung from my waist. The stone hog's thorn
was stumpy but became sharp at the end. It was approximately one meter in
length. It was a reasonable size to pierce something.

[Hrmm… Then I'll be going. I can't stay with you. There is something fun
going on in another place.]

"Do it."

[Huhu, then hang in there. I hope the story will bless you.]

Bihyung disappeared in a flash of light, and the surroundings became dark
again. I could use the light from my smartphone, but I wanted to save the
battery as much as possible. In the darkness, the stone hog thorn was
emitting a bluish light. It was a feeble light, but it would be sufficient for
the moment.

I pulled out a thorn and swung it. Maybe it was because I didn't have a skill
such as Weapons Training or Incarnation of All Soldiers, but I couldn't get
used to holding the thorn.

[A few constellations are bored.]

The impatient constellations left the channel. I couldn't see it, but Bihyung
was probably fretting right now. Then an hour passed.

Right, left, up, and down. I didn't like it, but I no longer had a problem
handling the thorn. The surface finish was rough and didn't seem like it
would slip easily from my hand. It was time to begin. I used the proper
force and stabbed at the ichthyosaur wall above me.

Tiing!

It was like poking a rubber elastic wall as the thorn bounced off. My current
strength wasn't high enough to tear at the stomach of the ichthyosaur. It
would probably be the same if I used a skill. At that moment, the small
holes at the top of the stomach wall opened simultaneously. Then an
absolutely disgusting liquid poured out.

"Kuweek!" One of the demonic people floating on something in the
stomach started shrieking. The demonic person's skin started burning. The
digestion of the ichthyosaur had begun. The ichthyosaur's digestive juices
quickly mixed into the river water and started to melt away the concrete and
other floating products.

There was no time. However, it was going as planned. I jumped from the
floating object and gripped a bump on the wall of the stomach. Then I
started climbing up the wall like I was rock climbing.

Gurgle gurgle gurgle.
The outlet of the digestive juices was right above. I put the thorn in my
mouth and grabbed a pocket of the hammer seahorse's mucus. Pouring the
mysterious dark blue liquid onto my hand, I then applied the mucus
carefully onto the thorn, from the tip down to the end. I did it with precision
and care, like applying shaving cream to an area to be shaved. If the
shaving cream protected the skin from the razor, then the mucus protected
the thorn from the digestive juices.

'Go'.

I swung the thorn toward where the digestive juices were coming from. The
angle was correct, and I used my maximum strength. The digestive juices
flowed down the thorn and dissolved the skin on my forearm. I experienced
a terrible pain but didn't stop. If I made a mistake here, everything would be
over.

[The exclusive skill 'Fourth Wall' has relieved some of the pain.]

Gurgle, gurgle. Chururuk…

Before long, the thorn jammed up the emission point.

"Just one."

After a deep sigh, I pulled out another thorn from my waist. I applied the
mucus of the hammer seahorse onto another thorn, found another opening,
and blocked it.

[A few constellations admire your calmness.]

[Constellations have sponsored you 200 coins.]

I used this method to block three opening points. There were some left, but
the small openings didn't release large amounts of digestive fluids. There
was one thorn left in the top tightly tied around me. All that was left was
one thorn and two pockets of mucus.
I used the remaining mucus on my skin and clothes, and then poured the
remainder down my throat.

"Kup."

The fishy taste on my tongue was sickening but it was better than dying.
The bitterness was nothing compared to the disaster that would occur
starting from this moment. It was around five minutes afterward that the
entire stomach started trembling.

…It had started.

Kieeeeeeek-!

The ichthyosaur let out a painful scream. The blood vessels on the wall of
the stomach were squirming, and the thorns were visibly expanding into the
blood vessels. The thorns in the openings had started their aggressive
growth activity. This was because the stone hog's thorns grew in response
to the body fluids of seawater species.

The thorns, which had become immune to the digestive juices due to the
applied mucus, absorbed the surrounding fluids and started to take root in
the body of the ichthyosaur. The stone hog's thorns wouldn't stop expanding
until the ichthyosaur was completely dead.

As I watched the liquid swirl under my feet, I grabbed a thorn tightly. I had
done everything I could. From now on, it was a mental fight. Either I would
die or this guy would die. Only one of us would survive.
                   Chapter 15: Ep. 3 – Contract, IV


I didn't know how much time passed by. My breathing was often
interrupted, and all my muscles were so stiff that I could barely move them.

[A few constellations admire your will to survive!]

[Constellations have sponsored you 100 coins.]

However, I persisted. I persisted because I believed I could hold on. The
light emitted from the thorn in the darkness confirmed that I was alive.
After confirming the falling temperature of the stomach wall, I was
convinced that the ichthyosaur was dying.

[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' admires your spirit.]

[The constellation has sponsored you 100 coins.]

When I was hungry, I placed my tongue to the end of the thorn. The
condensed fluid that flowed out contained the life force absorbed from the
ichthyosaur. The reason I drank the mucus in advance had been to absorb
this concentrate.

[Your physique has slightly increased due to absorbing the power of the
ichthyosaur.]

There wasn't an immediate effect of my stats levels increasing, but by the
time I escaped from the ichthyosaur, I would gain at least two levels in
physique. It wouldn't work at a higher level, but this was one of the few
tricks I could use to raise my physique without using coins.

Indeed, this wasn't a dream. This was all I could do. I was just an ordinary
reader, not a protagonist. It felt like I would wake up screaming in bed at
any moment, but no such miracle happened no matter how much I blinked.

…Mother would be fine. She was okay. This wasn't anybody else, it was
'Mother'.

I fell asleep whenever the liquid on the floor drained away and woke up
every time the cold river water entered my mouth. Then finally, the
ichthyosaur's digestion stopped. The warmth of the viscera suddenly cooled
down and the elastic stomach lining gradually solidified. Thus, I could be
certain of it.

The ichthyosaur had died.

[…You are really great.] There was a bright light in the darkness, and
Bihyung's dim figure was floating in the air. [Using the stone hog's thorn
like this. I never even thought about it. Constellations, isn't it the same for
you?] Bihyung looked at the stone hog's thorn emitting a faint light.

[The stone hog is a guy who mainly lives on the coast and feeds on small
sea species. They insert the thorn into the skin of the prey, but I didn't think
it would be used to plug up the openings for the digestive juices…]
Bihyung's shining eyes weren't looking at me. The words weren't an
explanation for me either.

[A few constellations are smiling as if they already know.]

[Constellations have sponsored you 100 coins.]

[A few constellations belatedly understand your judgment.]

[Constellations complain that you should tell them by talking to yourself
from now on.]

I ignored the messages from the constellations and drank the last of the
condensed fluid.

[Your physique has slightly increased due to absorbing the power of the
ichthyosaur.]

[Your physique level has risen!]

[Physique Lv. 11 -> Physique Lv. 12]

I accomplished my intended purpose. Bihyung came down to me and
touched my burned arm. [Furthermore, the mucus… I didn't know the
mucus of the hammer seahorse was so potent.]

Originally, my skin should've melted from the ichthyosaur's digestive
juices. I opened my mouth to stop Bihyung's nonsense. "The mucus of the
hammer seahorse is immune to digestive fluids. They evolved in this way
after often being eaten by the ichthyosaurs."

[A few constellations admire your knowledge.]

Then Bihyung looked at me with a betrayed expression. [Excuse me, I
should be the one explaining…]

"I did it because you don't know. Now is the explanation over?"
[…Yes.]

"Then give me the reward."

[Cheeky bastard,] Bihyung grumbled while a reward message appeared in
front of my eyes.

[The hidden scenario has ended.]

[You have obtained 9,000 coins in compensation.]

[You are the first to have successfully hunted a 7th grade species.]

[You have earned 1,000 coins as an achievement reward.]

9,000 coins plus an additional 1,000 coins. It was a very huge income.

[Coins Possessed: 14,800 C]

If I added the 500 donated coins from filming my survival, the total income
was 10,500 coins. It was over my target.

[Haha, Constellations. Did you enjoy this? Let's quickly watch an
advertisement before going straight to the next scenario!]

I could hear the faint sounds of an ad somewhere. New scenario opening
featured package, 8,800 coins…

Once the eyes of the constellations disappeared, Bihyung started speaking
to me in a friendly manner, [Sigh… It was a great survival. The response
from the constellations was amazing.]

"How much time passed?"

[Four days. I was in suspense the whole time I was watching. Were you
unaware of the time?]
"My smartphone died."

It had taken more time than I'd thought it would. The original goal had been
two days… Well, Yoo Joonghyuk took four days in the fourth round to
catch an ichthyosaur, so the speed wasn't slow.

'Anyway, I did it'.

A pleasant feeling of fulfillment covered my whole body and made me
confident. I was an ordinary person with ordinary skills, but even so, this
didn't mean I could only do ordinary things.

"…How funny."

It was strange. A novel that hadn't been helpful for 28 years was now
making me extraordinary.

[Oh, are you talking to yourself already?]

"…"

[Isn't it good? For an incarnation, talking to yourself is essential. Of course,
there are constellations who dislike it, but usually…]

"Shut up and open the Dokkaebi Bag."

[Why? Are you going to buy something?]

"I'm not buying but selling."

[Damn, I'll have to cut the ad short. Constellations, hold on a second. I'll
adjust the volume.]

As Bihyung opened the Dokkaebi Bag, I looked at the thorns embedded in
the wall. The upper barrier was hardened, and deep cracks formed around
the thorns. So, I could now smash through the upper barrier with my
strength. I broke the wall little by little with the one remaining thorn.
Shortly afterward, I encountered the core of the ichthyosaur that was
glowing blue.

[Ichthyosaur's Core]

It was an ether core found in monster species 7th grade or higher. I could
raise my magic power level without coins if I ingested them. It was good
quality because it was a sea commander-grade ichthyosaur. I carefully cut
at the flesh around the core while Bihyung looked at me with a
dumbfounded expression.

"I'll sell this."

[You really…]

"Of course, I don't mean to sell it to you. I'll put it on the dokkaebi auction."

Bihyung accepted it like he was tired of asking me anything. [Sigh… Do
what you want. How much are you going to charge?]

"I won't sell it for coins. I'll sell it by barter."

[Damn, you know all sorts of things,] Bihyung grumbled while uploading
the item to the dokkaebi auction. His desires were simple. This guy might
listen better than I thought.

"Someone will show up to buy it. The item exchanged must be 'Broken
Faith'."

[Broken Faith? There is a person with it… In any case, it is registered.]

"Yes. And I will buy…"

I saw Purest Sword Force in the shopping cart. Indeed, nobody had bought
it yet. Most constellations weren't well aware of the value of coin items.
The expensive items in the Dokkaebi Bag weren't unconditionally good.
[Wait a minute, can I talk to you for a moment?]

At Bihyung's words, the advertising volume increased again.

[Constellations are complaining about the long advertisement.]

Once I saw that one more advertisement had appeared, I had a hunch about
what Bihyung wanted to say.

"Is it the contract?"

Advertising was the only way to hide the eyes and ears of the constellations
without turning off the broadcast. From now on, it wasn't a story for the
constellations.

[Yes. I wasn't certain but I became convinced after this scenario. Well…
let's try it once. I can help you a little bit.]

"Won't this violate the streamer's pledge?"

[Ah, of course, I can't really help you. I'm just saying that. Will you sign the
contract?]

"What are the conditions?"

[Take a look.]

The dokkaebi pulled out an extravagant contract that had been prepared. I
read the contract that emerged as a transparent window in the air.

—–

[Stream Contract Agreement]

Incarnation Kim Dokja (Gap)¹ will sign an exclusive contract with Bihyung
(Eul)¹ until all scenarios are completed or until his death.
—–

"… I am the gap?"

[Haha, don't humans like this? It doesn't mean anything. Keep reading.]

—–

Incarnation Kim Dokja (Gap) will never choose a sponsor until allscenarios
have ended or until his death.

—–

This was also as expected.

—–

Incarnation Kim Dokja (Gap) should only be active on the channel
ofDokkaebi Bihyung (Eul).

Incarnation Kim Dokja (Gap) and Dokkaebi Bihyung (Eul) will
distributethe revenue from stream contracts, and this ratio will be
determined through mutual consultation.

······.

10. Incarnation Kim Dokja (Gap) and Dokkaebi Bihyung (Eul) will be
subject to destruction in accordance with the laws of Star Stream if they
break this contract.

—–

I read the contract carefully down to the last item. Although I thought he
might play some trick on me, I didn't see that part. Except for one thing…

"There is the most important part."
[What do you mean? You can just say that you agree. The stream contract
is a soul pledge―]

"I'm talking about the pay ratio."

[A-Ahh. Haha. Right.]

As if this bastard didn't know this was the most important part.

[How about 5:5? Instead, I'll get rid of my channel fee. Ah, do you know
how to calculate it? I will accurately divide your future donations in this
ratio. For example, if you get 100 coins, you will receive 50 coins and I will
receive 50 coins.]

All stream contracts were like this. The constellations had incarnations
appear on the dokkaebi's channel, and the contributions received from
other constellations would be divided by a percentage. This was normal.
"Are you taking me for a pushover? I won't accept."

[What? B-But this is the industry's default settlement ratio…]

"I'm an incarnation without a sponsor. When donating to an incarnation
without a sponsor, the constellations must pay a huge fee to the dokkaebi.
Haven't you already enjoyed a lot thanks to me?"

Bihyung's jaw slowly dropped open, but there was no point making that
expression.

"10:0. You will only get the commission. I won't pay you a single penny."

[What?! That is ridiculous… H-How about 7:3?]

The ratio changed greatly, but I wasn't going to concede.

"10:0."
[What is this fucking bullshit? It is a ridiculous rate―]

"Then don't accept. I will just go to another channel. 'Gildal' is doing well
these days. I should ask him."

[…8:2. I can't concede any more.]

"10:0."

[······.] Bihyung's expression changed to a threatening one. He looked at
my head like it would explode at any minute. However, I knew that he
would never give up the contract. My existence was his last chance.

"The advertisement is coming to an end. Don't you see the constellations
complaining?"

In the end, Bihyung gave up. [Shit, I understand. Then will you sign the
contract?]

He surrendered easier than I'd thought he would. In fact, I was going to give
up at 9:1.

…Maybe he earned more money than I'd expected. It was a bit disgusting.
"Yes. And one more thing."

[What? What now?]

"You have to give a separate down payment. Give me 5,000 coins."

Bihyung's expression tightened. [Y-You really…]

I laughed. Why a 'gap' was a 'gap' and why did humans dwell on it… I
would let that damn dokkaebi know.

[The stream contract has concluded.]

[You have received 5,000 coins as a down payment.]
The advertisement finished, and the constellations came back. Then I
patted the dokkaebi on the shoulder and said, "Let's get out of here." Now
was the real start.

(respectively) in a legal contract.
              Chapter 16: Ep. 4 – Line of Hypocrisy, I


A meteor shower was pouring down in the starry sky. It was a sight that
anyone would admire, but not Yoo Joonghyuk.

「 It is starting. 」

The meteor shower was the precursor to the start of the third main scenario.
Now Seoul would be destroyed part by part according to the scenario. Yoo
Joonghyuk looked up at the sky before he lowered his head and looked at
the Han River. The landscape around Dongho Bridge was quite desolate
since the large group of ichthyosaurs had recently moved downstream.

「 It was too much. 」

It had already been three days since Kim Dokja entered the Han River. It
might've been too much to demand that he catch the ichthyosaur just after
the first scenario.
「Indeed, it would be hard for me to catch an ichthyosaur in three days. 」
However, it would be impossible to take him if he couldn't do this much. If
he couldn't even do this much, he would only hinder Yoo Joonghyuk.

「 A prophet isn't a big deal. 」

Yoo Joonghyuk closed his eyes with disappointment. He would go on his
own again, without any companions. It wasn't a big deal—he had been
alone all this time.

「 This time I will definitely change it. 」

Yoo Joonghyuk turned around—but maybe he had turned away too soon.




"Wait…!"

[W-What?]

I blinked several times but could only see a grey-white ceiling. I was still
inside the ichthyosaur. I turned my head and saw the surprised Bihyung.

"…I had a dream."

[Ohu, are you trying to raise curiosity? It isn't bad?]

I didn't mean to do such a thing but I didn't mind the misunderstanding.

[A few constellations want you to move to a new place quickly.]

I used 500 coins to buy the Ellain Forest's Vital Force to help me sleep. I
thought it was too dangerous to move while exhausted. The Ellain Forest's
Vital Force quickly relieved fatigue and healed wounds in exchange for two
hours of sleep. In other words, it was an expensive item.
"…I really want to go out."

I talked to myself while stretching my body. The dream I just had was still
clear. Maybe it wasn't a dream.

Kwajijijik!

I heard the sound of an electric current scattering and Bihyung disappeared
without a word. Maybe he went to do his job. I sighed with relief. The
stream contract with the dokkaebi. It was a gamble that I never would've
attempted if I hadn't known about Bihyung from Ways of Survival.

Still, I did it with surprising calm. I never succeeded in any contracts in
'real life'.

[The exclusive skill, 'Fourth Wall' is in use.]

…It was real. I inserted strength to my right hand holding the thorn. I really
thought this world was reality.

[A few constellations want you to act.]

Well, there was no time to worry about it. I swung the thorn as hard as I
could at the stomach wall that lost its elasticity. At the same time, there was
the sound of something collapsing and water poured out. I plunged into the
Han River.

"Puah!"

Fortunately, I didn't see any other ichthyosaurs. Small seawater species
approached with curiosity but no hostility was felt. Not all creatures would
attack humans. Dongho Bridge was over there. I used a piece of the
ichthyosaur corpse as a floatation device and made my way towards dry
land. My skin was cold from the cold water but I couldn't worry about it.
After 30 minutes of swimming, my hand reached land.
[A few constellations are nervously looking at you.]

Normally, danger would immediately come after this message popped up.
[The constellation 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' is making an insidious
smile.]

It was a pity for the constellations but something bad wouldn't happen to
me. It was because I already knew the dangers.

[You have entered the region of the second main scenario.]

[The land in the scenario area is deeply polluted.]

[Be careful about your breathing and move underground as quickly as
possible.]

The message said this but in fact, I shouldn't be above ground from the
moment this scenario started. Why? Look at my skin now.

[You have been exposed to a poisonous fog.]

The skin touched by the violet fog turned black. Once I followed the source
of the fog with my eyes, I saw a monster making terrible cries. It was a
massive monster over 30 meters big. This fog was the fart of the 7th grade
monster, 'great poisonous rhinoceros'.

The rhino snorted and confronted a monster in the fog, which seemed to be
an insect king species based on the shadow. The struggle in this new world
wasn't just for humans. The monsters were also fighting for their homes. I
moved while holding my breath as much as possible.

They were 7th grade monsters like the ichthyosaur but I couldn't deal with
them right now. In the first place, I could kill the sea commander because I
was prepared.

[You have used the Ellain Monkey's Lungs.]
The monkey's lungs was an item I bought in advance that could be used as a
substitute for an air purifier for 20 minutes.

[A few constellations admire your readiness!]

The above ground station, Oksu Station, had already been destroyed. The
nearest underground station from here was 'Geumho Station'. Maybe the
others had moved there. I moved quickly while avoiding the small species
that were eating the corpses. I only had 20 minutes, so I needed to move as
quickly as possible while securing supplies.

The first thing I needed was clothes. My outerwear was melted by the
ichthyosaur's fluids so it was necessary. Of course, there were many of
them all around but… I felt uncomfortable.

…It couldn't be helped. I searched some bodies and grabbed clothes that
roughly fit. Then I headed to a nearby convenience store. I grabbed a few
plastic bags and swept in food randomly. Food would be a valuable trading
item after going underground.

I filled three or four bags like this. It seemed that the colour of the monkey's
lungs was becoming increasingly darker. There wasn't much time left. Then
I heard someone's voice.

"Help…help me."

There was someone still alive? A young woman was lying down in a
corner. The poisoning was progressing on the surface of the skin, but the
toxic condition wasn't severe due to the mask she was wearing. Her jacket
was half removed and a bit of her skirt was torn.

"Are you okay? Can you stand?"

"Uhhhh…"
Was there such an extra in Ways of Survival? I wanted to take a closer look
but I didn't have enough time. I picked up the woman and ran to Geumho
Station. I turned and a side street appeared. Now the distance to Geumho
Station was 100 meters in a straight line.

I breathed in and started to run with all my strength. I could see the Exit 3
sign in the distance.

…Closed. Then on the other side? There was a fire shutter down at every
exit due to the disaster situation. I could break the shutter with the thorn but
if I did it wrong, the people inside might be harmed.

"E-Exit 4…"

Unexpectedly, the woman I was carrying was helpful. I ran towards Exit 4.
Then I found a fire shutter that was rolling down. I placed the thorn in the
gap of the shutter that was trying to close. Somebody yelled out, "Shit, what
is this?"

"Open the door."

"N-No! You can't come in! Go away!"

"There is a wounded person."

"We are already in a full state! We don't need any more people!"

It was full of people? Strange. Was there such a development?

"I don't care about that."

I used the thorn as a lever and lifted the shutter as hard as possible. Since I
used the coins to increase my strength to level 10, I now had the strength of
half a dozen adult males.

"Uwaaaaack!"
There was a loud sound and the people on the other side of the shutter
became nervous.

"R-Run away!"

The scared men escaped into the darkness of the underground passage. I
entered the station safely, lowered the shutter and put the girl down on the
floor.

[You have entered the safety zone.]

The poisonous fog didn't come down to the underground area. There was no
possible scientific explanation. It was just because of the 'scenario'.

"Put this in your mouth."

I took off the woman's mask and handed over the monkey's lungs. It
wouldn't completely cure her but it would have a neutralizing effect.

"Umm…" A faint groan emerged from the mouth of the woman. The
woman who was abandoned. I suddenly wondered about her information.
This woman, it was likely that she had died in the original development. A
voice was heard as I was about to use Character List.

"There he is!"

Light from a flashlight approached in the darkness. My eyes narrowed as I
saw men holding metal pipes.

[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' frowns at the
appearance of the uninvited people.]

A big man in the middle opened his mouth. His body was well balanced so
he must be a strong person.

"Who are you?"
At this moment, I was strangely struck dumb. What should I say when this
happened? I thought for a moment before speaking like Yoo Joonghyuk.

"Kim Dokja."

"…Kim Dokja? That is your name?"

"Yes."

"Who asked that? What is this bastard?"

It was a more difficult question.


"U-Uh! That woman…" One of the men spotted the woman beside me and
shone the flashlight on her. "What, isn't that woman from the marginalized
group? Didn't you come back with her?"

"T-That is…"

The man's flashlight moved in a harassing manner near the woman's waist.

"…Ha, so it was like that. Cute guys. Why did you do that without
hyung¹nim's permission?"

"Hehe. I'm sorry."

"No, of course Cheolsoo hyung-nim should be first…hehe, I was going to
do that."

Cheolsoo? Cheolsoo. Was there a character by that name? I couldn't
remember. He must be insignificant, as opposed to how he looked.

"Hey, hand that woman over to us…huh? What is that?"

The flashlight shone on the convenience store bags on the floor. It was okay
to escape the crisis but the flow was turning out bad.
"Leave that as well. Then you can live."

To be exact, it wasn't good for these guys, not me.

[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' is annoyed at these
people.]

[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' is angry with the injustice
occurring.]

[A bounty scenario has occurred at the request of the constellations!]


  [Bounty Scenario – Remove the Interference]


  Category: Sub

  Difficulty: F

  Clear Conditions: The constellations feel great anger at the disruptors
  who are obstructing your rapid movements. Neutralize them within the
  time limit.

  Time Limit: 5 minutes.

  Failure: ???


I thought it would be like this. Poor bastards. I got up while holding the
thorn. There weren't any minors in the constellations right? I hoped so. It
was because it was now the adult broadcasting time.
[1] Hyung is a Korean honorific used by a male to address an older male.
              Chapter 17: Ep. 4 – Line of Hypocrisy, II


I often thought about it. Why did so many 'predictable villains' appear in
post-apocalyptic stories? It must be the laziness of the authors to think that
crimes such as rape or theft would occur indiscriminately in such a
situation. If the real 'destruction' came, wouldn't humans act more rationally
than they thought?

"It looks like he won't give it. Hey, go ahead and kill him!"

The answer was now right in front of me. I observed the men coming
towards me, as well as the man watching from the rear.

[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' expects a fair judgment.]

I once again realized it. The human imagination was cliché, yet real humans
were more cliché than the imagination.

Hwiiik!
The trajectory of the iron pipe moved in a funny manner through the air. It
wasn't a strike with the intent to kill. In fact, it didn't hurt that much.

"I-If you don't run away then you really will die. Get lost!"

The four men surrounded me. One was trembling but the others looked
more relaxed than before. It was probably due to the advantage in numbers.

"What are these brats doing?" Along with the shout, one man rushed
forward. It was clearly a defenseless posture. I moved the thorn.

Puok!

"Aaaaack! My leg! My leg!"

"You bastard!"

"Hit him together!"

The agitated men rushed simultaneously but I wasn't afraid. Their strength
levels were just about 5. I endured the incoming attacks and silently stabbed
the thorn. The men had their thighs successively pierced and fell to their
knees with a scream. Nevertheless, I didn't kill them. It was because the
scenario clear condition was to 'neutralize' them.

[Constellations of the absolute good system nod at your judgment.]

[A few constellations laugh at your humanity.]

[Constellations have sponsored you 100 coins.]

If I became a murderer, I might be able to attract the attention of the
constellations but it was only for a while. Instantly raising the threshold of
stimulation wasn't good in the long run.

[There are three minutes to the end of the scenario.]
Two minutes had passed. Time calculation was important in time attack
scenarios.

"W-What the hell is this bastard? Why won't you die?"

At this time, their leader who was watching the situation from the back
came forward. "You are a fairly tough guy. Everyone back off. I will deal
with him."

"Cheolsoo hyung-nim! This guy seems to have a pretty strong sponsor!"

"Good. It looks like he has a lot of coins."

Knuckles shining with a black gloss—they weren't ordinary iron knuckles.
Did he receive it from his sponsor?

Crunch.

There was the relaxed sound of bones cracking from the knuckled hands.

[The character 'Cheolsoo' has used Threaten.]

[Threaten doesn't work because the overall capabilities gap is too big.]

"Hoh, aren't you quite good? You aren't getting scared at all." The man's
fist moved before he finished talking. The attack was aimed exactly at my
jaw. I quickly stepped back. That guy smiled. "Aren't you quite good? Do
you exercise?"

Even if I didn't have a footwork skill, anyone could do this if their agility
exceeded level 10. Since I previously invested most of my remaining coins
after buying items, the total sum of my body stats now reached 33. Should I
look at this guy?

Ah…right. Now I remembered.

"Bang Cheolsoo of the Cheoldoo Group."

"What, you know me?"

"Let's see?"

My memory was dim because he disappeared like the wind at the beginning
of the work, but I fuzzily recalled there was a character called Bang
Cheolsoo. He was the stupidest guy in the group at Geumho Station. As far
as I knew, these guys should've been killed by Yoo Joonghyuk. Why were
they still alive?
"Ohu, perhaps you are of 'that' category? You must've killed people. Isn't
that right? Yes, I feel that we are somewhat alike."

[The character 'Bang Cheolsoo' has used Bluff.]

Bluff. It was a skill that anyone who was a thug possessed. It was a good
debuff that could weaken the opponent's attack power, but this case was
different.

[Fourth Wall has blocked the bluff of the character Bang Cheolsoo.]

[The confidence of the character Bang Cheolsoo is rapidly falling.]

"Are you ignoring me? You really want to die." Bang Cheolsoo took a
threatening Greco-Roman wrestling posture and rushed towards me, but
that was only a bluff. It was because he didn't have the 'wrestling' skill.

"Stop beating around the bush and come on."

"Son of a bitch!"

The key skill that Bang Cheolsoo had was Dogfight Lv. 2. His combat
power was insignificant unless he got into a melee.

"Die!"

The agility difference was so high that his attacks rarely hit me. I looked at
him with a bit of sympathy. Not all constellations had a desire to raise their
incarnations as the 'protagonist' of the scenario. For example, his
constellation 'Monarch of the Small Fries' was famous for being thrifty with
his incarnations. A masochist who enjoyed using idiots as his incarnation
and watching them be crushed by other incarnations. That was the
'Monarch of the Small Fries'.

[The constellation 'Monarch of the Small Fries' is delighted.]
[The constellation 'Monarch of the Small Fries' has sponsored you 100
coins.]

Despite his incarnation being smashed, he was supporting the enemy.
Originally, I was thinking about ending the time attack in one blow but now
the story was a bit different.

[There are two minutes to the end of the sub scenario.]

Then I should make the most of the remaining time.

"You rat bastard!" All of his lines were in the style of the Monarch of the
Small Fries. How pitiful. "Haha! I hit you!"

His attack luckily hit but there was little damage. The spot where I was hit
just stung a bit.

"How?"

How? My physique was Lv. 12. His strength was only Lv. 7. The disparity
in the overall stats created a huge combat power gap.

"Is it my turn now?"

I touched the cheek of the stupefied Bang Cheolsoo before hitting it as hard
as I could. A few teeth flew out as Bang Cheolsoo screamed. I didn't
hesitate and pierced his arm with the thorn.

"Aaaagh!"

I pinned one of his arms to the wall with the thorn and started the
indiscriminate assault. I chose the areas that were the most painful without
knocking him out, such as the back, thighs and sides.

[The constellation 'Monarch of the Small Fries' is delighted.]
[The constellation 'Monarch of the Small Fries' has requested an extension
of the sub scenario time.]

[The sub scenario is extended by one minute.]

I also paid attention to the parts where the woman had been injured.

"Cough! Kuheok! Kuheeok!"

Blood and flesh were scattered. Broken teeth fell to the ground and the
broken bones twisted abnormally. However, I didn't stop kicking.

"S-Stop! Please! Let hyung-nim go!"

The men standing to the side exclaimed with panic. I looked over at them
once in a while. Then I looked at the half naked woman lying on the
ground.
Humans were weak. How could such weak humans do such cruel things?

They used the excuse of the world being destroyed. They killed, raped
women and stole from others.

Was it because of instincts? I was suddenly curious as I saw Bang
Cheolsoo's eyes stained with fear in front of a stronger violence?

"Why did you do it?" It was a question out of nowhere. In fact, I didn't
expect an answer to this question but at the moment I was about to kick him
again, Bang Cheolsoo opened his eyes.

"Fuck…just kill me you son of a bitch."

The moment I saw his eyes, I knew he had answered my question in his
own way. A look that didn't show any lingering attachment to life. Yes. It
wasn't because of instincts. Bang Cheolsoo talked in a voice that was
subsiding.

"Dog, this dog-like world…"
This guy was a human who had been despairing long before this world was
destroyed. Just like me.

[There are 10 seconds left to the end of the sub scenario.]

I didn't delay any further and gave a strong kick to his neck. The breath was
knocked out of him and Bang Cheolsoo finally fainted.

[You have met the conditions to clear the sub scenario.]

[You have earned 300 coins.]

I hope all of you are happy.

[The constellation 'Monarch of the Small Fries' is satisfied and has
sponsored you 100 coins.]

The other men crawled and approached me one by one.

"H-How cruel…"

They looked at Bang Cheolsoo, who had been turned into a rag, and then up
at me with fear. It was like they were dogs waiting to be disposed of at a
slaughterhouse. I picked up the collapsed woman and the convenience store
bags. In any case, the world had been destroyed and I had to live a new life.

"Take me to where the group is."




Geumho Station was originally a place that would grow into the region's
base after it was organized by Yoo Joonghyuk. In his first regression, Yoo
Joonghyuk broke through the second main scenario with the Geumho
Station group, allowing the people of the group to occupy a place in the
new era. Even so, that was the first round. By the third round of regression,
Yoo Joonghyuk was different. The 3rd turn Yoo Joonghyuk was a monster
who monopolized everything.

"…Even so, he was someone who would do the basic clean up."

"Huh?" The man guiding me was surprised.

"I'm just talking to myself. It is a habit."

[The constellation 'Secretive Plotter' likes your monologues.]

"Yes…anyway, this way."

The men of the Cheoldoo Group, who were supporting each other, stopped
moving. We descended to the bottom of the dark platform and found a
place where there was still light. I heard the buzzing sound of people as we
went down the stairs.

"The Cheoldoo Group! People are hurt!"

Some people rushed over to support Bang Cheolsoo's group. There was
more of a system then I thought since people were moving in an orderly
fashion. In the meantime, I saw familiar faces run over.

"Oh my god. Dokja-ssi! Dokja-ssi!"

Fortunately, it looks like nothing happened. I greeted the person, "Yoo
Sangah-ssi."

"I'm glad. Really, I'm really glad!" Yoo Sangah stood in front of me with a
happy expression. I was startled and offered an awkward handshake. There
were a lot of scrapes on the back of Yoo Sangah's hand, showing she had
suffered quite a hard time in the past four days. I heard a sound and
something became attached to my leg.

"You're alive." It was Lee Gilyoung.
I stroked the boy's head and asked, "Have you been well?"

Lee Gilyoung nodded. He must be hungry since his cheeks were really thin.
I pulled out a chocolate bar from the bag and placed it in Lee Gilyoung's
hand.

"I knew you were alive, Dokja-ssi. Hah…" Finally, I looked at Lee
Hyunsung. The muscles of his upper half seemed to have become more
solid. Maybe Lee Hyunsung had protected these two. "I'm really sorry. At
that time, I left Dokja-ssi…"

"It was an unavoidable situation."

"Phew, I'm glad that Yoo Joonghyuk-ssi was right."

…Yoo Joonghyuk? Why was that name heard here? Lee Hyunsung noticed
after a moment and said, "That, Yoo Joonghyuk said that Dokja-ssi was
probably alive…"

"…Where is Yoo Joonghyuk now?"

"He isn't here now."

Not here?

"Yoo Joonghyuk-ssi left the station yesterday. So…"

I could determine many things before Lee Hyunsung finished speaking. I
see. It was truly like that. He was a person in a rush.

"That reminds me, there is one more person."

"Ah, the department head."

Yoo Sangah didn't finish speaking because a group of men suddenly
intruded. Nonetheless, it was a good thing.
"Everybody, out of the way!"

I didn't have to hear the explanation to see what happened straight away.
Three or four men armed with a hammer or pipe started to surround me.
There was a familiar face among them.

"Y-You…!" Han Myungoh abandoned me on the Even Bridge and now he
looked like he had seen a ghost. Han Myungoh must've joined this group.
"G-Get rid of that guy! He is a very bad person! He shouldn't be here!"

A thief was always the one who felt pins and needles. Han Myungoh started
exclaiming wildly. However, I noticed that the other men looked at each
other and didn't easily move. There was something weird. Han Myungoh
was placed in the center yet they didn't listen to him?

"Haha, Han hyung. Everyone should get along so why don't you stop?"

"Ah, t-that…"

"You are a new person."

The man split apart to the sides and a path was formed. A slim man
appeared among them. I could tell just by looking in his eyes. This guy had
a sponsor.

"Nice to meet you. Can I ask what your name is?"

"Kim Dokja."

"Dokja-ssi. I see. I am Cheon Inho."

Cheon Inho? It felt like a name I should remember. I inserted strength to the
hand holding the thorn. It looked like this guy was the leader of the
Cheoldoo Group. He lost half of his men to me so he came here to make
trouble.
"I heard the story from those you came with. You fought a monster
and saved my group members." …What?

"Everyone, please gather! We have a brave new group member!"

At Cheon Inho's words, people started to turn this way one by one. It was at
this time that I knew. It was impossible for the charisma of Han Myungoh
to gather this much power. Cheon Inho was the real leader of this bunch.

"Wah! It is food!"

Hungry eyes fell on the convenience store bags. Then Cheon Inho spoke as
if he had been waiting, "He delivered it exactly to us. He is a rare good
person."

The words made all the eyes look at me like I was a savior. The mother
holding the child and the elderly man who hurt his leg were looking at me
earnestly.

Cheon Inho…I seemed to remember. Yes, there was this guy in the
Geumho station group.

[The constellation 'Secretive Plotter' is excited.]

In this ruined world, the real danger wasn't people like Bang Cheolsoo.
Humans moving while feeling despair weren't the least bit dangerous to me.
The really dangerous people were those who used the despair of others as a
fertilizer for power. Just like this guy.

"Welcome to Geumho Station, Kim Dokja-ssi."

Cheon Inho was laughing on the inside while gazing at me. He chuckled
while shaking my hand. Cheon Inho would never know. At this moment,
his future had been decided.
              Chapter 18: Ep. 4 – Line of Hypocrisy, III


Despite the interference of Cheon Inho, the constellations didn't ask for a
bounty scenario. In other words, it wasn't the best time to deal with him.

For around half a day, I focused on grasping the situation of Geumho
Station. It was Lee Hyunsung who mainly gave information. "Currently,
there are 86 people in Geumho Station. Ah, I guess it is 87 people now with
Dokja-ssi."

"It is less than I thought."

"Yes. When the scenario broke out, only those near the station and those on
the train survived. Everyone didn't say it but perhaps in the first scenario…"

I didn't need to be told the next words. I could see it from the expressions of
the people. Those who survived had trampled on someone's life. All the
humans here were murderers.
"Currently, Geumho Station is divided into two groups. Strictly speaking, it
is one group and the rest."

Lee Hyunsung looked at the people with a dark expression. There were men
armed with iron pipes or other instruments. It was clear which was the
faction in power.

"Believe in me! The group president is working hard and everyone will
soon be rescued." The youngest son of Hankyung Group, Han Myungoh
cried out.

"Hyung-nim is right, everyone. Don't lose hope. We will be able to led."
The one who embraced Han Myungoh and practically led the group was
Cheon Inho. They were the 'mainstream group'.

"Mother, I'm bored…can't I play a game on the phone?"

"Hold on for a moment. The rescue team will come soon."

"The government will act. It isn't that easy to collapse a country."

Then the people who were protected by the mainstream group and wanted
to get on with their lives were the 'marginalized group'. Their will was too
weak to be killers. Even if 100 murderers were gathered together, they
would be divided between the weak and the strong. Maybe they were
thinking that they weren't murderers. They all believed it was unavoidable.

Lee Hyunsung watched the mainstream group inciting the people and said,
"Food distribution is determined by the mainstream group. Convenience
stores and restaurants in the region have already been robbed…the foods
that can be eaten right now are almost gone."

"I see."
"It is the reason why some people from the mainstream group were sent
above ground for food collection. Heewon-ssi, who you brought in, went
with them."

"Heewon-ssi…?"

"Ah, it is the name of the woman who Dokja-ssi saved."

I looked at the woman who lay on the subway bench. Under the bright
light, her beauty could be seen. Her raised cheeks and gentle features meant
she must've often heard she was attractive. Thanks to the monkey's lungs,
her colour was much brighter than it was this morning.

"Is Heewon-ssi the only one who didn't come back?"

"No. In fact, a few more people went out this morning but only those from
the marginalized group didn't return."

"They didn't come back?"

"Yes." Lee Hyunsung's expression became sad again. He thought he
roughly knew what happened. I grabbed Lee Hyunsung's shoulder. I knew
for sure after actually touching him. He truly was the steel sword. His
strength would soon exceed level 10.

"W-Why are you…?"

"Lee Hyunsung-ssi should've received a love call but you didn't accept."

"Ah, that…" Objectively, Lee Hyunsung's combat power was higher than
Bang Cheolsoo. There was no way Cheon Inho wouldn't aim for him. "I
can't explain it but I thought I shouldn't accept. I don't know much about
morals or ethics but…" Lee Hyunsung scratched his head like he was
embarrassed. "I felt that something wasn't right."

Not right…
It wasn't an answer but I felt it was true. Indeed, Lee Hyunsung was Lee
Hyunsung.

"Don't forget this heart."

That way, I could continue to believe in him. I heard a cute sound from
somewhere and looked back, seeing Yoo Sangah and Lee Gilyoung looking
up at me. Their faces were like baby birds waiting for the mother bird,
making me laugh.

"That reminds me, it is already evening. Aren't you hungry? Take this one
by one." I handed over the food from the convenience store one by one.

"Ah. Really? Can I?"

"This time is free. But next time, you should pay for it."

"Huh? H-How much…?"

"Don't you all have coins? It is 10 coins for one."

"T-That…"

Confusion filled the faces of Yoo Sangah and Lee Hyunsung. They looked
like they hadn't expected my words.

"Of course. I will pay right now. I don't need freebies." Surprisingly, the
one who spoke was the woman who had been lying on the bench. She had
regained consciousness. "I am Jung Heewon. Thank you for your help this
morning."

"It is nothing." I thought it was just a cute mask but I could see that it was a
prejudice.

"Yoo Sangah-ssi, Lee Hyunsung-ssi. Everyone, please wake up. It isn't the
time to be making this look. This food, he obtained it by risking his life. Do
you expect to get it for free?" There was almost no expression on the face
that spoke without hesitation.

"Ah…" Yoo Sangah turned red like she had woken up. "I was too
shortsighted, I'm sorry. Of course we should pay…it is right. I don't like
freebies either. I hate depending on other people."

"I also agree with Yoo Sangah-ssi. I will pay coins from now on."

I was a little surprised by the unexpected reaction. Indeed, just because it
was an apocalypse didn't mean there was only one type of person. I replied,
"If you insist…I understand. Does everyone know how to exchange coins?"
"Yes. I learned a few days ago. Touch each other's index finger, um, and…"

"Just state how many coins you want to exchange."

Starting from Jung Heewon, Yoo Sangah and Lee Hyunsung paid 10 coins
in exchange for food. It was fortunate that their resistance wasn't bigger
than what I thought. I didn't do this in order to get a few coins. At first, this
judgment might seem harsh but people would soon realize this choice was
right.

['Lee Gilyoung' has paid you 20 coins.]

"Huh? You gave me more than 10 coins?"

"It is the price for the chocolate bar during the day."

Lee Gilyoung's expression while speaking was quite good. Maybe the
fastest to adapt to a new world wasn't an adult but a child. It was easier for
children to break common sense.

"Will Dokja-ssi keep staying with us?"

"Ah, that…"
"Dokja-ssi." It wasn't Lee Hyunsung who called out to me. I looked back
and saw Cheon Inho from the mainstream group. Yes, I thought he would
be back soon.

"Can I talk with you for a while?"

Bang Cheolsoo was missing some teeth and glaring at me from behind
Cheon Inho. He stared at me before turning his head away. A foolish
fellow.

"Okay, let's talk."

I nodded and Cheon Inho spoke with a satisfied expression, "Then can the
rest of you vacate this place for a moment? I want to talk to Dokja-ssi
alone."

"Ah, that…"

"No, you don't have to go. You can listen."

Cheon Inho's eyes twitched at my words. Lee Hyunsung stopped as he was
about to retreat.

"Hmmm, is that so? Well…I don't care."

He acted like they were free to listen. Cheon Inho wiped the bench and sat
down. Men from the Cheoldoo Group appeared on both sides of him and
handed him a cigarette and lighter. He had seen too many movies. "You
seem to have a nature that dislikes cumbersome things, so I will get to the
point."

"Yes."

"Join our group." It was an expected offer. "I can offer Dokja-ssi a high
position in our group. I want to lead the group together with you."

"Why me?"
"Shouldn't you know why?" Cheon Inho glanced towards the injured
Cheoldoo Group members. "Dokja-ssi is a hero who saved people from
monsters. A hero needs such a place."

It was an interesting way of thinking. He would take advantage of my
presence.

"And if I refuse?"

"Refuse? How interesting. I never thought about that." Cheon Inho blew out
cigarette smoke towards me. "Dokja-ssi, this isn't a favour. You have a duty
to do this. Can't you see the poor people here?"

People were looking this way with scruffy faces. There were crying
children and tired elderly people.

"It isn't a big story. I am asking you to work together for survival. Dokja-
ssi, don't you have the strength?"

"What exactly do you want?"

"I need someone to be a hitman." Hitman? "Until a few days ago, there was
someone else doing the job. He procured food alone and hunted in the
tunnels. To be exact, we took it one-sidedly."

I didn't need to ask. This was the story of Yoo Joonghyuk.

"Then he suddenly left last night."

"So you need someone to replace him?"

"I think your strength is proven with Cheolsoo-ssi."

Lee Hyunsung and Jung Heewon's eyes widened. Now they noticed what
was going on.
"It isn't bad for Dokja-ssi. You are the hero of the people and will be the
leader of the group with us. Everyone will like you and also…"

I interrupted, "I'm sorry but I can't be responsible for anyone. I don't want
to join your group."

"Hrmm. Is that so?"

"Above all, the way you run the group doesn't fit me."

I looked at the healthy members of the Cheoldoo Group and the
sicklylooking members of the marginalized group. In particular, Jung
Heewon was looking at the Cheon Inho as if he was her mortal enemy.

"Is that so? It is fine. However, if you change your mind, come back
anytime."

"That will not happen."

"Haha, it remains to be seen."

It didn't take long to find out what Cheon Inho's words meant. As the
members of the Cheoldoo Group retreated, the other group members
approached as if they had been waiting. It was the people of the
marginalized group. They grabbed me and raised their voices.

"Hey, is the rumour true?"

"Are you really monopolizing the food?"

"Are you going to eat it all when there is enough to share with everyone?"

"We are all staying here! Why are you the only one to have it?"

"Leave the food to Inho-ssi! He will distribute it fairly!"
I knew what was going on. I could see the smiling face of Cheon Inho in
the rear of the people. His lips were moving.

'Choose'.

Will I give food and become the hero? Or would I be the villain and
monopolize it alone? If I chose to be the hero, I would fall into Cheon
Inho's game. After the food was distributed, I would have to hunt for food
with the group members and would someday get stabbed in the back. On
the other hand, I would be isolated in a group in a moment if I monopolized
the food alone.

[The eyes of a few constellations are shining.]

[The constellation 'Secretive Plotter' has snorted.]

As the people became heated up, Cheon Inho came forward.

"Ahh, everyone. Calm down. There seems to be a misunderstanding. Kim
Dokja-ssi isn't such a person." What was this? A decoy? "Kim Dokja-ssi
decided to work with us. The food he brought today will be left to the
mainstream group and will be shared fairly. He also promised to continue to
work with us―"

Of course, he believed I would choose him. It was hard to listen anymore.

"Stop."

I worried about it for a short moment. What would Yoo Joonghyuk do? Ah,
that's it. The answer was that he wasn't here right now. However, I wasn't
Yoo Joonghyuk.

"Of course I will give out food." I saw Cheon Inho's lips curve upwards.
But people should listen to the end. "However, it isn't for free."
Unlike Yoo Joonghyuk, I wouldn't throw everything away to move
forward. But I wouldn't be responsible for everyone. Food was given but it
wouldn't be for free. People were puzzled as if they didn't understand the
words.

"W-Wait a minute! It isn't free?"

"I'll tell you. I don't intend to monopolize the food. But I won't give food to
Cheon Inho's group. I'm not UNICEF and I don't trust them." I smiled at
Cheon Inho. "I will make a deal with you. I will sell you the food for a fair
price."

"S-Sell?"

"What…?"

"Uh, how much…money?"

In the distance, I could see Cheon Inho's face stiffening. I laughed as I
faced him.

"No, I only accept coins."




After a while, only the people in the marginalized group with a relationship
with me returned.

"That…D-Dokja-ssi. Is this a good choice?"

"Sheesh, is there anything free in life? Dokja-ssi, you said it well. I feel
refreshed." Jung Heewon dismissed Lee Hyunsung's concern. After I made
the 'trade' declaration, many citizens turned away from me. Maybe they
were disappointed.
"I agree with Heewon-ssi. The people here are too tame to the mainstream
group."

"That's right. The sons of bitches…Geumho Station is currently in their
palms. People are treated as cattle and are sometimes taken to a
slaughterhouse. Just like myself this morning."

Jung Heewon's body trembled. In fact, it wasn't me but the mainstream
group monopolizing the food. They monopolized the food on the pretext of
'fair distribution' and fed it to the tamed people. Humans were the weakest
when they believed someone protected them. Once authority was
established in a one-sided relationship, people started to depend on them.

"I agree. That's why I believe that Dokja-ssi's declaration today was very
meaningful. People need to have the will to do something on their own.
However…" Lee Hyunsung looked towards the food. "Not even one was
sold. 50 coins for one, isn't this price too expensive? Why don't you make it
10 coins like you did with us…?"

It wasn't unreasonable to think so. People only paid attention to the
mainstream group and showed no signs of looking this way. People still
needed time. I responded calmly, "Let's wait a little longer."

Then night came. The sound of huge monsters was heard intermittently
from the ground and people often had nightmares. Lee Gilyoung and Yoo
Sangah fell asleep first while Jung Heewon was dozing off.

Lee Hyunsung said, "Dokja-ssi should sleep as well. I will stand vigil."
"Nope. It is okay. Lee Hyunsung-ssi can sleep first."

"But you will be tired."

"I have work to do."

"Work to do?"
I pointed behind Lee Hyunsung. Surprisingly, there were the shadows of
people. It wasn't just one.

"That…are you still trading the food?"

Finally, the people started to move.
             Chapter 19: Ep. 4 – Line of Hypocrisy, IV


The next morning, I was almost out of supplies. Jung Heewon stared at the
convenience store bags as if she couldn't believe it. "Oh my god, it is sold
out?"

"Yes."

"Ha, really funny. Everyone was just watching and now…"

"Nope, it wasn't just the marginalized group."

The guests who came in the middle of the night weren't just members of the
marginalized group.

"Kim Dokja-ssi, you are making the worst choice." Among them was
Cheon Inho. "You will regret it."

More than half the food I had was taken by the mainstream group. Of
course, they paid the exact amount. Jung Heewon was enraged after hearing
the story. "Wait a minute. Then the mainstream group will just monopolize
the food again?"

"Something like that."

"No, what is this? Weren't you going to weaken the power of the
mainstream group by promoting transactions among the people?"

It was an unexpected insight. I responded with a bit of admiration, "That's
correct. That was the intent. I wanted people to move voluntarily."

"Then why did you sell food to the mainstream group? The situation won't
change!"

"It has changed. I have obtained coins."

"Huh?" It was 1,450 coins, a huge income for one night. "No…what is
Dokja-ssi thinking? Sangah-ssi, can we really trust this man?"

Yoo Sangah flinched as attention suddenly turned to her but then she
smiled brightly. "I believe in him." It was burdensome.

"Dokja-ssi, did you leave enough food for yourself?"

"Nope, I sold it."

Jung Heewon's mouth fell open as if she was dumbfounded. At that time,
someone poked my cheek. I turned my head and found a biscuit.

"Huh? You want me to eat it?"

Nod nod. The head moved cutely. I smiled, took the biscuit and put it in
Lee Gilyoung's mouth.

"I'm okay. You eat it. Ah, I should tell you something… everyone, do you
still have the food you ate yesterday?"
"Yes, I have it."

"I have a bit left."

"Why? Do you want to buy it back? I will sell it." Jung Heewon waved the
biscuit in a playful manner.

"No, you should eat it now."

"Huh?"

"Eat it all by today. You should do it now." I repeatedly stressed. "Or you
will regret it."

Jung Heewon cried out, "Why…no, wait a minute. Sangah-ssi, what are
you doing now? Why are you listening to him?"

"There is a reason why Dokja-ssi would say this." Yoo Sangah smiled
sweetly and opened a bag of biscuits. Lee Hyunsung was confused but ate
the food. Meanwhile, Lee Gilyoung had eaten it the moment I spoke. He
was a good listener.

"Ah well…I will leave one."

"I won't stop you."

I shrugged at Jung Heewon's words. It was up to her to regret it. At lunch
time, there was a major announcement from the mainstream group. Cheon
Inho stood on a platform surrounded by people and said, "We will limit the
food ration from today. The allocation is three biscuits per person. And―"
People became irritated before the speech was over.

"What? Three biscuits? How can we live on that?"

"That's right! Don't the scouts get more food? Do you think we don't
know?"
Despite being cursed at, Cheon Inho just laughed calmly. "Your words are
correct. Yes, the scouts receive more rations. If you want more food, please
apply to be a scout."

"Very few people have come back after applying to be a scout! The
Cheoldoo Group members are the ones who always come back!" "Do you
want us to die now?"

Cheon Inho was nonchalant despite the violent reactions of the citizens.
"Those people were just unlucky. You know that it is terribly dangerous
outside. Why don't you obtain food yourself if you are dissatisfied?"

"T-That…"

The people closed their mouths dumbly. If they went out now, they would
die. Everyone knew this. Cheon Inho wasn't finished. "Ah, there is a way to
get food without being a scout."

"What is it?"

"A deal. We will be happy to exchange food for anything we determine to
be of value. Every person can give something different. Isn't that right?"

Cheon Inho's cold gaze caused the people to tremble. It was mostly the
people who came to me yesterday and bought food.

[The character 'Cheon Inho' has activated the 'Incite Lv. 2' skill.]

"Originally, I wasn't going to do this, but yesterday, Kim Dokja-ssi told me
something nice. That's right, everyone. Is there anything free in the world?
If you want food, you have to prove your worth. This is the way it is. Haha,
thank you for telling me something good, Kim Dokja-ssi."

…Look at this? At this moment, everyone's attention was focused on me.
Their eyes were mostly filled with resentment.
"Because of that bastard…"

People wanted to be stupid and Cheon Inho had the 'Incite' skill. It was a
skill that most good group leaders would have. But this way, the hostility
would turn towards me again…

I looked at the back of Cheon Inho. It was a cute level, at least compared to
the people at Chungmuro and Seoul Station. The people gathered in front of
the podium were already trying to bargain.

"I-I will buy it with coins. How much do you want?"

"200 coins."

"Huh? But I don't have that many coins."

"Then go away."

200 coins for one piece of food, even the dokkaebi was likely to pass out.
One of the Cheoldoo Group member selling food saw my look and
trembled. He had a bandage around his thigh and seemed to be one of the
guys I beat up yesterday.

"Did I ever say thank you for yesterday?" A voice was heard. I suddenly
turned my head and saw Jung Heewon standing nearby.

"I think I heard it."

"Still, I want to thank you again." I wanted to say something but Jung
Heewon's eyes were fixed on the injured Cheoldoo Group member. "The
one with the injured leg, he was the one who tried to rape me yesterday."

"…I see."

"Don't touch him because I will kill him myself. Understood?"
Her killing intent was impressive. Was she chosen by a sponsor or was it a
late blooming attribute?

[The exclusive skill, Character List is activated.]

I was a little worried about using this skill. This woman would've died if I
hadn't saved her. Would she be registered as a character?


  [Character Summary]

  Name: Jung Heewon

 Age: 27 years old.

 Sponsor: None (Three constellations are currently showing interest in
 this person).

 Exclusive Attributes: Crouching Figure (General)

 Exclusive Skills: Demon Slaying Lv. 1, Kendo Lv. 1.

 Stigma: None

 Overall Stats: Physique Lv. 4, Strength Lv. 4, Agility Lv. 7, Magic
 Power Lv. 4.

 Overall Evaluation: She is a 'Crouching Figure' with enormous
 potential. The attribute information isn't verified yet because the
 attribute hadn't blossomed.


Fortunately, her information appeared. It was different from Yoo Sangah,
Lee Gilyoung and Han Myungoh. Was she originally not abandoned? By
the way, she had a very interesting exclusive attribute.
'Crouching Figure'.

It didn't seem big based on the name, but it was one of the few 'super
evolutionary' attributes in Ways of Survival. 'Crouching Figure' was a
general rated attribute, but it could reach a rare or legendary rating
depending on the occasion. One of the 100 strongest people in Ways of
Survival, the Crazy Butcher, evolved from 'Crouching Figure'.

Jung Heewon. I thought she was just a passing person but I might have to
consider taking her as a colleague. It would take a while to grow her
'Demon Slaying' skill but this woman could become a powerful hitman if
she was raised well.

"By the way, Dokja-ssi is very calm."

Calm… It might seem like that. I stated, "I am familiar with situations like
this in the novel."

"Huh? Does that make sense… Wait a minute. Where are you going?"

I didn't answer and descended from the platform. Jung Heewon wanted to
come with me but I reached out a hand to stop her.

"It's okay."

Jung Heewon landed lightly below the platform. I walked along the railway
tracks and looked at the tunnel to Yaksu Station. It was pitch-dark and the
inside wasn't visible, but it smelt terrible. It was a bloody smell.

"You aren't going inside are you?" Jung Heewon asked. "Everyone who
went that way has died. The thugs or anyone else. Everyone who goes
inside will unconditionally die."

Her words were wrong. Not everyone died. At least one person had already
gone down this tunnel and moved on to the next station. We climbed onto
the platform again. We had been gone for quite some time but the line of
people queuing to trade food was still long. Some people who protested
against the mainstream group were beaten up and other paid unusual prices
for the food.

Shortly afterwards, Jung Heewon saw a few young women from the
marginalized group sneak into the back of a tarp and she became furious.
"Ah, really annoying. Did you see that?"

"I saw it."

Cheon Inho had said it. 'Anything' could be exchanged for food, but the
girls who just entered weren't carrying anything. Jung Heewon sprang to
her feet. "I can't just watch this."

"What will you do?"

"Stop it. I have to tell them not to do it, no matter the circumstances!"

"Then those women will starve."

"Are you just going to watch?"

"Yes, I think you should just watch this time."

"What do you mean by that?"

I received Jung Heewon's contemptuous gaze before saying, "Jung
Heewonssi, stopping those women won't solve the current problem. Even if
you stop them now, something similar will occur late at night."

"…Then I will stop them again. I will stop it and stop it."

"Then what about their food? Among those who just entered the tarp, there
is a mother with a child. If that child starves to death, will Jung Heewon-ssi
be responsible for the child's death?"
Jung Heewon's eyes shook. She lowered her head as if to hide her
expression. "Then what can I do? The alternative…"

I looked at Jung Heewon. With this, Jung Heewon wouldn't do anything
unexpected. She was a 'Crouching Figure' with 'Demon Slaying'.
Depending on how she acted, Jung Heewon might evolve into an
indiscriminate murderer.

"Jung Heewon-ssi, the key to this problem is food. Isn't that right?"

"…That's right."

"Then we need to remove the cause of the problem."

"Huh…?"

I looked at my watch instead of answering. It was time.

Kwajijijik!

Yes, he showed up. The air split apart and a familiar figure was revealed.
Screams came from everywhere. The nightmare of humanity that opened up
this tragedy.

[H-How are you all doing? Haven't you been free for a while?]

The dokkaebi.

"A-Aaaagh!"

The people panicked at the appearance of the dokkaebi. It was never a good
thing when this guy showed up. Even Jung Heewon, who was full of
energy, flinched momentarily. By the way, it wasn't Bihyung. Originally,
Bihyung was the dokkaebi responsible for all nearby channels, but this was
a different guy. Unlike the pure white fur of Bihyung, this dokkaebi had
black fur.
[M-My friend who was originally in charge of this channel is
undergoing disciplinary action… S-So, I am responsible for this
scenario.] The dokkaebi's timid tone was very memorable.

[T-Then everyone. D-Don't you look very peaceful? T-That Bihyung, he
pretended to be pretentious only to set this level of scenario difficulty…]

"W-What are you saying? Tell us what you want!"

[H-Hik. Don't be angry. Everyone. A-Anyway, I came for you guys…]

"For us?"

"T-Then give us food!"

[F-Food? Aha…if you want food…]

After his words ended, the dokkaebi moved his hand.

[A scenario penalty has been added.]

[From now on, food stockpiling is limited.]

[All existing stockpiled food has disappeared.]

"U-Uhh! What?"

The people with emergency food screamed. Whether it was from the
mainstream group or the marginalized group, everything that was called
'food' floated in the air.

[He, hehe. Then everyone. You can't. Y-You have to think about how
to break the scenario.] Susuk.
The canned food, biscuits, calorie bars, etc. The emergency food gathered
by the people were destroyed with one gesture from the dokkaebi. The
people's expressions became grim when they saw the food disappearing.

[Y-You want to eat? In any case, Earth trash…]

His tone suddenly changed. I seemed to remember his name. According to
the original setting, there was one dokkaebi like this. His tone was timid but
he was more cruel than any other dokkaebi. In the distance, Cheon Inho
was watching me with confused eyes.

[Everyone, let's have fun from now on.

Hehe…] It was followed by system messages.

[A scenario penalty has been added.]

[The 'survival cost' clause has been added.]

[From now on, 100 coins will be deducted every night for the 'survival
cost'. If you can't pay the 'survival cost,' you will die.]

[The 'survival cost' penalty will be maintained until the second main
scenario is cleared.]

I laughed as I read the rising messages. Yes, now it was like Ways of
Survival.
                 Chapter 20: Ep. 5 – Dark Keeper, I


[T-Then I will let everyone take care of it! Yihihihit!] The dokkaebi said
these words and disappeared.

A food penalty and survival penalty. I already knew about the former
penalty. However, the latter wasn't in the original Ways of Survival. Maybe
my contract with Bihyung caused this development. Jung Heewon
confirmed that the biscuit in her pocket had disappeared and asked in a soft
voice, "Dokja-ssi, did you perhaps know something like this would hap―"

"I did expect it. I thought about what the dokkaebis would do first to harass
humans."

"…Aren't you really good at making predictions?"

I called Lee Hyunsung and the others over. The situation was created
and now it was time to move. "Give back our food!"

"How, how did this happen?"
The people of the marginalized group were crying. Cheon Inho and the
mainstream group were also devastated by the sudden food shortage. My
eyes met Cheon Inho's, who then bit his lip.

[Perhaps…were you aware of it? No, that's impossible.] If I could read his
thoughts then that's what he would be thinking.

[You have accurately read the thoughts of character 'Cheon Inho'.]

[Your understanding of the character 'Cheon Inho' has increased.]

…My understanding rose from this sort of thing? I looked at other people's
expressions and tried to guess what they were thinking. However, the
previous messages didn't pop up again. Meanwhile, Cheon Inho quickly
gathered the people together in order to organize the chaos.

"Everyone, gather together. I will give you an emergency notice."

The contents of the notice were simple: The situation had become worse so
more 'scouts' from the marginalized group were needed. They had to hurry.
Now there was no food underground.

"We won't distribute food to people who don't participate as scouts."

Despite the hardline declaration, there was no backlash from the citizens.
No, they couldn't. It was an inevitable result in this situation. The people
noticed it and volunteered to be scouts one by one. The food had
disappeared but hope remained on Cheon Inho's face. As the situation
became worse, more control was passed onto the mainstream group.

Lee Hyunsung became anxious when he saw this and opened his mouth,
"Dokja-ssi, what now?"

"Of course, we have to go and get food."
The expressions of the party members became tense at these words. Obtain
food. This meant only one thing.

"Then we have to be scouts? There is still food remaining aboveground."
"Nope, we won't go aboveground. If we go there, we will unconditionally
die." I looked at a gas mask on the floor. This tattered gas mask couldn't
stop the poisonous fog.

Lee Hyunsung muttered, "We need to obtain food aboveground…" "Lee

Hyunsung-ssi. The world has changed. Then the food needs to change." I

looked at the tunnel to Yaksu Station.

"Wait a minute. Dokja-ssi…don't tell me?"

"That's right."

In this world, humans were no longer the top predators. Even if we weren't
predators, we didn't necessarily have to be prey.

"We will hunt monsters."




After a while, several people from the marginalized group, including
myself, were standing in front of the tunnel towards Yaksu Station.

"I see. You are going to enter the railway track?" I thought Cheon Inho
would challenge us when we refused to join the scouting group, but he
seemed relieved that I was out of the group. He might think I was a threat to
his own power. "Well, looking at it in the long run, a team dedicated to
attacking the scenario is required. Come back safely."
He was a funny guy. He spoke like he was the captain but the time for him
to be finished wasn't far off.

[Your understanding of the character 'Cheon Inho' has increased.]

[Your understanding of the character 'Cheon Inho' has reached a certain
level.]

I see…I got it now. There were two major cases of character
'understanding' rising. One was when I got the liking or trust of the
character. The second was when I accurately guessed what the character
was thinking. Maybe now was the latter case.

[The character 'Cheon Inho' is suspicious of you.]

According to the accumulated understanding value, a vague idea of the
person's emotions could be obtained.

"Oh, can one of my group members join? I'd like to get some information
on the attack."

Indeed, Cheon Inho wouldn't let us go so easily. I stared at the man behind
him. It was the person who would go with us and an unlucky fellow.

"I-I have to go with them?"

"Eh, why else are you here, Han hyung? Didn't you want to reconcile with
Dokja-ssi last night?"

"T-That…"

Cheon Inho's party member who joined us was Department Head Han
Myungoh.

"D-Dokja-ssi." If you don't mind, I will go…"

"I understand. Let's go together."
Han Myungoh was surprised when I responded readily. He thought I would
refuse. Lee Hyunsung had a worried face but I had an idea. In any case, the
survivors party of five people from Carriage 3807, consisting of me, Lee
Hyunsung, Lee Gilyoung, Yoo Sangah and Han Myungoh was reformed.

"Can I come as well?"

"…Is it okay even if your body isn't fully healed?"

"This much is fine."

There was one more. Including Jung Heewon, there were a total of six
people in the party. It was a lot for a small party. Of course, the number of
people wasn't much in front of the upcoming crisis.

[A new sub-scenario has arrived!]


  [Second Scenario – Food Acquisition]

  Category: Sub

  Difficulty: E

  Clear Conditions: Directly hunt the monsters that can be used as food
  and cook them.

  Time Limit: None

  Compensation: 500 coins

  Failure: ???
As soon as they stepped foot in the tunnel, a sub-scenario flew in. Food
acquisition. It was a sub-scenario we had to go through before entering the
second main scenario.

[A few constellations are anticipating your performance.]

The darkness of the tunnel became apparent before we even moved 10
steps. I lit up the tunnel with a flashlight but the outline of the surrounding
area wasn't visible at all. It was proof of a curtain that was blocking the
light. The real thing would be beyond this curtain.

"Dokja-ssi, wait a minute. It is really dangerous from here on." Jung
Heewon, who walked beside me, stopped first. "Are we really going this
way? No matter how I look, it seems like suicide. There is also Gilyoung."

"In fact, I was concerned from the beginning. It isn't too late so how about
we leave Gilyoung behind? And if possible, the women…"

"Lee Hyunsung-ssi, I'm not as good as you but I know how to fight. I took
some kendo lessons." Jung Heewon replied.

"But…"

An unnecessary controversy was about to heat up the atmosphere so I
interrupted, "Lee Hyunsung-ssi. I told you before. The world has changed.
It is biased that a woman is physically weak. Right now, everyone can
become stronger by raising their stats. But Jung Heewon-ssi, there is also a
problem with your words."

"…What is it?"

"Just as a woman isn't weak, a child also isn't weak. Gilyoung, show them."

Lee Gilyoung came forward. He looked around for a while before sitting on
the tunnel floor and reaching out his hand. Jung Heewon's eyes widened.
"Oh my god, what is that?"
"S-Shit! Cockroaches!" Han Myungoh cried out with fear.

The cockroach that appeared in the distance was connected to Lee
Gilyoung's fingertips with a faint solid line. The cockroach listened to Lee
Gilyoung's words like a well-behaved dog and disappeared into the
darkness.

"My attribute is Insect Collector."

Insect Collector. Lee Gilyoung possessed the rare ability to communicate
simply with insects through his 'Diverse Communication' skill.

"There is nothing in front of us. It is safe for 100 steps forward." Lee
Gilyoung showed an overwhelming scouting power and the other people
made a stunned expression. Lee Gilyoung spoke to them with a bold
expression, "Thank you for your concern. But I didn't follow all of you for
you to take care of me."

"Ah, yes." Jung Heewon nodded with a sour expression. Lee Gilyoung
came to my side and I stroked his hair. Lee Gilyoung's attribute hadn't been
seen in the original Ways of Survival. It wasn't a wrong choice to save Lee
Gilyoung in the beginning. We passed a clear barrier and entered the full-
fledged darkness.

[You have entered a dangerous area.]

"Y-Yoo Sangah-ssi. It is dangerous to hold my hand while walking."

"…Aren't you more afraid than I am?"

"N-No!"

The air inside the curtain was sticky from the humidity.

"Reduce the light." I ordered.
Yoo Sangah immediate covered the flashlight. Since this model didn't have
a light control function, she had to adjust the light with her hand.

"Eew. Don't shine it downwards." Jung Heewon felt nauseous when she
checked the ground. There were torn bodies. The bodies of those who tried
to move through here were scattered at their feet. Yoo Sangah closed her
eyes tightly, Han Myungoh shook and even the bold Lee Hyunsung started
sweating. Lee Gilyoung was surprisingly calm, with not the slightest bit of
fear on his face. I felt a bit worried. This boy, did he think it was all a
game?

"There is something that isn't human." As Lee Gilyoung said, it wasn't only
the bodies of humans on the ground. There was something the size of a
fully-grown wolf. The bodies of mole-like creatures were scattered all over
the place.

The 9th grade underground species, the ground rat. It was a name
reminiscent of bug on Earth, but a name was just a name. They were
underground piranhas. The ground rats were persistent hunters who
burrowed through the ground in groups and aimed at their prey. However,
the ground rats collapsed like they had received a bombardment. Jung
Heewon sighed, "…Who the hell did this?"

Obviously, there was only one human who could turn the ground rats into
this. It was Yoo Joonghyuk. He proceeded to the next station through this
path alone. I couldn't help wondering. Originally, it was supposed to be
tonight or tomorrow when the third turn Yoo Joonghyuk moved to the next
station.

Why was he so hasty? Did he become impatient? What was the reason?

"Dokja-ssi, can we use this for food?"

"The scenario said that we have to 'hunt' it ourselves so maybe it isn't
possible."
"…Well, it is kind of uncomfortable. What about cooking? Do you want to
roast it on a fire?"

It could be roasted. The problem was that it must be a special fire.

"Heewon-ssi, you said you were good at kendo?"

"Uh, it is a bit much to say I am good…but what are you doing now?"

I stabbed the body of the ground rat and started to cut it with a knife. I
didn't know when I read it in the novel but it didn't go as well as I thought.
After somehow getting rid of the tough skin, I managed to remove the spine
bones. This was the first time so I left many scratches, but it was usable.

"Why are you taking that?"

"You need a weapon for kendo."

The stone hog's thorn wasn't enough for everyone and the spine of the
ground rat consisted of a single bone, making it a pretty good weapon at the
beginning of the scenario. After cutting the cartilage leading to the leg and
shaping it, the bone actually took the shape of a knife. I gave it to Jung
Heewon.

"Thank you. Suddenly I feel like I'm back in the Paleolithic age."

"You need to grind it a bit more for it to be useful. There are rocks around
so skillfully grind the blade."

"Huhu, understood. Captain." Jung Heewon started to grind the blade with
a slightly excited voice. I looked up and saw Lee Hyunsung watching the
scene with a bit of envy. "Do you want one?"

"Eh, you will make me one?"
"All of you come closer. It is better if you learn how to do it. Let's make it
together."

In fact, this was also my first time trying it. I wouldn't have been able to do
it if the details hadn't been included in Ways of Survival. Why wasn't Ways
of Survival popular? It was simple. The author wrote too much of the
setting.

"…Dokja-ssi, you are a beginner but you are good at it."

We sat down and made weapons together. This time it was a spear, not a
sword. They didn't have the Kendo skill so I decided it was more stable to
make a long spear. Lee Hyunsung's spear was made with the spine of the
largest ground rat while Yoo Sangah and Han Myungoh's weapons were
made with the spine of average sized ground rats. Finally, Lee Gilyoung's
weapon was made with the head bone of a young ground rat.

[You have succeeded in acquiring weapons by yourself.]

[A very small number of constellations are interested in the primitive nature
of humanity.]

[Constellations have sponsored you 100 coins.]

Everyone received these messages.

"We receive coins even for this type of thing."

I asked, "I don't want you to die. You have your own coins?"

"Yes, we do."

"Whenever possible, leave enough coins for the survival cost and invest the
rest in your strength, physique and agility. Otherwise, you won't survive."

"Ah, I'll keep that in mind."
We finished the preparations and started to move forward again. The 100
steps that Lee Gilyoung mentioned ended right in front of us.

[The sub-scenario – Food Acquisition has begun!]

The ground rats crawled out from the ground. I quickly counted their
numbers. One, two, three…there were exactly 13. It was more than I
thought. The group of ground rats drew a line and started threatening us.
The moment we crossed the line, the fight would begin.

I said, "There is no plan. We are beginners. It might sound cruel but
honestly, I don't expect you to survive."

"T-That…"

"Still, all of you survive. Please."

Han Myungoh was the only upset one in the party. Everyone else was
nervous but looked determined. In particular, Jung Heewon's eyes were
very impressive.

"Okay, let's try it. Everybody, please live!"

Just as Yoo Joonghyuk tested me, I also had expectations for them. No
matter how good a mentor, a person who wasn't determined couldn't
survive in this world. In the end, it was up to each person to save
themselves. Everyone should use this opportunity to realize it clearly.

"Then let's go."

I also knew who I must take among these people. As we took one more
step, the ground rats moved. The battle began.
                 Chapter 21: Ep. 5 – Dark Keeper, II


The party fought well. It was actually a little bit surprising. In particular,
Lee Hyunsung and Jung Heewon who stepped forward with me were very
influential. The battle composition naturally became the three of us in front
with the other three in the rear. Less than a minute after the battle began, a
few ground rats were struck to the ground with their necks pierced.

Lee Hyunsung overpowered another ground rat, wiped the sweat on his
forehead and said, "…I think I can live."

Once they raised their overall stats, the human race wasn't that weak. Even
so, Lee Hyunsung's mentality was very special in this world. A normal
human couldn't be so nonchalant when encountering monsters. There was a
reason why he got the name of Steel Sword in the future. However, the
more amazing person was Jung Heewon. She said, "The pattern is simpler
than I thought?"

Maybe it was due to the Kendo skill but every time her sword stretched out,
the target ground rat was cut somewhere on their legs or tail.
"Hap!"

It was a case where Jung Heewon invested most of her coins into strength.
Her endurance declined due to it but the power of one blow was better than
I thought. Her sword moved in a terrifying manner through the air.

"Damn, I lost one! Please!"

Her voice trembled as she spoke. Her only weakness was that her physique
was low so her endurance fell short. The ground rats who moved between
the party members were moderately smart. After succeeding in scattering
the ranks, they ran towards the opponent who seemed the weakest using a
hunter's instincts.

"Leave it to me."

However, the ground rats didn't know that they had picked the wrong
opponent. A blunt instrument thrown by Lee Gilyoung's hands struck the
head of a ground rat. The impact was lacking because he was a child but it
was enough. The others could help him finish it.

Yoo Sangah's spear pierced the body of the ground rat. The ground rat
twisted several times. Yoo Sangah made a confused expression but she
didn't remove her hand from the spear. The ground rat lost its energy and
fell down. I honestly thought it would be difficult for Yoo Sangah to adapt
but I was really surprised. Usually, it was normal to panic like Han
Myungoh standing over here.

"U-Uhhhh…" As the people were struggling, one person was hiding in the
rear. He couldn't even hide properly and was bleeding near the shins.

I pierced the last ground rat with the thorn and the surroundings became
quiet. I shook the blood off the thorn and looked at everyone. Everyone
suffered from minor abrasions except for Han Myungoh, but there were no
major injuries. It was a great first victory.
Yoo Sangah and Lee Gilyoung relaxed and sat down, while Lee Hyunsung
stabbed his spear into the ground and wiped at the sweat on his forehead.
Jung Heewon lamented as she counted the number of ground rats in the
vicinity. "…Dokja-ssi, how many did you take care of?"

"Four of them."

"Tsk, I killed two."

"I got three." My pride was somehow hurt when I heard Lee Hyunsung's
proud declaration. There was only one difference despite my stats. I used a
skill and looked at Lee Hyunsung's attributes window.

  behind him is wary towards you.

  * 'Starter Pack' is currently applied.



Hah, the starter pack. This was why he was strong. The Master of Steel
seemed to quite like Lee Hyunsung. The Starter Pack was a coin package
that could be used when the average overall stats of the incarnation was less
than level 10. It was a good item that allowed you to learn Weapons
Training, a useful skill in the beginning, while raising the level of the
overall stats by one. Considering the fact that most incarnations were being
exploited for nothing, Lee Hyunsung was lucky to receive the Starter Pack.

"Dokja-ssi, your complexion doesn't look good…"
"Ah, no. I was just thinking for a moment."

Now I was a little bit envious… well, I had the money to buy it, but I didn't
buy it. My average stats exceeded level 10 so buying it would only damage
me. Damn, I opened the Dokkaebi Bag a bit early.

"Let's gather up the ground rats. We need to prepare today's food."

"Ummm…by the way, how will we cook it? We can't eat it like this."

"We can't eat it now but there will be a way." I guessed I answered too
calmly. There was silence among my party members. Lee Hyunsung was
the first one to open his mouth, "Excuse me, I would like to ask you one
thing."

"Yes?"

"Dokja-ssi, perhaps…do you know something about this situation?"

Whoops, I made a mistake.

"That…"

Suddenly, I remembered the regressors in the novel I read, followed by Yoo
Joonghyuk's words. It was like this. The feeling of a regressor. Usually,
these types of things happened to a regressor. Some replies came to mind. I
could shamelessly say that it was a hunch or I could lie like Yoo
Joonghyuk.

[The constellation 'Secretive Plotter' is anticipating your choice.]

[A few constellations are anticipating your answer.]

But from a reader's point of view, the best answer was…

"A-Aaaack!"
It was to create a situation where I didn't need to say anything.

[The constellation 'Secretive Plotter' nods at your choice.]

"There is still one left!" Jung Heewon shouted and Lee Hyunsung ran.
However, the action of the hidden ground rat was faster than anyone else. It
was much bigger than the other creatures.

"S-Save me…!"

It dragged Han Myungoh into a tunnel by one of his legs. The nearest, Yoo
Sangah, swung her spear but the situation got worse because Han Myungoh
held onto her.

"Grab this!" Lee Hyunsung stretched out the handle of his spear but it only
hit the ground. The ground rat and the two people had already disappeared
into the ground.

[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' resents this frustrating
person.]

Jung Heewon burst out, "Ah…I knew I was going to get cancer because of
that uncle."

"…I'm sorry. I was too late." Lee Hyunsung spoke in a sad voice. I tapped
his shoulder to show it was okay.

"No one could've done anything."

"Should we chase after them?"

I looked at the hole where they had disappeared. It wasn't an ordinary hole.
There was a touch of energy around it. The darkness gave off a gloomy
feeling. I retreated to the back and turned on my smartphone. There was
only 5% battery remaining. At dawn, I exchanged one battery charger for
food with a person from the marginalized group.

Shortly afterwards, I was able to find the desired passage.

「…The 'Edge of Darkness' is the habitat of the ground rats and is a type of
subspace emitted from the 'Dark Root'. The ground rats that breath in black
ether instead of oxygen don't grow naturally unless they are near the 'Edge
of
Darkness'…」

It was a fact that I knew roughly but it was meaningful to review it. That's
right, this was the entrance to the Edge of Darkness. I read about it and put
the smartphone in my pocket.

"Dokja-ssi?" Lee Hyunsung was looking at me with a frustrated expression.
I nodded.

"We will enter."

"Ah, then…"

"Still, it's very dangerous to enter with a lot of people. Lee Hyunsung-ssi
and Jung Heewon-ssi will wait here at the boundary. If something happens,
I will give you a signal."

The startled Jung Heewon asked, "Surely…you don't intend to go with only
Gilyoung?"

"Gilyoung's ability will be helpful in pursuing them."

The moment she tried to strongly resist, I raised a hand and called to Lee
Hyunsung, "Lee Hyunsung-ssi. Jung Heewon-ssi isn't in a good condition
so please take care of her."

Lee Hyunsung seemed to realize something. "I understand."
"Wait a minute. I am fine!"

"Jung Heewon, confidence is good but don't be reckless."

"…"

Jung Heewon's breathing was uneven. She wasn't completely healed from
the poisonous fog. I left the two people and entered the hole with Lee
Gilyoung. It was obviously a hole that was dug down in a vertical slope.
However, as soon as we entered, we could stand as if gravity was in effect
perpendicular to the ground.

It was due to the magic power emitted by the Edge of Darkness.

"This way."

The darkness was so deep that I couldn't see anything, so I could only move
forward with Lee Gilyoung. Black ether had the property of absorbing light,
making a flashlight meaningless. If Lee Gilyoung's ability Diverse
Communication wasn't available, I might have to use coins again.

"Excuse me hyung." Lee Gilyoung called out to me. "Did you do it on
purpose?"

"…What?"

"When that uncle grabbed noona¹ and ahjussi², you let it go."

I had a moment of hesitation. In the darkness, Lee Gilyoung's fingertips
were strange. Before I could ask how he knew, Lee Gilyoung spoke, "At
that time, I was looking at hyung's face."

He was watching me even in those short moments. A very scary kid. It was
no good hiding from a person who was so quick.

"Yes, that's right."
The answer was terrible and a message bomb was set off in my head.
Indeed, this was a spectacle for the constellations.

[Constellations of absolute good frown at your cruelty.]

[The constellation 'Secretive Plotter' is pressing you with shining eyes.]
"Why did you do that?"

"It is because of the habit of the ground rats." I decided to answer honestly.
"The ground rats have a habit of keeping their catches in the same place as
their treasure. It isn't just food. Many things that seem rare are gathered. For
example, an item. However, the paths are so complicated that it can't be
found unless I follow them directly."

Lee Gilyoung was silent for a moment. I continued speaking, "I expected
him to take Han Myungoh. I didn't expect him to grab onto Yoo Sangah."

"Then your purpose isn't to save noona or ahjussi, it is the items?"

"Yes. Are you disappointed?"

"Nope." Lee Gilyoung's small hand gripped my finger tightly. "Hyung
shouldn't lie."

"…"

"If hyung was such a person, you wouldn't have saved me on the subway. I
believe in you."

Lee Gilyoung didn't act like a child but he was still a child. Lee Gilyoung
didn't know. To be mature and to be an adult were completely different
things.

[Some constellations are touched to tears.]

[200 coins have been sponsored.]
In this world, there were mean adults who would take advantage of such
maturity. The hole was longer than I thought and we had to go downwards
for quite a long time.

"Hyung."

"Yes."

"Hyung, are you a god?"

"…What?"

"Or the main character?"

Children sometimes asked sharp questions. It was because they lived in a
world where stories and reality weren't clearly distinguished. Lee Gilyoung
didn't know exactly what his question meant.

"I'm not a main character. Rather, I always envy the main character."

"But you still know something about this world?"

I thought for a moment before replying, "That's right."

"Then I'll ask you one thing."

"I will answer it if I can."

"Once we clear all these scenarios…can we make a wish?"

"Wish?" I was a bit confused.

"Usually there is a reward at the end of these stories. At the end of this
story, is there something like that?"

In the darkness, Lee Gilyoung's breath was trembling. Lee Gilyoung's
expression when he saw his dead mother suddenly came to mind. Those
who adapted to this world suffered from it in different ways. Some were
crazy, some were fanatics and some had irrational optimism.

"Yes, there is."

I was grateful that this place was dark. It was because Lee Gilyoung
couldn't see my face right now.

"We are almost there hyung."

The surrounding black ether was shrinking rapidly. It was evidence that
Dark Root was nearby. I tensed up and gripped the thorn.

[A few constellations are holding their breaths.]

I heard the sound of the ground rats somewhere in the ground. As the sound
got closer, the sense of space expanded rapidly. I saw a light in the
darkness, as if someone had lit a fire. Then I saw a tattered box beyond that
light. The moment I was convinced that I had come to the right place,
messages rang in my ears.

[The sub scenario has been updated.]

[You have entered the 'Ground Rat's Treasure Trove'.]



   [1]     Noona – term used by a male to refer to an older female.
   [2]     Ahjussi – uncle, middle aged man/stranger.
                Chapter 22: Ep. 5 – Dark Keeper, III


"Hyung! This…"

Right after Lee Gilyoung discovered the treasure box, I blocked his little
mouth. "Shh, wait."

The world of Ways of Survival was relentless. The constellations enjoyed
the adversity of the characters and added obstacles in the scenarios just to
fuck with humans. Things saying 'Catch me!' usually contained traps and
even system messages couldn't be trusted.

"The treasure trove doesn't just contain treasures."

[The constellation 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' is disappointed.]

Abyssal Black Flame Dragon… He wanted me to die for a while.

Anyway, I waited. Shortly afterwards, shadows started to emerge around
the treasure chest.
It was the ground rats. They brought something through the tunnel, threw it
and exchanged information. Once a certain number of ground rats had
gathered, the number of lights illuminating the surroundings increased. It
was black fire, flames made with black ether. It was said that this place was
the core of Dark Root, which was why it had so much black ether to burn.
At that time, someone's voice was heard, "It is all because of Yoo Sangah-
ssi!"

There was no need to say who he was. It was a voice I would know at once.
I gripped the shoulder of the surprised Lee Gilyoung tightly. It wasn't time
yet.

"Because of me, what do you mean by that?"

In the dim light, there were two people captured by the ground rats. They
were tied up tightly by branches that came up from the ground.

"I-If Yoo Sangah hadn't taken the subway, the situation wouldn't be like
this!"

"Why does the subway matter now?"

How could she accept all this nonsense? Maybe Yoo Sangah was a saintly
person. Or maybe the sponsor behind her was a saintly person.

"T-That…That, Yoo Sangah-ssi, you ride a bicycle all the time…" Han
Myungoh's voice shook as he wrote gibberish.

Yoo Sangah's tone was cold. "Wait a minute. Were you the one who stole
my bike?"

"W-What is this person? I clearly told you that I would drive you in my car!
You should know how to accept favours!"

"Answer me. Did you steal my bike?"
All of a sudden, the situation made sense. This was it. It was why a person
who drove a Mercedes-Benz S-Class took the subway line 3. Well, it wasn't
strange. There were quite a few men who had their eyes on Yoo Sangah,
not just at the company but at Geumho Station as well. In fact, Yoo Sangah
was a worthy person. Her atmosphere was warm and she knew how to
flatter people.

[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' hates the character 'Han
Myungoh'.]

Han Myungoh's face was so red that it could clearly be seen in the dim
lighting. It looked dangerous. "Yes, shit! I did it! So what?"

"Why are you talking like it isn't a big deal? You took someone else's
things, it is theft."

"Theft? Shit, don't talk bullshit! You should've just got in my car from the
beginning!"

[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' hates this trivial
argument.]

I didn't mean to do this but there was no other way now. I quietly gripped
the thorn.

"I didn't ask you just once. I continuously asked to take you home but you
kept fucking rejecting me…"

I threw the thorn as hard as I could. The thorn scratched the corner of Han
Myungoh's mouth and continued into the darkness.

"Uwaaaaack! What?"

[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' is pleased.]

[100 coins have been sponsored.]
"Dokja-ssi!" Yoo Sangah called out to me. However, I wasn't looking at
them.

Across the habitat of the ground rats, the darkness was split apart by the
thorn. Then that damned guy came. There was no way it wouldn't be in
Dark Root.

['Dark Keeper' has appeared!]

[The sub scenario has been updated!]

[Sub scenario 'Kill the Guard' has begun!]

Like slaves surrendering to a king, the terrified ground rats fell to the
ground. A dark figure appeared in the dim light. A tentacled monster that
was like a grim reaper. Lee Gilyoung's complexion deteriorated sharply.

"Oof, hyung, that…"

"It is okay."

Eventually, Lee Gilyoung fell to the ground and started retching. It wasn't
strange. A lot of pressure was felt just looking at it from afar. The
cockroaches scattered around the area had their stomachs exploded. Lee
Gilyoung, who was connected to the cockroaches, would've suffered
considerable mental damage.

"Gilyoung. How many more times can you use Diverse Communication?"

"…I think I can do it one or two more times."

"I understand. Then rest here for a while."

I left Gilyoung leaning against the side and approached Yoo Sangah and
Han Myungoh. The panicked Han Myungoh was struggling.

"O-Ohuk! What is this…?"
I took the Swiss Army knife and cut the branches binding the two of them. I
only moved the knife a few times. Then the part of the branch that it
touched abruptly corroded and the blade melted away. Yes, this was the
power of a demonic species. "Stay back."

I said while raising a weapon made of the spine of a ground rat. The 7th
grade demon type species, dark keeper. Among the many monsters that
appeared since the start of the destruction, the demon species were toxic. In
fact, the treasures of the ground rats were close to 'tributes' to the demon.
Even if it was the same grade, the demon species were different from other
monster species.

[The 'Dark Keeper' has received the favour of the demon king it follows.]

"Kamyun. Der. Yitur."

The demon species had their own language, worshipped different demon
kings and inherited some of the power of the demon king through Dark
Root.

[The 'Dark Keeper' has emitted 'Fear'.]

[The exclusive skill 'Fourth Wall' has neutralized most of the 'Fear' effect.]

Therefore, killing one demon meant becoming the adversary of their demon
king.

"Yitur!"

I didn't know what it was saying but the situation didn't look good. I didn't
want to fight if possible.

"M-Mother?" Yoo Sangah was the one who spoke. She still hadn't left?

"I told you to stay back."

"That monster just said 'Mother'…"
I thought for a moment about what this meant. No, wait a minute. "Uhh,

I think…K-Karud, yemiren? Ah, this is the pronunciation? Aketu?" For

a moment, I thought I was mistaken. But I didn't hear wrong. "Kallitu!"


Surprisingly, the dark keeper nodded at the end.

[The character 'Yoo Sangah' has activated the 'Interpreter Lv. 3 skill.]

…Oh my god, she wasn't only good at Spanish. Let's see what would
happen. I asked, "What is he saying?"

"That…it keeps saying 'become Mother'…"

…Become mother? The dark keeper cried out again and pointed to Yoo
Sangah.

"Kallitu!"

Yoo Sangah had a tearful face. "Uh, Mother? I'm not married yet!"

The dark keeper pointed at Han Myungoh this time. "Kallitu!"

Han Myungoh turned pale as he wiped his lip. "W-Why am I the mother?
Father!"

The dark keeper's tentacles rose.

"Ooooof!"

One of the tentacles entered his mouth and Han Myungoh turned black.
There was the sound of something moving down Han Myungoh's throat.
That's right. This was what it meant to become the mother. I belatedly
recalled that the demon species conceived their young in the body of other
species.
"Yoo Sangah-ssi, you don't plan to have a child yet, right?"

"Of course!"

Yoo Sangah immediately understood the words and stepped back quickly. I
swung the ground rat spear and tore at the tentacles attached to Han
Myungoh.

The dark keeper roared angrily, "Kallituo!"

The tentacles of the demon species were gradually breaking the ground rat
spear. Even the stone hog thorn, which broke through the stomach of an
ichthyosaur, would've been destroyed the moment it was stuck in a demon's
body. Before I knew it, Han Myungoh was far away while Yoo Sangah
looked at me.

「 Is there a chance? 」

Her eyes seemed to be asking me. To tell the truth, I didn't have a chance.

Pushu! Pushuu! Teong!

After a few strikes, the ground rat spear was almost destroyed. The hand
holding the spear was in pain. The monster guarding the treasure chest
couldn't be caught, just like the ichthyosaur of Dongho Bridge. That's why
the original plan wasn't to deal with this monster but to obtain the treasure
chest after it disappeared. As always, plans existed for things to go wrong.

"Dokkaebi. Are you watching?"

[U-Uh. You knew?]

The dokkaebi showed up in the darkness. I didn't know his name but he
seemed to be a cousin of Bihyung.

"There should be some mail for me by now. I want you to hand it over
quickly."
[Hihit. It isn't my responsibility. I-It is Bihyung's thing.]

"Right now, you are taking Bihyung's place. Don't you see the
constellations complaining?"

[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband wants to scold the
dokkaebi 'Biryu'.]

[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' threatens the dokkaebi
'Biryu'.]

The dokkaebi Biryu gulped. […O-Okay. Instead, it is just this once. I think
it will be interesting!]

The dokkaebi muttered something and the summoning began.

[The item has arrived from the exchange.]

[The item 'Broken Faith' has been acquired.]

[The brokerage fee was exempted due to the effect of the contract.]

Broken Faith. The item bartered for the 'ichthyosaur core', which was
registered on the Dokkaebi Bag' exchange, had finally arrived.

"Kik."

The dark keeper saw the item coming out of thin air and laughed. No
wonder it was laughing. All I received was a D-grade item. It was a knife
broken in half.

[The item is too old to use. The durability will be poor and it will be
difficult to achieve any performance.]

Even the dokkaebi who gave him the item was giggling. [H-How can you
fight with that old thing? And it can't be used if you don't have a special
skill…]
I knew that much. I wouldn't have bought it if I didn't know.

"Sigh…" I sucked in a breath and concentrated my mind.

Kiiing!

The hilt started trembling greatly. Biryu shouted with shock.

[Uh? How?]

It was natural to be surprised. It was because this was a skill I bought from
his friend for a huge 10,000 coins. Blue ether started to settle slowly on the
surface of the broken blade.

[Purest Sword Force]

After killing the ichthyosaur, I bought this skill from Bihyung. There were
a few flaws compared to other superior energy techniques, but they weren't
something that could be obtained for the time being.

[Broken Faith has responded to your star energy!]

[Blade of Faith is activated!]

Shortly afterwards, a brilliant white virtual blade sprang up from the edge
of the broken blade. Broken Faith, its real performance was revealed when
star energy was injected into it.

The number of tentacles increased by dozens and covered my field of view.
I wouldn't be safe from these attacks with my current stamina level. It was
scary. But now there was a chance. It was because the Blade of Faith was
the best quality weapon when it came to demon species.

The tentacles touched by the blade were oxidized and cut off. The dark
keeper let out a terrible scream as its tentacles were destroyed. I felt magic
power draining out but I wasn't in a hurry. I calmly moved the blade. I
missed the tentacles many times because I didn't have the 'Fighting Senses'
skill or the 'Swordsmanship Training' skill, so the way I wielded the blade
was terrible. It was natural. I was a reader, not a swordsman. And a reader
fought in the manner of a reader.

[The attribute effect has improved your memories of the pages already

read.] The pages of Ways of Survival flashed in my head.

「…The dark keeper's attack pattern is simple. Unconditionally, the
tentacle on the upper right will first… 」

「 …After the attack, a single tentacle at the bottom… 」

「 …Its tentacles regenerate but it will take a few minutes… 」

I read diligently and used what I had read.

"Kuaaah!" The dark keeper shrieked as its tentacles were cut.

On the other side of my field of view was Lee Gilyoung. The young boy
looked at me with awed eyes. Unfortunately, unlike his wishes, I wasn't the
main character in this world. Still, I was confident of at least one thing.

"Kar. Mien. Der." The dark keeper muttered as it barely managed to pull
itself together from its shock. I didn't ask but Yoo Sangah muttered from
behind me in a quivering voice, "How do you know all my weaknesses…?"
This was what it meant. I gave an answer in a light manner.

"I usually read a lot of books."

I knew more about this world than anyone else.
                Chapter 23: Ep. 5 – Dark Keeper, IV


Maybe we would've fought for a long time.

[The exclusive skill 'Bookmark' can now be activated.]

[The number two bookmark has been activated.]

[The level of the Bookmark skill is low, shortening the activation time.]

[Activation Time: One minute.]

Well, I had this. My bones might be torn out of my body or my blood might
be spilt.

[Your understanding of the character is low, so only a part of the character's
skill is activated.]

['Weapons Training Lv.1' has been activated.]
But I didn't. To be exact, I couldn't afford it. I used all the powers I had. I
squeezed out all of my strength and ran through the tentacles. The
landscape around me flashed by. The only thing left was the afterimage of a
sharp white light and the sense of cutting something.

[Your understanding of the character 'Lee Hyunsung' has increased.]

[The number two bookmark has been disabled.]

I felt like I had lost strength. I had poured everything out in one blow. Then
after a while, I heard a trembling voice in the air.

[…C-Constellations. Did you all see it? I-I didn't see wrong…?] It was the
appearance of Dokkaebi Biryu, who had forgotten his duties. In fact, it
wasn't strange to be surprised.

[A few constellations are doubting their eyes.]

[The constellation 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' is flaring fiercely.]

It was a powerful grade 7 demon lying down with damaged tentacles in
front of me.

[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' pulls his hair as if he
is pleased.]

[500 coins have been sponsored.]

The severed tentacles lay on the ground and the surrounding ground rats
had long been killed or fled in the aftermath of the fight. Only the dark
keeper lay breathing roughly on the ground, its lips twitching.

"…Ki. Kii. Ki."

Originally, the 7th grade demon was an enemy that I couldn't cope with.
Thus, I was prepared. I wasn't as strong as Yoo Joonghyuk and I didn't have
a good sponsor like Lee Hyunsung.
[The obsessive-compulsive constellations praise your readiness.]

[200 coins have been sponsored.]

It was just that the 'information' I had was more advantageous than others.
Sometimes, 'information' was more powerful than anything in the world.
The very result of that information was the white light sword now in my
hand.

[A-An 'ether blade' in the beginning scenarios…C-Constellations. Is this a
true story?]

Fortunately, I didn't have to explain it as the dokkaebi was in full swing.

Ether Blade. It was the flagship technique of the incarnations supported by
the highest level sponsor. The technique was often called 'energy blade' in
Murim novels.

"To be exact, it isn't a real ether blade. The real one is much stronger than
this."

[T-That's right! Strictly speaking, it is Broken Faith that has absorbed the
Purest Sword Force and made the blade…] Looking at the dokkaebi, he
wasn't a complete idiot. [Amazing… There is this guy in that brat
Bihyung's channel…]

As if waiting for this, the Blade of Faith turned off.

[Broken Faith's durability has run out. This item is no longer available.]

It was a pity but it did its part.

"Give me the compensation for finishing the sub-scenario."

[Uhh, that's right. W-Wait!]

Biryu hurriedly entered something in the air and a message soon popped up.
[You have met the conditions to clear the sub scenario!]

[You have earned 500 coins.]

[A handful of constellations admire your scenario.]

The reward was smaller than I thought. It was natural because I haven't
killed the dark keeper.

[By the way, are you not going to kill that guy?] Biryu looked at me with
expectant eyes.

I let out an exhausted breath and glanced at the dark keeper on the ground.
Then I kindly said, "I have a non-killing ideology."

[N-Non-killing…?]

"I'm not someone who kills easily."

[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' admires it!]

[100 coins have been sponsored.]

Of course, it was a lie.

[The constellation 'Secretive Plotter' is giving you a sly smile.]

[100 coins have been sponsored.]

The bewildered Biryu stammered. [B-But won't the reward be great if you
kill this guy? You will be the first to kill a grade 7 demon and I will give
you 7,000 coins! Do you know how big 7,000 coins is?]

"I won't kill it. I need to open the compensation box so please step aside."

I removed the irritating Biryu from in front of me. The dark keeper
wasn't the real reason I came here. So… Puok!
[The 7th grade demon, 'Dark Keeper' was killed.]

…What? The dokkaebi who looked like it was so funny he would die and
the dark keeper who died with a knife in his chest. Then.

"Haha, hahahaha! N-Now I can be strong! Kim Dokja, you son of a bitch!
You didn't know this!" Han Myungoh was the one holding the knife. I had a
rough idea of what happened. Then explosive messages were heard in my
ears.

[A 7th grade demon has been hunted for the first time!]

[An impossible feat has been accomplished.]

[You have earned 8,000 coins.]

[Contribution: Kim Dokja, Han Myungoh]

Perhaps these messages were also shared with Han Myungoh. I only
received a few coins because I didn't deal the finishing blow but…

I could see Han Myungoh dying with happiness at the messages.
"Nonkilling ideology? Stupid guy! What is killing in this burning world?
There can't be a person like you! You know―"

Then Han Myungoh stopped. Now he knew what he had done.

[The 7th grade demon 'Dark Keeper' has been killed and the demon king
'Asmodeus' has noticed the murderer's presence.]

[The demon king 'Asmodeus' will chase the one who dealt the finishing
blow until they are dead.]

[The demon king 'Asmodeus' has put a terrible curse on the person who
dealt the final blow!]

[Final Blow: Han Myungoh]
"W-What? What is this message?" Han Myungoh cried out fearfully.

[The constellation 'Secretive Plotter' admires your wickedness.]

"Ah…didn't I tell you? I intentionally didn't kill it."

[The constellation 'Secretive Plotter' has recommended your scenario to
Star Stream.]

Han Myungoh stared into the air like he had lost his soul. The curse of the
demon king Asmodeus was the most terrible thing for a killer. I didn't know
what it was but it was surely terrible. I looked back and saw Lee Gilyoung
and Yoo Sangah looking this way with bemused expressions. I smiled as if
nothing had happened.

"We'll open the rewards together."




After a while, we searched through the treasures and pulled out one each.

"I got this."

"I have this…"

Yoo Sangah and Lee Gilyoung found a small bracelet and old shield
respectively.

[Magic Power Recovery Bracelet]

[Old Iron Shield]

They were both D-grade items but it was better than nothing. The Magic
Power Recovery Bracelet was a useful item for everyone and the Old Iron
Shield would be good for Lee Hyunsung. It was difficult to ignore the 'iron'
in the name. This iron was much harder than Earth's iron.

Yoo Sangah spoke with slight disappointment. "It is less than I thought."

Less. Her words weren't wrong. It was too shameful to call this a 'treasure
trove'. Yoo Joonghyuk. The guy who left yesterday had probably gone
through this place. He knew he would be tired fighting the demon so he
took a chance and stole the treasures. In the end, we were robbing a place
that was already robbed.

"it is okay because the main thing is still left."

I looked at a black box in the center of the warehouse. We didn't waste any
more time and opened the box. The thing in the box was a stove. It was
small enough to fit into a pocket and it was shameful to call it a stove.

[Magic Power Stove].

As expected, it was still here. This item was in fact the key item in this
subscenario.

[Magic Power Stove can only be obtained once per person.]

Obviously, Yoo Joonghyuk had taken one so there were two Magic Power
Stoves in total.

"…What is that thing?"

"Well, I think I know a bit about its purpose."

I purposely trembled, activated the stove with magic power and raised a
dead ground rat's leg. It was funny since it didn't fit the size of a plate of
food, but in five seconds, a remarkable change happened to the leg of the
ground rat.
"Wow! A delicious smell!"

There was a sweet smell and the leg of the ground rat changed to a golden
colour.

"Meat!" Lee Gilyoung cried out excitedly. Yoo Sangah asked urgently,
"CCan we eat this?"

"I'll try it first."

I grabbed the greasy hind leg and dug into the flesh. The juices ran from the
flesh…I forgot to chew and closed my eyes. Tasting it was different from
reading it in the book.

[A few constellations are drooling.]

[Constellations have sponsored you 100 coins.]

[The constellation 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' has swallowed his saliva.]

[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' is biting his nails.]

······.

The messages continuously popped up. Indeed, eating broadcasts were the
best. Everyone was united in front of food.

"Eat it. I think it is okay."

The two people rushed towards the meat as soon as I spoke. They hadn't
had a proper meal for three days so they would be quite hungry. Han
Myungoh recovered and came over hesitantly, "D-Dokja-ssi…I-I went
crazy for a second…"

"Eat. Don't worry about the other thing."

"T-Thank you!"
"You will become a ghost after eating."

"W-What…?"

Han Myungoh's complexion turned as white as death. I said it like a joke
but Han Myungoh really would die. Asmodeus' pursuit was hard for even
Yoo Joonghyuk to overcome.

We each took one leg and started to eat. We were eating meat together
because we were hungry after everything that started. Humans couldn't help
it. Everyone ate the meal in silence. Was it due to the light spreading gently
from the Magic Power Stove? I was feeling a bit sentimental.

Killing something and eating it in order to live. This was the life of a
human. It had been like this so far but I wondered why it felt so fresh.
Suddenly, I looked up and met Yoo Sangah's eyes. Ha, Yoo Sangah came
to her senses and suddenly cried out, "I'm pathetic."

"…Huh?"

"Dokja-ssi worked so hard and I am just eating like a pig… I was no help at
all…"

"No, Yoo Sangah-ssi. That…"

"By the way, how does Dokja-ssi know all this? You know how to cook a
beast and…"

"Ah, that…"

"Indeed! It must be because you read fantasy novels, right? Really, I didn't
know the world was going to be like this. My silly self was just memorizing
Spanish."

I felt somewhat strange when I heard Yoo Sangah say this. I opened
my mouth to comfort her. "It is because Yoo Sangah-ssi studied
foreign languages that you learned the language of the demon
species." Of course, it wasn't very helpful.

"I see… Thank you, Dokja-ssi…"

I smiled at Yoo Sangah and got up from where I was sitting. The party was
immersed in eating again. I took a break and headed for the back of the
party. In fact, the Magic Power Stove was important but my real purpose
was a separate item. I looked closely at the 'black box' that contained the
Magic Power Stove.

It was this. There was no doubt about it. Yoo Joonghyuk, who took the
Magic Power Stove, probably didn't know about it. The real treasure of the
warehouse was this 'black box'. In the original story, Yoo Joonghyuk only
knew about this after the 6th round of regression.

Who was the first to discover this. Was it 'Heavenly Maid Hori?' Well, it
was hard to remember. It wasn't accurate but it was probably something like
this:

「 "Over there. There are strange boxes in the early areas. If you put
something in there…" 」

At this time, I met Yoo Sangah's eyes and asked, "What is the box for?"

"Huh? Ah, this…" Yoo Sangah said as she looked at the box. There were
unknown characters written on the box.

…Could she read them?

"Random…item box?"

Damn. This was why foreign language proficiency was important.

"Uh…that…um. So that is what it means."
I was a bit embarrassed. Yoo Sangah cried out, "Quickly use it, Dokja-ssi!"

"…Is it okay?"

Nod nod. Lee Gilyoung nodded vigorously.

"You don't need to worry about us. All the items obtained here are yours.
That is obvious."

Yes, I was caught so let's do it quickly.

"Then I will use it well."

[A few constellations are nodding at your decision.]

I took the nucleus of the 7th grade demon from my pocket. I had cut it from
the dead body of the dark keeper. In addition, I took out Broken Faith
which had run out of durability. According to the original plot, the use of
this box was simple.

「 "Who knew? There would be a limited edition coin item." 」

I placed the demon core and Broken Faith into the box.

「 "Ha, you can't believe my words? Is it real? Put sub items in there and
close the box!" 」

In fact, I didn't know what would happen when I put in these two items. But
I was certain that something huge would come out.

「 "A top item will unconditionally come out!" 」

A moment later, a dazzling light burst out from the closed box.
                Chapter 24: Ep. 6 – Judgment Time, I


The limited random items box… According to the setting of Ways of
Survival, this was a coin item which had been sold as a limited edition in a
past 'scenario'.

[Ah, no, why is this thing here?] The alarmed Biryu shouted belatedly. [I-I-
It was banned immediately after release!]

According to the original Ways of Survival, the setting of this item was
quite complicated. This coin item had been released long before the 8612
Planetary scenarios began. It was a product which had been forcefully
banned by the Star Stream Administration Bureau.

If sub-items were put in, it would 'unconditionally' spit out a top item. This
would have a tremendous impact on the balance of the scenarios.
Additionally, the price of one item box was a huge one million coins. The
constellations had been angered by this ridiculous billing policy, so the
stupid dokkaebi who invented this item got fired from the Administration
Bureau.
[C-Constellations. It is like this… I don't know why it is here… H-Hihihit!
Broadcast end!]

[#BI-7623 channel has closed temporarily.]

The delirious sounding Biryu closed the channel, and the voices of the
constellations disappeared. I regretted not being able to see the reactions of
the constellations, but it couldn't be helped. I looked down at the vibrating
box. The random draw was about to start in earnest.

[A sword type item will be awarded for putting in the same type of items!]

[The random draw has started!]

The limited edition random item box randomly spat out items of a higher
rank related to the item you put in. There was a chance for anything from a
C-grade to an SSS-grade item to emerge. In the end, it was all up to chance.

[The offered items are related to a certain constellation!]

[The probability that an item associated with this constellation will appear
is greatly increased.]

'…Eh?'

It was an unexpected message, but it didn't seem to be a disadvantage for
me. Both my hands were sweating. I hadn't been so nervous when I bought
a random chance item in an online game.

'Please let it be an A-rating'.

[A top-rated item has appeared!]

[The number of available random item boxes is 0.]

The box soon stopped trembling, and the faint light subsided. Then I looked
around at Yoo Sangah and Lee Gilyoung, whose eyes were shining.
"Shall we open it?"

"Yes!"

We opened the box.

"W-Wow!" Lee Gilyoung was so surprised that he screamed.

By the way, it really was amazing. With a luxurious silver guard and a
white blade… Its shape was somewhat similar to Broken Faith? I
immediately checked the item information.


 [Item Information]

 Name: Unbroken Faith

 Rating: Star Relic

 Description: In the past, it was the sword of the hero 'Kaizenix', who led
 the Grusiad during the Great Demon Age. The great ether dominance of
 Kaizenix allowed him to create a 'Blade of Faith' that contained fire,
 darkness and divine power respectively.

 As an additional option, it increases strength and physique level by 2.


I was speechless. No… was this real? It wasn't a simple alphabet rating but
a star relic item?

"D-Dokja-ssi! Doesn't it look like a huge item?"

It really was a huge item.
In the world of Ways of Survival, the 'star relics' were the only items
excluded from the ratings table. It wasn't just because they had a strong
performance but because these items were special.

Every star relic contained the power of a living constellation. The
difference in performance varied depending on whether the constellation
was the hero of a certain world and how much awareness they had.
Regardless, they contained the power of a constellation, so the relics had
tremendous value.

Furthermore, it raised the level of my strength and physique by 2. When
taking into account that A-grade items increased the total stats value by 1,
this must be at least an S-grade item. Yoo Joonghyuk had yet to obtain an
item like this.

I looked around at Yoo Sangah and Lee Gilyoung. "…Can I really have it?"

"Of course. It naturally belongs to Dokja-ssi," Yoo Sangah responded in
advance to his repeated question. Lee Gilyoung also nodded eagerly. I
looked at Han Myungoh, but he was just eating the leg of a ground rat with
a stupid expression while muttering unknown things to himself. I thought
he would insist on having the item… It was strange.

[You have acquired a star relic.]

[The owner of the star relic is curious about you.]

The message showed that the constellation existed somewhere. Later, I
would open up Ways of Survival and look for it.

"Then we should go back. There are plenty of ground rats out there, so we
can go back with just the Magic Power Stove."

"By the way, how do we get back?"
"It won't be a problem to leave with Gilyoung's power. Use Diverse
Communication and…"

However, Lee Gilyoung's expression wasn't bright. "Hyung, I…"

"Huh?"

"There aren't any insects nearby."

Come to think of it, the insects around here had burst from the pressure
when I was fighting the dark keeper. It was a problem I hadn't thought
about. "There really isn't one? Some of them should still be alive. If we
move for a bit and use the ability…"

There were so many insects in the world that I didn't have any sympathy for
the few who died, but Lee Gilyoung still had a dark expression.

"Well, there is one I can actually call…" Lee Gilyoung closed his eyes and
started concentrating.

"Dokja-ssi, isn't this a bit strange?"

Lee Gilyoung's eyes were gradually losing focus. Then blood flowed down
from his nose.

"Gilyoung?"

All of a sudden, there was a loud vibration from above them. Dust
started falling down. The vibration was coming from aboveground… At
this moment, goosebumps appeared on my skin.

"Gilyoung! Lee Gilyoung! Wake up!"

"Yeah… hyung?" Lee Gilyoung's eyes returned to normal.

"Gilyoung, stop the skill! Quickly!"
The surprised Lee Gilyoung stopped the skill, and the vibration subsided. I
sighed with relief.

There were incredibly dangerous monsters running around aboveground.
There were numerous high-rated monsters, including the 7th grade
rhinoceros. Among these monsters was the insect king. It was obviously a
type of insect just based on the name.

"You really…" I placed my hand on Lee Gilyoung's head and didn't say
anything. Gilyoung was about to call an insect king from aboveground…
Was he Fabre? We almost got buried here.

"For the time being, seal this skill. Don't use it unless I tell you to.
Understood?"

"Yes…" Lee Gilyoung replied in a sad manner. Now there was no choice
but to wait.

"We will get lost in the darkness. Let's wait a bit longer and move when
small insects appear in the vicinity."

It was easy to enter but the Edge of Darkness was a very dangerous place.
This was a place where someone could disappear for a day or two if a little
mistake was made. Then Yoo Sangah raised her hand. "If it is just going
back, I think I can fill in for Gilyoung."

"…How?" I was going to ask if she would converse with the Edge of
Darkness but stopped because it seemed sarcastic. Yoo Sangah replied in a
slightly uncertain tone, "I have a similar skill."

When I thought about it, I still didn't know Yoo Sangah's attribute and
sponsor.

"What is the skill?"
"That, it is a complicated skill to untangle…"

Untangle?

"…Excuse me, can I ask what Yoo Sangah-ssi's attribute is?"

Yoo Sangah wasn't a character in the novel, so I didn't know her attribute. It
was like with Lee Gilyoung and Han Myungoh.

"Uh, that…"

Yoo Sangah made a difficult expression. It wouldn't have been so
frustrating if I could use Character List on Yoo Sangah. I tried to use
Character List once again as a test.

[The exclusive skill, Character List is activated.]

[This person isn't registered in 'Character List'.]

Indeed… but there was one more message.

[Currently collecting information about the corresponding figure.]

'…Eh?'

It was a message that never existed before. Come to think of it, I heard a
system message when Yoo Sangah used the 'Interpreter' skill. It wasn't
something that was originally heard. Was it possible for the Character List
to be updated after some time? Perhaps…

I organized my thoughts and decided to let Yoo Sangah go. "Forget that I
asked. By the way, nice work. In the future, don't let other people know
about your personal attribute."

"That's not it! I trust Dokja-ssi…!" Well, Yoo Sangah's appearance said
otherwise.
At the moment, I got an idea. "Can Yoo Sangah tell me about the nature of
your sponsor?"

Yoo Sangah bowed her head. "I'm sorry."

The words barely escaped from her trembling lips. Based on this level, it
was possible that she made some type of promise in the contract with her
sponsor. Perhaps there was a life constraint in respect with the spilling of
information. I didn't know what sponsor they were, but it seemed they had
decided to raise Yoo Sangah in earnest.

"It is okay. I understand."

"Thank you, really…"

There was no need to thank me. The fact that she couldn't tell me about her
sponsor… made my heart tense. It was the desire of a reader who wanted to
fill the space between empty lines.

"Then try using your skill."

Soon, a faintly shining thread emerged from Yoo Sangah's fingertips and
started to stretch out. "In fact, I tied up a 'thread' when I got kidnapped."

One branch of the thread was connected to me and the other one was
connected outside. Maybe it was bound to Lee Hyunsung or Jung Heewon.

"Let's go."

There was no reason for Yoo Sangah to have such a skill from the
beginning.
This was definitely the stigma provided by her sponsor. By the way, it was
a 'thread' to escape the labyrinth. This… Somehow, I thought it was a
constellation I knew.

[#BI-7623 channel is open.]
I started hearing messages from the constellations again.

[A number of constellations have put a claim on the channel's transmission
system!]

[The constellation 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' is curious about what
came out of the random item box.]

Ah, they haven't seen it? What a pity.

[Damn! That bastard messed with my channel… Hahaha! Did you stay well
while I was away?]

The nice… No, a familiar voice was heard.

Bihyung.




[…You did such great things while I was gone?]

'Was it because of me that you couldn't come back?'

[It… Yes, it isn't unrelated. I got a warning from the Administration Bureau
because the advertisement went on for too long.]

Currently, Bihyung's voice was only audible to me. It was the 'dokkaebi
communication' that only the dokkaebi could use. Of course, it was an
obvious violation of the rules to allow me to use it.

[I have decided not to care about small things now. And I can go back and
forth to the Administration Bureau. Rather… how do you know about the
'Random Box'?]

'Just, I found it by chance'.
[Dammit. There are still remnants of the black history left. Why is that box
there…]

'Black history?'

[······.]

'…Wait. Surely that absurd coin item wasn't planned by you?'

As a reader of Ways of Survival, I didn't know this.

[Damn! If I wasn't greedy at that time…]

Bihyung's grumbling was cut off by Jung Heewon's cry of admiration,
"Wow, it really is delicious! What a surprise."

10 minutes ago, we safely returned to the rest of the party thanks to Yoo
Sangah's guidance. Fortunately, Jung Heewon and Lee Hyunsung had
maintained the boundary until we came back.

"You will recover a bit after eating."

"Well, I really think that my body is getting better." Jung Heewon seemed
much better as she swung her shoulders in a test. The meat of the
underground species actually contained detoxification components.

"Did you get a lot of things in there? In addition to the Magic Power
Stove…"

I looked at Lee Hyunsung and said, "I got a few things."

Lee Hyunsung put on and removed the Old Steel Shield, which he received
from me, repeatedly several times. Now, he was polishing the surface again
and again. It was like someone with a new car.

[The character 'Lee Hyunsung' feels a faint loyalty to you.]
Jung Heewon seemed envious of the scene and asked, "Is there anything I
can use?"

"No."

"What is that blade?"

"It is mine."

"…Will you distribute the meat to the people?"

"If they have coins."

"But… you are really stingy. Kim Dokja."

"Let's just say that I have a strong sense of survival."

As we were passing around a piece of cooked ground rat, the tunnel ended.
The surroundings suddenly brightened, and people started to be seen.
However, the atmosphere was weird. What was this urgent and bustling
mood?

[There are 20 minutes left until the paid settlement.]

[Prepare the survival fee.]

I belatedly noticed the time. That's right. It was already that time. It was
amazing that the word 'paid' could sound so scary.

"Coins, coins, please!"

"I don't have enough coins! Please, a few coins…"

100 coins wouldn't be a problem if they faithfully participated in the
scenario, but such humans were rare.
"I'll give you one million won—no, ten million won! Who will sell 100
coins?"

The price of the coins was soaring. It was funny. There was a ridiculous
premium on money that had no value until the beginning of the destruction.
There were people who smiled as they watched from afar. These guys
already had enough coins. It was Cheon Inho and the Cheoldoo Group. A
few women flocked toward the gang members and cried out, "Y-You said
you would give me 100 coins before!"

"Hrmm, is that so? I don't remember."

"What…?"

"I will think again if you will let me put it in one more time. How about it?"

Jung Heewon pulled out her blade and stared at them. "Those sons of
bitches…"

[The attribute of character 'Jung Heewon' is about to blossom.]

The time had come for Jung Heewon. It wasn't bad if her attribute
blossomed now… Yet she needed some patience in order to get the
'attribute' I was thinking about. Then a system message emerged.

[After a while, the survival settlement will begin.]

"S-Save me! Please, help!"

The expressions of the party changed. Lee Hyunsung bowed his head sadly,
and Jung Heewon bit her lip while holding her blade. Everyone knew what
the price of the 'paid settlement' was. There was no one here who hadn't
experienced it. Then Yoo Sangah looked at me. "…Dokja-ssi."

"Yes."
In this world, coins were power. A person with coins could obtain good
items or good stats. Coins were everything.

[Several constellations with scenario recommendations have been added to
the channel.]

[The constellation 'Secretive Plotter' is watching your choice.]

[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' is watching your
choice.]

[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' is watching your choice.]

…And I was currently the person with the highest number of coins in the
station.
                Chapter 25: Ep. 6 – Judgment Time, II


Just as I was about to open my mouth to speak, I heard Cheon Inho's voice.

"Oh, Dokja-ssi! You came just in time." Cheon Inho smiled as he found us.
I had a foreboding feeling as Cheon Inho spoke in a loud voice, "Dokja-ssi
has a lot of coins! How much? You are probably the richest one among us,
right?"

[The character 'Cheon Inho' has activated the 'Incite Lv. 2' skill.

The crowd looked my way.

"C-Coins?"

"Who has a lot of coins?"
It didn't take long for all eyes to turn to me. Cheon Inho… He was a really
great guy.

"A-are you Dokja-ssi?"

"Please save me!"

People panted heavily as they approached and grabbed my legs. The
number of people flocking toward me was estimated to be at least 20. If I
gave all these people coins, I would lose 2,000 coins. Yet if I didn't give
them coins, I would become a big villain of Geumho Station.

[Your understanding of the character 'Cheon Inho' has increased.]

"Haha, Dokja-ssi. I don't have the coins to help all these poor people, but…
isn't Dokja-ssi different? Will you just wait and watch?"

I sighed quietly, having seen this trick once or twice before.

[Constellations of the absolute good system have defined Cheon Inho as
'wicked'.]

I had enough of putting up with him.

"S-Save me!"

"Please save me!"

The people burst into tears with the most pitiful expression in the world.

[Hahaha! This story is becoming fun. For reference, there are 10 minutes
left!] Bihyung spoke in a voice that was full of joy, and the party looked at
me with strange expressions.

I let out a short sigh and slowly closed my eyes before opening them again.
"I see. You want coins?"
Then I laughed. "Why should I?"

I looked around at the people. The first scenario was original sin. Thus,
none of the people here were innocent. That made it more disgusting. Those
who trampled on someone else to survive couldn't even bear responsibility
for their own lives.

"W-Why?"

"You have a lot of coins! Can't you give us a few?"

In the midst of the confusion, Cheon Inho burst out laughing. "I expected
this from Dokja-ssi."

"…"

"From the very first moment Dokja-ssi showed up here. Didn't you sell
food for coins? If you didn't make them buy food at that time, do you
know how many people can survive now?" "Yes! He is right!"

"Shit! Give me back my coins!"

Suddenly the atmosphere was flowing against me. Maybe this was what
Cheon Inho wanted.

"Just a minute everyone! Your actions right now…!"

"Dokja-ssi isn't such a person!"

Yoo Sangah and Lee Hyunsung tried to diffuse the crowd, but the people
had already lost their sense of reason. Then Cheon Inho drove in the last
wedge. "Dokja-ssi. I will give you one last chance. Give the coins back to
the people."

"What if I don't want to?"
"Then the worst will happen."

The crowd of 20 people started to approach step by step.

"T-This…come! Give me your coins!"

Nevertheless, no one attacked first. Eventually, a member of the Cheoldoo
Group came forward. "You scum! What are you doing? Kill him! Why are
you hesitating when you can snatch the coins after killing him?"

The man who shouted had a very sturdy physique. I triggered Character
List and confirmed his information.


  [Character Summary]

  Name: Han Minsung

  Exclusive Attributes: Bully (General)

  Overall Stats: Physique Lv. 8, Strength Lv. 8, Agility Lv. 8, Magic
  Power Lv. 2.


His abilities made sense for a bully, but the level of his stats was not
natural… This guy had done 'it'. Yes, he acted rashly because he believed in
his stats.

"Kill that bastard!"

The metal pipe in his hand moved. It was a steel pipe containing Lv. 8
strength. The former 'Kim Dokja' might be scared by this threat but… For
the current me, it was just ridiculous. I cut off the man's arm, and it rolled
across the ground with the iron pipe.

"Kuaaack!"
The blood covered Unbroken Faith emitted a white light as I swept a glance
over the quiet people.

"U-Uh…" Everyone turned pale when they saw a Cheoldoo Group member
being overwhelmed with one blow. Now that I had shown off a bit, it was
time to start.

"Pathetic… Do you really believe this situation is because of me?" I looked
left and right at each face in the crowd. On the other side, Cheon Inho was
looking confused. "In fact, you know very well that it isn't me."

Like sick goldfish, the mouths of the crowd dropped open. I spoke like I
was disseminating food to them, "You guys are doing this because you are
scared. In fact, even though you knew what was wrong and are in a crisis,
you are trembling in fear because of them."

Cheon Inho laughed, "Haha, look at this, Dokja-ssi! What are you
saying…?"

"It is because they are stronger than you! Their overall stats are higher than
you and they have a lot of coins! But everyone, you know what?" I asked as
I took a step toward the crowd. The entire crowd retreated like surprised
goldfish. However, they were already in my fish tank. "Why are they
stronger than you?" I took one more step. "More than anything, why do
they have more coins than you? Is it because they are gangsters? Perhaps."

[The characters around you are shaken.]

Even in fear, there were some emotions that could be conveyed with
certainty. Questions passed over their faces.

"C-Cheon Inho-ssi, how many coins do you have…?"

"Haha, don't you know? Well, I have sold a few and―"

"Do you think it is possible to get that many stats with just that? Really?"
Cheon Inho closed his mouth. I turned from left to right, looking at the
crowd's faces one by one.

"When I came to Geumho Station a few days ago, there were 87 people
here."

"…"

"How many people are left now? I don't think there is more than 50 people.
Do you know why?"

"T-They went out as scouts and the monsters―"

"Monsters? Do you still believe that?"

"T-Then…"

"You fools. Think about it with your brains. Did those people really die
because of the monsters? Then why haven't any of the Cheoldoo Group
bastards died?" The area became quiet in an instant. "Why is it that they
come back stronger?"

[The constellation 'Secretive Plotter' nods at your reasoning.]

"D-Don't tell me―" The people turned to look at Cheon Inho. The
Cheoldoo Group members hesitated. Now it was my turn to drive in the
wedge. "They said it before. If you kill me, you will get coins."

[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' pulls his hair in
excitement.]

"How do they know that killing a person will give coins?"

"Y-You… Inho-ssi! Don't tell me?"
"Shut up! I'm being framed!" As Cheon Inho moved back, the men of the
Cheoldoo Group pulled out their weapons. The frightened people were
weeping.

[Hahaha! There are 7 minutes left!]

I stepped forward toward the people. "If you have any last self-respect left,
fight with your own hands."

The Blade of Faith cried out violently as anger filled the eyes of the people.

"At least get back what was taken from you."

As I waited, the people of the Cheoldoo Group rushed toward me
simultaneously. I also ran toward them.

"Now this world is such a place."

The white light moved, and people screamed. Then someone shouted, "Yes,
shit!"

"Sons of a bitches!"

The people started to move. All in all, they were people who had already
killed.

"M-Mother!"

"Dayoung, come here! Do this! Just like what you did on the subway with
Mother!"

There were children and mothers.

"This fuckin' bastards!"

There was also a middle-aged Indian man.
"These scum!"

Alas, they weren't a match for those in the Cheoldoo Group. There were a
lot of people left in the Cheoldoo Group, and their fighting power was
overwhelming due to all the coins they had obtained through human
hunting. Or at least, this would be the case if it wasn't for me.

The arms and legs of the Cheoldoo Group members, who charged at me,
flew off. The eerie sensation of cutting off a person's limbs filled my hands.
The incapacitated Cheoldoo Group members looked up at me.

"S-Spare me…"

At that moment, someone moved ahead of me and stuck their blade into the
fallen Cheoldoo Group members.

"I said I would kill him."

[All evolution conditions of the attribute 'Crouching Figure' have been
met.]

[The attribute of character 'Jung Heewon' is blossoming.]

A dazzling brilliance was rising from her body. I nodded. It was now time.

[The attribute of 'Jung Heewon' has blossomed to 'Judge of Destruction
(Hero).]

A judge to wipe out evil—the best of the three 'judge' attributes woke up
from a crouching figure.

[You have contributed greatly to the attribute of 'Crouching Figure!']

[The character 'Jung Heewon' won't hesitate to be your sword in the future.]

"Rest for now," Jung Heewon said. Her eyes were pale blue as she declared,
"These guys are my share."
[The character 'Jung Heewon' has activated the exclusive skill 'Judgment
Time'.]

[The Absolute Good constellations have agreed to the use of this skill.]

['Judgment Time' has been activated.]

Jung Heewon had a bloody aura around her body as her blade painted an
eerie trail. It was a light and precise kendo that moved between the
Cheoldoo Group members. Blood spurted everywhere.

"Kuaaaak!"

It was a scene of a complete massacre. Of course, Jung Heewon wasn't the
only one fighting. Yoo Sangah, Lee Hyunsung, and even Lee Gilyoung
were protecting their respective positions, but no one was as active as Jung
Heewon. Like a person who was born for murder, Jung Heewon killed and
killed. If I cut off a man's arm, Jung Heewon stabbed his heart. If I cut off
his leg, Jung Heewon cut his throat. She took care of all those I left behind.

Jung Heewon moved without hesitation, like a person who had been
longing for this moment.

"…"

The area was filled with blood. The only person left from the Cheoldoo
Group was Cheon Inho. However, many parts of his body had been injured
by the citizens. Jung Heewon looked at me, and I nodded.

Cheon Inho laughed as he looked at me. "Hu, huhu… Y-You…"

He never stopped speaking, but Jung Heewon appeared behind Cheon Inho
and sliced through him from top to bottom.

[All constellations in the channel feel intense joy.]
Finally, everyone stopped moving. The fight was over. However, they
couldn't feel it. The times when they ate grilled meat, felt the meaning of
life, joked while walking, and enjoyed moments of peace all seemed like a
lie. This damn scenario…

Yoo Sangah was crying. Lee Gilyoung closed his eyes. Lee Hyunsung bit
his lips so hard he was bleeding. Jung Heewon exhausted her physical
strength and was sitting in a pool of blood.

Yes, this was the truth of the world.

[The survival value will be settled.]

There was the sound of popping all around us. Those who had coins
survived, while those who failed to get coins were now dead. No one was
able to save each other. I said to the people, "Wake up, everybody."

Even if I raised my head, the sky couldn't be seen. I stared at the unseen sky
for a while, resisting some great fate. The noisy constellations had no
answer this time.

"This scenario has just begun."

While everyone was in deep thought, I was thinking about the next scenario
alone. My mind was calm as the pages flipped one after another. I had
obtained everything I needed from Geumho Station. The next stage was
Chungmuro.
              Chapter 26: Ep. 6 – Judgment Time, III


The following morning, there were a few changes to Geumho Station. First
of all, Han Myungoh had disappeared. He hid once the fighting started and
disappeared after it ended. I didn't know if he was hiding somewhere in the
station or was moving to the next station.

"Let's not worry about him now. I didn't like him from the beginning. In
addition, he isn't the only one who disappeared." It was as Jung Heewon
said. After the fight yesterday, the number of people remaining in Geumho
Station was almost nonexistent. It wasn't that there were few survivors.
Rather, more people survived compared to the original plot. However, most
of those who survived left the station last night. Perhaps they had their own
reasons.

"…Will the remaining people be okay?" Yoo Sangah asked as she looked at
the survivors. Me, Yoo Sangah, Lee Hyunsung, Lee Gilyoung and Jung
Heewon. Apart from us five, there were only five people left in this station.

Jung Heewon spoke first, "Hey everyone. Are you coming with us?"
The casual words caused a stir among the people. The representative was a
young woman holding a child's hand. "…We will go separately. We have
some coins left."

I honestly admired that the mother and child survived the bloody fight. If
she had that much strength, they might be able to survive without going
with us. Jung Heewon nodded, "Yes. I wish you luck."

Once Jung Heewon turned around, relief appeared on the people's faces. In
fact, this response wasn't strange. Certainly, yesterday's situation was a bit
shocking. It was understandable. One refused to give out charity while
another one brutally killed people, even if there was a reason. To them,
Jung Heewon might not be much different from the Cheoldoo Group. I
touched Lee Hyunsung, who was making a stupefied expression next to me.

"Lee Hyunsung-ssi?"

"Ah, yes!"

Lee Hyunsung, who was staring at Jung Heewon with a blank expression,
looked at me with surprise. I think I knew what he was thinking. He
wondered if she was the woman struck by madness yesterday and killed all
the Cheoldoo Group.

"Are the preparations finished?"

Lee Hyunsung replied, "Yep! It is a bit rough but it is finished. There are
plastic bottles to be used as water containers, goods to protect from the cold
and emergency supplies…"

Indeed, a soldier was useful in situations like this.

"…This is all we have. If you need anything else…"

There was nothing else I needed…I wanted to say but I suddenly thought
about something. "Oh, can you find me any portable charger?"
"You are talking about a powerbank? Why…?"

It was natural to wonder. A smartphone was useless because no signal was
available. I replied roughly, "I have a place to use it."

Lee Hyunsung said he would look for it and started to search through the
things left behind by the Cheoldoo Group. Lee Gilyoung and Yoo Sangah
also said they would help. Jung Heewon looked at me and asked, "Are we
going now?"

"We're going."

She asked naturally, as if there was no question that we would go together.
This was Jung Heewon. It was welcome from my viewpoint. The 'Judge of
Destruction' was a talented person who even Yoo Joonghyuk would pay
attention to.

"I have many questions."

"Not now."

"Ah really, you are an iron wall." Jung Heewon lightly punched me and
laughed.

[You have received 1,500 coins from the character 'Jung Heewon'.]

"This…?"

"I am dividing it. I feel too sorry to eat it all alone. I will share it with other
people."

I understood what she was saying. Yesterday, Jung Heewon alone killed
most of the Cheoldoo Group members. In other words, she obtained most
of their coins. By the way… I was a bit nervous about this.

"You don't need to do this."
Jung Heewon didn't know. In fact, I had a lot more coins.

"I'm not Dokja-ssi, you know?" She punched my arms a few more times
before walking towards the tunnel with her backpack. "Finish this off. I'll
go ahead and make some arrangements."

"Don't go too far ahead. There are sections too dangerous to go alone."

Jung Heewon waved her hands as if not to worry while wandering away.

[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' likes your companionship.]

[The constellation 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' smiles slyly.]

I watched the messages in the air blankly and said, 'Did you make a lot
yesterday? It must be good'.

There was no answer. I spoke once again, 'Don't keep pretending and tell
me. I know you are watching'. [Ah, hahaha… you caught me?] It was
Bihyung's voice.

'How much did you earn?'

[…T-That. Um.]

I stared silently.

[Sigh, right. How did you know again…? I just can't get over it. Take this.]

[Dokkaebi 'Bihyung' has given you 4,500 coins.]

I thought so. This damn dokkaebi.

[…The constellations didn't use the sponsorship system but sent it directly
to me instead. I don't know why. I'll give it to you later. Ah, there are these
messages as well.]
Messages suddenly popped up.

[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' is satisfied with your
scenario.]

[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' is convinced of your
judgment.]

[The constellation 'Secretive Plotter' is satisfied with your plan.]

······.

This was why I didn't get the support messages yesterday. I had been
curious because such a great thing happened and I received less income
than I thought.

[Coins Possessed: 23,050 C]

I invested a lot of the coins I obtained last time into stats and now I had a
lot of coins again. It was once again time to improve my stats. Then let's do
it moderately. I couldn't open the attributes window so I had to remember
the exact level of my stats.

First…physique was important.

[1,200 coins have been invested in physique.]

[Physique Lv. 12 -> Physique Lv. 15]

[The durability of your body has greatly increased!]

I had no separate passive attack skill so I also raised my strength.

[1,600 coins have been invested in strength.]

[Strength Lv. 11 -> Strength Lv. 15]
[A stronger force will come from your muscles!]

For agility, it was enough to be able to evade.

[400 coins have been invested in agility.]

[Agility Lv. 10 -> Agility Lv. 11]

[Now you can move a bit faster.]

I needed to maintain Purest Sword Force, so magic power had to be at least
level 10.

[1,200 coins have been invested in magic power.]

[Magic Power Lv. 6 -> Magic Power Lv. 10]

[A mysterious energy lives in your soul.]

I could invest more than this but I purposefully didn't. Once I arrived in
Chungmuro, there was another place where I would have to use a lot of
coins.

Besides, I had spent 4,400 coins just now. It was both easy and difficult to
use. If I had started with decent stats, I wouldn't have had to spend so many
coins. Someone starting with level 1 physique… in Ways of Survival, even
Lee Gilyoung's stamina would be higher than that.

[By the way, I forgot…two more scenarios are recommended. You are
really great. It seems that I will soon be able to upgrade my channel level.]

'I see'.

I couldn't get the support of a sponsor like other incarnations, so I needed to
collect more coins. The reason why I have yet to see the effect of
contracting with Bihyung was because his channel was small. The 'minor'
constellations weren't enough. In order to gather more coins, it would take
more constellations to configure the channel.

Once I went to Chungmuro, the environment would soon be ready.

"If everybody is ready, we will leave. You aren't missing anything?"

My companions gathered together and nodded. Looking at their nervous
faces, all of them seemed to have been enlightened by yesterday. Finally,
the journey to Chungmuro began.




We had crossed half the railroad lines when the system message popped up.

[The second main scenario is enabled.]


  [Main Scenario #2 – Meeting]

  Category: Main

  Difficulty: E

  Clear Conditions: Cross the tunnel and meet the survivors in the first
  main base.

  Time Limit: None

  Compensation: 500 coins

  Failure: ???
The message made me realize that it was really starting. Unlike the first
main scenario, the second main scenario had a 'main base'. Jung Heewon
asked, "The main base? Where is that?"

An answer wasn't required. Another message immediately appeared.

[The next main base is 'Chungmuro'.]

"Is it Chungmuro? It is only three more stops…"

It was originally like that. Then ground rats appeared. There were around
30 ground rats. Jung Heewon stiffened and muttered, "…We have to go
three stops through this."

It was Lee Hyunsung who came forward. "I'll take the vanguard."

Thanks to the support of his sponsor, Lee Hyunsung's total stats were now
37. He had earned less coins than me but he was chasing me…this was the
advantage of starting with high stats. If I knew this, I would've done regular
push-ups.

"I'll take the rear, hyung."

Lee Gilyoung's total stats were still low but he was able to use Diverse
Communication more flexibly through steady skill training.

"Please leave it to me."

Yoo Sangah made a thread with magic power to block the movements of
the ground rats. Her attack ability was low but her overall stats were similar
to Jung Heewon.

"…Isn't it just a lot of numbers?"

Finally, there was no need to talk about Jung Heewon. Compared to Lee
Hyunsung, her total stats were low but her skills were sufficient. There was
the exclusive skill 'Judgment Time' that belonged to the 'Judge of
Destruction'. As long as the opponent in front of her was 'wicked' according
to the Absolute Good constellations, Jung Heewon wouldn't lose.

The last ground rat fell down. Lee Hyunsung held the shield by his side and
started sweating.

"Sigh…this seems to be enough."

In fact, this shouldn't have been cleared so easily. No matter how simple the
pattern of the ground rats was, fighting 30 of them was tough. I wouldn't be
able to annihilate them myself without activating Bookmark. The party had
become stronger.

We advanced further through the tunnel. Finally, a new platform appeared
in front of me.

"Yaksu Station. By the way…there is nobody? No, that's not it."

Yaksu Station was filled with dead bodies and ground rat corpses. Based on
the injuries, some of the people were killed by Yoo Joonghyuk, not the
ground rats.

"Keep going. There are two stops left."

We continued to advance. Anyway, the distance from Yaksu to Dongguk
University was less than 1 km in a straight line. Once we arrived at the
entrance of Dongguk University Station, we encountered another group of
ground rats and repelled them. We only moved a total of 2 km along a
simple path, but the fighting was so tough that the party was exhausted.

"We will take a break here."

"Sigh…there is one stop left. We should just go there and relax…"

"Nobody knows if we can rest or not once we arrive there."
Everyone was silent at my words. Certainly, monsters weren't the only
dangers things in this world. I looked around for a moment and said, "It
seems that the people in this station moved quickly. Some basic necessities
might remain."

"Ah right. Then…"

After hearing 'basic necessities,' Yoo Sangah gently raised her hand. Yoo
Sangah looked at Jung Heewon and their eyes met. No words were
exchanged but both of them nodded at the same time. Jung Heewon saw my
look and asked me, "What is it? Does Dokja-ssi want to know?"

Yoo Sangah paled. "…Heewon-ssi?"

"Ahaha, I'm just joking. Of course, I won't tell anyone."

…A secret only between women. It would be strange if I didn't know what
they were talking about. Human physiology didn't stop even in a world like
this. Lee Hyunsung also opened his mouth, "Ah, then I will go to the
bathroom."

I was surprised for a moment but there was no reason not to use well-built
facilities. This was why the subway was convenient.

"I'll go with you." It was Lee Gilyoung. The two people walked side by
side. I looked at their rear view and thought they looked like affectionate
brothers with a large age difference.

Yoo Sangah asked me, "Will Dokja-ssi be alone?"

"I will go above ground for a bit."

"Huh? There will be poisonous fog if you go out…will it be okay?"

"I'm only going for a bit."

Jung Heewon narrowed her eyes at my words. "…Something is suspicious.
Dokja-ssi, are you going to eat something good alone?"

I looked at Jung Heewon for a moment. "It is a man's secret."




After a while, I stood in front of Exit 6 of Dongdae Station. According to
the information I read beforehand, this place was surely…

[You have been exposed to a poisonous fog.]

The effect of the poisonous rhinos was still visible. This time I didn't buy
the Ellain Monkey's Lungs so I had to work quickly. I jumped up the
escalator to the east while holding my breath. Not long after that, a bronze
coloured shining statue appeared.

[A constellation wearing a straw mat is filled with expectations at your
actions.]

The statue was based on the appearance of a monk who lived in the
midJoseon Dynasty. I felt an unknown nobility coming from the face of the
monk holding a bamboo stick. I confirmed the name written vertically
under the statue.

Yujeong Samyeongdang¹

Okay, good. There were no signs of anyone… I stood in front of the statue,
holding my hands together.

[A constellation wearing a straw mat is delighted with your actions.]

[100 coins have been sponsored.]

I didn't hesitate to use Purest Sword Force to activate the Blade of Faith.
[A constellation wearing a straw mat is puzzled by your actions.]

Then I struck the statue of Samyeongdang.

[A constellation wearing a straw mat is appalled by your actions.]



[1] Yujeong Samyeongdang is a Korean Buddhist monk, sometimes
identified by his pen name, Song-un. A leader of Seosan's army of monks in
1592 – 1598. Wiki.
               Chapter 27: Ep. 6 – Judgment Time, IV


A few minutes later, I once again entered Dongguk University Station and
ate a ground rat. It was in order to heal the skin contaminated by the
poisonous fog. It took a little time but the contamination could be recovered
by eating the meat of an underground species.

[…Hey! Are you crazy? What did you do just now?] I was eating when I
heard Bihyung's voice furiously berating me.

'Shut up'.

[No, this isn't an issue you can dismiss. You destroyed a constellation's
idol! Do you want to see my channel fail? Once the 'Bald General of
Justice' begins to talk…]
The idol of a constellation. Every world had their own constellations, South
Korea as well. By the way, Bihyung said it was the 'Bald General of
Justice'. He was a great person in South Korea but…

Actually, I wasn't the type of person to say that.

[A constellation wearing a straw mat is furious at your atrocious actions.]

[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' is laughing.]

There was a difference in the degree of all idols, but they had the power of
a constellation sealed in them. If I released the seal of the idol in the right
way, I could gain a certain amount of power, such as an item or a skill that
the constellation used in their lifetime. However, 'unlocking the seal' took a
long time and I wasn't sure if I could get the skill I wanted.

I looked at Ways of Survival on my smartphone.

「 "But if it is sealed in the bronze statue of Samyeongdang, how did you
get the skill?"

"There is a saying that if you meet Buddha, kill Buddha."

"What? Don't tell me…"

"Haha, I was just trying it out… but it is true. All the statues aren't just for
worship."

"Hey! This jerk, you should watch your mouth. You might be cursed by the
constellation." 」

At the last gateway to enter Chungmuro, the 'skill' of Samyeongdang was
essential and the most surefire way to get the skill was to destroy the idol.
Of course, I could buy something similar from the Dokkaebi Bag but… the
more coins I saved, the better.
"Then did you resolve the 'man's secret' well?"

I quickly turned off my smartphone screen. My companions, including Jung
Heewon, had gathered.

"Yes. And I have something for you."

I pulled out the items I gained from the idol. As luck would have it, the
Samyeongdang idol contained items and skills.

[Samyeongdang's Beads]

[Samyeongdang's Straw Mat]

Rags and old beads. There were questions in the eyes of everyone present. I
knew what they were thinking. However, I also knew this: In this world,
'old' was more likely to be 'good'.

"They seem like good items because they are souvenirs of a great person."

"Great person?"

"Do you know Samyeongdang?"

[A constellation wearing a straw mat has paused at your actions.]

Jung Heewon asked with a blank expression, "…Who is that?"

[A constellation wearing a straw mat wishes to appear before character
'Jung Heewon'.]

"Ah! I know!" Fortunately, someone knew. Needless to say, it was Yoo
Sangah. "I remember seeing it when I was studying Korean history! Isn't he
a monk from the Joseon Dynasty?"

"Yes, that's right."
"When the Korean military was struggling to defend against the Japanese
invasion…he fought in the Nowongpyeong battle and Wukwandong
battle!"

As expected from Yoo Sangah. I also studied Korean history but I didn't
know this.

[A constellation wearing a straw mat is touched by character 'Yoo Sangah'.]

I nodded and said, "Anyway, these items have his strength."

"…Really?"

"Wow, it is real!"

Jung Heewon and Lee Hyunsung were surprised when they confirmed the
item information.

"Still, how did Dokja-ssi know to get this?"

"Just, I put my hands together in front of the Samyeongdang statue and…
they fell from the sky."

"Huh? No way…"

I thought it was ridiculous but there was a reason people said such
ridiculous words. I put on a mock solemn expression as I watched the party.
"I think… it was sent by Samyeongdang for South Korea."

"Ah…"

Their 'ah' were filled with many meanings. I ignored them and kept talking.
It wasn't like I was asking for them to listen.

"He might've left his belongings to save the country, just like during the
Japanese invasion of South Korea. Anyway, now South Korea is a country
undergoing turmoil."
[A constellation wearing a straw mat is moved by your words.]

In times of turmoil, scammers always gained power.

"…In this strange world, it isn't weird if something like this happens.
Maybe Samyeongdang is one of the 'constellations'. Isn't that right?"

Surprisingly, Yoo Sangah was the first to be convinced. Maybe she didn't
want me to be embarrassed. The funny thing was that once Yoo Sangah
agreed, Lee Hyunsung was immediately convinced.

"Indeed, Samyeongdang…"

Lee Hyunsung grew up with patriotism for a long time and looked like he
was reminiscing on the principle of military service. Lee Gilyoung also
seemed convinced. It was only Jung Heewon who was staring at me like it
was nonsense.

[A constellation wearing a straw mat likes your revealing words.]

[The constellation 'Bald General of Justice' forgives your sins.]

Bihyung looked at the sky with an 'Is this okay?' expression before looking
dumbfounded. The power of a constellation was directly linked to their
fame. Thus, the constellations loved it when their stories were spread this
way. Where was a constellation that hated being praised?

"I will give Samyeongdang's Beads to Yoo Sangah since you know him
well."

"Really? Can I accept it?"

"I think Samyeongdang will be delighted if Yoo Sangah uses it."

In fact, the performance of Samyeongdang's Beads wasn't good compared
to what the sponsor used it for. It wasn't a sponsor's star relic so maybe the
fact that Samyeongdang wasn't a world-recognized figure had an effect. It
was still a B class item so it had a secondary option of boosting magic
power to increase magic power recovery.

Jung Heewon watched Yoo Sangah like she was envious and said, "Yoo
Sangah knows a lot of things. I didn't know about Samyeongdang because I
didn't do very well at school."

"Ah…that…that."

"I'm joking, joking. Don't make such an expression."

I spoke to the sulky Jung Heewon, "I also have something for Jung
Heewonssi."

"For me? Is it that straw mat?"

"Yes."

"It's okay. No matter how urgent, I don't want to wear such a thing."

"…Just try it. You won't regret it."

Jung Heewon hesitated for a moment before throwing on the straw mat. She
was trying to be fashionable but she just looked like a beggar.

[A constellation who likes companionship condemns your actions.]

[A constellation who praises friendship likes your actions.]

It would be different if the star relic 'Samyeongdang's Bamboo Stick and
Straw Sandals' came out, but the other two items weren't necessary for me
right now. Jung Heewon saw her reflection on the screen door of the
subway and made a slightly complicated expression.

"It is hard to explain but…I suddenly feel like I can harness the power of
justice."
Samyeongdang's Straw Mat was an item that enhances the justice and
willpower of the wearer. I didn't need it but it was a pretty good item for
Jung Heewon.

"You said Samyeongdang? I feel sorry for some reason. I should study
harder."

[The constellation 'Bald General of Justice' is happy at this situation.]

[100 coins have been sponsored.]

I jokingly said, "Then let's put our hands together and pray."




It was a joke but Jung Heewon really went to pray.

Jung Heewon was contaminated by the poisonous fog and spoke while
eating a ground rat. "By the way, who broke it? Surely it wasn't Dokja-ssi?"

"…"

"…Dokja-ssi?"

"Be prepared. We will be at Chungmuro soon."

I looked at the dark tunnel. It had been 20 minutes since Lee Gilyoung used
Diverse Communication, allowing us to safely move forward. Considering
the fact that Dongguk University to Chungmuro was 1 km in a straight line,
it was time for 'that' to appear.

[A new sub-scenario has arrived!]

Indeed, as soon as I thought about it.
"Everybody step back."


  [Sub Scenario – Phantom Prison]

  Category: Sub

  Difficulty: D~F

  Clear Conditions: Escape from Phantom Prison within the time limit.

  Time Limit: 1 hour

  Compensation: 300 coins

  Failure: ???


[Sub-scenario – Phantom Prison has begun!]

Perhaps Yoo Joonghyuk had suffered quite a bit in this scenario.
This scenario was one of the most painful traps for a regressor. Yoo
Sangah asked, "Phantom Prison? What is this?" She would know
without asking.

"It is coming. Everyone, please keep your mind straight."

Before my words were over, a haze overcame me. The fog that instantly
occupied the tunnel blocked my field of view. The party members in the
immediate vicinity couldn't be seen. When I looked around, I could only
see a distorted scenery, as if I was on drugs.

"Uwah…I feel bad!" Jung Heewon screamed. Maybe Jung Heewon was
seeing something different from what I saw now.
「Dokja.」

The voice I didn't want to hear. That forgotten voice was heard in a drug-
like landscape. If I was this way, my other party members would be worse.

"…Something feels strange. Dokja-ssi! Are you there?"

"Dokja-ssi! Dokja-ssi!"

In this distorted vision, the voices of my party members were gradually
fading.

[Phantom Prison].

A space that led to madness by touching a person's trauma.

「 Dokja, you didn't see anything. Understood? 」

The landscape disappeared and the face of a person popped up. I smiled
bitterly as I stared into the air. I wanted to deny reality.

[The exclusive skill, 'Fourth Wall' is activated!]

[Due to the skill effect, immunity to Phantom Prison has occurred.]

The moment my mind relaxed, the uncomfortable feeling diminished.

[The constellation 'Secretive Plotter' admires your spirit.]

[100 coins have been sponsored.]

[The curious constellations are sorry that they can't peek at your memories.]

As the power of Phantom Prison weakened, I felt a sense of alarm.

"Everyone, calm down and take deep breaths."
Those trapped in Phantom Prison would lose their minds and unleash their
madness around them. Thus, the most dangerous thing in Phantom Prison
was the companions around you. Yoo Joonghyuk's solo behaviour might be
because he was worried about this prison.

"S-Soldier Lee Hyunsung. Did you hear wrong?"

"I was wrong. I was wrong, Mother!"

"T-This dog bastard!"

…I was too late. I heard the screams of people filled with madness, but it
wasn't everyone.

"…Dokja-ssi?" At this moment, Yoo Sangah's appearance was revealed in
Phantom Prison. Samyeongdang's Beads around her wrist was glowing
brightly. Fortunately, it worked. I approached Yoo Sangah and said,
"Cover the surroundings. From now on, I will destroy this space." Yoo
Sangah nodded with a nervous expression.

[The exclusive skill 'Destroy Evil Lv. 1' is activated.]

Destroy Evil. It was one level higher than the Repel Evil skill that could be
bought with coins. It was a skill that I obtained after breaking the bronze
statue of Samyeongdang.

[The exclusive skill 'Destroy Evil Lv. 1' has turned off 'Phantom Prison'.]

Indeed, it was a skill used by Samyeongdang. If I had bought Repel Evil, it
would've taken a minute to release it. As the fog retreated and Phantom
Prison disappeared, my companions started to appear one by one.

"O-Our resolve! We are the South Korean army, loyal to the nation and the
people!"

"Uh…Uh…Mother."
The trauma could be seen with one glance. Lee Hyunsung was bowing with
his head on the ground, while Lee Gilyoung had his head on his knees and
was shaking. Yoo Sangah came forward first. "Lee Hyunsung-ssi?
Gilyoung! Please wake up!"

At this moment, a blade flew from the rear. Fortunately, the blade wasn't
fast and it wasn't difficult to avoid.

"…I will kill all of you."

Jung Heewon was waving her sword through the air like a madman. My
heart ached as I watched Jung Heewon's eyes became gradually redder.
This was dangerous. It was a sign of 'Demon Slaying'. I stunned Jung
Heewon by strongly hitting her in the back of the neck. Luckily, Jung
Heewon was unharmed. I thought it wouldn't be like this with
Samyeongdang's Straw Mat but Jung Heewon's mental state was more
fragile than I expected.

"Yoo Sangah, please look after Jung Heewon-ssi."

"…Yes, yes!"

"It isn't over yet."

[You have met the conditions to clear the sub-scenario!]

[You have earned 300 coins.]

Monsters appeared as soon as the clear message showed up. They were a
mass of liquid, reminiscent of ectoplasm. The 8th grade specter. It was the
specters who made Phantom Prison. I used Purest Sword Force to invoke
Blade of Faith. Fortunately, the battle itself wasn't difficult. In the first
place, the specters weren't difficult if Phantom Prison was destroyed. The
creepy and weird specters were destroyed.

[Specter's Stone.]
I put the fallen stones into my pocket. This needed to be picked up. Thanks
to Yoo Sangah, the others were recovering quickly.

"A-Are you okay?"

The one who recovered the fastest was Lee Hyunsung. Lee Hyunsung heard
the story and bowed his head with surprise. "…Thank you. I almost got into
big trouble. I also want to thank Dokja-ssi."

"It is nothing."

"I have a headache…" Lee Gilyoung's head was pounding. I stroked Lee
Gilyoung's hair. He pretended to be okay but perhaps the one with the most
terrible trauma in this place was this child. I saw a pale light in the distance.

Yoo Sangah said, "Dokja-ssi, I think it is over."

I worried about it for a short moment. Jung Heewon was stunned and it was
difficult for the others to exercise their power. Would we be okay to enter
Chungmuro at this rate? My concerns were resolved by another person. A
blade loomed in the darkness, but it was a pure threat, without the intent to
harm.

"Who are you? Don't you know that this area is our hunting ground?" In the
faint light of the entrance, a girl holding a long sword stood. She looked to
be 17 and was wearing a school uniform. She was wearing a hood like she
was trying to hide her name tag, but her appearance was noticeable.

"Ah, this girl…!" Yoo Sangah had keen eyes and recognized her first. I also
knew her. It was because she was one of the main characters of Ways of
Survival. The only survivor of Daepong Girls High School, Lee Jihye. She
was one of the reasons why Yoo Joonghyuk went straight to Chungmuro in
the shortest time.
"…Did you guys beat the specters?" Lee Jihye discovered the stone in
my hand and was surprised. "How did you…only Master could catch
them?" I immediately used a skill.

sponsor behind Lee Jihye. She was a must in future maritime wars.
[The constellation 'Bald General of Justice' is touched at meeting an old
companion.]

[Lee Jihye's sponsor welcomes the 'Bald General of Justice'.]

I felt a faint breeze in the subway tunnel where no trains were running.
Looking at Lee Jihye's hair fluttering in the wind, I realized again.

[Main Scenario #2 – Meeting has ended.]

[The compensation will be settled.]

Yes, we finally arrived. This was Chungmuro.
                    Chapter 28: Ep. 7 – Landlord, I


We followed Lee Jihye and entered Chungmuro. Yoo Sangah saw the
shattered screen door of the platform and said, "…It is a chaotic
atmosphere."

As we climbed up from the tracks of railway line 3, we saw some people
sitting down.

[You have entered Chungmuro.]

[The third scenario is currently in progress.]

[#GIR-8761 channel is active.]

[#BIR-3642 channel is active.]

From Chungmuro onward, the size of the scenario grew and the dokkaebi
channels increased. That naive Bihyung would have a hard time from now
on. Some middle-aged people saw us and waved their hands. "Oh, little
samurai. You brought new people?"

"Yes." 'A samurai'. I guess Lee Jihye could be called that if the sponsor
behind her wasn't known. Sooner or later, they would be punished. Lee
Jihye frowned at the middle-aged people. "Are you drunk again?"

"Hahaha! What is there to do other than drink when the world has become
like this?"

The middle-aged people seemed relaxed, unlike those who were
experiencing a disaster. It was natural since they were wearing the uniform
of soldiers. This was definitely different from Gumho Station. It was truly
beginning now.

"But did your friends come through the tunnel? How great… Won't they
have a lot of coins?"

Then one of the middle-aged men turned to Yoo Sangah. "Young lady over
there, what is your name? Would you like to rent a room for cheap?"

"…Room?"

"Haha, you don't know the system here yet? This place―"

Lee Jihye cut off the middle-aged man's words. "Ahjussis. Don't try to trick
the newcomers."

"Uhuh, they must know anyway. This is what everyone is doing to live…"

"If you don't want to be injured, then get lost."

The middle-aged man paled at Lee Jihye's words. "This… young child has
already learned bad things."

"Hey, Kang-ssi. Stop it."
The middle-aged people turned away. They disappeared into transit line 4,
and Lee Jihye put away her sword.

"I brought you here, so take care from now on. I'm not a babysitter," this
child spoke so indifferently.

I looked around. Chungmuro—this was the stage of the third scenario,
where completely different rules were in play.

"S-Shit! I'll kill you if you come close…" A man was in the middle of the
platform for subway line 3, waving a knife around and threatening people.
At his feet was a tile that was 1 pyeong (3.306 m2) in size. It emitted a
green light that stretched into the air.

Yoo Sangah asked, "…Why is he doing that?"

"I don't know." I could guess but there was no need to scare her just now.
There were many people sitting down with a knife on subway line 3. Unlike
the previous middle-aged men, the faces of the people here were filled with
despair. I glanced at them and asked Lee Jihye, "Is Yoo Joonghyuk here?"

Lee Jihye, who was about to leave, turned her head at 'Yoo Joonghyuk'.
There was vigilance in her eyes. "…Who are you?"

Yoo Joonghyuk had already ruined this child. Well, I could understand. It
was difficult to find a constellation on the level of Maritime War God,
even if he searched through all of South Korea. If I were in Yoo
Joonghyuk's position, I wouldn't have found her so soon after coming to
Chungmuro. "I am a companion of Yoo Joonghyuk who came back
alive."

"…Companion? How is that possible?" Lee Jihye stared at me with
suspicious eyes.

I shrugged shamelessly. "That guy will understand if you tell him. Where is
Yoo Joonghyuk now?"
"…Master isn't here right now."

"Really? This is difficult. I have something I need to say."

Lee Jihye's expression distorted as she stared at me with something like
feelings of betrayal. Ah, I knew very well what she thought of Yoo
Joonghyuk. Moreover, she was already addressing him as 'Master'… It will
be difficult to get her this way. Lee Jihye called out to a boy squatting in the
corner, "Hey, over there!"

"Eh? Yes, yes!"

"Watch over these people right here! I'm going to find Master."

The boy looked at us with puzzled eyes. "…Who are they?"

"I don't know. Master's friends?"

At Lee Jihye's words, the eyes of the people on the platform became bigger.
They looked at us with amazement and awe.

"…Yoo Joonghyuk-ssi's friends?!" The boy ran up to us and exclaimed. It
was a boy who looked roughly around Lee Jihye's age. "Are you really Yoo
Joonghyuk-ssi's friends?"

I couldn't lie when I saw the boy's clear eyes. At least, that would be the
case if I were an ordinary person.

"He is a good friend."

Recently, I didn't seem to be an 'ordinary' person. At least, that was the case
here.
While taking care of the unconscious Jung Heewon, I heard about
Chungmuro from the boy. Along with Lee Jihye, this boy was one of Yoo
Joonghyuk's followers.

"…Thus, we followed Yoo Joonghyuk-ssi. Are you listening to me?"

"Yes."

Of course, I wasn't listening properly. The story of psychopath Yoo
Joonghyuk's heroism wasn't interesting. The short summary was something
like this.

"Three days ago, Yoo Joonghyuk appeared and saved some of you,
including Lee Jihye, from the monsters. Isn't that the story?"

The boy frowned at his story being summarized so simply. "Uh, the story
isn't that simple…"

He was surely spellbound by Yoo Joonghyuk. A presence with
overwhelming force had rescued them suddenly. It would be strange if they
didn't follow him. Yet the boy didn't know that he had survived not because
Yoo Joonghyuk was a good guy but because he had been lucky to be with
Lee Jihye.

"Now can I ask you a few things I am curious about?" Lee Hyunsung
started asking politely while I was locked in my thoughts.

"Yes. Just ask."

"How is the food supply here?"

"That… It is a bit embarrassing to say… Some people, including me, are
dependent on Jihye. Jihye hunts and asks Yoo Joonghyuk-ssi to cook…"

It was unknown when he made a checklist but Lee Hyunsung took out his
notes and started to write something. He really was a soldier.
"Then how is your drinking water?"

"We give food or coins to the 'Landlord Alliance' upstairs in exchange."

"…Landlord Alliance?" I sat straight up. Now the story was becoming
interesting.

The boy hesitantly opened his mouth, "They are the landlords in charge of
the Chungmuro area. They occupy the upper floors, and we call them the
Landlord Alliance."

Chungmuro's Landlord Alliance—it was a name that appeared in Ways of
Survival.

"What type of people are they?"

"Well, what should I say…" In fact, there was no need for me to ask.
Perhaps, according to my expectations, one of the '10 Evils' was in
Chungmuro right now. "They are just landlords."

This answer was the correct answer in a sense. They were landlords,
building owners who received fixed taxes. At this moment, the quiet Lee
Gilyoung opened his mouth, "Excuse me, hyung."

"Yes?"

"I want to go to the toilet."

"Is it urgent?"

"Yes."

The timing was a bit unexpected. It was even more puzzling because Lee
Gilyoung normally didn't say something like this. Then I noticed that Lee
Gilyoung was standing next to a blushing Yoo Sangah.

"…Excuse me, can I also go with you?"
At the moment, the image of Yoo Sangah and Jung Heewon securing secret
necessities at Yaksu Station came to mind. I thought I knew what was
going on, but that kid, Lee Gilyoung, quickly noticed it first. The boy
overheard the conversation and said, "You need to go up to the second
underground floor for the toilet, but it won't be easy to enter."

"…Has something happened?"

"Yes. I think it is better to see directly… I'm going up to, would you like to
go with me?'

"Let's go." I was the one who said it. Of course, it wasn't to go to the
bathroom. I had to go up and check a few things. Recently, Yoo
Joonghyuk's movements were different from the 'third regression' that I
knew. If so, I needed to be clear about the gap. I went up to the third
underground level with my friends while carrying Jung Heewon who was
still unconscious.

"Oh, I heard that there were new faces. Have you come to see the rooms?"
A middle-aged man standing near the escalator for line 4 whistled.

The boy shook his head and replied, "Ah, I'm sorry. We are going
upstairs…"

"Eh, too bad. Be careful." The middle-aged man waved his hands without
hesitation.

Yoo Sangah watched the middle-aged man moving away and asked,
"That… By the way… what exactly is the 'room'? I don't think it is the
same as the room that I know."

"It is easy." The boy pointed to a square tile. The tiles were also present on
the platform of line 3. They were green tiles that were 1 pyeong in size.
Looking at the details, I saw something written in the air above the tile.

[Green Zone 0/1]
"The scenario name is 'green zone,' and these tiles are called rooms."

Near the tile, two men were fighting each other over the tile. It was Lee
Hyunsung who asked this time, "What is that? Why are those people
fighting over it?"

The boy looked a bit reluctant to answer, as if talking to us would be a
threat to his survival. "You will know once you arrive at the second
underground floor."

As we climbed up to the higher floors, there were more fights over rooms.
The room numbers were different. There were small rooms labelled (0/1)
and large rooms labelled (0/7). The latter number was probably the capacity
of the room. I looked around carefully and asked, "The third underground
floor to the first underground floor is all the area of the Landlord
Association?"

"…Yes. They are small forces, but the Landlord Association has obtained
most of it."

All the infrastructure of Chungmuro was located on the second and first
underground floors, yet a single alliance occupied all of it.

"Yoo Joonghyuk didn't take any action? Didn't he save you?"

"That…" The boy's face became noticeably darker at my question. The boy
looked sullen for a while before barely being able to speak. "He told us to
stand on our own…"

I knew it. Of course, Yoo Joonghyuk would say something like this.
Perhaps Yoo Joonghyuk never told them to follow him. Fascinated by the
overwhelming force he displayed, they went on to have hopeful dreams.
How pitiful.

Not long after, we arrived at the second underground floor. There was
tension on the boy's face. "We have to be careful from here onward."
There were many more rooms on B2 than the lower levels, and there were
no groups of people fighting. Instead, there were people guarding the green
zones with scary eyes.

[Green Zone 7/7]

We passed by the people and headed toward the bathrooms.

"Uh… Why stop here?"

Our pace came to a stop as we approached the last passage to the bathroom.
Like a bottleneck, dozens of people were gathered in the passage.

"Let's go forward," I said while pushing people out of the way.

"Pildu-ssi! Please accept it! I won't do it again! Please, please! Please let me
stay one more day. I'll go into debt to get the coins!" The leader at the head
of the line was facing the agitated people.

"Now now, back off. Back off." On the opposite side, people who seemed
to be from the Landlord Association were gathered there. I could feel it
instinctively. One of the 10 Evils was here. I tried to find the '10 Evils'
member through the novel's description, but it wasn't easy since all of them
seemed to fit. Did their impressions become similar after becoming
landlords?

I was shaking my head when someone grabbed my leg. It was Lee
Gilyoung. I sensed some danger and was about to grab his shoulder when
someone pushed Lee Gilyoung.

"Ah." Lee Gilyoung lost his balance and fell down.

[The character 'Lee Gilyoung' has invaded private property!]

Suddenly, the atmosphere became cold, and some of the 'Landlord
Association' members in the front looked at Lee Gilyoung.
"What is with this child?"

At almost the same time, the crowd of people screamed and withdrew.

"Crazy!"

"B-Back! Quickly!"

As if they were never there, the crowd of people rushed back like a tide.
The people disappeared, and red lines shone where they used to be
standing. One man looked between the boundary and Lee Gilyoung in turn.
"Hrmm. You seem lost. Do you know where this is?"

"The way to the bathroom?"

"The bathroom? Haha, at one time. By the way, that kid… Where are your
parents?"

"…Huh?"

"Didn't you learn that you shouldn't intrude on other people's land?"

Other people's land…

Oh, it must be true. The man stroked Lee Gilyoung's head with an unknown
look.

"Since you don't know, I will teach you from now on."

[The character 'Gong Pildu' has activated 'Armed Zone Lv. 3!]

There was a whirring sound, and mini turrets resembling gatling guns rose
from the ground.

[The character 'Gong Pildu' demands 500 coins for invading his private
land.]
[If you don't follow the recommendations, all nearby turrets will fire
immediately.]

The man said, "Give me money."

The loaded turrets were all aiming at the same point. The confused Lee
Gilyoung stood up and moved to my side. The man saw me and laughed.
"Ah, so you are his guardian. Then shouldn't the guardian pay 500 coins
instead?"

I smiled at the hand that the man brazenly stretched out.

…How funny, Yoo Joonghyuk. You let these jerks go?
                   Chapter 29: Ep. 7 – Landlord, II


The 10 Evils—the list and rankings were often changed according to Yoo
Joonghyuk's regression cycle, but they were the 10 people in charge of
being the main villains in this world of Ways of Survival. Chungmuro's
armed fortress master, Gong Pildu, was one of the 10 Evils. Thus, a person
wouldn't be aware of Gong Pildu unless they had read to the end of Ways of
Survival (like me).

[Green Zone 56/70]

Indeed, the size of his room was different. It couldn't be measured easily.
This whole green zone was Gong Pildu's area.

'Let's do the standard procedure'.

I hid Lee Gilyoung behind me and opened my mouth, "Why should we pay
you coins? Chungmuro Station is a public place."
"Haha, it was until eight days ago. But not anymore."

For ordinary humans, 500 coins wasn't a small sum. Making people pay
500 coins just for stepping on his land… What a crook.

"Okay, I'll give it, but I'll give it to the person directly."

"What?"

"You aren't Gong Pildu."

Gong Pildu might be a villain, but right now, the person in front of me was
just Extra '1' of the Landlord Alliance.

'Where are you, Gong Pildu?'

I quickly looked around. Not him, not him… I wondered where Gong Pildu
was.

"Haha, you are a funny guy. Hey, you're playing with me now…"

"Gong Pildu-ssi. Where are you? Take the fine."

I ignored them and kept walking.

[You have invaded private property!]

The turrets aimed straight at me but I didn't stop. Honestly, there was no
guarantee that I would be safe if the turrets started shooting. Nonetheless,
there was a need to show off my combat power here. That way Gong Pildu
wouldn't underestimate me.

"That's how far you'll get. I will shoot if you come closer." Finally, Gong
Pildu moved. There was a bench covered with various supplies. A
middleaged man was sitting on top of it and reading a magazine was staring
at me. Indeed, this was how he was described in the novel. His belly was
half revealed, and I could see the hair on it. This was Gong Pildu, the
representative of the Landlord Alliance.

"This is a face I've never seen before but you are great."

"Isn't it unfair that I need to pay to see you?"

[The character 'Gong Pildu' is interested in you.]

In any case, I seemed to be the type that was popular with the bad guys. It
was the same with Kim Namwoon.

"You are fairly good at talking. But it isn't good to be too cocky."

Tadak. I heard magic bullets being loaded in the turrets. 'Damn bastard'.

Gong Pildu smiled like an ordinary neighborhood ahjussi, but I knew…
Gong Pildu could never be an ordinary neighborhood ahjussi.

  * A growth package is currently applied.



There were numerous 'gap' in this world, but few of them were as stable as
a landowner or landlord. However, there were those who boasted both
characteristics, and the 'Armed Fortress Master' Gong Pildu in front of me
was one of them. I realized it when I saw this explanation. His magic power
was already at level 19. Indeed, this would be enough for him to be one of
the 10 Evils in the future.

"By the way, what did you come here for? I don't think your goal is paying
the fine."

He was also very sensitive. I pondered over it for a while. Should I
negotiate here or overpower Gong Pildu? It might be possible if I used all
my power, but it wouldn't be easy to break through Gong Pildu's Armed
Zone. I needed to prepare to receive a big injury if I wanted to defeat the
turrets.

What should I do? There was a separate place where I had to use coins, so it
was impossible to increase my stats.

"I'm warning you that you shouldn't think of anything." Gong Pildu smiled
at me. His troops were surrounding Lee Hyunsung. He really moved
quickly.

I laughed and raised both hands. "Please calm down. Isn't it obvious for a
tenant to come to the landlord?"

"Is it for a room?"

"Yes. Please let my companions and I sit in your green zone"

This was a must. In order to clear the third scenario safely, we had to stay
in Gong Pildu's green zone. However, Gong Pildu's answer was as
expected. "No. The alliance doesn't accept outsiders. I'll think about it if
every person pays 500 coins a day."

500 coins a day? It was like selling coins. This was more expensive than the
Dokkaebi Bag.

"It is a bit tough, so I will give you information instead."
"What information?"

"Information about Yoo Joonghyuk."

'Yoo Joonghyuk'. The complexions of the landlords changed with that one
name.

"Yoo Joonghyuk? Yoo Joonghyuk caused such an uproar not long ago…"

"You bastard! What is your relationship with that guy?"

"Pildu-ssi! Isn't this bastard suspicious?"

There was a reaction. I thought that Yoo Joonghyuk would've already
caused a problem with the Landlord Alliance. In fact, I was a bit unsure
about this point. According to the original story, Yoo Joonghyuk of the
third regression should be fighting against the Landlord Alliance by now.
What was he doing? Gong Pildu stared at me with suspicious eyes. "What
is your relationship with Yoo Joonghyuk?"

"We are companions separated by life and death."

"…I don't think it is like that?"

"Anyway, we're friendly."

"How can I believe that?"

"Don't believe me. Don't you have nothing to lose?" I threw out the bait.

Perhaps Gong Pildu would have to accept my suggestion. It was because
right now, Yoo Joonghyuk was the only person who could threaten the
power balance in Chungmuro.

[The character 'Gong Pildu' has activated 'Profit Calculation Lv. 2!]

"Why won't I receive any loss?"
"…?"

"There is no guarantee that you aren't a scammer. I can't ignore my years of
experience. In my experience, people like you run away to avoid paying the
rent at the end of the month."

It was so accurate that I felt wronged. Still, it was difficult to push it here.
"If you don't believe me, it can't be helped. Maybe there will be damages."

Gong Pildu's expression became complicated. I turned around without
hesitation. It was important not to show any regret. That way, he would
regret it even more.

"Wait a minute." Indeed. "You have to pay the fine for intruding. Where are
you trying to flee to?"

It was another regret. Dammit. I turned around and smiled awkwardly.
"How much? 100 coins?"

"No, you and that kid are 1,000 coins."

The vein on my head bulged. Did this bastard think that 1,000 coins were
1,000 won…?

"That is too much."

The dokkaebi still hadn't given me my cut of the coins, but I couldn't give
1,000 coins to a jerk like Gong Pildu. Gong Pildu grinned. "Then you are
disqualified as tenants. Die."

I instinctively pushed through the men around me and ran to where my
party members were. There was the first sound of firing, and Lee Hyunsung
held up a metal shield, blocking my back. He was really reliable. Lee
Hyunsung's strength and physique were level 14, but he spoke very
nervously, "…Dokjassi."
I could clearly see his trembling arm muscles. Lee Hyunsung had yet to
obtain his second stigma, which meant he couldn't hold on against the
turrets. Moreover, there was no Jung Heewon. If I started a head to head
fight, someone in this party would surely die.

"Gong Pildu-ssi, wait a moment. If we fight then you won't escape any
damages."

"What?"

"It is better not to fight us now."

"Why?"

The damage had to be shown.

"If we fight now, you will die here."

Gong Pildu's expression hardened. Even if I didn't add anything, Gong
Pildu would've noticed the presence of the guy coming down the escalator
from B1. It would be strange if he didn't know considering the guy was
giving off such a huge momentum.

"My best companion is coming."

It was Yoo Joonghyuk. I didn't expect that damn regressor to be happy.

"Master, it's that person. He pretended to be Master's companion," Lee
Jihye cried out shrilly as she pointed at me. The main character, the lone
hero of a drama, was walking by her side. He looked at me with
impressively fierce eyes.

[The character 'Yoo Joonghyuk' is greatly disturbed.]
[Exclusive skill, Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint stage 2 has been

activated!] There was a brief moment of dizziness, and I started to hear his

thoughts.

「 How… Already? 」

I waved to him and said casually, "Hi Joonghyuk."

「······.」

"Have you been well? Your face looks good?"

「······.」

Lee Jihye and Gong Pildu looked at us like they couldn't believe it. They
never expected that I would be a companion of Yoo Joonghyuk. There was
a tight tension in the air.

"These people don't believe I am your companion. Can you tell them?"

Nevertheless, I knew Yoo Joonghyuk. This bastard killed easily but he kept
his promises.

[A few constellations are paying attention to character Yoo Joonghyuk's
answer.]

[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' is observing Yoo Joonghyuk's
loyalty.]

Moreover, the constellations were paying a lot of attention.

「······.」
Yoo Joonghyuk watched me and slowly opened his mouth. However, my
words were faster. "Ah, right. It would be better if you let me use the
bathroom!"

Finally, Yoo Joonghyuk pulled out a blade.




After a while, we safely used the bathroom and came down to the platform
of line 3. It was thanks to this fellow regressor companion. I smiled widely.
"It's nice to see you, you rascal."

"…You're alive."

In conclusion, Yoo Joonghyuk didn't call me his companion. He just
pointed his blade at Gong Pildu as his answer. Fortunately, Gong Pildu
didn't want to clash with us and let us go.

I asked, "Were you hoping I would be killed?"

"I thought it would be good."

This rotten companion…

I became angrier when I saw that cheeky face. It made me want to run over
and strike him in the jaw, but I couldn't do it.

It hadn't seemed that great in the novel. Yet, having seen it in person now, I
knew how extraordinary it was. We were about to enter the third scenario,
and Yoo Joonghyuk's total physical related stats were around 70.

'This crazy bastard'.

Dammit, this was the main character buff.

"Do you have anything to say?" Yoo Joonghyuk asked.
Yoo Joonghyuk's growth rate was steeper than it had been in the original
three regressions. The fact that his growth was so fast meant he was taking
great risks… What the hell was this person, who had only returned three
times, doing? Something was making me uneasy. I would have to dig it out
sooner or later…

"I asked if you had anything to say."

"No, I was just looking."

「 …He is more tenacious than I thought. 」

What tenacity? He had a serious chuuni disease.

「 However, being cheeky isn't good. Should I just kill him now? 」

"I'm joking." I laughed hurriedly. Yoo Joonghyuk turned his head like he
wasn't interested.

[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' is disappointed in
you.]

Anyway, I didn't want to alienate Yoo Joonghyuk right now. In order to
clear the multiple scenarios, Yoo Joonghyuk was a necessary person. Even
if we weren't real companions, it was worth using him thoroughly.

…Why did it sound like I was making excuses?

"It looks like you've obtained companions." Yoo Joonghyuk looked at the
people behind me with emotionless eyes.

[The character 'Yoo Joonghyuk' is a bit disappointed in you.]

'…What? Why?'

The answer was very clear.
[The character 'Yoo Joonghyuk' has used Sage's Eye Lv. 8!]

「 He picked up Lee Hyunsung but was only able to raise him to this level.
」

I was at a loss for a moment because it was true. Certainly, Lee Hyunsung's
growth would be better if he had moved with Yoo Joonghyuk.

'Still… this bastard'.

I was just an ordinary reader who had luckily gotten to know the future.

「 It is below expectations. 」

It seemed worse because I was hearing his words in my mind. At that
moment, Yoo Joonghyuk's eyes stopped as he was looking around. For the
first time, confusion could be seen in his eyes.

「…What is that? 」
                  Chapter 30: Ep. 7 – Landlord, III


Yoo Joonghyuk was looking at everyone except for Lee Hyunsung. The
three remaining people were standing together and I couldn't figure out
exactly who Yoo Joonghyuk was looking at.

「…How is this possible? 」

Who was he looking at? I wanted to ask but I was afraid that my skill
would be exposed. Yoo Joonghyuk still didn't know that I knew his
thoughts. However, I guessed that he might've seen the information of Jung
Heewon. Jung Heewon saw Yoo Joonghyuk's gaze and confronted him.
"What are you looking at?"

「······.」

Good job, Jung Heewon.

「 Kill… 」
"Yoo Joonghyuk."

I quickly opened my mouth, "I was wondering about one thing." He turned
to look at me. His eyes were questioning. "Why are you leaving Gong Pildu
alone?"

"If you are a prophet, you should know."

"I don't know everything."

To be exact, I didn't remember everything.

[The character 'Yoo Joonghyuk' has used the 'Lie Detection' skill.]

[The character Yoo Joonghyuk has confirmed that your words are

true.] He was thorough.

"…Indeed, I see. A prophet whose level of 'future sight' is low."

Think what you want. Yoo Joonghyuk continued speaking, "I need Gong
Pildu alive."

"Is it because of a future scenario?"

Yoo Joonghyuk didn't answer. It was like he was trying to gauge the
information I knew.

"I know that you need Gong Pildu for future scenarios. But you only need
Gong Pildu. You don't need the entire group that follows him."

「······.」

"Isn't it your style to remove what you don't need? Why are you just leaving
them?"
「…How annoying. 」

What?

"I have a lot to do." Yoo Joonghyuk stared at me quietly and said, "You
will never understand."

"Wait! That isn't the problem. If you don't move now, most of the humans
in Chungmuro will…!"

Yoo Joonghyuk's eyes were cold. "It doesn't matter."

I wasn't a humanist. I didn't believe that everyone in this world was worth
keeping alive. The thing that was making me angry right now was Yoo
Joonghyuk.

"Yoo Joonghyuk. Can I hit you?"

"If you have confidence."

I angrily formed a fist as I heard a message.

[The character Yoo Joonghyuk has used 'Strong Self-Defense Lv.

5'.] I dropped my fist. Cowardly bastard.

"Are you finished?" Yoo Joonghyuk asked.

"…"

"Let's go."

Lee Jihye flinched at Yoo Joonghyuk's call. Lee Jihye, who belated
following Yoo Joonghyuk, looked at me with confused eyes.

[The constellation 'Bald General of Justice' is impressed by your chivalrous
spirit.]
[100 coins have been sponsored.]

Of course, it was completely misleading.




[There are 1 hour and 30 minutes before the third scenario is activated.]
There wasn't much time left and my mind was complicated.

[The constellation 'Bald General of Justice' is angry that people's lives must
be risked.]

[The constellation 'Bald General of Justice' wants an uprising.]

Samyeongdang's message rang loudly in my head but he didn't think of a
good way to resolve it. The third scenario lasted exactly one week. Maybe
Yoo Joonghyuk was planning to gain some other advantage during the third
scenario. Of course, I couldn't let it go. I couldn't let it go…

[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' is wondering what
you are thinking.]

"That jerk Yoo Joonghyuk."

[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' is satisfied.]

[100 coins have been sponsored.]

In fact, the problem in front of me wasn't Yoo Joonghyuk but Gong Pildu.
In order to break through the third scenario, Gong Pildu's help was
absolutely necessary. If I couldn't get his help…

Suddenly, Jung Heewon looked up and smiled, "Who is it?"

"…Huh?"
"You know, that person. The one you were talking to Yoo Joonghyuk
about."

I immediately explained about Gong Pildu. Jung Heewon was unconscious
so she hadn't been able to see Gong Pildu. I didn't mean to change the
subject. Jung Heewon immediately reacted. "…What are these scum?
Taking the public facilities and making people pay to use them?"

"Those scum are upstairs."

"I'll go and throw them out." Jung Heewon picked up the ground rat blade.
That reminded me, I should change their weapons. There was a lot to be
done.

"Your actions are absurd."

"We can win if we join forces. Don't you remember Gumho Station?" Jung
Heewon's expression was confident. It was natural. Jung Heewon had the
Judgment Time skill as a trump card. She had good senses and was quick to
adapt, so she would've already figured out her attribute and skills.

"Don't dawdle! Let's go and kill them!"

As long as her opponents were 'wicked', her Judgment Time boasted the
highest power.

[The character 'Jung Heewon' has activated the exclusive skill 'Judgment
Time'.]

[Constellations of the Absolute Good system are silent at Jung Heewon's
request.]

[The skill has been cancelled.]
Jung Heewon's face filled with confusion. "No, this…what? Is it broken?"
Jung Heewon tried to activate the skill again. However, the skill wasn't
triggered. "No…why isn't it activating? Aren't they obviously wicked?"

I laughed at Jung Heewon's question. "That is what we humans think."

"…What are you talking about?"

"The constellations might be different. There is no guarantee that the good
and evil they know is like what we know."

"Ah…"

"Justice is always decided by the majority."

Right now, the majority of constellations have decided that they are 'good'.
Humans no longer had the right to decide on justice. Humans were just the
puppets of their sponsors.

"That…"

I looked at the party members. Everyone didn't say anything but they
thought in a similar way to Jung Heewon. Lee Hyunsung wiped the iron
shield that was scratched by the magic bullets, while Yoo Sangah and Lee
Gilyoung sat next to each other on the ground, looking at cockroaches.

This sense of despair, I could understand. They thought they understood
after getting rid of the gang at Gumho Station. However, there was an
incomparable monster just three stations away. It was time to start the
torture known as hope.

"That doesn't mean there is no way."

"Huh?"

"It might be difficult but there is a way to defeat them."
They simultaneously looked at me. Lee Hyunsung asked, "…Do you really
have a way?"

"What is it?"

I looked around and lowered my voice. "Get Gong Pildu out of the Armed
Zone."

"What is the Armed Zone?"

"His stigma. It is optimized to defend an area."

Armed Zone. The reason why it was difficult to go against Gong Pildu was
this stigma. It was a fraudulent ability that could build 'turrets' in an area.
Right now, it was just Armed Zone. Once the stigma evolved in the future,
it would become 'Armed Fortress' and a siege needed to be prepared to
catch him. However, Gong Pildu had an obvious weakness.

"His Armed Zone will be released as soon as he leaves his designated area.
His mini-turrets will also become useless. Usually, there are many
restrictions on such a wide defense skill."

At the same time, Lee Hyunsung and Jung Heewon looked at me with
admiration.

"Ah…I see."

"You figured this out after seeing it once? Is this Dokja-ssi's attribute?"

The same thing was repeated but I saw that the people had adapted to me to
some extent. Yoo Sangah asked, "Then how will you make him move?"

"We have to think about that for now."

"Ah, I hate thinking." Jung Heewon complained.
Then everyone was silent for a while. It was Lee Hyunsung who gave his
idea first. "Attack when he goes to the bathroom…"

"Didn't you see the things next to the bench?"

Gong Pildu never moved out of his Armed Zone. His bench had everything
he needed. There were all the basics to eat and sleep: a sleeping bag,
blanket, food, water, and even a place to piss. Of course, the tenants
provided him with all of it.

"Crazy. He is a complete shut in. No, is he not moving because he is hiding
something good on the land?"

"It is the biggest 'room' in Chungmuro."

"…Room?"

That reminds me, Jung Heewon still didn't know about the rooms. But there
was no need for me to explain.

[There is 1 hour before the third scenario is activated.]

She would son find out.

"We also need to find a room."

The moment our party got up, the people around us flinched.

"D-D-Don't come closer!"

In particular, the man with a knife who was protecting a single person room
on the No. 3 line platform showed high vigilance. However, other people
rushed towards him before we could approach.

"Get out, your fucker!"
They attacked indiscriminately. As soon as the man was pushed out, the
mark on the green zone changed. The owner had changed.

[Green Zone 1/1-> Green Zone 0/1].

The people were engaging in a bloody fight over the room. Someone was
stabbed in the thigh while someone had their nose broken. Jung Heewon
frowned. "Shouldn't we stop that?"

"Even if we intervene, the result will be the same. In the end, somebody
will die."

"Why does someone have to die?"

"It isn't possible to avoid in this scenario."

I had just finished speaking when Bihyung emerged in the air.

[Now now, shall we start the third day of the main scenario? New faces
have arrived today so won't it be fun? Hahaha!]

Bihyung glanced my way. There were three dokkaebis in charge of the
Chungmuro scenario. It seemed that Bihyung was temporarily the
representative. It was a natural consequence of being the smallest of the
three channels. Then the third scenario arrived in front of us.
  [Main Scenario #3 – Green Zone (Day 3)]

  Category: Main

  Difficulty: C

  Clear Conditions: Occupy the 'green zone' in the station and survive the
  monsters that emerge every night at midnight. This scenario will last 7
  days.

  Duration: 8 hours.

  Compensation: 1,000 coins

  Failure: ―


Lee Hyunsung's eyes widened.

"T-This…!"

[It is simple. Occupy the green zone before other people. Of course, you
can take away the green zone of others. By the way, you should hurry. If
you don't have a green zone after the scenario starts, you will have a terrible
experience. Haha, then everyone should try it!]

People's expressions hardened as they heard Bihyung's words. In the
meantime, the screams of the people continued.

"Die! Die!"

"I-I'm not doing this because I have a grudge! I must survive…"
Maybe this was what everyone realized. The struggle in front of us was no
longer a story. Yoo Sangah asked in a trembling voice, "Surely we don't
have to fight like these people?"

"We don't need to fight. Just find a room that can accommodate a large
number of people."

"The size of the green zones vary by type. It ranged from fitting only one
person to fitting 70 people like Gong Pildu's area."

"Of course, if there are any rooms left."

Jung Heewon opened her mouth at my words. "Dokja-ssi is really talented
at making people uneasy… then let's move right away. Maybe there are
some rooms left."

"It might be faster to split up. Divide the team. Hyunsung-ssi will move
with
Sangah-ssi, while Heewon-ssi should take Gilyoung."

"Dokja-ssi?"

"I'm fine on my own."

I didn't have to say anything else. Everyone trusted me. Lee Gilyoung
spoke first, "Hyung, that…what if we can't find one?"

"If we can't find a room, then 20 minutes before the scenario starts, we will
gather here again."

"I understand. Then I'm going."

The team scattered in an orderly fashion. Jung Heewon and Lee Gilyoung
went to B2 while Yoo Sangah and Lee Hyunsung went to B3. I watched my
companions leave before turning on my smartphone. As soon as I opened
Ways of Survival, a sentence immediately popped up.
「 There were no rooms left in Chungmuro. 」

This fact was written clearly. It was likely that they wouldn't be able to find
any rooms. Then they could only choose one way. In order to survive, kill
someone else and take their room. But could Lee Hyunsung and Jung
Heewon do it? Not everyone here was 'wicked'. There were some who
exploited others, like Gong Pildu. But in fact, most of them bared their
teeth in order to protect themselves.

Could Yoo Sangah and Lee Gilyoung bare their teeth at people like that? I
would know the answer very soon.
                   Chapter 31: Ep. 7 – Landlord, IV


After the dokkaebi disappeared, dozens of casualties appeared on the
platform of line 3.

Currently, there was only one room on the line 3 platform.

There was no one strong here, so the weak didn't back down and attacked
each other.

"Die! Die!"

[There are 30 minutes before the third scenario is activated.]

As pandemonium occurred around me, I was quietly reading Ways of
Survival. Perhaps today's scenario would flow as I thought. In order to
survive, I couldn't miss a single word.

[What are you doing now?]
Along with Bihyung's words, I could hear the messages of the
constellations. [The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' is
wondering what you are doing.]

I reflexively turned off my smartphone. There was something I hadn't
thought of until now. Why didn't the constellations respond when I read
Ways of Survival?

In the original Ways of Survival, the constellations discovered that Yoo
Joonghyuk was a regressor and raised questions about fairness. It was
normal for them to say something about the text I was reading.

[What are you doing right now with a blank notepad? All the
constellations are going crazy with frustration because of you!] …Blank
notepad?

I turned on the smartphone again. Ways of Survival appeared on the screen.

"Is this what you are referring to?"

[Yes! What are you going to do with that notepad? You will die if you
stay still! Ha, I believed in a guy like this and sighed a contract…] I got
goosebumps.

The dokkaebi couldn't read this 'text'. If even the dokkaebis, which
managed the system, couldn't read it then the constellations were the same.

Then the writer who gave me the text…what type of existence was he?

"Kuaack!"

The last scream rang out. Finally, the owner of the room on platform line 3
was determined.

[Green Zone 1/1]
"…Don't come any closer."

A boy was pointing a knife at me. Surprisingly, the winner was the boy
who guided us earlier. I still didn't know his name.

"Don't worry, I won't take your room."

I spoke in order to reassure the boy. The moment I had this thought.

"Really? You are quite relaxed ahjussi. Do you want to

die?" I didn't need to look back to see who was talking.

"It looks like you are quite free."

"Nobody touches my room. I will send everyone who touches it to hell."

Lee Jihye twirled a deep blue blade round and round. In regards to specs,
there was no one who could match Lee Jihye apart from Yoo Joonghyuk or
people from the Landlord Alliance. Lee Jihye watched me carefully and
opened her mouth.

"I don't want ahjussi to die. You were quite impressive against Master
earlier."

"Don't worry, I won't die. It won't die even if I don't find a room."

It was true. I wouldn't necessarily die if I couldn't find a room. There was
an impossible man in this station who proved this. It was only three days
ago.

Lee Jihye's eyes narrowed.

"Ahjussi, do you know what you are saying right now?"

"Yes."
"Ahjussi, are you strong? As strong as Master?"

Then Yoo Joonghyuk appeared behind Lee Jihye.

"Stop and go back to your room."

"Ah…yup. Master."

Lee Jihye obediently left and Yoo Joonghyuk turned towards me.

"Are you going to fight the monsters?"

I shrugged.

"You will die. Your four companions as well."

"That remains to be seen."

There was an unknown emotion in Yoo Joonghyuk's eyes as he glanced at
me and left. I didn't use Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint. It wasn't always
possible to expression emotions with words.

[There are 20 minutes before the third scenario is activated.]

There was the sound of people coming down the stairs. Lee Hyunsung, Lee
Gilyoung and Yoo Sangah… looking at their dark expressions, the result
was as I expected. Yoo Sangah opened her mouth with a gloomy
expression.

"Room…there were non.:

"It is okay. Rather, where is Heewon-ssi?"

"She is trying to negotiate upstairs."

At these words, Jung Heewon jumped down with a terrible scream.
"One night is 2,000 coins? Are they joking right now? I am really going to
hit them."

The agitated Jung Heewon snorted and said.

"Dokja-ssi. Do you know what is happening upstairs? No―"

"They suddenly raised the taxes right?"

"Eh…you already know?"

It was predictable. The tenants would die if they couldn't get a room in 20
minutes. It was no wonder that the owners would take the initiative to raise
the taxes.

"Did Dokja-ssi find anything?"

"No, I didn't."

"Ah…"

I examined their faces one by one. In the end, the time to choose had come.

"I have two ways."

The eyes of the party members shone at these words. But my methods
would probably betray their expectations. "The first way is easy for all of us
to live." Jung Heewon's eyes narrowed.

"Usually it is the second method… what is the other one?"

"The second method is very difficult. It is likely that some of us will die."

"Eh…that can't happen. Then I will choose the first way."

"What do the others think?"
Lee Hyunsung responded first.

"The first method will be good if everyone can live."

Lee Gilyoung nodded. Only Yoo Sangah hesitated.

"…Can I hear what it is?"

I nodded and lead them up the stairs to transit line 4.

"This is the first method."

The party members looked at where I pointed. There was a group of five
men and women shaking.

[Green Zone 5/5]

"They room they occupy has exactly five spaces. But their individual
abilities isn't that high. Honestly, if the five of us…"

"Wait, Dokja-ssi―"

"Yes, kill them and take their room."

Their trembling increased at my calm voice. Jung Heewon made a deeply
wounded expression.

"…Who doesn't know about this method?"

"If hyung says so, I can do it."

Lee Gilyoung spoke first.

"I'm not afraid. I will do it."

"No Gilyoung!"
Yoo Sangah grabbed Lee Gilyoung's shoulder. I deliberately looked
uncaring.

"They would've also killed someone to take that room. Honestly, we can't
overcome future scenarios if we can't do this."

"Dokja-ssi." Jung Heewon interrupted. "I killed people at Gumho Station.
I killed because I wanted to and I don't regret it. But." Jung Heewon had a
pained expression on her face.

"Just because I am a murderer doesn't mean I want to keep killing. I don't
want to be a monster.

"…"

"…Dokja-ssi, I would like to know about the second method."

I closed my eyes for a moment at Lee Hyunsung's words.

"I understand your thoughts."

Yes, this was enough.

"Let's go the second way."

The expressions of the party members seemed to brighten. In fact, I was
going to use the second method from the beginning.

Killing was an easy way to survive, but I could never attract the attention of
the constellations if I chose the easy method.

However, the second method required considerable determination. It wasn't
just me but everyone. Thus, I needed to check their determination. I had to
know what these people were really thinking.

Jung Heewon laughed.
"…I thought so. Why are you talking when you were going to go with the
second way?"

"I wasn't trying to test you. Whatever choice you made, I would've
respected
it."

I stroked Lee Gilyoung's head, who was looking up at me with uneasy eyes.
Yoo Sangah sighed and opened her mouth.

"Dokja-ssi is really spiteful."

"I'm sorry I'm not a good person."

"What is the second method?"

"There is no need to kill anybody with this method. But it is very difficult."

At my heavy tone, the expressions of the party members became
determined. "If you choose the second method, please unconditionally
follow my instructions. Please trust me, even if it doesn't make sense. If one
person doesn't trust me―"

"…"

"We will all die."

Someone gulped. The party members nodded almost simultaneously. Lee
Hyunsung said.

"I believe in Dokja-ssi. I have survived up to here because of Dokja-ssi."

[There are 5 minutes before the third scenario is activated.]

"Then follow me."
I moved with the party members along railway line 3. We passed through
the broken screen door and stood at the entrance of the tunnel leading to
Euljiro3.

Inside the dark tunnel, I saw a glowing 'red zone'. Perhaps the monsters
would be created over there. They would sweep over line 3 and go up each
floor towards the ground.

Lee Hyunsung asked nervously.

"…Then are we fighting the monsters here?"

"No, we aren't fighting. If we fight here then we will die."

It wasn't possible to fight against the terrifying monsters and survive until
dawn without the green zone.

This time, Jung Heewon asked.

"…Then will we run towards the Dongdae area?"

"That won't work. Once the scenario is activated, we will automatically die
if we leave Chungmuro."

"Then…"

"This operation needs to be shared. Lee Hyunsung-ssi, Yoo Sangah-ssi and
Jung Heewon-ssi. Once the monsters appear, run straight in the direction
they are coming from."

"…Huh?"

"Understood? Just run towards them. Just before you encounter them, be
sure to look at the left wall. Then you will know that I mean."

The people didn't understand my words but there was no time to explain to
them.
"Just trust me or you will die. Don't forget to look at the left wall."

"I understand Dokja-ssi." Yoo Sangah seemed to understand what I meant
and answered first.

"I am telling you in person. You must run after the monster appears."

I picked up a stone and threw it towards the tunnel. Then stone sparked as it
hit something and fell. Lee Hyunsung and Jung Heewon nodded as if they
understood.

"What about Dokja-ssi?"

"I'll find another way with Gilyoung."

This method couldn't be used unless my party members believed in me.
Who would go against common sense and commit a suicide attack by
rushing towards the monsters?

The only thing left was their determination.

[The third main scenario is enabled.]

The barrier that was blocking the tunnel to Euljiro-3 disappeared.

"Run!"

The three people started running the moment I called out.

Grrr!

The monsters started to be created in the red zone. It was mainly the grade
9 ground rats. Then the middle ranks were filled with the intermediate
grade 9 underground species, the 'groll'.

Kuooooh!
A monster with a black mane that was in the shape of a bear. The sharp
horns on their foreheads was threatening.

One was relatively easy to deal with. The problem was the number. The
crowded columns was already not suitable to be called a 'group'. We would
die if we hit that wave.

The moment Lee Hyunsung encountered the first groll, I shouted.

"Now!"

Yoo Sangah found it first. Green tiles shimmering on the wall.

"Ah―!"

The enlightenment was instant The moment Yoo Sangah's hand touched the
wall, it emitted a bright light.

[Green Zone 1/3]

The agile Jung Heewon immediately touched the wall behind her.

[Green Zone 2/3]

However, Lee Hyunsung missed the timing. It was because the ground rats
clung to Lee Hyunsung's shield.

"Hyunsung-ssi! Catch it!"

Lee Hyunsung grabbed the 'thread' that Yoo Sangah threw him. Thanks
to the strength of the two women, Lee Hyunsung flew through the air
and reached the wall. [Green Zone 3/3] Good.

Grrrrrrr!
The monsters stared at them but once they entered the green zones, the
monsters couldn't attack.

"Dokja-ssi!"

Yoo Sangah called out to me but there was no time to look back. I was
already running with Lee Gilyoung on my back.

「 …In the third main scenario, there are several hidden green zones. This
is activated on a specific wall and the green zones on the wall won't appear
until after the scenario starts… if you think about it, humans were the ones
who thought of it as the concept of a 'room'. 」

In Ways of Survival, Yoo Joonghyuk went through numerous regressions
and found some secret green zones in Chungmuro.

On the platform of line 3, there were two such green zones.

Kiiiiit!

A few ground rats chasing after me bit me in the thigh. The blow wasn't big
because of my high strength, but these small things could accumulate.

Kwack!

Lee Gilyoung hit a few ground rats with a blunt weapon from his position
on my back. But there were too many of them. In addition, the groll were
fast.

A dozen meters away, the boy was looking at me with terrified eyes.

[Green Zone 1/1]

It was cowardly but I was tempted to take the easy road for a second.

[Hahahaha! This situation is fun. Then like yesterday, should there be a
penalty?]
A dokkaebi spoke followed by the system messages.

[A scenario penalty has been added!]

[Some existing green zones will be disabled.]

"N-No! Uack, aaaaack!"

Screams rang through Chungmuro Station. The closest scream came from
the boy.

Kwajijijik!

"Aaaaack!"

As soon as the green zone disappeared, the boy's small body was shredded
by the ground rats.

Thanks to the boy's body buying time, I was able to run into the passage.
However, the monsters that came from beyond the broken screen door
blocked the path.

I hid Lee Gilyoung behind me and pulled out Unbroken Faith. The blade of
Purest Sword Force quickly pushed back the incoming monsters.

But the numbers didn't go down at all. The person who fought with these
monsters until sunrise, Yoo Joonghyuk was a monster. I wasn't sure it was
possible for me, even if I changed all my coins to stats.

At this moment, Lee Gilyoung spoke.

"Hyung, you know."

"Don't talk now. I'm busy."

"You can just leave me here."
"…What?"

"I really don't understand it. Why are you helping me, Hyunsung hyung and
the noonas? If you are alone… you would be able to survive better."

He could calmly speak such words before his death. Maybe this kid's mind
was already dead.

"Yes, you are right." Another ground rat fell to the ground with its head cut
off. "It is comfortable to live alone, eat alone and survive alone. But…"

Why was I acting this way? If anyone asked me, I couldn't exactly explain.
But I could say one thing with certainty.

"I know one novel that developed in such a way and was ruined."

"Huh?"

I thought it every time but I wasn't a protagonist. I wouldn't be a hero or a
savior. But…

Lee Gilyoung's eyes were shaking. I lifted him onto my back again and
said.

"Hold on tight."

I wouldn't let Lee Gilyoung die. At least, not today.
                   Chapter 32: Ep. 7 – Landlord, V


As I watched the surging wave of monsters, I gave strength to my thighs.
The level 15 strength condensed at once and my feet developed a strong
propulsion force.

The ground rats ran from all directions and the hard horns of the grolls flew
from unexpected places.

My skin, which was tempered by the level 15 physique, became bruised
and bloody from the grolls' horns.

[The number one bookmark has been activated.]

Bookmark was activated and Kim Namwoon's Blackening wrapped around
my body. I pushed away all the monsters coming from the front.

Fangs burrowed into my body and a few ground rats bit my thighs.
However, I didn't stop. Run and run again.
Over here. Finally, the original wall was visible. I jumped over the ground
rats. There was a green zone for two people shining.

By the way…shit.

[Green Zone 1/2]

There was already someone inside.

"…"

I forgot about the monsters coming from behind and stared at him. There
was a guy who should never be there.

"Hey."

He turned to me.

"Can't you get out? You don't even need to stay in here."

"It is difficult. I am tired today."

I pushed to punch this asshole's face. I didn't understand. This wasn't the
'third regression' Yoo Joonghyuk that I knew.

In Ways of Survival, it was written that Yoo Joonghyuk only found the first
hidden green zone in the fourth regression… damn, did he know about this
place since the second regression and it just wasn't described? Then why
didn't he originally use it in the third regression?

Grrrr!

There were the cries of the ground rats chasing me from behind. It was too
late to blame the writer. I could feel Lee Gilyoung's breathing. I stared into
Yoo Joonghyuk's eyes. We spoke at almost the same time.

"Take the kid."
"Give me the child."

Still, it was lucky. The constellations would hear my words.

[Green Zone 2/2]

I moved Lee Gilyoung and the mark of the green zone changed. Now Lee
Gilyoung was safe.

"Hyung! Wait a minute! Hyung!"

Lee Gilyoung urgently tried to rush towards me but Yoo Joonghyuk's hand
restrained him. I swung my sword towards the ground rats.

[The constellation 'Bald General of Justice' has closed his eyes.]

[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' is watching you with
uncomfortable eyes.]

At the last minute, Yoo Joonghyuk's eyes seemed to move.

「 I told you that you would die. 」

The waves of monsters headed towards me. Now there were no more green
zones remaining.

"I won't die."

I ignored the monsters and put a hand in my pocket. In fact, I really didn't
want to use this. I couldn't be assured that there would be no aftereffects.
Now I had to believe in the Fourth Wall.

「 That…? 」

Yoo Joonghyuk's eyes shook with surprise. This bastard, did he find out?
Well, I wouldn't have known this method without him.
I looked down at the white stone shining in the palm of my hand.

[Specter's Stone.]

It was an item I gained by hunting specters on the way to Chungmuro.

Hundreds of ground rats started biting at my body.

I was bleeding from minor wounds and the shoulders struck by the grolls'
horns were red with blood. As the durability of my body rapidly
diminished, I put the stone into my mouth.

Then something like water vapor started to emerge from my mouth. The
water vapor formed a fog that covered me.

[The Welcome Prison is activated.]

The ground rats and grolls stopped attacking me at once.

Everything around me started to distort. The platform, Yoo Joonghyuk and
Lee Gilyoung calling out to me.

I became a 'ghost'.




「 Dokja. 」

I noticed as soon as I heard my mother's voice. This was a dream.

I tried not to get caught up in it but it wasn't easy this time. The floor sank
like a quagmire and swallowed me.

[Due to excessive immersion, the influence of Fourth Wall has temporarily
weakened.]
Scenes started to weave in front of me, no matter what I wanted.

A living room covered with blood. The cold body of a man. The back of a
woman looking down at the body. No. This memory was difficult to
remember. I couldn't remember it.

I shook my head furiously and the scene in front of me scattered. This damn
trauma…

It was a memory I didn't want to see.

This was why I was reluctant to eat the Specter's Stone. The Specter's Stone
temporarily made the user a 'ghost' and turned them invisible to monsters.
But it has a side effect of causing the user's trauma to peak.

That's why I didn't give it to the other party members. If it had been used by
someone other than myself, they might've turned into a madman.

·····.

I had to endure, even if my head was hurting like crazy.

Certainly, the Fourth Wall was a scam. The skill would even be able to eat
away at this stone. I wouldn't see this effect even with the superior 'Mental
Barrier'. Where was it? If my guess was correct, this skill…

「 Yoo Joonghyuk? Are you Yoo Joonghyuk? 」

I thought a trauma had started again but it wasn't my voice. It wasn't a voice
created by my memories. I looked back and saw a strange woman.

「 …You aren't Yoo Joonghyuk. I think you are Korean but who are you?
」

A dazzling blonde foreigner. She was a little girl with a short height. The
girl looked at me for a long time with an incomprehensible expression.
「 That…I don't understand. I've seen the future a number of times but I've
never seen you before… 」

In the girl's left eye, an ominous red swirl could be seen. The pages flashed
in my head. I knew this person. No, there was absolutely no way I couldn't
know her. In this case…

  6, Lie Detection Lv. 7, Great Demon's Eyes Lv. 1…


A woman who could ignore space constraints and freely enter the
consciousness of other people. A woman who saw the future and tried to
design the future of the world. There was only one 'woman' with such a
way of thinking in Ways of Survival. "Anna Croft."

「 …How do you know me? 」

Her eyes widened and she glared at me.
I replied quietly, "I'm a prophet."

[The character Anna Croft has triggered Lie Detection Lv. 7.]

[Lie Detection has confirmed that your words are false.]

Indeed, I couldn't lie to a true prophet.

「 …Reveal your true identity. Who are you? 」

Her small lips were tightly closed. It looked as though she was protesting.

I anticipated how the situation would roughly occur. The woman noticed
my presence, perhaps because the influence of Fourth Wall temporarily
weakened. If Fourth Wall was really the skill I thought it was… By the
way… it was disappointing.

"Do you really not know who I am?"

「 …Huh? 」

"Didn't I send you the ichthyosaur's core?"

Anna's lips slowly widened.

"You must've implanted the 'great demon's eyes' with the power of the core.
Right?"

「 T-Then you? You asked for Broken Faith…? 」

[Great Demon's Eyes.] It was a huge one million coin item that was taken
by this woman with a damn diamond sponsor. I felt envious.

「 You! What is your name? How… 」

[The influence of the exclusive skill 'Fourth Wall' is slowly returning.]
「 Why… why can't I see anything…? 」

Her eyes became blurred. The influence of the Great Demon's Eyes, which
could interfere with the consciousness of others, weakened and her figured
gradually faded. I waved my hands.

"Someday we will meet. Wait across the continent."

[The exclusive skill Fourth Wall has been completely restored.]

Anna completely disappeared.

I sighed with relief. In fact, my spirit had been fluctuating back and forth
when talking to Anna Croft. It wasn't very good.

[Due to the skill effect, immunity to Welcome Prison has occurred.]

…Dammit, the effect took place too late.

I felt my consciousness clear up.

The discomfort still remained but it was much better than before. I took a
deep breath and slowly exhaled. I looked at the distinct facts one by one in
order to regain my rationality.

I am Kim Dokja. The world was destroyed. Ways of Survival had become
reality. This was…Welcome Prison. I ate the Specter's Stone and was a
ghost for a while. If I was a ghost, I wouldn't be attacked by the
underground species.

Yes, that's right. So… the world looked like this.

In the midst of the landscape that seemed like I had eaten drugs, the flow of
time was hardly noticeable. I became a bit uneasy.

What happened to Yoo Sangah, Lee Hyunsung and Jung Heewon? That
Joonghyuk bastard, did he kill Gilyoung? Was the third scenario still in
progress? What if there were still ground rats around? Were the grolls
circling in order to eat me?

If so…

…Hyung.

…Please.

…Dokja-ssi!

Voices flashed through my head.

[The exclusive skill 'Evil Destroying Skill Lv. 1' is activated.]

Yes, it was time to go back.




I breathed out roughly. There was a soft texture touching my cheek.

"Dokja-ssi!"

The fog faded and my vision became clear. The first thing that I saw was
Yoo Sangah's face. Lee Hyunsung and Jung Heewon's worried faces also
appeared.

"…The scenario?"

"It ended Dokja-ssi. We did it. We did it!"

…I see. We did it.

I looked at the agitated party members and tried to move my body. I had
remained stiff for a long time and my muscles barely listened to me.
"Don't be…pleased."

"Huh?"

"Only one day has passed. Yesterday was the third day…"

Lee Hyunsung caught me as I tried to get up.

"Dokja-ssi! It isn't possible. You haven't slept at all."

"What time is it now?"

"It is 8:30 a.m. 30 minutes have passed since the scenario ended."

8:30… fortunately, not too much time passed. By the way, there was a face
missing.

"Where is Gilyoung?"

"Ah, Gilyoung…"

Before Jung Heewon spoke, I already discovered where Jung Heewon was.
Lee Jihye and Yoo Joonghyuk were looking down at Lee Gilyoung a few
steps away.

…No, what was that bastard Yoo Joonghyuk doing?

At this moment, I remembered how Yoo Joonghyuk was surprised when he
saw my party. Don't tell me, when Yoo Joonghyuk used Sage's Eye…?

"When… you have chosen? Obvious never…before."

Due to the aftereffects of using the stone, Yoo Joonghyuk's voice wasn't
heard properly. Then Lee Gilyoung started talking.

"It is okay."
"…You really won't go with me?"

"Yes."

"You can become much stronger with me than with him. You still won't
go?"

"Yes. I won't."

"…Stupid kid."

Yoo Joonghyuk frowned and looked my way.

[Exclusive skill, Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint stage 2 has been
activated!]

「 …Lucky guy. He will be helpful so let's keep him a little longer.」

I wanted to say something but I had no energy in my body.

"Dokja hyung!"

Once he discovered that I woke up, Lee Gilyoung rushed towards me with
swollen eyes. Yoo Joonghyuk's thoughts still rang in my head.

「 There is no time to delay. I have to finish the attack today. Otherwise..」

…Attack? What was he talking about?

I had to think… Damn, I'm too tired. As I relaxed my body, the softness of
the thigh I was lying on touched my cheek again.

"Yoo Sangah-ssi…"

"Y-Yes!"

"Sorry, I'm going to sleep a bit…"
Then I fell sleep. It was a sweet sleep without any dreams.




I woke up two hours later.

[Hey, how long are you going to sleep?]

I opened my eyes at the loud and unpleasant voice. This time, the texture
against my cheek was much thicker and harder than before.

"…Ah, Dokja-ssi woke up."

Smiling lips. Jung Heewon was looking down at me.

"Yoo Sangah-ssi took a break. We didn't sleep well last night."

I turned my head and saw Yoo Sangah sleeping against a wall. Jung
Heewon smiled.

"By the way, is Lee Hyunsung's thigh comfortable?"

I turned and saw Lee Hyunsung drooling.


"Today in the morning… the on-call officer will conduct the duties…"

…I thought the height of the pillow wasn't right. It turned out to be Lee
Hyunsung's thigh. It was an army pillow with a bloody smell.

"Dokja hyung…"

I felt a heavy feeling on my stomach and looked down to see Lee Gilyoung
leaning against me and sleeping.

The moment I carefully raised my body, I heard Bihyung's voice.
[Haha, you are awake? Then take this.]

Messages poured into my ears.

[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' is sad about your trauma.]

[The constellation 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' is interested in your past.]

[The constellation 'Secretive Plotter' is wondering about your mother.]

[Constellations have sponsored you 1,800 coins.]

…Sons of a bitches. They were trying to steal a peek at my past.

This wasn't the end.

[You have endured Chungmuro's night without the green zone.]

[You have accomplished the 'Never-ending Dawn' achievement at
Chungmuro Station!]

[You have earned 1,000 coins as an achievement reward.]

[Coins Possessed: 22,650 C]

I had achieved the target amount. I didn't experience a hard night for
nothing.

This time Jung Heewon asked. "What should we do today? Like
yesterday…"

"No, not today. That only works for one day."

Of course, if we were lucky then we might be able to find the randomly
generated green zone. Unfortunately, there was no detailed description of
the location of the green zones on day four in Ways of Survival.
"Then…"

Jung Heewon's expression became dark. But it was unnecessary worry.

"Today we will completely end the third scenario."

"Huh?"

I carefully laid Lee Gilyoung and got up.

It wasn't originally planned but I couldn't wait after hearing Yoo
Joonghyuk's thoughts. Yesterday, he had no choice but to buy time.
However, the story was different today.

"I will drag out the land owners.

"…How?"

Jung Heewon asked and I looked at Lee Hyunsung, who was sleeping
deeply.

"I have to use the secret weapon that I saved."

Now it was time to change the owner of Chungmuro.
                Chapter 33: Ep. 8 – Emergency Defense, I


「 Lee Hyunsung was dozing like an officer on duty, 」

Perhaps there would be such a description in Ways of Survival. And maybe
there was this sentence.

「 Maybe Lee Hyunsung didn't know. What would happen to him today. 」

"Hyunsung-ssi?"

"…Ah, hmm, I fell asleep for a moment. Dokja-ssi, are you well rested?"

"Yes, I'm fine. By the way, you were talking. Officer on duty…"

"Eh, really?"

"Something about Second Class Soldier Lee Hyunsung…"

Lee Hyunsung's face turned red.
"T-That… Just a trauma from my days as a soldier."

"Days as a soldier? Isn't Lee Hyunsung an officer?"

"That…I was transferred to the third unit when I was a corporal."

"I heard these cases are rare. You must've been well-suited for the army."

Lee Hyunsung laughed. It was a laugh that I could understand. There were
few people well-suited for the army. The people who remained didn't fit
elsewhere.

Then it was time to throw a small stone.

"Still, I'm glad that Lee Hyunsung-ssi is here.

"Huh?"

"I'm relieved when Lee Hyunsung-ssi blocks in front. It feels like someone
is protecting me."

"…Is that so?"

Lee Hyunsung smiled slightly. It was a weak smile, but it was certainly a
comforting smile. After exchanging brief greetings, I separated from Lee
Hyunsung.

In the original third round development of Ways of Survival, Lee
Hyunsung experienced a character evolution by protecting the people at
Gumho Station from the Cheoldoo Group. But Jung Heewon took that
chance.

Now Yoo Sangah, Jung Heewon and Lee Gilyoung were approaching me. I
faced them.
"Did you see the demonstration? Just do what I did."

"Yes. Well…pretty much. But why do we have to do

this?" There was a reason for it.

[The character 'Lee Hyunsung' has started to feel responsible.]

Lee Hyunsung was currently wiping his shield with an innocent expression.

Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint was a scam. At least, as far as 'characters'
went.

"I want to help Hyunsung-ssi. He looks a bit down these days. Won't he feel
better if you cheer him up?"

I said this for Lee Hyunsung's sake. The innocent Yoo Sangah nodded her
head.

"Is it the saying 'dance like a while at praise?'"

"It is similar."

"I understand. I'll give it a try!"

Unlike Yoo Sangah, Jung Heewon had an uncertain expression.

"Dokja-ssi."

"Yes."

"Dokja-ssi's sponsor isn't something like 'One-Eyed Fortuneteller', right?"

"…What is that?"

"You don't know?"
Well, there was something like this. For a moment, I thought that Jung
Heewon might be the writer of Ways of Survival. For example, Gung Ye
was the 'One-Eyed Maitreya'.

"It isn't that. I have a special skill. It is a skill that understands people well."

"…I don't know if I want to ask, so I won't."

"Thank you."

"But have you ever used it on me?"

I almost showed emotions on my face. It was fortunate that Jung Heewon
didn't have Lie Detection. I looked at Lee Gilyoung and said.

"I only use it on men."

"Oh my."

It wasn't a lie. I haven't read Jung Heewon's heart. So far.

"Anyway, I am asking everyone to do this. First is Jung Heewon-ssi, then
Yoo Sangah and Gilyoung is last. Please take it in turns to speak to him."

"'Oh my, I really believe in Hyunsung-ssi!' That type of feeling?"

"Please don't go so far."

"Sigh, I am really going to die."

Still, she needed to do it. In order for this plan to succeed, Lee Hyunsung's
'attribute evolution' was absolutely necessary. I would've planned a bit
sooner if I knew Yoo Joonghyuk would act like this… but if we tried hard,
I should be able to see the result today.

In fact, they seemed to be doing well.
"Hyunsung-ssi is really dependable. You are like a pine tree."

"Haha, thank you Heewon-ssi. My favourite song is Green Pine."

[The character 'Lee Hyunsung' feels proud.]

"I didn't ask."

[The character 'Lee Hyunsung' feels a bit sullen.]

"I don't think I've seen a righteous person like Hyunsung-ssi."

"Ah… that isn't the case. Still, thank you. Yoo Sangah-ssi."

[The character 'Lee Hyunsung' has started to worry about justice.]
"Hyunsung hyung has the best muscles."

"Thank you, everyone."

[The character 'Lee Hyunsung' has increased his self-esteem.]

It was fortunate that Lee Hyunsung was a simple person and such empty
praises worked well. After repeating the same conversation several times
like this, the system messages started to change.

[The character 'Lee Hyunsung' is waiting for a chance to evolve his
attribute.]

Okay. It went smoothly.

Yoo Sangah asked in a slightly worried tone. "But I think Hyunsung-ssi is a
bit burdened…"

Yoo Sangah was really nice. Even in this situation, she was concerned
about someone else's heart. I didn't have that ability.
"Maybe a bit. But It is necessary. There are some people in the world who
become stronger as they carry more burdens."

"Ah…"

"Don't worry. And…Gilyoung, did you do what I asked?"

"Yes, hyung."

Lee Gilyoung replied from next to Yoo Sangah. On his head, there was a
pair of small cockroaches like they were antennae.

"That noona, she is on B1."

"Thank you."

Lee Hyunsung was good. Now it was time to steal the power of others.

I walked up the stairs alone. The people of the Landlord Alliance welcomed
me as I went up.

"Haha, who is this? If it isn't the illegal tenant."

"…"

"You are coming up here after doing well. Did you really survive yesterday
without a room? Did Yoo Joonghyuk help you?"

I ignored them and kept walking. The Landlord Alliance members kept
talking, as if they thought I was scared.

"Isn't it hard to live with Yoo Joonghyuk? Enter our alliance. Pildu-ssi said
he would let you."

I didn't care and counted the remaining green zones on every floor. One,
two, three… in order for this plan to succeed, I couldn't miss a single one.
"Of course, under the condition that you bring both women."

Now there were 11 green zones remaining. The number had reduced a lot
after yesterday's scenario. It was a close number to carry out the plan.

"Hey, are you ignoring me now?"

"I'm listening. Tell him I'm thinking about it."

The alliance members looked at each other and chuckled at my words. They
could laugh like that now.

I was walking up the escalator when a blade suddenly reached my neck. I
felt very few signs it was coming… there was only one skill that boasted
this type of concealed movements in the beginning.

[Ghost Walk.]

"I'm disappointed, ahjussi."

Lee Jihye. A proud girl with outstanding fighting skills. She wasn't chosen
by the Duke of Loyalty and Warfare for nothing.

"Ahjussi, don't you know what will happen to those women if you make a
deal with them?"

"I know."

"Do you really know? Yesterday, wouldn't you rather

die?" I shrugged.

"Put away the sword. Let's talk."

"Talk? You came to find me on purpose."

"Yes."
Lee Jihye put away the sword. I followed behind Lee Jihye. Lee Jihye
walked from B1 to the ticket barrier at the entrance. We seemed to walk for
a while.

"What did you want to talk about?"

"But why are you standing there?"

"Master told me to defend this place."

"…Defend?"

"That's why I can't let you pass."

Lee Jihye touched the ticket gate and drew her hand across her neck. I
looked at the passage beyond the ticket gate. There were exit numbers
leading to the ground. But not all numbers led to the ground. At that
moment, I had an ominous feeling.

…That Yoo Joonghyuk, surely he wasn't trying that route?

If Yoo Joonghyuk wanted to protect this place, there was only one reason.

As the scenario was in progress, he was secretly trying to attack the 'hidden
dungeon' of Chungmuro. Hidden dungeon attack. It sounded good. In fact,
it wasn't bad if the main character became stronger.

The problem was that this dungeon was a place that Yoo Joonghyuk
couldn't clear until the end of the third regression. It looked like I should
finish this quickly.

"I need your help."

"My help?"

"Today, I will shatter Gong Pildu's party."
"…Are you serious?"

Lee Jihye looked at me like she was trying to see my heart.

[Your understanding of the character 'Lee Jihye' has increased.]

"Ahjussi isn't strong enough. You won't be able to get rid of them."

"Even if you help me?'

Lee Jihye's head jerked like her pride was damaged.

It was natural. Lee Jihye had already challenged Gong Pildu the first day
she came to this station. Then she ran away. If Yoo Joonghyuk hadn't
appeared to rescue her, she would be dead.

"I have a way. I can do it if you help me."

"…Master told me to stay here."

"If you don't help, most of the people here will die."

"People will die anyway."

"Did Yoo Joonghyuk say that?"

Lee Jihye's eyes shook.

"The boy we talked to yesterday is dead. Do you understand?"

"…I know."

"Maybe he could've lived. Then today, he would be rushing at us to tell us
about Yoo Joonghyuk."

"That…"

"Yoo Joonghyuk killed him. He could've saved him."
I felt complicated while talking. I noticed that I wasn't much different from
Yoo Joonghyuk. The subway, Gumho Station… I ignored people I might've
been able to save because my safety was being threatened.

But hypocrites could speak plausible words.

"I saw the video of your scenario when I was on the subway."

Lee Jihye's small shoulders shook.

"It was a video where you killed your friend to survive."

"…Stop."

"In fact, you didn't want to do that."

[The character 'Lee Jihye' is greatly disturbed.]

"What do you know?"

"I know what I know. Of course I don't know. I'm just talking to myself."

"…"

"But since I am talking, I wanted to say this. If you turn away today, you
will regret it for the rest of your life. Definitely."

[The character 'Lee Jihye' has fallen into deep agony.]

I didn't know the 'human' Lee Jihye but I knew the 'character' Lee Jihye.
This girl was a loyal subordinate of Yoo Joonghyuk. But that was a story
for the future, not now. She admired Yoo Joonghyuk's strength but she was
essentially different from Yoo Joonghyuk.

Lee Jihye opened her mouth a few minutes later.

"If I help, people can live?"
"Not everyone, but some will survive."

"…What should I do?"

"I will start at 7 o'clock this evening."

I told her the plan. In order to implement this plan, Lee Jihye needed to do
the things I told her.

Lee Jihye stared blankly and opened her mouth.

"Are you sane? You will really do this?"

"Yes."

"…Honestly, I don't think it will work. I'll tell you in advance. I don't think
I can help."

"The choice is yours."

She said this but Lee Jihye would surely move. She was the person who
was chosen by the Duke of Loyalty and Warfare.

[The constellation 'Secretive Plotter' likes your impudence.]

[100 coins have been sponsored.]

[Lee Jihye's sponsor likes you.]

[100 coins have been sponsored.]

Now all the preparations were finished.
             Chapter 34: Ep. 8 – Emergency Defense, II


It was finally the promised time.

I gathered on the line 3 platform with the party. Every member was
checking their weapons. Lee Hyunsung seemed to have handled it properly.

"I did as Dokja-ssi asked."

Since the weapons they had used so far were very old, I asked Lee
Hyunsung to produce new weapons. The materials were from the grade 8
underground species, the groll that were killed in the struggle last night.
The blades and spears were made by cutting the horns of the groll. They
weren't long enough but they were appropriate as a temporary measure.

Jung Heewon smiled like she was satisfied.

"Isn't this much lighter and durable?"

"Ah… Dokja-ssi, Hyunsung-ssi. Thank you very much."
Yoo Sangah bowed. The groll's horn couldn't be used to make a blunt
weapon so only Lee Gilyoung was still carrying a weapon from a ground
rat. Lee Gilyoung was silently gazing at the ground. This sulking child… I
stroked his head and said.

"It won't be easy. This situation can be more dangerous than yesterday. Are
you all ready?"

The party members nodded.

"Then we will start."

From now on, it was a fight against time. We had to work as quickly as
possible before the Landlord Alliance noticed the situation. Jung Heewon,
Yoo Sangah and Lee Gilyoung disappeared to their respective floors for
their missions, while I started climbing the stairs with Lee Hyunsung.

Lee Hyunsung spoke in a voice without any confidence.

"Dokja-ssi, I am unsure."

…He was the core of this operation. He shouldn't be talking like this. I
deliberately answered in a strong voice.

"It will be fine."

However, Lee Hyunsung's face was still timid.

"I think that people are relying on me more than they should. I'm not sure I
can do well."

"Hyunsung-ssi is a dependable person."

"…Thank you for saying so. In fact, this is my first experience. When I was
in the army, I never got someone's trust like this."
It was the first time I've heard this story. That reminded me, I didn't really
know about Lee Hyunsung's army life. Ways of Survival only mentioned it
in passing.

"Once this is over, I want to hear Hyunsung-ssi's story."

I said it casually but Lee Hyunsung was more shaken than I thought.

[The character 'Lee Hyunsung' has started to open his heart to you.]

[Your understanding of the character 'Lee Hyunsung' has greatly increased.]

"Sometimes I feel strange when talking to Dokja-ssi."

"Huh? Why…?"

"It seems like you knew me from a long time ago… I can't explain it
well…" Lee Hyunsung scratched his head and trailed off. "Ah, I don't mean
anything strange. I just…"

"I know what you mean."

"Thank you. I'm also curious about Dokja-ssi's story."

"My story?"

"Yes. I have never seen a person like Dokja-ssi before. I'm curious about
what you did before this happened."

Somehow, I felt a bit strange. The 'supporting cast' of the novel I read was
curious about me. I had a bit uncomfortable and had an itchy feeling.

"It isn't very interesting."

"I still want to hear it."

Suddenly, a question popped into my head.
If Ways of Survival hadn't become reality, would Lee Hyunsung be living
in the same world as me? Or did the novel suddenly emerge as a reality? I
didn't know. One thing was for sure. Lee Hyunsung was now a 'living
person' in front of me.

"Oh, Yoo Joonghyuk's friend. Did you come to negotiate?"

At this time, a number of middle-aged men came forward. Chungmuro's
Landlord Alliance.

"Hmm…but where are the women?"

The middle-aged man who spoke was holding a woman by her hair. She
was part of the group that had been in the five spaces green zone just
yesterday. The man laughed at my gaze.

"Ahh, this friend didn't see her land… This matter doesn't concern you."

"S-Save me. Help me!"

The woman was gazing at me pitifully. In my head, the constellations of the
'absolute good' started clamoring. But I waited. It was because I had
someone who would act instead of me.

"Let her go."

It was Lee Hyunsung.

"Who are you?"

Lee Hyunsung looked at me after the middle-aged man's question. It was
like he was asking for permission. I nodded.

[The character 'Lee Hyunsung' wants to practice justice of his own will.]

[The character 'Lee Hyunsung' is about to evolve.]
The allied members pulled out their weapons and exerted a tremendous
momentum. I checked the time. It was time to begin. I raised my stats with
my coins.

[1,200 coins have been invested into 'physique'.]

[Physique Lv. 15 -> Physique Lv. 18]

[Your physique level has increased dramatically!]

[1,200 coins have been invested into 'strength'.]

[Strength Lv. 15 -> Strength Lv. 18]

[Your strength level has increased dramatically!]

This was the maximum efficiency with minimal investment.

[Coins Possessed: 20,450 C]

I had another place to spend the remaining coins.

Kwaaaang!

Small blasts were heard all over the subway. A big and small uproar
followed. It was the signal.

"Hyunsung-ssi!"

Lee Hyunsung nodded. We ran forward towards the men in the front row.
The confused alliance members shouted.

"What, you bastards!"

[The exclusive skill 'Purest Sword Force' has been activated.]

Sukakak!
"Kyaaak!"

The arm of the middle-aged man holding the woman's head flew away. The
middle-aged men froze at the blood that emerged. Lee Hyunsung and I
ignored them and kept running. The middle-aged men belatedly chased
after us.

"These crazy guys! Stop them!"

A corridor on B2. It was the private land of Gong Pildu.

[You have invaded private property!]

"Surround them!"

The alliance members waiting in front discovered us. Some of the alliance
members were missing, so there were less than expected. 20 in the back, 12
in the back. However, it was still a lot of people.

Well, I had no intention of dealing with all of them.

The moment I was about to clash with the alliance members, Lee Hyunsung
moved ahead of me with a steel shield.

[The character 'Lee Hyunsung' has used the stigma 'Great Mountain Push
Lv.
1'.]

Kwakakakak!

Lee Hyunsung used his tremendous muscle strength and they fell like
dominoes.

[The character 'Gong Pildu' has activated 'Armed Zone Lv. 4!]
Turrets started to rise from all over the territory. The turrets were charged
with red magic bullets and were prepared to fire. There were five
miniturrets. The level of Armed Zone had rised again.

"Dokja-ssi!"

I overtook Lee Hyunsung and at the same time, I received his shield. As
soon as the solid shield entered my hand, a stunning shock from a bullet
pushed me away.

Kwang! Kwaang! Kwaang!

It was heavy, as if I was hit by a cannon. The arm holding the shield was in
pain. The level 19 magic power was strong. But I had to hold on.

[The compensation effect of Unbroken Faith has increased physique to
level 20.]

[A toughness that is one step higher has protected your body.]

"A cheeky tenant is here."

Beyond the voice, I heard Gong Pildu's gruff voice.

Our feet were tied up by the powerful magic bullets while the alliance
members were still chasing us. The durability of the iron shield was falling.
Now it could only block a dozen magic bullets in the future.

Gong Pildu spoke like it was interesting.

"I don't think you came here to pay a fine. What is going on?"

"Now I will quit being a tenant."

"How interesting. Are you coveting my land?"

"We'll see. More than that…"
[Some of the trespassers' stats are reduced by the effect of Gong Pildu's
private land.]

…It had started. This was why Gong Pildu's power was scary. The special
effect of Armed Zone was a 'private land debuff'.

Red magic power started condensing on the turrets.

[The character 'Gong Pildu' is preparing the 'strengthened magic bullets'.

As long as the combo of 'private land' and 'armed zone' wasn't broken, there
were very few incarnations who could deal with Gong Pildu.

"Die."

The moment that the enhanced magic bullets were about to be launched, I
heard the screams of people from far away. The wounded landlord alliance
members were rushing to this side.

"P-Pildu-ssi! The land…!"

There were signs they were injured by something sharp. Lee Jihye had
moved. Now was the time. I looked at Lee Hyunsung.

"Hyunsung-ssi, now."

Lee Hyunsung's eyes were shaking.

"Smash it."

Lee Hyunsung raised his fists up high. He looked uneasy and irritated, but
there was also a firm determination not to retreat.

[The character 'Lee Hyunsung' has evolved.]

There was a blinding light and silver aura started to appear around Lee
Hyunsung's bdoy.
I was a bit emotional at the sight. Lee Hyunsung's 'character evolution' was
one of the scenes I liked most in Ways of Survival. It was the reason why
Steel Sword Lee Hyunsung was called one of the strongest supporting
characters. That is―

[Due to the character evolution, a new stigma has been opened.]

When it came to 'one blow', Lee Hyunsung was considered one of the
strongest in Ways of Survival.

[The character 'Lee Hyunsung' has used the stigma 'Great Mountain Smash
Lv. 1'.]

Pale magic power gathered around Lee Hyunsung's fist and within seconds,
Lee Hyunsung's arms became big enough to transcend common sense.

"Haaaat!"

Lee Hyunsung's fists flammed down onto the ground.

Kwaaaaang!

There was a loud sound and the fragments of the broken floor scattered in
the air. The alliance members screamed.

"W-What?"

Jjejejejeok!

Dangerous cracks spread across the ground and the positions of the turrets
started to twist. The magic bullets were fired towards the wrong place. An
explosion spread and dust clouds rose. Then after a while.

Ku ku ku ku!

There was a great vibration and the ground of B2 started to collapse.
[The green zone has been destroyed.]

[The character Gong Pildu's private land has been destroyed.]

I looked at the collapsing ground and grinned towards Gong Pildu.

"Let's go back to the days when we didn't have our own land."
            Chapter 35: Ep. 8 – Emergency Defense, III


I couldn't kill Gong Pildu because he was useful in future scenarios, but I
needed Gong Pildu to leave his land.

This was a difficult dilemma so I focused on the premise of the dilemma.
For example if he was on 'private land' then I had to destroy the private
land.

"Uhh… h-he is out."

"This dog…"

However, using this method required strong force. An overwhelming force
that could destroy a 'huge' private land in one blow. That's why I hastened
to evolve Lee Hyunsung.

"Eeeeok…!"

The people who fell down to the third underground floor groaned with pain.
The operation was a success.

The green zones disappeared and the landlords lost their 'rooms'. Gong
Pildu's face was covered with dust and looking this way. As he was about to
open his mouth, Bihyung's voice entered their ears.

[What are you doing now? Waaah!]

'Be quiet'.

[Crazy bastard! The dokkaebis of Chungmuro are freaking out because of
you!]

I had a headache from the messages of the constellations that rang in my
head.

[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' likes your
recklessness.]

[The constellation 'Bald General of Justice' likes your revolution.]

[The constellation 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' likes the destruction and
chaos.]

[300 coins have been sponsored.]

"Y-You bastard!"

"Kill them!"

The alliance members shouted at us. I started running down to the platform
with Lee Hyunsung.

[The exclusive skill, Character List is activated.]
  [Character Summary]

  Name: Lee Hyunsung

  Exclusive Attributes: Person who has Regained Justice (Rare)

 Stigma: Great Mountain Smash Lv. 1, Great Mountain Push Lv. 2.

 Exclusive Skills: Bayonet Skills Lv. 2, Camouflage Lv. 2, Patience Lv.
 1, Sense of Justice Lv. 2, Weapons Training Lv. 3.


The evolution of Lee Hyunsung was successful. Strictly speaking, it was
just the start. But the fact that Lee Hyunsung could use Great Mountain
Smash would quickly enhance the power of the party.

"Hyunsung-ssi, how many more times can you use it?"

"…Probably once or twice more."

Lee Hyunsung was gasping for breath and obviously quite worn out.

It was natural. The Great Mountain Smash stigma was an ultimate skill that
consumed a tremendous amount of stamina and magic power. There weren't
many skills that exceeded Great Mountain Smash when it came to pure
physical force among the physical reinforcement type skills.

The group of people scattered all over the place seemed to be running in
this direction. I asked Yoo Sangah who was running in the front.

"Was there anywhere you couldn't break?"

"I broke both of them!"
"I didn't realize the rooms could be broken like this. We banged hard on
the ground together and it smashed…" Jung Heewon followed.

Yoo Sangah, Jung Heewon and Lee Gilyoung took out the small green
zones. Most of the green zones fit three or fewer people, apart from Gong
Pildu's green zone. There was some was an ambiguous scale but there was a
separate person handling those.

[Hey! Can't you hear me? What are you going to do now?]

On the other hand, Bihyung was still shouting across the 'dokkaebi
communication'.

'What are you worried about?'

[Have you forgotten? I'm don't have the only channel in Chungmuro. Do
you really not know what will happen if you do this?]

Of course I knew. Maybe the constellations in the channel with Gong Pildu
would be in a frenzy right now.

'What channel is Gong Pildu in?'

[…Biryu's channel. BIR-3642.]

'Biryu is the one who came while you were busy for a bit?'

[That's right. That asshole.]

'How is his subscription configured?'

[It is the flagship channel for the 'finding amusement' group.]

The dokkaebis whose main purpose was to find amusement. That's why
their broadcasts were radical. Great. Then the response within the channel
would be much hotter than expected. Everyone would've eaten the sweet
potatoes properly.

I headed down the stairs of the transfer corridor to line 4 and saw a
welcome face. The blade was moving through the air.

"You broke them?"

"Yes. It was easy."

Lee Jihye's role was to take out the green zones that contained five to eight
people. It was a task that Jung Heewon would find hard to do alone. Indeed,
she was Yoo Joonghyuk's disciple and was the incarnation of the sage hero.
Now there were no more green zones left in Chungmuro.

"Now what? Those jerks will come running wildly. Ah, there they are."

Lee Jihye's expression twisted as she looked behind me.

"I'm not going to help you this time."

"I don't need it."

Jung Heewon scowled as she watched Lee Jihye retreating.

"What is with her?"

Come to think of it, Jung Heewon didn't know about Lee Jihye. But there
was no time to tell her.

[Haha… you are fucked now.]

A message was heard along with Bihyung's words.

[A bounty scenario has occurred!]
  [Bounty Scenario – Assassination Commission]

  Category: Sub

  Difficulty: C

  Clear Conditions: The constellations of Channel #BIR-3642 have
  requested to kill a certain person. Please kill 'Kim Dokja' of Chungmuro
  Station.

  Time Limit: 10 minutes.

  Compensation: 2,000 coins.

  Failure: None



I thought this situation would unfold. It was going to be a lot of fun. Now
all the incarnations in the region would gather on the platform of line 3 to
catch me. Jung Heewon asked by his side.

"I will receive 2,000 coins if I kill Dokja-ssi right now?"

"Why, are you going to kill me?"

"Aye, perhaps. If you give me 200,000 coins then I don't know."

Does this girl know how much 200,000 coins were worth?

"Dokja-ssi. Go behind me."

Lee Hyunsung stepped out ahead of me. Jung Heewon stayed beside me
while Yoo Sangah and Lee Gilyoung moved to block any access. It was a
defense formed around me. Jung Heewon smiled.
"Now I can pay back my debt."

"Dokja-ssi, we'll try to block it somehow."

There were people showing hostility around us. The angry landowners and
the tenants were blinded by the bounty quest. I watched Lee Gilyoung
holding the weapon and opened my mouth.

"Don't be nervous."

I lightly stroked Lee Gilyoung's shoulder and moved towards the railway
tracks.

"We don't have to fight them."

It was a few turns. I had read about such a scene. I didn't have time to check
which regression it was but Yoo Joonghyuk had destroyed the green zones
as soon as he arrived at Chungmuro.

Even then, it was like the current situation.

[All green zones in this region have been destroyed and the main scenario
has collapsed.]

[The difficulty is automatically adjusted according to the remaining
schedule of the scenario.]
[The scenario content is updated!]


  [Main Scenario #3 – Emergency Defense]

  Category: Main

  Difficulty: B-

  Clear Conditions: All the green zones in the region are destroyed and
  the monsters that were going to be created in the remaining days have
  suddenly run wild. Survive against the flood of monsters for the
  remaining time.

  Duration: 8 hours.

  Compensation: 1,000 coins.

  Failure: ―


Originally, there were three days remaining in the scenario.

Now the monsters supposed to be created during the remaining time of the
green zone scenario would emerge all at once. In other words, it was
simple.

[The emergency defense has begun!]

The defense game had started.

"W-What?"

The people approaching me started screaming. The cries of monsters were
heard from outside the screen door. The feast of monsters moved like an
angry wave.
"Crazy! What the hell is this?"

The platform of line 3 quickly became a mess. The faces of the people
became speculative as they watched the monsters coming from all sides.
The bounty scenario was completely forgotten about.

Grrrr!

A few grolls ran and bit some of the alliance members. The upset people
were shouting.

Now was the only chance. I shouted to my party.

"Go to the transfer route!"

I started jumping up the transit stairs with my friends. By the time we
reached the upper level, people were blocking the path.

"What? Get out of the way!"

"Do you want to fall?"

I kicked some of the followers and pulled out a blade. The people were
surprised by the Purest Sword Force blade and backed away.

"You haven't grasped the situation yet."

"W-What?"

"Even if you come up, you won't be able to survive."

There was a sense of despair in the expressions of the people. There were
no more rooms. Now there were no more safe zones from the monsters in
Chungmuro.

"What should we do?"
"What else? Fight."

"Don't speak crazy words! This is all because of you! If you hadn't broken
our rooms…!"

I triggered the Blade of Faith and used it on the transfer stairs.

Kwarurung!

"Uwaaaaack!"

The center of the staircase fell with a large sound, along with the people. It
was cruel but necessary.

"Crazy! Quickly find another staircase! Quickly!"

Well, I don't think it would happen.

Lee Hyunsung was already running. I smashed the transit stairs we came up
on and there was only one staircase remaining. Subsequently, the sound of
arguing and something breaking was heard on the other side.

"Shit! Waaah!"

The cries of the people trapped on the platform of line 3 were heard. Lee
Jihye approached me and asked.

"Ahjussi. This isn't what you told me. If you leave it like this…"

"I know."

I looked at the lower floor that was becoming pandemonium. If I left it like
this, they would all be killed. Whether it was from the monsters or using
each other's bodies as a stepping stone to come upstairs.

This wasn't what I wanted.
[The exclusive skill 'Bookmark' can now be activated.]

['Character Bookmarks' is activated.]

[Available Bookmark Slots: 3]

[Bringing up the list of available bookmarks.]


  [People Listed in the Bookmark Slots]

  The Delusion Demon Kim Namwoon (Understanding 35).

  Steel Sword Lee Hyunsung (Understanding 65).

  Demagogue Cheon Inho (Understanding 20).


I activated the third bookmark.

[The number three bookmark has been activated.]

[The level of the Bookmark skill is low, shortening the activation time.]

[Activation Time: 5 minutes.]

[Your understanding of the character is low, so only a part of the character's
skill is activated.]

[Incite Lv.2 has been activated.]

Suddenly, it felt like my tongue was coming alive on its own. This was how
Cheon Inho felt. I looked downstairs. In the middle of the mess, I could see
a middle-aged man.
"Hey Gong Pildu. How long are you going to stand there?"

Gong Pildu glared at me.

"This dog…!"

"Don't you have to act in order to live? If you move, everyone else can

live." The power of Incite permeated the ears of all the frightened people.

"P-Pildu-ssi!"

"P-Pildu-ssi, please save us!"

Gong Pildu's expression distorted. I felt good. This was what Cheon Inho
would've felt at Gumho Station.

"The third scenario isn't as hard as you think. Once everyone gives up on
the rooms and participates in the defense, there are enough people to handle
the monsters."

My words were half true. If Chungmuro had united before I arrived here,
there would be far less victims. After all, the biggest pitfall of this scenario
was the green zone.

"If Gong Pildu fights with the people, you can survive."

Those who fight together would survive, those who ran away would die.

[The sponsor behind Lee Jihye agrees with your wisdom.]

[The constellation 'Maritime War God' nods his head.]

"Now there are no rooms for you to run away to. Forget about whether you
are a landlord or tenant and fight. Or you will all die."
The more urgent the situation was, the more the effect of Incite would
increase.

"Damn, this fucking guy…!"

"Pildu-ssi! Please help us!"

The alliance members gathered around Gong Pildu. If he ran away here
alone, Gong Pildu's Landlord Alliance would collapse. In the end Gong
Pildu made his decision.

"Dammit… Everybody gather here!"

The people downstairs started gathering around Gong Pildu.

"I need time to install a new Armed Zone. Everybody just hang on!"

The key was Gong Pildu's Armed Zone. However, the weak point was that
Armed Zone took time to install every time it moved.

Blood splattered everywhere and people screamed as their limbs were torn
off.

"Aaaagh!"

As expected, the first ones who abandoned the formation were the
tenants, not the alliance members. "Yoo Sangah-ssi."

"Yes. Please leave it to me."

I didn't need to explain it. Yoo Sangah already understood what she needed
to do.

Her Binding Thread stretched out and started to rescue the people who
couldn't fight anymore. In any case, their mission was to buy time for Gong
Pildu to deploy Armed Zone.
"U-Uhh… t-thank you."

The tenants hung from the threat and were pulled upstairs.

The rescued tenants were shaking as they wrapped up their injured area. In
the meantime, some of the people with weapons carefully looked at me. I
smiled at them and said.

"Oh, do you want the bounty?"

[The time limit for the bounty scenario has expired.]

[The bounty hanging on Kim Dokja has been destroyed.]

"Sorry, it is too late."

"I-I'm sorry."

The tenants seemed ashamed as they put away their weapons. I heard Gong
Pildu's voice roaring from the bottom.

"Out of the way!"

[The character 'Gong Pildu' has used Private Land Lv. 3!]

[The character 'Gong Pildu' has activated 'Armed Zone Lv. 4!]

There was a mechanical sound as five turrets rose from the ground. The red
magic bullets condensed in a short time and started firing.

Dududududu!

Kwang! Kwaang! Kwaang!

The ground rats screamed as they were hit by the bombardment of magic
bullets while the grolls came to a halt. The group of people cried out.
"As expected of Pildu-ssi!"

"Wahhhh!"

It was truly Gong Pildu. In a defense type scenario, there was no
incarnation that surpassed a player's combat effectiveness.

The 10 Evils weren't called that for nothing.

"All of you damn scum disappear!"

The agitated Gong Pildu randomly fired. Lee Hyunsung spoke with
admiration.

"It is a really tremendous stigma. Is it okay when the magic power
consumption is so big?"

"It is a good stigma so it will be okay for a while."

"Should we help…?"

"Gong Pildu alone is sufficient. If we do down then he will be distracted
and stop shooting."

The Defense Master sponsor behind Gong Pildu was completely suited for
this type of scenario. As long as he supported Gong Pildu, Gong Pildu
wouldn't die here. As long as the sponsorship continued.

I sat down and stretched out my legs.

"We will be sucking honey for a while."

"…Is it time for personal maintenance already?"

Lee Hyunsung sat down with me and the party members started to relax one
by one. Jung Heewon asked.
"Thank you. I didn't get enough sleep… can I sleep now?"

"Yes."

10 minutes later, Jung Heewon was lying on the ground and snoring. I said
yes but I really didn't know how she could sleep so easily.

"A-Aren't we too easygoing?"

Yoo Sangah sounded concerned. Indeed, it would be confusing. There
wasn't a 'scenario' like this so far. In fact, all we did was survive the brink
of a crisis.

"Think of it as standing on the right line."

"Then over there…"

"They got the wrong line."

The confusion on the lower level had almost died down because of Gong
Pildu.

Dududududu!

"Uwaaaaah!"

He should've lived a better life.

"Fuck! Fuuuuuckers!"

In the midst of the endless procession of monsters, Gong Pildu's screams
echoed.
            Chapter 36: Ep. 8 – Emergency Defense, IV


One hour after the battle began, Gong Pildu fought and fought. The number
of monsters had barely decreased but it was still great. Gong Pildu was
considered to have the strongest defense among the 10 Evils for a reason.

"You scum!"

[The character Gong Pildu's Armed Zone has levelled up.

[The character Gong Pildu's Private Land has levelled up!]

[The character Gong Pildu has acquired the Protective Wall skill.]

The level up speed of Armed Zone was fast. The sponsor behind Gong
Pildu was rushing to support his growth. If he could survive here, Gong
Pildu's growth would be enormous.

As long as he could survive here.
"Uhweeeh…!"

According to the scenario, Gong Pildu had to hold on for seven more hours.
It would've been nice if I had popcorn. Too bad.

Lee Jihye was giggling next to me as she watched the bottom floor. She
told me earlier that I should save them… it was truly a transformation in the
disposition of Yoo Joonghyuk's disciple.

"By the way, why isn't Yoo Joonghyuk here?

"How should I know? Master is always busy."

Busy… yes, he might be busy. The person trying to be all alone was the
busiest.

I looked down at the dying Gong Pildu as I asked, "What time did Yoo
Joonghyuk enter the dungeon?"

"It is roughly 9 a.m. today…" Lee Jihye stopped speaking and stared at me.
"…Wait a minute, how do you know that Master entered a dungeon?"

I ignored Lee Jihye and calculated the time. Now it was 8 p.m. Using
simple calculations, it had already been over 11 hours since Yoo Joonghyuk
entered. Yet he still hadn't come out…

Damn, I had to move. Yoo Joonghyuk was the main character and it would
be difficult if something happened to him.

I opened the dokkaebi communication.

'Bihyung'.

Bihyung floating in the air turned to look at me.
[What is it? Calling me so suddenly.]

'Open the Dokkaebi Bag'.

[What? N-No! I am currently getting a lot of subscriptions!]

I know. My stock price was rising due to my actions with Gong Pildu. My
actions of laying a trap and then sitting back meant the constellations of the
'fun seekers' group wouldn't still be on the channel which Gong Pildu
belonged to.

Where would the constellations go after leaving the channel?

[New constellations have entered the channel!]

It was naturally Bihyung's channel.

[#BI-7623 channel is ready for an expansion.]

[Huhu, huhuhut, look at this, look at this! Now my channel is also…!]

It wasn't unreasonable for Bihyung to be acting like this. But this wasn't the
time for amusement.

'If you don't want your channel to be ruined, open it quickly. You can see
that there will be an advertisement in preparation for the channel
expansion'.

[Ah, shit… really…]

Bihyung grumbled but opened the Dokkaebi Bag after showing an
advertisement. It was finally time to use the coins I had saved.

'I'll give you 5,000 coins. Upgrade me to a gold member'.

Bihyung stared at me quietly and sighed. It was followed by system
messages.
[5,000 coins have been consumed.]

[Congratulations! You have become a gold member of the Dokkaebi Bag!]

My member rating changed and the background of the Dokkaebi Bag also
changed. Coins were really good. New item listings were added. I put the
necessary items into the shopping cart.

 Behind the Scenes Contract – 10,000 C.

 Intermediate Magic Power Recovery Potion X 10 – 5,000 C.

One contract and 10 intermediate potions… this should be enough.

The spending was a bit big but the channel was going to be expanded. It
wouldn't be long before I recovered it. Bihyung was nervous when he saw
the items I bought.

[…Why is there a contract? Have you already forgotten the terms? You
can't have a sponsor!]

'What do you mean? Why would I get a sponsor now?''

Even if I was doing that, why would I buy the contract with my own coins?
At any rate, this Bihyung still needed a lot of work.

[15,000 coins have been consumed.]

[A 'Behind the Scenes Contract' has been acquired.]

[10 Intermediate Magic Power Recovery Potions have been acquired.]

Yoo Sangah showed curiosity when the items appeared out of thin air.

"What is that?"

"A contract to make a 'gap' an 'eul'."
I filled out the contract carefully, wrote my name in the 'gap' section and
waited quietly. It was time for the 'eul' to come.

[The sponsor for character 'Gong Pildu' is asking for help from nearby
constellations.]

Finally, the sponsor behind Gong Pildu reached his limits and started
sending messages outside the channel. It was natural since the sponsor
didn't have many coins in the first place. Not everybody was rich just
because they were a constellation.

[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' scoffs.]

The other constellations in Gong Pildu's channel would've stopped
sponsoring and the incarnation was dying… everything was going
according to plan.

Bihyung noticed something and muttered.

[Wait a minute, surely you aren't…]

I talked towards Gong Pildu, who was in a half dead state.

"Hey, you over there."

Dududududu! Gong Pildu fired crazily and looked up at me while breathing
heavily.

"Will you die like this or will you sign a contract with me?"

"W-What…?"

"I'm not a constellation so I can't be a sponsor. But if you want, I can be
a person behind the scenes. How about it?" "What is this bastard talking
about…?"
"Gong Pildu, shut up. I'm not talking to you."

"What…?"

I waved the 'contract' in one hand and the 'Intermediate Magic Power
Recovery Potion' in the other hand.

"Answer quickly. I will give these items to you if you sign with me."

A message window flashed in front of me.


[The sponsor behind character 'Gong Pildu' has revealed himself.]

[The constellation 'Defense Master' is looking at you like you are crazy.]

Indeed. He wasn't yet ready to be an 'eul'. Don't worry. He would be in a
hurry as time passed.

Bihyung was watching me.

[You… are you crazy?]

'This one as well'.

[You are the first to try and support a constellation.]

'I can't do it?'

[This is a constellation! Will it sign with an insignificant human?]

'That is just your thoughts'.

The intermediate constellation, Defense Master. He was a low level
constellation compared to his ability.

His world had long become a 'scenario' and was completely destroyed.
Therefore, the Defense Master's myth was no longer discussed. The myth
had disappeared and the constellation couldn't get coins. One day, even his
existence would disappear.

That's why some constellations, including the Defense Master' were
obsessed with looking for an 'incarnation'. The constellations were
remembered in the world through their chosen incarnation.

'That guy, he doesn't have any coins left'.

[What?]

Gong Pildu's power had fallen sharply compared to before. Unlike the
'Monarch of the Small Fries', the Defense Master was someone who cared
about his incarnation. The fact that Gong Pildu was going to die meant he
had run out of coins.

It was obvious but without coins, a new 'sponsor contract' was impossible.
Then what happened to a constellation who couldn't create a new
incarnation?

'Once Gong Pildu dies, that guy will be forgotten'.

For a constellation, being forgotten meant death.

Faint fear filled Bihyung's eyes.

[You are…?]

Gong Pildu was a great card if I could afford it. Even Yoo Joonghyuk had
attempted to subjugate Gong Pildu several times in countless regressions.
Of course, he had never been successful.

Yoo Sangah spoke.

"Dokja-ssi, that person will die."
Gong Pildu was biting his lips so hard that blood was flowing. Now there
were only two mini-turrets left in Armed Zone. It was time to end this.

[The constellation 'Defense Master' is wondering about the contents of the
contract.]

He was coming. Bihyung's eyes widened at the sight in front of him.

[…Really? No, is this real?]

I showed the contract immediately.

[The constellation 'Defense Master' has started reading the contract.]

Gong Pildu, who was shedding blood on the lower floor, suddenly shouted.
He had probably heard a message from his sponsor.

"W-What? What is this message?"

What? He was being sold.

"W-What is going on Pildu-ssi?"

[The constellation 'Defense Master' is asking for some time to think.]

After a while, I heard some good news.

[The constellation 'Defense Master' as added a condition to the contract.]

[If you agree with this condition, the constellation 'Defense Master' will
agree to contract with you.]

I immediately read the contract.

…
14.       Incarnation Kim Dokja (Gap) recognizes the property rights
ofConstellation Defense Master (Eul)and should ensure the survival of
'Gong Pildu'.

15.      Incarnation Kim Dokja (Gap) should help Constellation Defense
Master(Eul) so that his private property 'Gong Pildu' grows well.

…

Guaranteeing Gong Pildu's life and his growth. In fact, this didn't need to be
included. It was natural for Gong Pildu not to die if the contract was signed.
The only thing that mattered for me was the third condition.

3. Incarnation Kim Dokja (Gap) has a command authority over 'Gong
Pildu', the private property of Constellation Defense Master (Up to 10 times
a day).

I checked the contract and nodded.

"I will sign the contract."

Before long, a faint thread connected me and Gong Pildu. Then system
messages were heard.

[The contract has been completed.]

[You have become the co-sponsor of 'Gong Pildu' due to the contract.]

[Due to the contract, you have been given the right to command incarnation
'Gong Pildu'.]

[The duration of the contract is five years and it won't be automatically
renewed.]

Yoo Joonghyuk would be stunned if he knew that Gong Pildu could be
obtained so easily. If I hadn't read to the latter half of Ways of Survival, I
wouldn't have known to use the Behind the Scenes Contract this way.
I handed the recovery potions to Yoo Sangah.

"Give this to Gong Pildu. You should give him one every 40 minutes."

"…It is okay to give to him?"

She had to give it. If not, this main scenario wouldn't be cleared. Gong
Pildu was confused after Yoo Sangah handed him a potion.

"What is this?"

"Drink it and fight."

Gong Pildu was suspicious for a moment but soon opened the potion's lid.
Blue smoke emerged around his body and the destroyed turrets returned to
their original appearance.

[The character 'Gong Pildu' has completely recovered his magic power.]

Gong Pildu wiped the potion stained lips and looked up at me.


"Stupid guy. Do you think I will forgive you because of this? Once I get out
of here, it will be your end…"

"Shut up, Gong Pildu."

[Under the terms of the contract, 'Command Rights' is activated!]

"O-Oof? Oof oof oof?"

Poor guy, he didn't even know what situation he was in.

"Fight hard. Don't touch my party members."

"Hup…! Oof oof…!"

Dududududu!
Yoo Sangah's eyes widened when she saw Gong Pildu listened to my
orders.

"D-Dokja-ssi? W-Why is that person…?"

"I made a 'gap' into an 'eul."

"…Did you write something?"

"Now you can rest assured about Gong Pildu."

Then the bombardment of messages from the constellations poured out.

[The constellation 'Secretive Plotter' finds your idea interesting.]

[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' has dropped his stick
at your strategy.]

[The constellation 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' thinks that you are
impudent.]

…

I had secretly signed the contract but these guys already noticed. The
Defense Master was only intermediate level but he was still a constellation.

A mere human became a co-sponsor with a constellation, the impact on the
constellations would be enormous. There would be a backlash among those
like the Abyssal Black Flame Dragon. But.

[Many constellations are paying attention to you.]

[A number of constellations want to become your sponsor.]

The constellations who realized my value were overwhelmingly larger. If
they became my sponsor, they would be able to use the power of Defense
Master.
Then the owner of Gong Pildu's channel, Dokkaebi Biryu appeared in the
air.

[Constellations! W-Why… are you suddenly leaving? D-Don't go! Just wait
a little longer…!]

Biryu, whose channel was being ruined, made a desperate appeal. It was the
dokkaebi who created the food penalty and 'survival cost' in Gumho
Station.

[H-Hiiik! N-No…]

Dokkaebi Biryu gradually blurred and disappeared.

[Channel # BIR-3642 has been forced to leave after having the
subscriptions reduced.]

Bihyung muttered in a trembling voice after seeing one channel falling to
ruin.

[Excuse me… Dokja-nim?]

'What is it?'

[You… were you aiming for Gong Pildu from the beginning?]

I shrugged.

[Crazy… human… what human did I sign with?]

Bihyung couldn't close his mouth. I didn't care. This place was organized
and I needed to move on to the next place.

I spoke to the bewildered party members who still hadn't grasped the
situation.

"Everyone. I'm sorry but I have to leave for a while'.
"Huh? Now?"

"There is a place I urgently need to go to. Hyunsung-ssi and Yoo Sangah-
ssi, please stay here. You don't have to do anything. Just throw Pildu a
potion until the end of the scenario and relax."

Jung Heewon asked, "What about Gilyoung and I?"

"You will come with me."

"To where?"

"Um… it is hard to explain but there is a bad guy."

"A bad guy?"

"Yes. A bad person who disappeared to eat items alone, regardless if
people die or not. From now on, I am going to hit him in the back of the
head." It was very hard. Jung Heewon thought for a moment before
asking.

"…Is he worse than Gong Pildu?"

I contemplated for a moment before replying.

"He is much worse."

"Then let's go."

"I'll explain the details later."

I moved with Jung Heewon and Lee Gilyoung. Then somebody grabbed my
shoulder. It was Lee Jihye
"Wait, where are you going right now?"

In any case, this was good.

"Great. You can come along."

"Where are you going?"

"Yoo Joonghyuk is in danger."

Lee Jihye laughed like she thought I was joking.

"What nonsense are you saying? Master is in danger?"

My expression remained serious and Lee Jihye's laughter soon disappeared.

"…Are you serious? No, how do you know this?"

How did I know? Perhaps I was the world's foremost, no the second highest
authority who knew her master.

I checked the time.

"That jerk, he went to the hidden dungeon at Exit 1?"

"U-Uh?"

"And it has been 11 hours since he entered?"

"Uhhh…" Lee Jihye spoke blankly.

I remembered that Yoo Joonghyuk' had attacked Chungmuro's 'hidden
dungeon' a total of eight years. He failed twice and succeeded six times.
The problem was that the two failures were concentrated in his early
regressions.
The 8th turn and the 11th turn.
During the 8th regression, Yoo Joonghyuk died in Chungmuro's hidden
dungeon.

But the current Yoo Joonghyuk was… the third turn.

"At this rate, Yoo Joonghyuk will die today."

If my guess was right, our damn regressor would be on the 'sunfish route'.¹



[1] Sunfish route – a reference to the game 'Survive! Mola Mola!' where a
player has to help a sunfish survive troubles in the sea. However almost
anything makes the sunfish die.
               Chapter 37: Ep. 9 – Omniscient Sunfish, I


After a while, we moved towards the entrance of the 'hidden dungeon' on
the first underground floor. I walked behind Lee Jihye, Lee Gilyoung and
Jung Heewon while looking at my smartphone.

「…In the midst of the splitting headache, Yoo Joonghyuk came to his
senses.

'Give up on this life'.

This was the end of Yoo Joonghyuk's eighth life. 」

It couldn't be. This hadn't happened yet.

…Shit, why was this guy doing this on only the third life? If he moved
carefully like his second life, he would've passed through the mid-to-late
scenarios.

I raised my eyes to see Jung Heewon looking at me.
"Dokja-ssi, what are you looking at?"

"…Ah, the calendar… This situation has made me lose my sense of the
date."

I actually thought it might be more interesting to look at the calendar.
Sometimes I wondered how I finished reading this novel.

Jung Heewon looked at me suspiciously before turning her head towards
Lee Jihye.

"Then… did you say your name was Jihye? Do you also use a sword?"

"Yes. I like the sword."

"Right? The sword is the best. It has a good taste."

"…Unni also knows the taste?"

Jung Heewon smiled as she watched Lee Jihye's sword. It was a luxurious
sword that obviously flowed smoothly. Maybe it was given by Yoo
Joonghyuk.

"Your sword looks good."

"Ah, Master gave it to me. Unni…?"

"My one… I-I like mine as well."

Jung Heewon looked down at the groll horn blade and then sneaked a peek
at the sword on the other person's waist.

I didn't do anything wrong but I couldn't help feeling sorry. I had no choice
but to hang something on Lee Jihye.

"Hey, why are you talking to Heewon-ssi but ignoring me?"
"Uh… that, I'm a bit weak to older females."

Lee Jihye responded with a quivering voice and Jung Heewon gave her a
headlock, as if Lee Jihye was cute. There seemed to be a connection
between the 'demon slayers'. Lee Jihye barely escaped from the headlock
and asked.

"By the way, why are you rescuing Master?"

"We are companions."

"Don't talk nonsense."

"He is a useful guy."

"…You sound like Master."

[The constellation 'Secretive Plotter' is wondering about your heart.]

Come to think of it, it wasn't just Lee Jihye but the constellations as well
who must be wondering about my actions. He was a guy who would kill me
if he got a chance. It was strange that I would run to save him.

[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' likes your desire to
rehabilitate a fallen friend.]

[100 coins have been sponsored.]

This one misunderstood me. But the Demon-like Judge of Fire… unlike the
expectations of the Archangel Uriel, I had a deeply personal reason for
saving Yoo Joonghyuk.

It was to prevent him from 'regressing' after his death.

Regression after death. It sounded good. A 'regression stigma' that triggered
every time you died. The protagonist had a fraudulent ability.
The problem was that this ability invoked complicated thoughts in the
surrounding cast.

「By the way, what happens to the world after you return? 」

A supporting actor had asked this of Yoo Joonghyuk when Yoo
Joonghyuk's number of lives had broken into the double digits. I forgot his
name but Yoo Joonghyuk's answer from that time was clear.

「 …I also don't know. I always choose a world where more people can
live. 」

It was plausible but in fact, Yoo Joonghyuk didn't know about the world he
abandoned. In face, there was no definite theory about what happened to
the world in Ways of Survival.

Science, magic, whatever.

This was why I was anxious. What happened to the world after the
regressor disappeared?

Would it reset with the regression? Or would a parallel universe branch off?
The latter would be fortunate, but if it was the former…

"Hyung?"

"Ah, yes?"

Lee Gilyoung, who was holding the hem of my clothes, looked up at me
with anxious eyes.

"I think we're here?"

[You are approaching the outside region. Be careful not to leave the
scenario area.]
This message popped up. It didn't matter. Chungmuro's hidden dungeon
was treated as an 'inside' area.

We turned the corner and Exit 1 appeared. A dungeon entrance with an
ominous shade greeted us.

[You have found a hidden dungeon!]

[This dungeon has already been discovered by someone. You can't get the
first discovery achievement.]

[A new hidden scenario has arrived!]


  [Hidden Scenario – Theatre Dungeon]

  Category: Hidden

  Difficulty: A-

  Clear Conditions: Defeat the master of Theatre Dungeon.

  Time Limit: None

  Compensation: 4,000 coins

  Failure: ―


The surprised Lee Jihye hesitated and stepped back.

"…What is this? Theater Dungeon?"

Lee Gilyoung looked startled. Well, this must be the first time they
encountered a hidden scenario. Jung Heewon also spoke.

"A movie theatre as a dungeon… it sounds romantic."
Romantic. This was only because she didn't know how scary the movie
theatre could be. We entered the theatre. The familiar lobby of the
multiplex welcomed us.

[You have entered Theatre Dungeon.]

We were tense as we entered the bleak dungeon. It was a multiplex
consisting of nine floors, from B1 to the 8th floor.

"Hyung, the posters are torn. Who would do that?"

"I'm not sure."

I said this but I actually knew the truth.

The core of this 'Theatre Dungeon' were the 'posters' on the wall. Perhaps
Yoo Joonghyuk defeated every poster as he went upstairs. His intentions
were to sweep up all the rewards.

Except for the torn posters, nothing strange was found on B1. There were
no items and no monsters. The only exception was the smashed elevator in
one corner with a distrted door.

Lee Jihye asked.

"Isn't this a dungeon? Why isn't there anything?"

"Something will appear."

"…Do you know something?"

"A little."

"How? Something is fishy about ahjussi. Is this your second life?"

That was her master. But he had lived three times.
Then Jung Heewon said, "It is due to the sponsor behind Dokja-ssi."

"…Really?"

I ignored the two women and tried to move to the ground floor when I was
caught by Lee Gilyoung. The cockroach on his head was moving wildly.
Lee Jihye drew her sword at almost the same moment I covered her mouth
with a hand.

"Shhh, there is somebody else besides us."

I breathed out while small sounds started to be heard. Just upstairs. Then…
the lobby? I first thought it was Yoo Joonghyuk but it wasn't Yoo
Joonghyuk's voice.

"…Are you sure? Here… there are a bunch of things."

"Yes. I bought the information with 1,000 coins."

"The prophets?"

"Yes. They are disgusting but the information is obvious."

I heard the sound of people talking. We went up the escalator and
approached them. It seemed that four people were gathered in the lobby on
the 1st floor.

Lee Jihye whispered, "Who are they? I never once saw their faces in
Chungmuro."

"Maybe they came from the ground side entrance."

"Ground side? Isn't that filled with poisonous fog? Furthermore, the
scenario―"

"Different stations have different scenarios at different speeds. There
are those who have finished the scenario faster than our station. If there
is a weak poisoning, they can eat the meat from the underground
species." I said this but I was confused.

'Prophets?'

There was no information about such people in Yoo Joonghyuk's life. At
this point, Yoo Joonghyuk and I should be the only ones who knew about
the hidden dungeon.

What caused the variables? Needless to say, I needed to find out.

"Then let's go inside."

A blue spotlight was floating above the men talking. A bright light
surrounded them and then they disappeared.

"…What happened to them?"

Jung Heewon asked me but I didn't answer. Instead, I was searching the
posters on the wall. This was torn, that as well… by the time I reached the
end of the wall, only one wasn't torn. I read the words written on the poster.

Steven Spielberg, Samuel L Jackson, Jeff Goldblum…

That bastard Yoo Joonghyuk… he left this one alone? As expected from the
third regression.

At that moment, the light came on again. This time, the spotlight was aimed
on us. The surprised Lee Jihye and Lee Gilyoung stepped back, but there
was no way to avoid it. The word 'ray' suited it.

I asked Jung Heewon, "Heewon-ssi likes movies?"

"Of course. Do you usually like it?"

"You might hate it after this."
"What do you―"

[You have been hit by a projection light.]

[The screening will begin.]

The surrounding landscape started to slowly change. It wasn't a simple
illusion so Fourth Wall wasn't activated as before. The old linoleum floor
became covered with green bushes, while the reception desk and popcorn
stand turned into a lush rainforest. The ceiling turned into a blue sky with
no clouds and no end in sight. Lee Jihye muttered in a small voice.

"Where the hell is this place?"

Lee Jihye shouted and hacked at the surrounding trees and bushes, but
nothing changed. Lee Gilyoung started looking for insects with a calm
expression.

I tried to touch the nearby trees. It had a hard and moist texture. It was a
real rainforest from the Mesozoic era. This was a different realism from the
specter's Phantom Prison. This was the power of the theatre master on the
dungeon's 8th floor.

"It is a movie."

"…Really ridiculous things are happening."

A novel had become reality. There was no law that a movie couldn't
become reality as well.

Jung Heewon was a fast adaptor and quickly understood.

"Ahjussi, what movie is this?"

"You'll know soon."

"…Can't you just let me know? Wait a minute, what is this kid doing…?"
At this moment, the shrubbery moved and something jumped out in front of
Lee Gilyoung. An insect that resembled a giant praying mantis. The size
was approximately 40cm. Lee Jihye was terrified and cried out.

"Hey Kid! Back away!"

However, Lee Gilyoung responded calmly to the fuss.

"It isn't a praying mantis. It is a Titanoptera from the Triassic period.

"What?"

Lee Gilyoung stretched out his hand to the titano. The insect didn't refuse
the touch and after a moment, Lee Gilyoung and the insect's body was
wrapped in a blue light.

Lee Jihye watched with a stupid expression.

"This… what?"

"Fabre."

It really was good that I brought Lee Gilyoung. This guy's ability might
allow us to pass through the gateway more easily.

The giant praying mantis moved its big mouth and Lee Gilyoung nodded. I
didn't know what it involved but they were having a conversation. After a
while, Lee Gilyoung paled as he talked to the praying mantis.

…What was it?

Lee Gilyoung hurriedly turned to me.

"Hyung!"
As he spoke, the sound of the earth shaking was heard. It seemed that
something was coming at a tremendous speed, smashing the huge palm
trees.

Kuoooooh!

The muzzle of the giant reptile that appeared through the rainforest was
covered with reddish blood. Some bloody men were running in front of it. It
was the men who entered before us.

"Kuaaack!"

"S-Save me!"

Lee Jihye stepped back and spoke to Jung Heewon.

"I know what movie this is."

"…Yes, me too."

A body that was over a dozen meters tall and hard skin. Fierce muscles
dominated the entire body. The strongest predator of the Mesozoic Era was
in front of us.

At first glance, it was similar to a grade 7 monster. The difficulty level was
atrocious considering this was the 1st floor of the dungeon. But my heart
just thumped. The harder the hidden dungeon, the better the reward.

I pulled out a blade and said, "Get ready to fight."

Maybe Yoo Joonghyuk skipped only this movie because of the contents.
The main reward of Theater Dungeon was related to the movie contents.
Yoo Joonghyuk probably thought there weren't any worthy rewards in a
movie where dinosaurs appeared. But he didn't know.

In this movie, a really important reward was hidden.
"…Are you serious? We are going to fight that?"

"We need to beat it to make an exit."

"The exit?"

"It is a long movie. Have you forgotten?"

A T-rex was approaching quickly. The island's central laboratory was seen
behind it. And an escape helicopter was on the rooftop of the laboratory.

This was a movie. A movie that the master of Theater Dungeon made into
reality.

Therefore, there was only one way to escape from here.

"Let's make a great ending."
             Chapter 38: Ep. 9 – Omniscient Sunfish, II


The moment the yellow eyes looked at us, a deafening roar echoed in our
ears.

Kuoooooh!

[The 7th grade, Tyrannosaurus Rex has recognized you.]

[The 'Tyrannosaurus Rex' has triggered the 'Fear the Predator' skill!]

[The exclusive skill Fourth Wall has blocked the effect of the 'Fear the
Predator' skill.]

My mind was calm thanks to Fourth Wall, but I could stop the chills that
occurred. This was the fear towards a predator.

"Everyone, get out of the way!"
The petrified Jung Heewon and Lee Jihye regained their spirits. I fell back
with Lee Gilyoung beside me.

Kwa kwa kwa kwa!

A long tail flew through the forest in front of us.

"Kuaaack!"

The men who were running fell on the backs and coughed up blood.
Fortunately, Jung Heewon and Lee Jihye were away from the danger zone.

I shouted to Lee Gilyoung lying down next to me.

"Gilyoung fall back, while Heewon-ssi and Jihye-ssi scatter to the left and
right!"

Then a message popped up.

[The character 'Lee Gilyoung' has activated the 'Dinosaur Book' skill!]

…Huh?

"Tyrannosaurus are agile compared to their size, but they are vulnerable
due to their narrow field of view."

"…What?"

"I saw it in a book when I was a child."

"When you were a child?"

"…Younger than I am now."

I stared blankly at Lee Gilyoung. This wasn't the time to tackle it.

Kuoooooh!
[The exclusive skill 'Purest Sword Force' has been activated.]

I started waving the iridescent blade to attract the attention of the T-Rex.
Lee Jihye and Jung Heewon weren't tankers. I didn't even need to mention
Lee Gilyoung. Therefore, I was the only one who could take the risk here.

"While I draw its attention, attack its rear―"

I hadn't finished talking when I saw Lee Jihye and Jung Heewon already at
the T-Rex's rear. They noticed quickly.

Kuoooooh!

I barely avoided the incoming teeth and the stomping legs. Before I could
wield Unbroken Faith, its tail passed over my head. An electrifying thrill
swept over my body. I wouldn't die because my physique was over level 20,
but it was dizzying.

Maybe I had been lucky until now. I might be the 'sunfish' rather than Yoo
Joonghyuk.

Sukak! Supaak!

Meanwhile, Jung Heewon and Lee Jihye was steadily dealing damage from
the rear. It was a combination of 'Sword Training' and 'Kendo'. Noticeable
sword wounds were being dealt to the T-Rex's big legs. If this continued, it
might take some time but the T-Rex would be defeated.

"Hyung! I'll draw its attention!"

The boy didn't listen to me about staying in the rear.

"No, Gilyoung you―"

"I can do it!"
All of a sudden, Lee Gilyoung came forward and started to make an
unknown signal. I wanted to say something. Then a huge praying mantis
came from somewhere, stabbed the T-Rex's eyes and fled. It was the Titano
that Lee Gilyoung had been talking to before.

Kuooooh!

The T-Rex's eyes moved confusedly as it followed the praying mantis that
disturbed its vision. Lee Gilyoung used dazzling hand movements to
control the praying mantis. I looked at Lee Gilyoung with a fresh mindset.

Wasn't this guy actually a hugely fraudulent character? No wonder why
Yoo Joonghyuk coveted him.

Kuwoooh!

Thanks to Lee Gilyoung's success, the battlefield quickly became
advantageous. The T-Rex's movements became duller while a red light
shone in Jung Heewon and Lee Jihye's eyes.

[Demon Slayer].

It made them vulnerable to mental attacks but it was a good skill that made
them stronger when they were excited. The sight of the two women's eyes
burning as they watched the rainforest was truly spectacular.

It was a pity that I had lost Lee Jihye to Yoo Joonghyuk. However, Jung
Heewon also had overwhelming growth potential. Judge of Destruction was
a good attribute and she didn't have a sponsor yet.

It felt like the T-Rex's stamina had decreased considerably. It was time to
deal the final blow.

[Blade of Faith is activated!]
I started to focus my remaining magic power. I didn't have a sponsor, nor
was I as fast as Jung Heewon or Lee Jihye. But that didn't mean my attack
power was weak. I had a fraudulent system that overcame all of this.

Kuoooooh!

Ether Blade.

[The special option of Unbroken Faith is activated.]

[The ether property is converted to 'fire'.]

An enormous amount of magic power was sucked in and my physical
fatigue became extreme. But I didn't mind because there was a way to
supplement it later.

The blade increased by one meter and was surrounded by flames.

I ran to the rear of the Tyrannosaurus.

"Everybody out of the way!"

The moment that the Tyrannosaurus hesitated and its movements slowed, I
climbed its tail. I almost fell over a few times because I didn't have the
'Sense of Balance' but I somehow held on by stabbing the blade into the
epidermis.

Kuoooooh!

The T-Rex poured out blood and its body rolled across the ground. I
rammed the blade in wherever I could. Flames poured into the wounds
caused by the blade.

The yellow eyes of the T-Rex stared at me as it gasped painfully, before
finally dying.

[You have succeeded in being the first to hunt the 7th grade species
'Tyrannosaurus Rex!']

[You have obtained 1,000 coins as compensation.]

"Ah…we really got it."

"I knew we could do it."

Jung Heewon breathed heavily as she spoke with a proud expression on her
face. She could be proud because the T-Rex was top-ranked among the 7th
grade monsters. Lee Jihye belatedly rushed towards me.

"I had it!"

"What? It would've taken a long time if you continued hitting it like

that." I wiped off my sword while speaking. Jung Heewon asked.

"But was a Tyrannosaurus killed in this movie?"

"No but isn't this more fun?"

"…Huh?"

"The genre is fantasy, action and adventure. This should be enough."

At this moment, a system message flashed in my head.

[The theater owner is satisfied with the changed ending of the movie.]

Jung Heewon screamed like it was absurd.

"Eek?"

Yes. The strategy of Theatre Dungeon wasn't to see the 'real ending'.
If so, Yoo Joonghyuk wouldn't have been able to beat this dungeon. It was
to create the desired ending for the 'theatre master' at the core of this
dungeon. Please note that the theatre owner was an extreme psychopath.

"Do you understand now? We just need to smash it."

In other words, if we removed all the obstacles to the ending, the movie
would end naturally.

[Now you can move to the next floor.]

[Go to the helipad on top of the research laboratory.]

"We will move in a little while. We have to get some rewards."

I started exploring the area around the T-Red. Soon after, I found one of the
guys who entered before us. The rest were eaten or mutilated by the T-Rex.
"Hey, wake up."

"U-Uwooh…"

Blood was constantly flowing from the man. The wounds were from the
TRex's claws. The bones were revealing, making it obvious that this person
couldn't recover.

"Breathe slowly."

"C-Cough! …Alive…"

I fed the man drinking water I had brought in. The man drank some water
before coughing up blood again. I was forced to urgently ask him questions.

"How did you come here?"

"P-Prophet…"

"Who are the prophets?"
The man's breathing was getting rougher.

"R-Revelation… received…"

…Revelation?

"I want to… live…"

Blood burst out from the man's mouth. He finally died. Jung Heewon and
the others came up behind me.

"That person…?"

I shook my head and looked down at the fallen man.

'Revelation'. What funny bullshit.

As far as I knew, only Anna Croft had the ability of 'Future Sight' in Ways
of Survival.

Then there was only one answer.

…There was someone else besides me. But they didn't know as much as I
did. The proof was that they didn't dare come here in person to test out the
information.

"Dokja-ssi?"

"Take a break."

We covered the man's body with a large lead and gathered near the dad
TRex. W had to hurry to pursue Yoo Joonghyuk. But if we didn't get
enough rest, the party would be wiped out before we met him.

I searched the T-Rex's body.
I looked at the head and heart but unfortunately, I couldn't find any monster
cores. That didn't mean there was no income. Jung Heewon drooled as she
watched the T-Rex being cooked over the fire.

"…Can we eat this?"

"We can eat it because it is cooked with magic flames. The unripe parts can
be cooked with the Magic Power Stove."

We sat side by side around the T-Rex's leg. As we cut the cooked flesh of
the T-Rex little by little, steam rose. Lee Gilyoung shouted.

"Fresh meat!"

Lee Jihye hurriedly rushed up and grabbed a pierce first. The rest of the
group, including myself, also picked large pieces of flesh. Meat of this size?
It was a luxury that couldn't be dreamt of back when I was an office
worker. Lee Jihye closed her eyes while enjoying the taste. Then she
murmured in an ecstatic voice.

"Ah, the best taste in the world…"

It really was delicious.


The fat was properly wrapped around the muscles, making it different from
the ground rats. The feeling every time I took a bit… If Yoo Sangah was
here, she would've cried.

After I consumed the meat, I felt my stamina recovering. The meat of an
advanced species had these special effects. However, caution was required
in some cases. Jung Heewon sighed.

"Phew… I ate well. It is really delicious but I will cry if I eat anymore."

We had a moderate rest and then headed straight to the laboratory in the
center of the island.
We encountered several raptors on the way but they were easy after the
TRex.

There were many flasks and ampoules in the laboratory. There were small
incubators containing dinosaur embryos and blood samples collected. There
was only one thing missing.

My eyes caught a few items as we entered the inner corridor.

[Physique Enhancing Ampoule]

[Magic Power Enhancing Ampoule]

[Agility Enhancing Ampoule]

[Strength Enhancing Ampoule]

As expected, it was here. I started to pack the ampoules. Just like the
Ichthyosaur's Core, these comprehensive stat growth items were available
only in the early scenarios.

It wasn't just one or two ampoules. There were close to 20 bottles. If this
was the case, my stats would be able to level up explosively. It was in
anticipation of this hidden scenario that I saved coins instead of investing
them in my stats.

These ampoules were only available when the corresponding stat was less
than level 30.

"Ahjussi, what did you find now?"

…Ah, this ghost-like girl.

"What? Physique Enhancement Ampoule?"

Lee Jihye's eyes shone as she grabbed one ampoule.
"Are you trying to eat these alone?"

"Eat them all? Of course I will share it."

"Unni, look at this! Ahjussi…!"

The other people in the party came closer due to the turmoil. Jung Heewon
was shocked when she checked the item information.

"Oh my god… what are these items?"

"…This is a hidden scenario."

I spoke with a bit of disgruntlement. Damn, this was a bit difficult. I didn't
catch the T-Rex alone so taking all the items pricked my conscience…

[Some constellations are displeased with the situation.]

Lee Jihye looked at the Strength Enhancement Ampoule and opened her
mouth.

"Can you give me the Strength Enhancement Ampoule? I am a bit lacking
in strength."

[The exclusive skill, Character List is activated.]

It was a summary version that only contained the comprehensive stats.

This damn girl…

"Huh? Heewon unni, can't I have it?"

"Um, Dokja-ssi was the one who discovered it so it is his decision…"

Frankly, it didn't matter if the other party members received them but
giving them to Lee Jihye was a bit of a waste. She was part of Yoo
Joonghyuk's group anyway.
[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' expects your fairness.]

Fairness… yes, let's pick the most unbiased game I knew.

I smiled and made a suggestion.

"How about rock paper scissors?"

"Rock paper scissors?"
"There will be one winner at the end."

Greed filled Lee Jihye's face.


"Okay!"

"Well… I will do what Dokja-ssi wants. But is it okay? It could be a
mistake."

"Then doesn't that mean he is unlucky?"

Lee Jihye asked. She was excited at the thought of getting a share of the
items.

"Let's start with a Strength Enhancement Ampoule."

I put out the Strength Enhancement Ampoule and said to Lee Jihye.

"You will face me."

"I'm good at rock paper scissors. Will it be okay?"

"Ah, is that so?"

I smiled at Lee Jihye.

[Exclusive skill, Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint stage 1 has been

[The character 'Lee Jihye' has prepared 'scissors'. ]
             Chapter 39: Ep. 9 – Omniscient Sunfish, III


[The constellation 'Secretive Plotter' is curious about your scam.]

[Constellations have sponsored you 200 coins.]

The winner of the rock paper scissors was decided in an instant. Lee
Gilyoung's face was slightly flushed while Jung Heewon had a satisfied
expression. Lee Jihye flopped to the ground with a devastated expression.

"…This is ridiculous!"

Unfortunately, I couldn't read Lee Gilyoung's mind so two ampoules went
to him.

"You don't have to give it to me…"

"Take it."

He was cute. I stroked Lee Gilyoung's head.
In addition, Jung Heewon won two Physique Enhancement Ampoules. Jung
Heewon received them with a smile.

"Thank you. It was tough so far with my physique."

It was only Lee Jihye who didn't obtain any ampoules.

"How can you beat me 18 out of 20 times? Did you cheat?"

"I am originally good at rock paper scissors."

"Are you really going to do this? Can't you give me just one…"

"You have Yoo Joonghyuk."

I ignored Lee Jihye's whines and packed the ampoules.

Jung Heewon patted the shoulder of the grouchy Lee Jihye while staring at
Lee Jihye's shining sword.

"Little sister, the world has to be fair."




Dudududu. There was the sound of the helicopter's propellers. Lee
Gilyoung looked at the distant dinosaur island and asked, "Hyung, can't I
take it to the next floor?"

The big praying mantis was sitting in Lee Gilyoung's lap and talking to Lee
Gilyoung. The praying mantis rubbed its antenna against Lee Gilyoung's
jaw.

"Unfortunately, you can't take it."

Lee Gilyoung's hugged the praying mantis with a sad expression.
"…Take care Titano."

Kwiiik.

He had already given it a name. Unfortunately, monsters created in Theatre
Dungeon couldn't move to another floor.

However, items could be taken to other floors. For example, I had the
ampoules that increased stats and the item I was now holding.

[Tyrant T-Rex's DNA Ampoule]

The golden ampoule was the most decisive reason for choosing this movie.
It was an item that increased all stats by 10 for 30 minutes after ingestion.
Although it had the disadvantage that it could only be used in Theatre
Dungeon, it was impossible to break through the last floor of this dungeon
without this item.

Especially if Yoo Joonghyuk was in the worst situation as I thought.

The praying mantis that Lee Gilyoung released flew in the air and the dark
sky started to collapse.

[The first 'Ending Credit' has been reached.]

[Performers: Kim Dokja, Jung Heewon, Lee Jihye, Lee Gilyoung.]

[You have obtained 500 coins as compensation.]

I felt some dizziness and we appeared on the ground floor again. After we
escaped, the movie posted on the wall was torn. It was evidence that we
safely cleared it. Lee Jihye was complaining.

"Do you have to pass a few more floors like this?"

"Yoo Joonghyuk will have broken most of it so it will be faster than you
think."
We headed straight to the second floor via the escalator. From the second
floor, the remaining space was narrow because it was the full-fledged
theatre. Jung Heewon asked.

"There's no change?"

No matter how long we waited, the environment on the second floor didn't
change. The camera wasn't seen and the screening didn't start either.
Looking closer, all the posters on the second floor were torn. Lee Jihye
noticed something.

"Is it only the movies whose posters are intact?"

I checked the torn posters one by one.

Pacific Rim directed by Guillermo del Toro… a giant robots righting
movie?
Too bad. If this had been intact then I could've gotten the reward of
Hardened Gloves.

Inception directed by Christopher Nolan… it was good that this one was
torn.

"Wow, I wanted to watch this."

I saw the poster that Lee Jihye was looking at.

"Do you like superheroes?

"Yes."

"It is fortunate. Otherwise you would hate it after this."

"…I see."

On the torn poster, a green monster was roaring at us.We went straight up
to the third floor.
"It is the same here."

All the posters on the third floor were torn as well. Yoo Joonghyuk had
properly swept through it. It was fortunate since there were a lot of
dangerous movies on the third floor.

Final Destination directed by James Wong… that bastard Yoo Joonghyuk,
how did he break this? This was an annihilation movie.

"We are going up faster than I expected?"

Unlike Jung Heewon's bright voice, I was nervous every time we climbed a
floor. Clearing the Theatre Dungeon required some luck. Some of the
posters on each floor weren't covered in Ways of Survival. Yoo Joonghyuk
didn't clear all movies.

There was a system message when we entered the fourth floor.

[You have entered the fourth floor.]

The spotlight poured down without giving me time to look at the posters.
Jung Heewon gathered both hands together and prayed.

"Please don't be a ghost movie…"

I glanced at Jung Heewon and she gave me an excuse.

"Ghosts can't be killed with a sword."

…This was the reason.

[The screening has started!]

The background changed and when we opened our eyes, a sea breeze blew
on the prow of a ship.

"This…?"
Salt was felt in my mouth and the open horizon spread out before me. I was
enraptured by the scenery of the sea. I had been working every day and it
had been a few years since I've travelled anywhere.

"What is this movie?"

Next to me, Jung Heewon was wearing a full length dress.

A violin sound was heard from the inside of the cruise ship and there was
the sound of excited people. It was an incredibly romantic atmosphere from
a
movie…

Oh, I know what this movie is.

Then Lee Jihye's voice was heard. "Oh, accelerating all of a sudden…"

I looked back and saw that Lee Jihye was vomiting. Jung Heewon rushed
over and patted her back. After vomiting for a long time, Lee Jihye said.

"Uh, I get seasick."

"It is okay, just vomit."

…I had wondered this since a while ago. Why did the Duke of Loyalty and
Warfare choose Lee Jihye? No, I read the novel but I just didn't want to
know.

"But Unni… is this the movie? The boat that sinks."

"It seems so."

"Then… perhaps Unni is 'Kate Winslet?'"

Lee Jihye looked at Jung Heewon's dress like she was envious, then she
looked at me.
"Then ahjussi is… DiCaprio? Uweeeek!"

I felt somehow grumpy when I saw her vomiting after saying that. At this
time, Lee Gilyoung emerged from behind me.

"Hyung!"

Lee Gilyoung was dressed in formal clothing. This clothing was somewhat
familiar…

Anyway, everyone was gathered.

"There is no time."

The ship was now sinking. Unfortunately, the solution to this movie didn't
appear in Ways of Survival.

How could we beat the Titanic? Was it a fight with the sea?

Lee Jihye was the first to comment.

"The ship is sinking anyway. Do we just have to sink with it?"

"That is a little…"

It was frustrating. It would've been better if the movie had a clear enemy to
crush.

"Let's look for the villain hyung."

This was Lee Gilyoung's opinion. I didn't know if there was an obvious
villain this movie., But since I couldn't think of anything else, I decided to
follow it.

"Then let's handle the villain."
We started moving. By the way, who was this movie's villain? The last time
I watched the Titanic…

But I didn't need to worry. The villain came to find us. A man in a clean
suit was staring over here.

"Jack Dawson!"

Wait, Jack Dawson… the role that DiCaprio played? But the man wasn't
looking at me.

"…Me?"

…He was DiCaprio? I sighed as I looked at Lee Gilyoung.




After a while, we kidnapped a person we thought was the villain of the
movie. But the theater master didn't respond. It wasn't enough to kidnap
him…

I hesitated for a moment before opening my mouth.

"Then…"

"Let's kill him."

Lee Jihye pulled out her sword and pointed it. It was at a man struggling
while his body was tied up.

"The theater master is a psychopath? Then isn't the answer to kill him
quickly?"

I thought so as well. No, I was sure of it.

It was the answer to another movie like this in Ways of Survival. But Jung
Heewon gazed at the man in horror and unexpected said,

"But…he looks like a real person."

"…Huh?"

"This is a movie but he is just like a real person."

It was surprising that Jung Heewon said this when she had been neatly
subjugating the weak a few days ago. Then again, Jung Heewon had said
something like this: 'I might be a killer but I don't want to become a
monster'.

Lee Jihye asked, "Unni, what are you saying this type of sentimental thing
now? You don't want to kill him?"

"No, that isn't it…"

"It is good to save people. But if this person doesn't die, we will die. We are
definitely alive but this guy is just a character!"

Characters…

I felt bemused at Lee Jihye's words.

Jung Heewon looked at me. "…Do you think so?"

"Even if this guy is a 'real' person, he is still a bad guy! Why is killing him
bad?"

Lee Jihye's words might be right. This guy was definitely a villain of the
scenario and would do bad things. So it was okay to kill him. Funnily
enough, it was the logic that Yoo Joonghyuk often spoke about in Ways of
Survival.

The moment I opened my mouth, Lee Jihye hurriedly drew her sword.
"Sigh, what is this? Master could be dying right now!"

The blade descended and pierced the man's chest. Blood poured out. It was
incredibly realistic. Then a system message was heard.

[The theater owner is satisfied with the changed ending of the movie.]

[The stern of the ship will lead to the next floor.]

"Look, I did it properly. Right?"

Lee Jihye shouted triumphantly.

The answer obviously wasn't wrong. The theater master acknowledged this
and the constellations would give coins for our actions. We would survive
with these coins.

It was a way of living that destroyed this world.

[The second 'Ending Credit' has been reached.]

[Performers: Kim Dokja, Jung Heewon, Lee Jihye, Lee Gilyoung.]

[You have obtained 500 coins as compensation.]

We weren't able to get a reward item from Titanic. Thus, we went straight
to the next floor and followed the guidance of the system message.

[You have entered the fifth floor, the rewards room.]

Once we climbed the escalator, the rewards room finally showed up.

"Rewards room? It isn't a scary movie?"

"This is an exhibition hall. It was a place they used to show original movie
props."
In fact, I knew this but I once again acted ignorant.

Various movie props appeared in glass tubes. Equipment and costumes
used by the main characters of various movies, stage accessories… The
funny thing was that they were no longer props.

Jung Heewon approached a glass tube and shouted.

"Oh my god, look at this!"

[Mikazuki Munechika – Replica] A-grade sword.

Jung Heewon's eyes sparkled as she looked at the glass tube and I nodded.

"You've finally obtained a proper sword, Heewon-ssi."

"Whoa…"

It was obviously a great sword at first glance. The originally groll horn
knife wasn't comparable and it wasn't lacking when compared to Lee
Jihye's blade.

Jung Heewon started to swing the sword in his hand.

"Isn't this amazing? It is light and moves properly!"

I had never seen Jung Heewon like this.

[The character 'Jung Heewon' is deeply grateful to you.]

It was nothing.

The main purpose of targeting the Theatre Dungeon was the 'compensation'
of the fifth floor. The Theatre Dungeon was a good place to farm for items
early on. In particular, Jung Heewon would become stronger with this
weapon.
[The reward items are limited to two per person.]

It wasn't a genuine 'star relic', it was just a movie prop, but the replica
version had characteristics of the original item. A-grade items were close to
a scam in the early stages.

By the way, Yoo Joonghyuk had already passed through here. Two items
were already gone.

"Pick your items. Each one can only obtain two so choose carefully."

I told Jung Heewon to pick an item Yoo Sangah could use while I found
one for Lee Hyunsung. This one seemed useable.

[Heracles' Shield- Replica] A-grade shield.

Good… It was an item that couldn't be compared with the Old Iron Shield. I
thought of how Lee Hyunsung's eyes would shine with loyalty towards me
and already felt warm.

Lee Jihye, who claimed to be a fan of superheroes, was trying to pull an
item from the corner.

"Ah, why can't I hold this?"

I came closer. This was it.

[Mjolnir – Replica] A-grade

blunt weapon.


The hammer of the god of lightning, Thor. It would've been an enormous
item if it was a genuine star relic… still, the quality of the original was so
great that the performance of the replica was significant.
I watched Lee Jihye groaning as she grabbed the hammer that couldn't be
moved.

"Isn't this an item that only someone special can use?"

"Damn, I'm not special?"

At this time, Lee Gilyoung came up behind her and reached out to Mjolnir.

"Hey Kid! This is mine…"

Mjolnir was lightly lifted by Lee Gilyoung's hands. Lee Gilyoung swung
the hammer around before looking at me.

"Hyung, can I have it?"

"Yes, it looks good."

Lee Jihye once again looked stunned.

"Only I am unhappy… just me…"

I ignored her and searched the remaining items. Let's see what was left.

[External Reinforced Suit – Replica] A-grade protective clothing.

I didn't know what would happen in the future but it would be nice to
supplement my defense. Once I wore the suit, it wrapped around my arms
and legs.

[Damage from external attacks is reduced by 10%.]

[The ability to detect enemies is improved.]

[You can move more agilely than before.]
It was a bit frustrating but it was still better than not wearing it. In
particular, I thought about the fight waiting at the end of this.

Now the preparations were finished.

Since there were no significant changes in the dungeon, it was clear that
Yoo Joonghyuk was alive. If we moved quickly through the sixth floor, we
might be able to meet on the seventh floor. In the worst case scenario, if he
was fighting the boss on the eighth floor… at least he was still alive.

Now, let's go and get our damn regressor back.
             Chapter 40: Ep. 9 – Omniscient Sunfish, IV


Unfortunately, Yoo Joonghyuk wasn't on the sixth floor.

The only comfort was that the movie on the sixth floor was easy. It was a
typical thriller directed by Bryan Singer. I knew the killer so it was possible
to clear it quickly.

[The theater owner is satisfied with the changed ending of the movie.]

[You have obtained 500 coins as compensation.]

Lee Jihye asked as if she was dumbfounded.

"…He was really the killer?"

"Don't tell me it is a spoiler? There is actually someone here who hasn't
seen
it."
[The constellation 'Secretive Plotter' hates spoilers.]

In any case, an item was rewarded due to the movie's unique characteristics.
[Skill Book: Calm Observation.]

Calm Observation. It was quite a useful skill.

This skill allowed the user to see the movements of the target and figure out
their overall stats. It didn't mean much to me since I could use Character
List, but it would be quite useful for people like Yoo Sangah and Lee
Gilyoung. This skill would be good against enemies excellent at acting.

[The exclusive skill 'Calm Observation' has been acquired.]

Still, I felt a bit sad. It would be nice to experience a movie like Gladiator.

I had yet to obtain a suitable combat passive skill. He might purchase the
skill Weapons Training but it wasn't a good idea to spend coins on the skill
right now.

"…Now I am tired of movies."

I agreed with Jung Heewon's words. I didn't want to look at a movie theatre
for a while. I should just be satisfied with the high performance fee.

We went directly up to the seventh floor. Maybe this time we could see
Yoo
Joonghyuk's back…

Damn. Most of the posters on the seventh floor were torn. Yes, Yoo
Joonghyuk was now in the boss room. Under these circumstances, there
was really no time to delay.

"Run. It is almost the last floor."

We started to run. We had to catch up with that guy as fast as possible.
Before he gave up everything.
We passed through the auditoriums and ran down the aisles. The posters on
the 7th floor were of Korean movies popular in the past.

Shit, please let all of them be torn…

However, unlike what I hoped, the last poster was still intact.

"Damn…"

[The screening will begin.]

The blue spotlight covered the party and the scene changed. My head spun
and a salty smell entered my nose.

The stage was the sea. But… this time it wasn't a cruise ship. There was the
smell of artillery. I could feel rough wood of the panokseon¹ deck.

The moment I turned my head on the shaky boat, I heard someone's voice.

"Everybody, down—!"

I reflexively fell down and there was a bombardment of gunfire around me.
Tang tang tang tang― A few soldiers collapsed while bleeding.

"Protect the ship―!"

The soldiers dressed in old military garb were rushing around. An uneasy
wind blew as war took place. The turbulent Myeongnyang Strait was
swirling and there was the distant sound of drums.

Dammit.

There was no Korean who didn't know this movie. It was because this
movie had been watched by most South Koreans.

Jung Heewon looked at the horizon and muttered.
"This… how can we win?"

The ending of Theater Dungeon would only open when the master was
satisfied.

Kukukukung!

300 Japanese warships filled the sea. I hurriedly confirmed the power on
our side. Still, this was a movie based on historical facts. There was hope.

"…What is this?"

There was only one Panokseon where there should be 12. I hurriedly
grabbed one of the sailors around him and asked.

"Where is the commander?"

"Comman…der?"

"Admiral Lee!"

The navy sailor had no idea at all. My chest became cold. It was different
from the movie I knew. The theatre master changed the story.

In no time, the enemy narrowed the distance. This was ridiculous. How
could we win the Battle of Myeongnyang without help from the Duke of
Loyalty and Warfare?

I looked around and hurriedly exclaimed.

"Lee Jihye!"
I thought that this might happen. If fact, I brought Lee Jihye not just for her
power but to consider the 'what if's'.

[The constellation 'Maritime War God' is sorry for Lee Jihye.]

It wasn't difficult to find Lee Jihye. There was only one boat and the place
where Duke of Loyalty and Warfare's messages could be heard was limited.

"U-Uhhhh…"

She was vomiting in a corner of the first floor deck.

"Hey, are you okay?

Lee Jihye looked up at me with moist eyes.

"I can't, I can't do it!"

This wasn't about me.

[The constellation 'Maritime War God' is encouraging 'Lee Jihye'.]

"Never, I will never do it! Oof…!"

She vomited once again.

I knew. The reason why this person was chosen by Duke of Loyalty and
Warfare, despite hating the sea.

[Due to the effect of your exclusive attribute, memories from the books you
have read will become stronger.]

In my head, a scene from the 40th chapter of Ways of Survival passed.

「 "Hey, how did she get chosen by the Duke of Loyalty and Warfare when
she is afraid of the sea?"
"I don't know. Um… maybe because she has the admiral in her ancestry?"

"…She is the descendent of the Duke of Loyalty and Warfare? 」

There was considerable criticism from a few readers apart from me who
made it to the 40th chapter of Ways of Survival.

No, did it make sense for her to have the blood of the great Duke of Loyalty
and Warfare?

But I had read all the chapters except for the epilogue of Ways of Survival
so I knew. Lee Jihye wasn't of the bloodline of the Duke of Loyalty and
Warfare.

[The constellation 'Maritime War God' misses his old friend when he sees
'Lee Jihye'.]

「 "Then are you a Lee from the Deoksu clan?"

"No, I am a Jeonju Lee." 」

[The constellation 'Maritime War God' looks at the descendant of an old
friend.]

Lee Jihye was the descendant of Lee Eokgi, the companion of the Duke of
Loyalty and Warfare.

Duke of Firmness and Compassion, Lee Eokgi.

Along with the Duke of Loyalty and Warfare, he led the navy to victory in
the Battle of Tanghangpo and the Battle of Hansan-do. He was one of the
few who defended the Duke of Loyalty and Warfare, Yi Sunsin when he
was arrested on unfair charges. However, he didn't have enough myths and
didn't become a sponsor.

[The constellation 'Maritime War God' is looking at 'Lee Jihye' with sad
eyes.]
Due to that, the Duke of Loyalty and Warfare selected Lee Jihye.

She wasn't his descendant but the descendant of his closest confidant.
Maybe it was simply the Duke of Loyalty and Warfare's choice.

Perhaps the Duke of Loyalty and Warfare didn't see it.

The fact that the descendant of his deceased confidant and friend would be
killed by his own hands and become a demon.

Well… this was according to the setting of Ways of Survival.

[A bounty scenario has occurred!]


  [Bounty Scenario – Those who seek death shall live. Those who seek
  life will die]

  Category: Sub

  Difficulty: B+

  Clear Conditions: The 'Maritime War God' is asking you for help.
  Encourage Lee Jihye, incarnation of Duke of Loyalty and Warfare, and
  win the Battle of Myeongnyang.

  Time Limit: 2 hours

  Compensation: A stigma from the Duke of Loyalty and Warfare.

  Failure: ―


I doubted my eyes for a moment.
The bounty scenarios were rarely requested by a constellation alone. I
looked closely because it was strange and saw that the reward was also
extraordinary.

…The stigma of the Duke of Loyalty and Warfare?

If I cleared this scenario, I would be able to use one of the Duke of Loyalty
and Warfare's stigmas without signing a contract. I shook Lee Jihye.

"Lee Jihye, stop it. Quickly."

"I don't want to! Urgh… The three of you can handle it!"

"Can't you endure it a little bit?"

"…Endure? Ahjussi doesn't know."

I didn't know…

Yes, this was her manner of talking. However, there was no time to accept
her childish actions.

"No, I know. You aren't like this because of seasickness."

"…What?"

"It is because your dead friend liked this movie."

Lee Jihye shook, like a boxer hit in the jaw. It was like a scene rushing into
her head. It was the first scenario at Daepo Girls' High School. She
strangled her friend with her bare hands.

"T-That… How did you…?"

"Don't ask how I know. There is no time to explain."

Lee Jihye looked up at me with blank eyes.
"You killed your friend with your own hands only to die like this?"

The first floor deck was pierced with a hook. I grabbed the hook shooting
towards Lee Jihye with my bare hands. Lee Jihye shook as she looked at
me. "You can run away here or not. You will never be forgiven. But―"

There were loud shouts. I could hear the sound of Japanese raiders jumping
on the ship.

"If you wake up now, at least you can save some people."

I came up onto the second floor deck with the trembling Lee Jihye.

Lee Gilyoung and Jung Heewon were already surrounded. I raised my
weapon. The enemies were ordinary Japanese soldiers. We wouldn't lose in
a one on one battle. The problem was that there were too many numbers.

"Kuaaak!"

I sliced at the incoming soldiers but couldn't seen an end to it. The enemy
ships were firing from a distance. We were finished if this ship sunk. The
movie would end tragically and we would die here.

"Lee Jihye!"

I realized the greatness of Yi Sunsin.

How did he lead this battle to victory?

"Wake up now!"

This was a cursed scenario. We didn't have Song Yeojung or Jung
Eungdoo. (Apparently close companions of Yi Sunsin)

All we had was a weak girl protected by the Duke of Loyalty and Warfare.
The girl staggered on the deck of the second floor.
"I-I'm disgusting. I…I don't deserve to be alive…"

Yes, it was disgusting. I was disgusting along with the way that I was using
her.

"No one would be qualified."

"U-Ughhh…"

Tears endlessly poured from Lee Jihye's eyes. I held Heracles' Shield and
stood in front of her.

Kwang! Kwaang! Kwaang!

"Survive and take responsibility! Atone for the rest of your life or live a
garbage life. Just somehow survive!"

The ship was being broken by the indiscriminate shelling. I turned to her
with cold eyes.

"Or do you really want to die here?"

[Your understanding of the character 'Lee Jihye' has increased.]

All types of emotions came from the crying Lee Jihye. She was drowning
in the dark emotions of resentment, self-contempt and disillusionment with
the world. Nevertheless, there was a straightforward emotion under it.

「 I don't want to die. 」

The constellations were selfish. There were those who didn't support their
incarnation or didn't care if their incarnation died or not. But.

As long as any constellation was in the stage of their 'myth', they wouldn't
turn away from their incarnation.
[The constellation 'Maritime War God' has responded to the will of 'Lee
Jihye'.]

A brilliant red light burst around Lee Jihye's body. It was good for Yoo
Joonghyuk but I didn't get nothing. I had something to gain.

[The character 'Lee Jihye' has received a new stigma.]

The third stigma of Sword Demon Lee Jihye. It was the strongest stigma
that would later make her a maritime admiral.

"…Your Majesty."

Lee Jihye held the hilt of her sword and looked at the sea. There were many
enemies and no allies. She quietly turned her sword towards the world.

"I still have 12 ships left."

A radiant beam emerged from the end of her sword.

[The character 'Lee Jihye' has activated the stigma 'Ghost Fleet Lv. 1!]

Water vapor rose in the area. Water sprayed all over the place and 12 ghost
ships appeared in the sea.

"Get revenge on the enemies."

The drumming paused like it was embarrassed. Shells flew towards the
ghost fleet. However, the ghost fleet was disembodied and didn't suffer any
damages.

"Die in this place."

Finally, Lee Jihye's fleet started to move forward. 12 ships moved through
the water, creating countless ripples. The white barrels started firing and the
ships blocking the path collapsed helplessly.
Kwa kwa kwa kwa kwa!

The girl who didn't cry led the battlefield.

In front of the ghost fleet, the warships were completely overwhelmed. It
wasn't just me., Jung Heewon and Lee Gilyoung also gaped at the scene.

This was the real power of a 'stigma'. It was the power of the admiral that
wasn't pushed by anyone in a maritime war.

In the fading light of the sunset, the screams of the Japanese were heard
from among the smoke. The whirlpool of Myeongnyang Strait sucked in
the dead bodies. It took less than an hour for the last enemy ship to
collapse.

[The theater owner is satisfied with the changed ending of the movie.]

[The fourth 'Ending Credit' has been reached.]

[Performers: Kim Dokja, Jung Heewon, Lee Jihye, Lee Gilyoung.]

[You have obtained 500 coins as compensation.]

As soon as we received the ending credit, additional messages came up.

[The bounty scenario is cleared.]

[You have received the Maritime War God's reward for the bounty
scenario.] Frankly, I was filled with expectations. Maybe I would get Ghost
Fleet. If I could just get it then I wouldn't be envious of Lee Jihye.

[The stigma 'Song of the Sword' has been acquired.]

I thought I heard wrong when the message popped up.
The stigma Song of the Sword. This was originally a stigma that Lee Jihye
acquired midway in the story. Yet the Duke of Loyalty and Warfare gave
me this stigma.

[The constellation 'Maritime War God' thanks you.]

In a sense, this skill was something I needed more than Ghost Fleet right
now. If I had this stigma, I might be able to prevent the worst from
happening on the eighth floor.

The surrounding scenery slowly changed and we returned to the inside of
the movie theatre. The exhausted Lee Jihye was staring at me.

"Ahjussi."

"You rest here. We will go to save Yoo Joonghyuk."

"But…"

"Listen up."

I obtained a new stigma but I didn't have time to laugh. No matter how
good the stigma, there was no meaning if this 'world' was over. In order to
prevent that 'end', I had to save Yoo Joonghyuk.

I distributed the ampoules I gathered to everyone. When raising the stats
level, the coins consumption was increased every 10 levels. Therefore, I
would use my coins first before the ampoules.

[4,000 coins have been consumed.]

[The comprehensive enhancement ampoules have been used.]

[Physique Lv. 18 -> Physique Lv. 24]

[Strength Lv. 18 -> Strength Lv. 24]
[Agility Lv. 11 -> Agility Lv. 20]

[Magic Power Lv. 10 -> Magic Power Lv. 15]

[All stats have increased significantly!]

We climbed the last stairway.

"Everyone, get ready."

[You have entered the eighth floor, the Heavenly Garden.]

The eighth floor of the theatre was a rooftop. It was a small dome
reminiscent of an opera house. As soon as I stepped on the green grass of
the rooftop, I found the back of the regressor I was looking for.

Ah…

When I thought about all those who would suffer if he died, my anger
soared. Fortunately, the back of his head was good enough to be hit.

"Hey Yoo Joonghyuk!"

I ran towards Yoo Joonghyuk and hit him in the back of the head.



[1] Panokseon ("board roofed" ship) – an oar and sail propelled Korean
ship that was the main class of warship used by Joseon during the late 16th
century.
             Chapter 41: Ep. 9 – Omniscient Sunfish, V


The cold sensation numbed my fingers. Dammit, I really wanted to beat this
guy up. But…

There was something strange.

"…Yoo Joonghyuk?"

This guy, he didn't look back. A grey-white aura was flowing from Yoo
Joonghyuk's body. The aura felt ominous and caused my hairs to rise.

I instinctively took a step back. Looking closer, the aura was connected to
an old man sitting on a chair on the eighth floor. I knew everything the
moment I saw this old man.

[The 'Theatre Master's Simulacrum' has been revealed.]

…Dammit, it had become like this. Yoo Joonghyuk emanated the whitish
aura and slowly turned towards me. It was the worst situation.
[The 'Theatre Master's Simulacrum' has controlled the character 'Yoo
Joonghyuk'.]

Goosebumps covered my entire body. A formidable killing intent was
rising from the guy who lost all sense of reason. There was no 'character' in
the world who could stop this guy now.

[The character 'Yoo Joonghyuk' has used Force Palm Lv.

4!] I barely managed to open my mouth.

"W-Wait a minute!"

Kwaaaang!

I experienced a strong pain in my side and my consciousness became numb.
As this person who did as he liked shot forward, pages flipped through my
head. I was alert.

「 …The 8th turn Yoo Joonghyuk didn't die in Theatre Dungeon because
he was weak. Strictly speaking, Yoo Joonghyuk wasn't lucky.

The boss of the 'Theatre Dungeon' is the worst opponent for a regressor lie
Yoo Joonghyuk… 」

My breathing was back.

"Kuhup…heook."

[The External Reinforced Suit is damaged.]

[There is a reduction in the defense.]

I got up while holding my abdomen. It was a really nonsensical attack
power. I ate so many ampoules yet still received this much damage from
one blow?
One blow dealt huge damage and I was blown away to the other side of the
rooftop.

[The character 'Jung Heewon' has used Demon Slaying Lv. 2!]

In the distance, Jung Heewon's eyes were burning. I tried to get up but my
body wasn't listening to me.

[The character 'Yoo Joonghyuk' has used Hundred Steps Godly Fists Lv.
4!]

The current Jung Heewon wasn't Yoo Joonghyuk's opponent. She could
endure a few blows due to Demon Slaying but blood started to emerge
from Jung Heewon's mouth.

Yoo Joonghyuk was much stronger than I expected.

This bastard. He activated a new stigma.

Transmission. It was a stigma that allowed Yoo Joonghyuk to wake up the
skills he had in the past over time. Through this stigma, Yoo Joonghyuk
would become a full-scale monster.

"Master!"

At this time, Lee Jihye came upstairs. The jerk flying towards Jung Heewon
turned towards Lee Jihye.

Kwa kwa kwa kwa!

"Kyaaack!"

Thanks to the favour of the Duke of Loyalty and Warfare or maybe Ghost
Walk, Lee Jihye fortunately avoided the blow. I shouted toward Lee Jihye.
"He is being controlled! Go after the theater master!"

However, Lee Jihye wasn't free enough to do so. In the end, we couldn't
reach the theatre master without going through Yoo Joonghyuk.

Jung Heewon and Lee Jihye's eyes crossed. Their swords moved towards
Yoo Joonghyuk at the same time.

It was the combo of Kendo and Sword Training. But the combo that
damaged even the T-Rex didn't work on Yoo Joonghyuk.

"Kuheok!"

Lee Jihye was hit in the face with Hundred Steps Godly Fists, spat out
blood and collapsed.

[The character 'Jung Heewon' has activated the exclusive skill 'Judgment
Time'.]

[Constellations of the Absolute Good system are silent at Jung Heewon's
request.]

[The skill has been cancelled.]

Jung Heewon cursed.

"Dammit…not this guy as well?"

It was natural. Yoo Joonghyuk was ruthless but his essence was 'righteous'.

Jung Heewon was hit by a force punch and lost her sword, rolling across
the ground. In this desperate moment, Lee Gilyoung used the special skill
'Mjolnir's Thunder' from behind me.

Kukukung!
[The character 'Yoo Joonghyuk' has offset the impact of the attack with
'Lightning Resistance'.

Yoo Joonghyuk looked this way. Shit. I knew he would be strong but… this
much? I touched Lee Gilyoung's shoulder and staggered forward.

"Gilyoung. Please. Do you know what to do?"

Lee Gilyoung quickly noticed and immediately nodded.

"Yes, hyung."

"I'm sorry."

"No."

Lee Gilyoung started to mumble something straight away. Lee Gilyoung's
pupils slowly reversed. I didn't want to do this but now I had to mobilize all
my cards.

[You have used the Tyrant T-Rex's DNA Ampoule.]

[All stats will explosively increase for 30 minutes!]

Yes…let's fight you son of a bitch.


[Physique Lv. 24 -> Physique Lv. 34]

[Strength Lv. 24 -> Strength Lv. 34]

[Agility Lv. 20 -> Agility Lv. 30]

[Magic Power Lv. 15 -> Magic Power Lv. 25]

[The vitality in your body is rising!]

[The potential of your muscles have exploded!]
[You can move more agilely than before.]

[Your heart is seething with an unknown energy!]

The gap in insufficient skills was filled with overwhelming stats.

If Yoo Joonghyuk's Transmission was complete, it would be a useless
gamble. But it was possible since the skill level was low.

Still, it would only be for a moment. This moment was good.

[The exclusive skill 'Purest Sword Force Lv. 1' has been activated.]

[The accumulation of stats will increase the level of Purest Sword Force!]

[Purest Sword Force Lv. 1 -> Purest Sword Force Lv. 2.]

The feeling of the magic power at my fingertips changed. I didn't have to
run as he rushed towards me first. I realized my momentum was unusual as
he pulled out his sword for the first time.

[The character 'Yoo Joonghyuk' has used 'Breaking the Sky Energy Lv. 2'.]

Kakakakak!

Sparks flew from our blades. Neither Yoo Joonghyuk or I stepped back. I
felt tremendous pressure as I gripped the blade. Blue ether burned around
his blade.

At this point, it was wonderful beyond admiration. In the world of Ways of
Survival, higher stats created an absolute gap in power. Now my physical
stats were over 30 while Yoo Joonghyuk's were around 20.

Still, he wasn't pushed by me at all. No, it was to the point where I was
pushed. I gritted my teeth.
[Exclusive skill, Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint stage 2 has been
activated!]

As soon as the skill was activated, Yoo Joonghyuk's thoughts entered my
mind.

「 It is painful. 」

「 Several more times in the future. 」

「 Do I need to repeat this? 」

I was furious. This bastard, already?

"Wake up you jerk!"

I struck his sword with all my might and stretched out a fist towards his
jaw. The attack was possible because I read his movements with
Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint.

Supak!

My fist hit his chin and he stumbled for the first time.

「 Once the regression begins, everything will go back to the beginning.

」「All my companions will lose their memories and my history is erased.

」 "You idiot!

「Then everything will repeat again. 」

In fact, sunfish were very durable creatures. They died because they were
vulnerable to stress, not because they were weak.

Just like this guy in front of me.
The theater master was able to control Yoo Joonghyuk was due to his
uneasy mental state. The theatre master had weak physical abilities but the
best mental abilities. If Yoo Joonghyuk's Mental Barrier was over level
80,000, this wouldn't have happened.

「 What am I…? 」

Yoo Joonghyuk's eyes were blurred. I was furious once I heard the thoughts
in his head.

"Aren't you a real protagonist?"

As someone who read all 3,149 chapters of Ways of Survival, I was
furious.

"Haven't you only regressed three times?"

I once again hit his head with all my strength. Was it a miracle? The blow
to his jaw slowed him down a bit. I didn't miss the opportunity and kicked
his chest.

"Do you really think so? You have already forgotten the determination of
your first attempt."

「I am the only living thing in this world. 」

A lonely voice.

"You bastard… don't fall into those sentiments."

I shouted while blocking his sword.

"If you can't find the meaning of life in front of you, didn't you decide to
live for the greater cause?"

[The exclusive skill, 'Fourth Wall' is activated!]
I didn't know who I was talking to anymore. Hot flames sprang up from the
blade. My eyes stung and my skin became raw from the heat. My voice was
breathless. Maybe I was also lost in the moment.

「 I am alone. 」

It was as if I was Yoo Joonghyuk or even lived Yoo Joonghyuk's life. My
chest was tight.

"Alone?"

「 I… 」

"What did I come here for if you are alone?"

「 I… 」

My sword struck and tore at his hands. Blood flowed and the flesh was
torn. I wielded the sword like a madman. I gritted my teeth.

"Why are you alone? When you died like a fool in the Theatre Dungeon,
when you cried over your dead little sister, when the prophet stabbed you in
the back! When your loved one gave birth to a child…!"

As I was talking, I strangely recalled other memories. Letters and letters
passed. My old memories of Ways of Survival.

"You went crazy after your child died!"

The complex memories of his family affairs and things he experienced
passed through my mind.

"Fighting against the demon kings and the returnees!"

The nightmares of the senior officers in the army.
"Helping people and fighting against the damn reincarnators! When you
finally stood before the constellations!"

The days when I struggled to get a job and when my bosses were vile and
abusive. Everything was in order to live. In order to survive every day.

"Look around you and try to live somehow!"

Even so, I returned home. I felt relieved when reading one novel.

"I…"

My hand holding the blade trembled. I became too excited. Dammit. I just
needed to buy enough time.

I breathed roughly and looked ahead. But…something was strange. Was it
an illusion? It was only a moment but a dim light was returning to Yoo
Joonghyuk's hand.

「 I… 」

Some things couldn't be understood even if I read his mind. My heart
thumped the moment I saw Yoo Joonghyuk's look.

[The excessive immersion has caused the 'Fourth Wall' to shake.]

Yoo Joonghyuk's eyes were staring straight at me.

「 You… who are you? 」
             Chapter 42: Ep. 9 – Omniscient Sunfish, VI


"What?"

「 What are you…? 」

I was surprised by the sudden change in thoughts. Surely he didn't regain
his sense of reason after hearing my words? How could that be?

I was a bit confused. In the first place, I didn't start this operation with the
expectation of such a result.

[The 'Theatre Master's Simulacrum' is embarrassed.]

[The 'Theatre Master's Simulacrum' has strengthened his control on the
character 'Yoo Joonghyuk'.]

"Kuaaak…!"

Yoo Joonghyuk's eyes blurred again.
Indeed. I had felt hope but it was unreasonable for him to wake up himself.
Otherwise, he wouldn't be a sunfish. I would be grateful if he didn't commit
suicide. The ether of Yoo Joonghyuk's sword trembled.

[The character 'Yoo Joonghyuk's Breaking the Sky Energy' has grown!]

In the meantime, the skills received through Transmission were becoming
stronger. It was thanks to the talent of a main character.

The Purest Sword Force gradually collapsed as I kept struggling. I didn't
know if it was the limit of the skill itself or a difference in talent.

I glanced at Lee Gilyoung. Blood was pouring down from Lee Gilyoung's
nose. The time had come.

"Joonghyuk."

Perhaps after today, Yoo Joonghyuk would become surprisingly strong. I
pushed his sword away as hard as I could.

"Do you remember what I asked before? I asked if I could hit you?"

There was a difference in natural talent. In the next few years, Yoo
Joonghyuk would become incomparable stronger than me.

But not right now. At least for now.

"You told me to hit you if I could. Do you remember?"

If I did this now, then at least for a moment…

[Blade of Faith is activated!]

[The special option of Unbroken Faith is activated.]
[The ether property is converted to 'fire'.]

I could overwhelm this ridiculous guy.

Ether Blade. The fire ether appeared in empty space.

Hwaruruk!

Yoo Joonghyuk was surprised by the sudden attack and took a few steps
back. He instinctively felt that it was something extraordinary. But it was
too late.

[The stigma 'Song of the Sword' has been used.]

Song of the Sword. It was one of the strongest combat buffs that the Duke
of Loyalty and Warfare was proud of.

[Your sword is filled with the words left by the Duke of Loyalty and
Warfare.]

There was a large variation in the attack power depending on which verse
was sung, but it was a perfect skill for me right now.

「 Shooting arrows like rain and protecting the generalissimo from guns
firing on all sides. 」

Fortunately, it was a verse from the Nanjung Ilgi¹.

An enormous magic power emerged and all the burning ethers were united.
I swung it towards Yoo Joonghyuk.

「 The chaos was like a thunderstorm. 」

The fire ether took the shape of arrows and started to bombard him. It was
an attack that couldn't be used for a long time due to insufficient magic
power. However,this would suffice.
Dudududududu!

"Kuooh!"

Numerous red wounds appeared all over Yoo Joonghyuk's body.

In this damn world where coins represented all values and the constellations
decided the development of the world, I still needed Yoo Joonghyuk.

Thus, I would protect him today.

Hwaruruk!

Yoo Joonghyuk's actions stopped as flames burned the area. His Fire
Resistance meant it might not be a serious blow, but it was enough to force
him into a state of inactivity. I looked at the 'theater master' sitting at the
edge of the garden.

[The 'Theatre Master's Simulacrum' is extremely alert to you.]

Now was the only chance. I started running. In the distance, I could see the
theatre master stiffen.

Then.

[The character 'Yoo Joonghyuk' has used Recovery Lv. 2!]

Dammit, Yoo Joonghyuk was already chasing after me.

Recovery. It was a scam skill where he could recover quickly after being hit
hard once a day. He already obtained this skill due to Transmission.

No matter how fast I ran, I couldn't be faster than Yoo Joonghyuk who used
Red Phoenix Shunpo.

I ignored the theater master in front of me and collided with Yoo
Joonghyuk's sword. I could only believe in my last card. I cried out with all
my strength.

"Gilyoung!"

Kukukung!

The moment I cried out, there was a huge crack in the ceiling of Sky
Garden.

The black dome surrounding the roof was breaking. The Yoo Joonghyuk
running towards me was also the Yoo Joonghyuk manipulated by the
theatre master. He looked up with surprise at the ceiling.

It was generally impossible for the shielded area of a 'hidden scenario' to be
broken. But it was possible for 'uncommon' existences.

In the distance, Lee Gilyoung was crying while wiping his bleeding nose.

"U-Uwahh… uwahhhh…!"

In order to deal with a monster, you had to call a monster.

Kuoooooh!

A huge insect dug into the cracks of the broken dome.

Rattle!

Like thin glass, the dome broke and the roof was split apart. The astonished
theater master screamed. A monster that could destroy the shielded area of
a hidden scenario. It was like a gigantic praying mantis, the insect king of
great size.

[The 6th grade insect king, Titanoptera has appeared!]
It was an appearance that caused goosebumps. The monster that had been
fighting with the poisonous rhino the other day. This monster came here in
response to Lee Gilyoung's Diverse Communication. Lee Gilyoung
laughed.

"He, hehe… Titano…"

Titano? Don't tell me… it did look similar but surely not.

Kuoooooh!

The huge praying mantis flew towards the theatre master. Then Yoo
Joonghyuk blocked it.

[The character 'Yoo Joonghyuk' has used 'Strong Self-Defense Lv. 4'.]

Kwaaaaang!


There was a massive sound and Yoo Joonghyuk's body was pushed down
into the floor of the rooftop. Yet Yoo Joonghyuk was still standing.

Ku ku ku ku!

…He was really a ridiculous monster. He could do with a 6th grade species
with his current abilities? Yoo Joonghyuk even launched a counterattack.
Kyaooooh!

The Titanoptera screamed at the hard blow. Surprisingly, Yoo Joonghyuk
was on par with the 6th grade insect king.

Maybe it was something he saw when fighting with me. The colour of the
theatre master was returning. Yoo Joonghyuk was strong. It was a sudden
situation but the theatre master thought he could win.

He was wrong. He should've been looking at me.
I ran towards the theater master again. There wasn't long left on Diverse
Communicaton. I wouldn't let Lee Gilyoung's efforts be in vain.

[Blade of Faith is activated!]

The theatre master belatedly discovered me and shouted.

The theater master's simulacrum.

According to the setting of Ways of Survival, this named boss was made
with all the heart and soul of a constellation. A lot of time passed and he
was in a deteriorated form, becoming the boss of a hidden scenario.
However… he was still able to penetrate Yoo Joonghyuk's Mental Barrier.

The one who received the divine protection of a constellation. He was never
a pushover.

[The 'Theatre Master's Simulacrum' has triggered 'Simulacra'.

It was a delirium skill on a higher level than the specter's Phantom Prison.

The surrounding space distorted and all types of illusions appeared. The
monsters seemed closer to reality than illusions.

The ground rats, grolls, poisonous rhinos, T-rex… The monsters I had
encountered so far were running towards me. The fierce teeth and violence
claws ripped and clawed at me, but I didn't stop. I wasn't afraid. It was all
fake. They didn't exist. They were all fiction from a novel.

The moment that the Blade of Faith reached his neck.

[The 'Theatre Master's Simulacrum' has triggered 'Mental Erosion.]

Mental Erosion. It was the advanced cognitive manipulation skill used on
Yoo Joonghyuk. I wasn't afraid because I had the Fourth Wall. But
something unexpected happened the moment he penetrated my head.
[The 'Theatre Master's Simulacrum' is embarrassed.]

Abyss of the ego.

All types of thoughts gathered and the pages of Ways of Survival fluttered.

–T-This? This, is…!

Numerous texts emanated a faint light and floated in the darkness. It was
the chapters of Ways of Survival that I had read.

[The exclusive skill, 'Fourth Wall' is activated!]

The complexion of the theatre master changed as he dug into my head. He
looked at the strings around him and his face whitened.

–Don't, tell, me, you…ahhh!

This was the last thing he said. Strangely, he looked at me in awe.

The moment Blade of Faith was about to cross his neck, a dazzling light
came from his body. It was like a ghost touching a divine light or the
penalty for breaking a taboo.

He was destroyed without a trace.

I looked down at my hands and felt dazed.

…What just happened?

[The 'Theatre Master's Simulacra' has been killed for the first time.]

[You have obtained 9,000 coins as compensation.]

[You have met the conditions to clear the hidden scenario!]

[You have obtained 4,000 coins as compensation.]
These messages rose. I looked back and saw Yoo Joonghyuk collapsing
after being released from the theatre master's control. Fortunately, he didn't
die. The same was true for Lee Gilyoung, who had forcibly used Diverse
Communication.

"Hyung…"

I rushed over and embraced Lee Gilyoung. Lee Gilyoung lost strength and
fainted in my arms.

[The barrier surrounding the Theater Dungeon has disappeared.]

The barrier covering the ceiling vanished and I looked at the insect king.
Surprising, it turned around and fled. It was like all interest had vanished. I
breathed out with a sense of relief.

It was over.

"…Are you okay?"

Jung Heewon and Lee Jihye staggered over.

"I'm fine. Heewon-ssi?"

"I'm okay. Fortunately, Jihye is safe."

Lee Jihye was hit a lot by Yoo Joonghyuk and she couldn't speak because
her mouth was swollen.

[The ending time for the third main scenario is approaching!]

Perhaps it was time for the end.

I looked around the rooftop and saw that dawn was coming, making the day
brighter. If Lee Hyunsung was here, he would recite the 'homeland' prayer.

Jung Heewon groaned.
"Ah… Seoul."

The ruined city area was illuminated by the faint light of dawn. I heard
intermittent explosions from far away. Now there was no more poisonous
fog. The poisonous rhinos were crushed under the collapsed buildings. I
could see people fighting among themselves. They were probably a group
that ended the scenario before us. The entire landscape was trapped inside a
huge dome.

It was a large barrier that seemed to be breaking.

Currently, Seoul was isolated in a transparent dome.

Jung Heewon said, "Really…it is all ending."

It was a scene that had to be acknowledged once again.

I looked at the collapsed buildings and thought that Mino Soft would be
somewhere there. Yoo Sangah would be disappointed. It was because Yoo
Sangah was a person who worked hard. Lee Gilyoung wriggled in my arms.

"Have you regained consciousness?"

Lee Gilyoung nodded and pointed to the sky.

From a distance, a meteor shower seemed to be falling. The meteor shower
was originally the forerunner of the main scenario. However, the number of
meteor showers was more than before.

It meant the 'hall' would open soon.

The meteor showers were probably falling all over the world.

Jung Heewon admired it.

"Pretty…"
Jung Heewon didn't know. The meteors that looked beautiful from a
distance would make a nightmare for the people where it fell.

Now a bigger disaster would come.

Lee Gilyoung gathered his small hands together and muttered something.
Jung Heewon and Lee Jihye were silent for a while. Maybe they were also
praying.

It was funny. Wishing to the beings who would become a source of
nightmare, it was probably only human beings who did this in the entire
universe.

After a while, Lee Gilyoung opened his eyes and looked up at me.

"Hyung isn't making a wish?"

I looked down at Lee Gilyoung and replied.

"I have made a wish."

"What is it?"

"Gilyoung, you shouldn't ask that." Jung Heewon scolded him.

I watched Jung Heewon, Yoo Joonghyuk and then the collapsed Seoul
again.

"I wish to see the novel's epilogue."

Lee Gilyoung looked at me with confusion.

I silently gazed at the sky. There were slight cracks in the sky above Seoul.
Once the sun rose, the dokkaebis would open a new hell.
[1] Nanjung Ilgi – personal diary of Admiral Yi Sun-sin, a first person
narrative of the admiral's perspective on the Japanese invasions of Korea in
the late 16th century.
                  Chapter 43: Ep. 10 – Future War, I


[Main Scenario #3 – Emergency Defense has ended.]

[You have obtained 1,000 coins as compensation.]

The main scenario, which was supposed to begin only after the sun had
risen, actually started less than 10 minutes after the third main scenario was
over.

[The fourth main scenario is about to begin!]

Damn, how long had it been since the third scenario ended…

I went straight to Lee Jihye.

"You take Yoo Joonghyuk."

"…Can I do that?"
"You can't go downstairs now anyway. It will be a problem for when he
wakes up."

Lee Jihye nodded as she looked at Yoo Joonghyuk.

"Please inform me when he wakes up. I want to give him another hit in the
back."

I headed downstairs with Jung Heewon. I carried Lee Gilyoung, who had
completely fallen asleep after the meteor shower.

The dungeon disappeared and it turned into an ordinary theatre. The items
in the rewards room on the 5th floor were turned into ordinary stage props.
It was as if everything that happened yesterday was a dream.

Then Bihyung's voice was heard. […Do

you know what I am going to say?]

'Yes'.

[Sigh…I nearly fell down.]

I felt a little relieved as I listened to Bihyung's grumbles.

The constellations were powerful but they weren't omniscient. It was
because all the sounds and images of the scenario were transmitted through
the 'channel'. What did this mean?

'Was it filtered properly? I was too excited that I said too much'.

[Of course it was. Is there something wrong with my channel? That level of
information is automatically filtered.]

If my thoughts were correct, the words I said to Yoo Joonghyuk would be
conveyed to the constellations in the following way.
–Do you really think so? You have already forgotten the determination of
your ■■ attempt.

–Why are you alone? When you ■■■ like a fool in the ■■■■■■■■, when
you cried over your ■■■■■■! When your loved one gave ■■ to a ■■! –
Helping people and fighting against the damn ■■■! When you finally ■■■
before the ■■■■■!"

In fact, I didn't know how much filtering there was.

It might be more than this, but it wouldn't be weak. In the original work,
Yoo Joonghyuk experienced information being blocked this way at the
beginning, even when information about 'regressors' was spreading.

[Constellations didn't hear anything. Don't worry. The problem is that even
I didn't hear much.]

'…You didn't hear it?'

This was a bit odd. The dokkaebi also couldn't hear the information?

[Yes, that's right. What were you talking about?]

Information that even the dokkaebi didn't know. I had one guess. Perhaps…
the constraints of 'probability' had begun? I naturally came up with
something from Ways of Survival.

「 'Probability' is a great deterrent that controls the Star Stream. 」

…I was reminded of it but it didn't help me straight away. One of the
reasons why Ways of Survival was ruined was that there were too many
settings the writer didn't know well.

'What is the reaction among the constellations?'

[They are fed up. There is still an uproar about what you were talking
about.]
I guess so. The constellations experienced a filter and the movie suddenly
changed into a silent movie.

If they were smart, they should start paying attention to the possibilities I
had. The fact that my words were filtered meant I knew information that
shouldn't be revealed at the present time.

[A few constellations are watching you to explore your secrets.]

[The constellation 'Secretive Plotter' is excited by your existence.]

[2,000 coins have been sponsored.]

I thought Bihyung had forgotten.

[I received so many indirect messages that I didn't send them to you. Do
you understand?]

'Do so in the future. I only want messages about coins'.

[…Am I your manager?]

The figure of Bihyung disappeared. I thought he was becoming cuter over
time. One thing was finished and the other…

"Dokja-ssi, is it hard? I'll carry Gilyoung."

"Ah, it would be appreciated."

I handed Lee Gilyoung to Jung Heewon. Her face looked somewhat
serious. I hesitated for a moment before opening my mouth.

"Heewon-ssi."

"Huh?"

"What are you worried about?"
"No, just…" Jung Heewon hesitated for a moment before sighing.
"Hah… okay. It isn't in my nature to keep it in." Indeed.

Jung Heewon got directly to the point.

"What is Dokja-ssi's identity?"

"…Did you hear something earlier?"

"A little bit."

I thought she wouldn't hear it because we were quite far away.
Unfortunately, she heard something. Jung Heewon was closer than Lee
Jihye and no human-to-human filtering is possible…

Lee Gilyoung let out a loud snoring noise. I decided to be half honest.

"I know part of the future."

"Really?"

"Yes."

Jung Heewon thought about something for a while. She seemed to be
wondering if my words were true or not. Then Jung Heewon seemed to
have decided as she bit her lips.

"Do Yoo Sangah and Lee Hyunsung know?"

"They don't know yet."

I answered in earnest and Jung Heewon stepped away from me with Lee
Gilyoung.

"…Surely you aren't going to kill me?"

'What are you talking about?"
"Normally, a development like 'You know too much about me' will
occur…"

Where did this normal development come from? Somehow I seemed to be a
bad person.

"I don't know what the normal development is but I would've already killed
Heewon-ssi if I wanted to."

"Actually, that is a bit weird."

"…I don't have bad thoughts. It is actually the opposite."

"The opposite?"

I looked into Jung Heewon's eyes and said.

"The future scenarios will be more dangerous. You might almost die many
times and might lose preciouse things.

"…So?"

"So…"

I looked into Jung Heewon's increasingly nervous eyes and said.

"Please stay with me from now on."

"…What do you mean?"

"It means to be my companion."

It was time to make my people. 'Trustworthy people' who wouldn't easily
betray me.

Jung Heewon, who I helped awaken and could read her mind, was the most
suitable talent. Jung Heewon looked blank for a moment.
"Dokja-ssi didn't consider me a companion before?"

"It is actually the opposite. I'm not the one who doesn't think of you as a
companion."

Jung Heewon's eyes shook.

I deliberately took a step back.

"If you don't want to be companions, think of it as a deal. I need Heewon's
strength and my information will be helpful to Heewon-ssi. It is give and
take. The important thing is that our relationship won't change in the
future." "It is a bit abrupt… Do I have to answer now?"

"No."

For a person like Jung Heewon, a leisurely approach was better than a hasty
and emotional one. In fact, Jung Heewon's expression wasn't bad.

[The character 'Jung Heewon' is relieved at your honesty.]

[The character 'Jung Heewon' is seriously thinking about your proposal.]

Maybe it wouldn't be long. I had a big influence on Jung Heewon's
awakening event and my presence would be deeply stamped in her
subconscious.

Perhaps when this scenario was over, the second Sponsor Selection would
begin. Then Jung Heewon would gain a sponsor. The real power of Jung
Heewon would be shown from then on.

"Then can I ask you something?"

"Yes."
"Do you know what I am doing in the future?"

I looked up. Wouldn't this be filtered?

"I also don't know."

"…Huh?"

"There is no Jung Heewon in the future that I know."

"What…"

"That's why this deal is really necessary for Heewon-ssi."

Jung Heewon's eyes widened.


Jung Heewon wasn't in the original book. She was a variable that I raised
directly. Her attribute was good enough and if she got a proper sponsor, she
would play a key role in changing future scenarios. Especially if I fought
against people with 'other variables' that I didn't know.

Then a loud noise was heard from downstairs.

"Think about it. Let's hurry."

We descended to the platform where many people were putting pressure on
a small group.

I understood the situation. The Landlord Alliance. They were still like this.

"Where did that bastard Kim Dokja go? Tell me quickly."

Looking closer, I saw that the Landlord Alliance were harassing Lee
Hyunsung. I deliberately walked towards them and spoke in a loud voice.

"Yoo Sangah-ssi, Lee Hyunsung-ssi."
"You!"

An alliance member cried out as soon as I came down to the platform of
Line 4.

I saw a familiar landlord uncle. The evidence of the fierce battle remained
on the bastard's body. At first glance, I could tell that his overall stats had
risen sharply. I liked it.

"Gong Pildu."

Gong Pildu used Armed Zone and eight turrets rose. The alliance members
centered around Gong Pildu looked at me. They didn't know the person
who saved them.

"This jerk…!"

The moment Gong Pildu was about to say something. There was an electric
current in the air.

[The fourth main scenario will start in 5 minutes!]

Along with the system message, Dokkaebi Bihyung appeared.

[Hahaha, everyone! Have you been well?]

People's expressions stiffened at this nasty guy's face.

[It looks like you are all restless!]

"W-What is it now?"

[Of course I came because of the announcement for the fourth scenario.]

"This is shit…"
[Now now, don't act like that. Don't you know I go after the first person
who complains? The fourth main scenario has to do with the other stations.
A fairly exciting story is waiting for you. I'm sure you will be satisfied!]
Everyone's complexions darkened as they heard about other stations.

Chungmuro alone was this bad. It was obvious how much trouble there
would be if other stations were involved. Bihyung laughed.

[By the way, in order to proceed with this scenario, you have to perform
another task first. Won't it be a mess if the number of people increases?
Therefore, you need a presence to lead you. In other words, there must be a
station representative!]

Representative. It was finally starting.

[From now on, we will play a 'skirmish'.] It could be called a warm-up
game.
The rules of the game… well, you will see!]

Bihyung smiled and disappeared, while a message window popped up in
front of everyone.
[The sub scenario has arrived!]


  [Sub Scenario – Elect a Representative]

  Category: Sub

  Difficulty: C

  Clear Conditions: Take the 'white flag' installed in the center of the
  platform.

  Time Limit: 30 minutes

  Compensation: 1,000 coins, Chungmuro's representative.

  Failure: ―

  * The representative of the station can exercise strong control over the
  members.


Before the message window fully popped up, Gong Pildu was already
running to the flag in the center of the platform. He truly was like a ghost.

"Everybody get out of the way!"

Gong Pildu pushed people like a runaway locomotive and was in the lead to
get the white flag. This couldn't happen. The moment his fingertips were
about to reach the flag, I opened my mouth.

"Gong Pildu, down!"

[Under the terms of the contract, 'Command Rights' is activated!]

"Waaack!"
I stepped on the back of the collapsed Gong Pildu and took the white flag.

[You have pulled the white flag from the flagpole.]

[You have become the 'representative' of Chungmuro.]

[You are qualified to walk the 'King's Road'.]
                  Chapter 44: Ep. 10 – Future War, II


As soon as my hand wrapped around the flag, I felt a strong energy rising in
my body. Originally, this was something the third turn Yoo Joonghyuk
should have but… it didn't matter.

Wasn't he already strong?

['Kim Dokja' has occupied the white flag.]

[If the white flag doesn't change owners in the next five minutes,
Chungmuro will be under his control.]

[If the flag is snatched in the next five minutes, the timer will reset.]

A timer appeared in the air.

[5:00]

Gong Pildu pointed at me with a pale face.
"Take away the flag! You only have to snatch it in five minutes!"

The alliance member belatedly regained their minds and started rushing
towards me. Oho, it was like this?

Lee Hyunsung turned to me.

"Dokja-ssi!"

"Hyunsung-ssi!"

We called out to each other at the same time. Heracles' Shield flew out of
my hands into Lee Hyunsung's hands.

"T-This?"

"I picked it out for you. Throw away what you previously used.

A big smile appeared on Lee Hyunsung's face.

[The character 'Lee Hyunsung' has used the exclusive skill 'Wide-Area
Defense!]

A translucent shield centered on Heracles' Shield surrounded our party.
Indeed, this was the secondary skill attached to an A-grade item.

"Wah, what is this?"

People groaned as they ran into the air shield. They tried to break the
protective shields with their old weapons but it couldn't be broken with
Egrade or F-grade items. In the end, the alliance members had only one
place to turn to.

"Pildu-ssi!"

"Out of the way!"
The level of Armed Zone had risen considerably and there was already a
small Armed Zone under Gong Pildu's feet. He reduced the area to shorten
the cooldown time. He was using his brains.

Well, I had to handle it properly.

"Pildu, did I tell you to get up yet?"

"Heok?"

Gong Pildu's head once again slammed into the ground as he fell flat.

[Under the terms of the contract, 'Command Rights' is activated!]

"Keep your head on the ground until I tell you to get up."

The perplexed alliance members shouted at Gong Pildu.

"P-Pildu-ssi?"

"P-Pull me up! Quickly!"

The terrified alliance members tried to raise Gong Pildu up but it wasn't
easy because Gong Pildu was very heavy.

"And… it is annoying so turn off the turrets."

[The character 'Gong Pildu' has released 'Armed Zone Lv. 6!]

"T-This bastard…!"

"Shut your mouth as well. Stay silent for 30 minutes."

[Under the terms of the contract, 'Command Rights' is activated!]

"Mmph mprh mmph!"
The alliance members became completely panic stricken once Gong Pildu
became powerless with just a few words. Of course, the same was true for
Lee Hyunsung, Yoo Sangah and Jung Heewon.

I said with a smile, "Now everyone seems to have figured out the situation
and I'd like to talk to you…"

I could see people wincing and withdrawing.

There were roughly 29 people left. 20 members from the Landlord Alliance
and nine extra people, including me and my party. The number wasn't high
but it was better than I thought. It was because having too many people at
the beginning was difficult to control. I watched them and said.

"Now you have two choices."

It was time to pick a side.

"The first one is to leave Chungmuro and go to another station. Or stay here
with me."

"W-What are you saying so suddenly…?"

"Just answer me. Will you remain here or will you go elsewhere? You
better decide before the main scenario starts. Or else your life will be in
danger."

The eyes of the people present started to quickly move. Someone looked at
me, someone else looked at Gong Pildu and another person looked at the
tunnel leading to another station. I could tell their thoughts just be looking
at them.

"I won't stop anyone who wants to leave. But anyone who stays here will be
under my control."

"Control…?"
"Behaviour like the Landlord Alliance' is no longer acceptable. I won't
allow tyranny over a small group."

A handful of people watching me furtively started to stand by my side.
They had been treated harshly by the Landlord Association and thought it
was better to stick with me. It was a good judgment. A few alliance
members shouted.

"In the end, you are going to reign!"

"I won't deny it. But I won't take taxes or survival money."

"Is our safety guaranteed if we enter your group?"

A man from the alliance asked. Well, they bothered the tenants so much
that it was natural to worry.

"I'll guarantee some outside safety but I won't interfere with what is going
on inside. You must deal with conflicts between individuals yourself."

"T-That…"

"I'll give you one minute. You have until then to decide."

There was no need to wait for one minute. People had already made up
their minds. Some of the alliance members walked over to me with
determined expressions and bowed their heads. They were relatively young.

"Thank you in advance. I was wrong in the past. Thank you for your
generous forgiveness."

"It is a pleasure. You don't have to ask for forgiveness from me."

[Some members within the group fell a sense of trust towards you.]

However, several others decided to leave Chungmuro. They tried to raise
the fallen Gong Pildu.
I watched them and said, "Ah, leave Gong Pildu. That guy is mine."

"What?"

"If you have decided then leave quickly."

The five alliance members frowned at this and withdrew.

"Kang-ssi! Do you really not want to come with me? It is better than
staying under him!"

"Let's all go! Are you really going to serve that guy? You've seen him!"

But there were no more defectors.

The five men cursed a few times before heading for the tunnel towards
Myeongdong. They wanted to gain land elsewhere and become new
'landlords'. Unfortunately, their plan would fail. In the fourth scenario, the
people 'wandering' were good prey to predators.

Once five minutes passed, the system messages popped up.

[The sub scenario has ended.]

[You have earned 1,000 coins as compensation.]

[The white flag will show its true effects to the Chungmuro representative.]

[Current Group: 24 people.]

[Your reputation is still too weak to gain the title of king.]

The title of king…

Indeed, it was hard to get the title of king with just a white flag. In order to
walk the proper king's road, I had to change the colour of the flag. Of
course, the white colour had its own 'authority'.
[You have gained control of the Chungmuro Group through the effect of
the white flag.]

[You can punish a group member who goes against you.]

[There are currently five people who have left.]

I could give a 'punishment' to the five distant men but I left it alone. Terror
was effective in controlling people but such tyranny wasn't suitable for me.

"Well, thank you."

I said while looking everyone in the eyes.

Lee Hyunsung was looking at me with respect while Yoo Sangah and Jung
Heewon nodded. The rest of them were looking at me with similar
expressions. They were still rabble but it wasn't a bad start.

Shortly afterwards, Bihyung appeared in the air.

[Ohu, you have voted for a representative. Then let's start the game!]

[The fourth main scenario is activated!]
  [Main Scenario #4 – Struggle for the Flag]

  Category: Main

  Difficulty: C

  Clear Conditions: (Hidden due to content length)

  Time Limit: 12 days.

  Compensation: 2,000 coins.

  Failure: ???


I press the clear conditions.

Numerous messages appeared in front of me.
     [Clear Conditions]

1.         Every station has a 'flag' and 'flagpole' that can be occupied.

     * The flag can only be carried by the 'representative' of the station.

2.         You need to protect the flag from other station groups. If a flag
istaken away by another group, the losing group will be taken over by the
group that occupied the flag.

3.          You can put a 'flag' in the 'flagpole' of another station. The
authorityof the flag is only for the 'representative' of each station. Once the
representative dies in an armed conflict, the authority of the representative
is transferred to the person who holds the flag first. If you take the 'flag' of
another station group, the treatment of the group deprived of the flag is
determined by the group that took the flag.

4.         You must occupy the 'flagpole' of the 'target station' within a
certaintime limit. Failure to do so will result in the death of all group
members.

5.         The target station your group should occupy is Changsin Station.


Jung Heewon thought for a moment before opening her mouth.

"…We have to keep our flag and flagpole while putting out flag in other
stations. Am I understanding it right?"

"That is how I understood it. We must take the flag to Changsin Station."
Lee Hyunsung also spoke.

Then I said, "That's right. Everyone has understood."
Jung Heewon narrowed her eyes at my words. She knew I was pretending
not to know. Now that I knew the future, she kept looking at me. I grinned
towards Jung Heewon.

Yoo Sangah touched her shoulder and said.

"Again… we once again have to fight against people?"

Lee Hyunsung thought for a moment before replying.

"It said that we can decide on the treatment of the group if we occupy their
flagpole… hopefully there might not be any casualties."

"Ah, I see. That death won't necessarily occur if we take over the station? If
we can accept the members of that station group when deciding the
treatment…"

"Yes, it is possible to clear it without anyone dying."

Lee Hyunsung replied with a smile. However, my heart wasn't comfortable.

It seemed like Yoo Sangah and Lee Hyunsung were trying to understand
the world with some saintly logic.

There was no such thing as a scenario where no one died. The fourth
scenario would have more casualties than any previous scenario.

As if she knew my heart, Jung Heewon changed the topic. "What

line is Changsin Station? I think we should know that first." Lee

Hyunsung confirmed it on the route map.

"Line 6. If we go to the tunnel, we can use the transit route…"

"Then we should split the group. How about a few people guarding this
place while others go to scout?"
I didn't have to say anything as they actively exchanged opinions. It was
somewhat heartwarming.

[The activation of the scenario will turn off Chungmuro Station's safety
borders.]

[You can now freely move to other stations.]

As people were exchanging their opinions, I approached Gong Pildu.

"Gong Pildu, you can speak now."

The command was turned off but Gong Pildu couldn't easily open his
mouth. "I know that you feel badly towards me. But you have to adapt. The
days when you are a landlord are over."

"…"

"I know why you have been so obsessed with 'land'. But do it moderately.
If you want to survive in the future. Don't you have something to do?"
Gong Pildu's eyes were shaky. I continued speaking.

"You will be in charge of protecting this place."

Just like the third scenario, Gong Pildu was very useful for the fourth
scenario. As long as Gong Pildu protected this place, Chungmuro would be
safe unless someone on Yoo Joonghyuk's level came.

"Why should I speak to you…?"

"This time I won't enforce it with a command. If you follow my request,
there will be a reward."

"…"

"Think carefully. Think about your family."
Gong Pildu's eyes became bigger at my words.

"You, how…!"

At this moment, noise was heard from the tunnel.

Baang~!

There was a loud horn sound and headlights shone on the railway of line 4.
There was a bike engine sound and an exhaust sound. Something was
coming towards Chungmuro.
                 Chapter 45: Ep. 10 – Future War, III


…It hadn't been long since the scenario began and already?

I tried to recall the original story but there was no recollection of such an
early invasion. It meant variables had appeared.

In the darkness, the headlights turned off and there was the sound of people
talking.

"Ah, we finally made it to Chungmuro."

"Really, it took them a long time to break the scenario."

"Hey, be quiet. They are going to hear. And don't you know that the
scenarios are different between stations?"

I watched as the people came closer with weapons. The most important
thing in a battle was to take the lead first. I went forward, followed by Lee
Hyunsung and Jung Heewon, then Yoo Sangah in the rear. Lee Gilyoung
was still sleeping.

How many seconds passed? The four men and women in the darkness
walked towards this side. I opened my mouth.

"Stop there."

"Eh? Well well."

The people stopped in their traces when they saw the blade I was pointing.
There were white bikes beside them. I heard weapons being pulled out but a
man's voice was faster.

"Wait a minute. Calm down. Oh, I can't even talk because I am too scared."

"Put down your weapons and slowly come this way."

The man put down his weapon and approached with both hands raised.
Once he entered the light, the man's impression wasn't bad. He gave off a
reasonably favourable impression. His thin eyes were in a gentle curve.

"Don't be too wary. We didn't come here to fight."

"Then why did you come?"

"Let's start with the introductions. I'm Kang Ilhun and I help manage the
Dongdaemun Group."

Kang Ilhun? Nobody popped up in my head straight away. Furthermore, the
representative of Dongdaemun… things were becoming strange.

[The exclusive skill, Character List is activated.]

Since the skill worked, he was certainly a character in the novel.
  [Character Summary]

Rumours Expert… It was time for these guys to start acting. Kang Ilhun
looked at me with slight impatience.

"Your name is…?"

"Kim Dokja."

"Ah, Kim Dokja-ssi…?"

A flash of wonder crossed Kang Ilhun's face as he heard my name.
However, it was only for a short moment.
"Nice to meet you, Dokja-ssi. Since you have a flag, you must be a station
representative?

"That's right."

He looked closely at the colour of my flag and then the people around me.
It was to confirm the power on our side. He had keen eyes but
unfortunately, he met the wrong opponent.

"If you have seen enough, get to the main point."

"Haha. I beg your pardon. We also need to be concerned about safety."
Kang Ilhun continued speaking without any panic. "Once again, we didn't
come to fight. What if we came with a good offer?"

I watched Kang Ilhun's party. None of them had a flag.

"How can I believe that?"

"Hmm, won't you know if you check the rules? If we came to fight, we
would've come with the representative. Only the representative can occupy
the flagpole."

It was true. It was obviously true.

"What is the offer?"

"We came to ask for an alliance."

At these words, the members of Chungmuro started murmuring. Kang Ilhun
shook.

"Ah, you are uncertain because Chungmuro just opened. In fact, the fourth
scenario has already been in progress for two days."

"…Two days?"
Yoo Sangah reflexively muttered. Kang Ilhun nodded.

"Yes, the third scenario is slightly different in content and duration between
stations… perhaps you didn't know this?"

"Ah…"

The third scenario was just over but I already knew this. In the original
story, Chungmuro was a latecomer in the scenario compared to other
stations. In other words, we started with some losses in terms of
information.

In that sense, Kang Ilhun's alliance offer was a timely temptation.
Information was required and this was beyond our strength. The problem

was what did the other side gain?

"It is a difficult offer to accept. I don't know if you have an ulterior motive."

"Hrmm, Dokja-ssi's words are definitely right. You won't believe in the
alliance so I will first state what we will get from the alliance. In short,
Chungmuro isn't our 'target' station."

"How can I believe that?"

"You can believe it or not. But please think about it. If Chungmuro was our
target, we would've dragged the main force of our station here. To be
honest, the flagpoles are most vulnerable just after the station is open." It
wasn't very persuasive.

"What will you do if our target station is Dongdaemun?"

"Haha, there is no need to worry about that. We already know the station
that is targeting us. We didn't come to you for no reason."
"I see. Let's clear the scenario by helping each other, since our targets are
different… is that what you mean?"

"That's right. Isn't it good to help each other at this time?"

Kang Ilhun smiled and nodded. I was silent for a moment and Yoo Sangah
opened her mouth.

"I have a question."

Kang Ilhun grinned at Yoo Sangah.

"Yes, what is it pretty girl?"

"Why did you come to Chungmuro? If you came from Dongdaemun, you
could've made an alliance with other stations."

It was an unexpectedly sharp point. Kang Ilhun looked slightly confused.
"Oh, that… as I told you, Chungmuro just opened. I mean… um, the other
stations have already formed alliances. But I thought that Chungmuro
wouldn't have… haha, I have to ask, has Chungmuro already made an
alliance?"

Hrmm…

"No, we haven't."

Kang Ilhun looked happy at my words.

"Then form an alliance with Dongdaemun. You won't regret it. Above all,
we have a 'winning solution' for this scenario."

"A winning solution?"

"Yes, in fact, our group knows the hidden secrets of this scenario."

Kang Ilhun grinned and drove in the last nail.
"We will tell you if you agree to an alliance with us."




After a while, I sat with Yoo Sangah, Lee Hyunsung and Jung Heewon to
exchange opinions. Yoo Sangah spoke.

"What do we do? Should we establish an alliance?"

"I'm going to disagree. I can't believe them. I feel uneasy."

Once Jung Heewon spoke, Lee Hyunsung gave his opinion.

"But it wouldn't be bad if they have information about this
scenario. Certainly, we can't fully trust them as Heewon-ssi
said…" Finally, they looked at me. I shrugged.

"Then for now…"

Once we made a decision, we called over Kang Ilhun and the Dongdaemun
Group, who were looking around Chungmuro Station.

"I will make a decision once I have met your representative."

"Oh, is that so?"

"Where is your representative?"

"At Dongdaemun. If you don't mind, I will guide you…"

"Please do so."

We got on the back seats of the bikes they came on. The people I took with
me were Lee Hyunsung, Yoo Sangah and Jung Heewon. Lee Gilyoung was
left behind with Gong Pildu. It was because he overused Diverse
Communication and hadn't woken up yet. Of course, I didn't forget to give
an order to protect Lee Gilyoung.

"Then let's go."

There was the sound of the bikes turning on and we started moving. Once
20 seconds had passed. I opened my mouth.

"By the way Kang Ilhun-ssi."

"Yes?"

"Those people, did they say anything else about Chungmuro?"

"Huh? What does tha…"

"For example, if you come here then there will be a very scary man called
Yoo Joonghyuk…"

"Haha, what are you sayin…"

I gave a signal and our party jumped from the back seats of the bikes at the
same time.

"Yoo Sangah-ssi!"

Yoo Sangah used Binding Thread and tied the four bikes together. There
was a roar as the bikes collided with each other.

Kwaaaang!

"Aaaagh!"

The Dongdaemun members screamed as they crashed down.
Fortunately, our party was safely hanging in the air due to Yoo Sangah's
thread tied to the ceiling. It was a type of seat belt. It was an incredible feat
that made Yoo Sangah seem like Spiderman.

Kang Ilhun was covered in dust as he lay on the ground and shouted.

"W-What are you doing?"

"What am I doing? That is what I want to ask." I looked at the dark tunnel.
"In order to ambush us, you should raise the level of the stealth a bit more."

It was enough for me to detect despite not having Absolute Senses. Kang
Ilhun noticed something was wrong and screamed.

"Attack them!"

At almost the same time, people hiding all over the tunnel emerged. I knew
it. They were aiming for my flag.

[The character 'Jung Heewon' has activated the exclusive skill 'Judgment
Time'.]

[The Absolute Good constellations have agreed to the use of this skill.]

['Judgment Time' has been activated.]

"Eh? I thought it might not… isn't this a complete mess?"

Jung Heewon laughed with a surprised expression.

"It is hard to find bad people."

Jung Heewon spoke in a cold voice and her sword flashed through the dark
tunnel. Her eyes were red from using Demon Slayer. The bloody light
swept through the darkness as people were slaughtered.

"W-What?"
"This crazy girl…! Aaaagh!"

Seokeok! Seokekeok!

There were 10 people but Jung Heewon killed them without a hitch. It was
a scene that showed how much Jung Heewon's stats had risen after the
hidden dungeon was cleared.

I also used Purest Sword Force and easily suppressed Kang Ilhun. A few
hours ago, I was dealing with Yoo Joonghyuk. This guy wasn't very
difficult.

"Dokja-ssi, Chungmuro…!"

I looked back at Lee Hyunsung's cry and saw that there was a commotion in
Chungmuro. They were ambushed as soon as we left Chungmuro. I left
Kang Ilhun to be tied up by Yoo Sangah and rushed to Chungmuro.

There was already a melee happening on the platform. But I decided to
watch the situation for a while. There was something I needed to check
first.

"What are these bastards!"

Dozens of group members that ran from the Myeongdong direction waved
weapons at the people of Chungmuro. By the way, the weapons they were
carrying were familiar.

"That is Kim-ssi's weapon!"

The Landlord Alliance members who headed towards Myeongdong had
already been hit by these guys. Indeed, the wanderers who lost their group
were just seen as living coins.

The most noticeable enemy was one wearing a red flag around his head like
a bandana.
"Gain control later! It will be over if I just put the flag in!"

That's right. He was the 'representative'.
                 Chapter 46: Ep. 10 – Future War, IV


"Push through to the flag holder!"

Based on the direction he was running from, he seemed to be the
representative of the Myeongdong Group. They had joined hands with
Dongdaemun.

[The Myeongdong representative 'Kim Hyuntae' has used the additional
effect of the 'red flag'!]

It was someone who already changed the colour of the flag. Furthermore, it
was 'red'.

In fact, the key to 'Struggle for the Flag' was the colour of the flag. It was
from white to red, navy, brown, purple and black. The flag provided
increasingly better effects as the colour changed.

[The Myeongdong Group has received the buff effect of the red flag!]
[Attack and defense has increased by 5% each!]

If the flag was already red, it meant he had occupied one or more stations or
had killed the flag bearer of another station.

Looking at his eyes, he seemed to have pretty good fighting power. But…

He shouldn't have aimed for Chungmuro.

[The character 'Gong Pildu' has activated 'Armed Zone Lv. 6!]

[The character 'Gong Pildu' has activated 'Private Property Lv. 6!]

Gong Pildu didn't move too late.

"Trivial pups…!"

I was glad I didn't have to use the Command Rights. If this was the case, I
could leave Chungmuro's defense to Gong Pildu.

The eight mini-turrets fired at the same time towards the Myeongdong
Group running towards the flagpole.

"W-What?"

"Owaaaaack!

Dududududu!

Pieces of flesh flew through the air. Gong Pildu was truly a scam.

"Kuuack! Huddle up!"

The Myeongdong group gathered together in a tight defense formation but
it wasn't enough to endure the shells from the level 6 Armed Zone. It was a
rewarding sight that made leaving him to clear the Emergency Defense
scenario alone worth it.
Kwang! Kwaang! Kwaaaang!

How many shots were fired? The enhanced magic bullets caused the
Myeongdong Group to be riddled with holed and collapse. Gong Pildu was
scary as an enemy but strong as an ally.

"T-There wasn't information about this!"

"Retreat!"

But there was no place for them to run away.

"Where are you going?"

[The special option of Unbroken Faith is activated.]

[The ether property is converted to 'fire'.]

The ether blade made of flames created a wall of fire that blocked their
escape. The moment that the confused people hesitated, Gong Pildu shot at
them.

Dududududu!

"P-Pierce through! Quickl…cough!"

The Myeongdong representative was hit in the head by a magic bullet and
the flag was released. Gong Pildu's eyes shone as he found the flag. Sheesh,
this brat.

"Do you want me to step on your back again?"

The running Gong Pildu stiffened.

"Damn…"
I immediately picked up the Myeongdong flag that had fallen onto the
tracks. Focus vanished from the eyes of the desperate Myeongdong Group
members.

[You have won the flag of the 'Myeongdong Group'.]

[Your white flag has absorbed the cumulative achievements of the red flag.]
[Your white flag has evolved into a red flag.]

I felt a stronger force swirling inside my body.

[You are one step closer to the King's Road.]

The flags after the red flag improved not just the abilities of the
representative but also the surrounding group members.

Apart from overall stats or S-grade and above items, the flag was one of the
few ways to improve basic combat power. Due to this, groups aimed at
stations other than the 'target' station.

The other 'king candidates' would've already entered a full-fledged war to
change the colour of their flags.

The stronger they became, the more they could enjoy this world.

[The remaining members of the Myeongdong Group are waiting for your
decision.]

I grabbed one of the wounded Myeongdong members in the area and asked.

"Why did you aim for Chungmuro?"

I had realized something when I first heard Kang Ilhun's words. It was true
that Chungmuro had just opened but it didn't make sense for them to rush in
like they had been waiting. The observations of the party and the strange
look he made when he knew I was the representative…
These guys knew about this station from the beginning. I brought my blade
to the man's neck and asked.

"Tell me, who gave you the information of Chungmuro?"

The most likely people were the Prophets. The guys I met in Theatre
Dungeon mentioned 'hidden information' that other people didn't know.

I had been searching through Ways of Survival but I never saw the group
name Prophets. If so, who were they?

There were two hypotheses.

One, due to an unknown variable, a new prophet had appeared apart from
Anna Croft.

The second… besides me, there was another 'reader'.

Honestly, I thought it was probably the latter. The 'prophet' attribute
wasn't so easy to obtain. Furthermore, Prophets was a plural… Well, I
could check it from now on.

I looked at Gong Pildu and said, "By the way… why didn't you act more
moderately?"

"Why should I show mercy to those running wild?"

Gong Pildu looked annoyed.

Unfortunately, the people of Myeongdong Group weren't able to answer
because they had been hit by too many bullets. As soon as I asked them a
question, they coughed up blood and died.

In the end, I could only ask one person. I looked down at Kang Ilhun who
was behind guarded by Lee Hyunsung. His eyes rolled uneasily while he
was tied up with Binding Thread.
Yoo Sangah asked, "Was everything planned from the beginning?"

"I thought there was a high probability. As soon as the station opens, two
groups will unite and attack. It was a prior promise."

"Saying things with such a good face…"

Yoo Sangah's expression became dark.

"Are you sorry? There isn't going to be an

alliance."


"…A little bit."

"Don't believe in people too much. Things won't be as easy as you think in
the future.

"I know. Still… if possible, I wanted to believe. I was able to come
here because I believed in someone." Yoo Sangah looked at me.

"Hey, how long are the two of you going to talk? Quickly pry the
information out."

Jung Heewon interrupted us. Indeed, now wasn't the time to give life
advice. I released the thread blocking Kang Ilhun's mouth.

Kang Ilhun was trying to stay calm.

"…What will you do with me now?"

"It depends on how much information you can give me."

"Are you basing the standards on usability?"
This guy talked back even in this situation, there was more to him than I
thought. If so, I had to use a hard-line method…

Jung Heewon said, "In any case, the constellations see him as 'wicked'.
How about trying torture?"

"Why bother with torture? Just kill him if he doesn't speak."

"Huh?"

I pulled out my sword without hesitation. Kang Ilhun trembled as he looked
up at me.

"From now on, I will count to three. If you don't open your mouth in that
time, you will die. There is no reversal."

I deliberately triggered Purest Sword Force and inserted the sword into the
ground.

"One.

Kudududuk!

The ground was scratched with the power of Purest Sword Force as the
blade started to move towards him. Fragments of the floor flew towards his
face.

"Two."

The heat of the blade warmed his face as it approached his nose. In a short
time, the ether blade would cut his eyeballs.

"Three…"

"Dongmyo Station!"

I smiled. Torture? There was no need for that.
Kang Ilhun gasped for breath and explained, "…The people from
Dongmyo Station gave us information about Chungmuro." Dongmyo, who
was there?

"Who was it?"

"He called himself a Prophet…"

By the way, this guy's condition was strange. His eyes were rolling and his
tongue hung out like a dead person. I had an ominous feeling.

Surely it wasn't 'Suggestion'.

"Yoo Sangah-ssi, hurry and block his mouth with a thread!"

Fortunately, Yoo Sangah's threat blocked this guy's mouth before it could
close. Using Suggestion to control information from leaking… they were
more meticulous than I thought.

On the other hand, it was easier for me to solve the problem. Suggestion
was a skill that could only be used face-to-face.

I looked down at Kang Ilhun and stated.

"You are a lucky guy."

If he was present, I could definitely identify one of the Prophets.




Before I went on the full-fledged search, I headed to the roof of the theater.

"He still hasn't woken up?"
Maybe it was because she didn't know I was coming but Lee Jihye shook.
Yoo Joonghyuk was still unconscious and lying on her knees.

Jerk, he was the main character yet he wasn't going through any hardship.
Meanwhile, I was the tired one despite being the reader.

"How is it downstairs?"

"Don't worry and rest."

"Master… will he be okay?"

"He will be fine. Although there might be some trauma left."

"…Trauma?"

"His mental state is more fragile than a child's. He will be a bit better after a
good sleep."

"It sounds like you know a lot."

"I know him the best in this world."

I spoke in a dry tone and pulled out some paper, writing on it with a pen. I
filled it with notes and handed it to Lee Jihye.

"Don't read it but give it to Yoo Joonghyuk when he wakes up. Do you
understand?"

"…I understand."

She said so but Lee Jihye would definitely read it. However, Lee Jihye
wouldn't be able to understand it since it was filled with things only Yoo
Joonghyuk would know.

By the way, did the information on the paper also look like ■■■ for the
constellations?
[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' hates ■.]

Indeed. I was turning around when Lee Jihye opened her mouth.

"By the way, can I ask you something?"

"What?"

"Earlier, with Master. Master and ahjussi…"

Somehow I seemed to know what Lee Jihye would say. Damn, Lee Jihye
heard as well as Jung Heewon?

I've been stupid. I only considered the constellations and never thought
about the humans listening. Yoo Joonghyuk would laugh at my stupidity.

What was a good excuse?

"Well, that. You two."

"What?" I decided to feign ignorance.

Lee Jihye's expression became more serious.

"I mean, ahjussi's words."

"So what?"

"Wake up you jerk! Don't fall into those sentiments!"

Lee Jihye imitated my voice and shouted. I felt embarrassed suddenly
hearing my words emerge from someone else's mouth.

"For the first time, that… that determination! Have you already forgotten?"

"…?"
Wasn't something strange? This child, she almost heard it at the filtered
level?

"I came here because of you! Why are you alone? We are together!"

"No, wait a minute."

"I've always been around you! Don't lose hope! Think of the child!"

"That isn't what I…"

"Why did I come here if you are alone…!"

I stared at Lee Jihye for a moment.

…No, how could she hear it this way?

"S-Something like that? Ahjussi, you and Master…"

I sighed. "Think what you want."

"…Indeed. Don't worry, I'll give him this love letter!"

I shrugged and turned around. Behind my back, Lee Jihye's bullshit
continued.

"Wait! How did you give birth to a child?"

"Ask Yoo Joonghyuk."

Yes, Yoo Joonghyuk, I leave everything to you. The next moment, indirect
messages exploded in my head.

[Some constellations are greatly affected by the truth of the filtering.]

[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' respects your taste.]

[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' likes your companionship.]
[The constellation 'Secretive Plotter' thinks it is ridiculous.]

[600 coins have been sponsored.]

…Damn, there were other idiots. In any case, I told Yoo Joonghyuk what I
needed to.

I hurried through the theater. During the time Yoo Joonghyuk was the
sleeping prince, I had to gain as much benefits as possible.
                 Chapter 47: Ep. 10 – Future War, V


After coming down from the theater, I headed straight to Myeongdong
Station with Lee Hyunsung and Yoo Sangah. Dongmyo Station was
important but there was something to be done first.

I killed the Myeongdong Representative and taken the flag so I had to hurry
and occupy the empty station.

Lee Hyunsung spoke in a worried tone.

"Is it okay with just us?"

"There won't be a fight. I will decide what to do with them. If I leave it
alone, they will die soon."

The 'wanderers' who lost their group would become prey to other groups if
they weren't lucky. Just like the Landlord Alliance members who left
Chungmuro Station.
But the moment we arrived at Myeongdong Station, we saw an unexpected
sight. The people in Myeongdong Station had already been hit by someone.

It was also very gruesome.

I saw a group of men standing near Myeongdong Station. The men were
flustered and quickly fled in the direction of Hoehyeong Station. It wasn't
easy to chase them because they had bikes.

It was as if they knew I was coming. There was more than one or two odd
things.

Lee Hyunsung asked, "Who are these people? What happened?"

"I'm not sure."

"Even Dokja-ssi doesn't know…"

Lee Hyunsung gulped nervously. Fortunately, the flag holder of
Myeongdong Station was empty.

[Currently there is no group occupying Myeongdong Station.]

[Are you sure you want to take over the station?]

I plugged the flag into the flag holder and pulled it out again. Then a flag
that was the same as mine appeared in the flag holder.

[You have occupied Myeongdong Station.]

[A station that has been occupied can't be taken from you unless the 'main
base' or flag is taken away.]

[Currently Occupied: Chungmuro (Main Base), Myeongdong]
[The achievement points of the red flag are rising.]

The red colour of the flag turned darker.

[Your influence has expanded by taking over a new station.]

[The hidden scenario has arrived!]

[The King's Road has begun!]


  [Hidden Scenario – King's Road]

  Category: Hidden

  Difficulty: A

  Clear Conditions: Take over a minimum of 10 stations within the time
  limit.

  Time Limit: 10 days

  Reward: The attribute of a 'king'.

  Failure: If you can't take over a minimum of one station per day, you
  and your group members will all die.


I finally arrived at the terrible hidden scenario. Once I started this quest, I
couldn't turn back. There were only two fates for a king.

Become a king or die.

[The new king candidate has started to walk along his road!]

From now on, it was the full-fledge flag struggle.
I returned to Chungmuro, gathered the party members and told them about
the hidden scenario. Jung Heewon made an interested expression while Lee
Hyunsung looked confused. Yoo Sangah was as anxious as always.

"It sounds like a difficult scenario… Dokja-ssi, will it be okay?"

"It's okay."

An angel or a fool… In this situation, they were worried rather than jealous
about the hidden scenario.

Lee Hyunsung said, "I'm glad that Dokja-ssi is the king candidate."

"Thank you."

"Then should I call you Your Majesty?"

I was hit in the head by Jung Heewon after being touched by Lee
Hyunsung's serious words.

"I don't want that."

"Your Majesty, based on this hidden scenario, shouldn't we go occupy a
new station right away? You should think about the lives of your subjects."
Jung Heewon said sarcastically.

I nodded.

"I think we need to find out about the people who attacked us. I'll go
straight to Dongmyo. Jung Heewon-ssi and Lee Hyunsung-ssi, will you go
with me?"

Yoo Sangah raised her hand at my words.
"Then I…"

"Yoo Sangah-ssi will stay here."

"Ah, really… on the other hand, more…"

I listened to Yoo Sangah's voice and it sounded glum. Perhaps Yoo Sangah
was thinking that she was useless.

Her damage wasn't as strong as Jung Heewon and she didn't have a strong
physique like Lee Hyunsung. In addition, she didn't have a powerful trump
card like Gilyoung.

"Yoo Sangah-ssi."

"…Yes?"

All her previous 'specs' had become obsolete in this new world. But she was
too good to be jealous of other people. Thus, her inferiority complex was
quietly festering.

"Yoo Sangah, not everyone can do the same things well."

"Yes, I am aware of that." Yoo Sangah smiled weakly.

I spoke carefully so that she wouldn't feel it was an admonishment. "Do you
remember the words that you said on the subway? Dokja has a solo life and
I will…"

"I will have an ivory life. Yes, I remember. I wrote it on the notepad of my
smartphone."

Why did she look so elated? In any case, I couldn't hate it. I continued
speaking.
"Yoo Sangah-ssi has things to do here. I can't leave the unconscious
Gilyoung alone. I need someone to monitor Gong Pildu and to control
the nervous group members." Yoo Sangah's eyes shook.

"Besides, the Hoehyeon forces must be kept in check. They might attack
while we're away. Gong Pildu is here but Yoo Sangah's Binding Thread
might be necessary."

"C-Can I do this role well…?"

Yoo Sangah spoke weakly because of her low self-esteem.

"Hey everyone. In that way… I will give Yoo Sangah-ssi a job position.
What do you think?"

Lee Hyunsung and Jung Heewon thought for a moment before nodding.

"Okay, I can trust it if it is Yoo Sangah."

"King… If you wish, then do so…"

I glared at Jung Heewon. Did she think that was funny right now?

[You are using the unique permissions of a representative.]

[Chungmuro Station's representative, Kim Dokja is transferring some of his
authority to group member 'Yoo Sangah'.]

[Group member 'Yoo Sangah' has become the deputy of Chungmuro
Station.]

[In the future, group member 'Yoo Sangah' can deal out punishments on
behalf of the representative.]

Yoo Sangah looked at me with stunned eyes and stuttered. She looked
terrified.
"G-Giving, giving this position to me…"

"I will leave it to Yoo Sangah-ssi."

I meant it. Once again, not everyone could do the same things well. Based
on what I remembered, Yoo Sangah would be appropriate for this.

Yoo Sangah was the best person in the human resources department, not
someone else.

"Oh…I'll do my best."

Yoo Sangah bowed before slowly raising her head. Tears could be seen in
her eyes.




We headed straight for the tunnel on the east side.

We had to pass three stops before arriving at Dongmyo. We moved with the
fainted Kang Ilhun. Honestly, taking this guy was a burden but I needed
him to identify the faces. When I looked back at Chungmuro, I could hear
Yoo Sangah's voice.

"Everyone, please gather!"

As I expected, Yoo Sangah worked harder in the shadows. The people were
already organized and were receiving their orders. Sentries were set up and
people were put in charge of different areas. Some of the landlords said
they wouldn't listen to Yoo Sangah but…

[Chungmuro Station's deputy, Yoo Sangah has used the

punishment.] I vaguely heard someone moaning.
…Was this okay? Well, it should be fine.

Jung Heewon looked at my face and said, "Good job. I felt that Yoo Sangah
had been a bit depressed."

"I didn't select Yoo Sangah-ssi because I was thinking of her emotions. I
thought Yoo Sangah-ssi would do really well."

"…Ah, is that so? Then please me something later. It should fit me."

"How about an executioner?"

"…Forget it."

Jung Heewon grumbled and turned her head away. It was good after all the
jokes she played.

"But that gangster on the roof, is it okay to leave him?"

"Oh, you mean Yoo Joonghyuk?"

"I guess his name is similar."

"It will probably be fine."

"It sounds like you know him very well. What is it?

"That…" I thought for a moment before asking. "Heewon-ssi, do you have
a younger sibling?" "…? Yes. Why?"

"A brother or a sister?"

"A brother."

"How old is he?"

"He is one year younger."
"How is it having a brother?"

"Annoying. He easily defies me and I had to take him to school instead of
my mother…"

Jung Heewon feel silent as she was complaining about her brother. She
gazed somewhere in the air. Then I asked her.

"But now you are worried about him right?

"Well… we are family."

"I am similar."

"Dokja-ssi also has a younger brother?"

"Nope, I'm talking about Yoo Joonghyuk."

"Ah…" Jung Heewon looked at me and nodded. "Then do you like or hate
him?"

"I hate him. I fought with many people because of him."

I wasn't the only reader of Ways of Survival in the early days. Quite a few
people followed along out of curiosity up to the 10th chapter. There were
also 12 readers at the 50th chapter.

There was a guy who liked Kim Namwoon… while I argued with him. I
wonder if any of the people who fought with me back then were alive.
Maybe the people I was going to catch now was one of them.

"You two, you seem to have become very close."

Lee Hyunsung interrupted and I suddenly realized I was walking too close
to Jung Heewon.

Jung Heewon smiled.
"Why, soldier ahjussi. Are you jealous?

"Hrmm. It isn't like that…"

Come to think of it, didn't Lee Hyunsung join the army right after going to
a male high school? I felt sorry for Lee Hyunsung when I thought about the
setting.

"It seems we have arrived at Dongdaemun History and Culture Park
Station."

In fact, the entrance of Dongdaemun History and Culture Park Station
could be seen in the distance.

We nervously stuck to the tunnel wall and looked around. It was in case
troops were waiting. But this worry was pointless. Jung Heewon muttered.

"It is strange. There are no sentries."

The fact that there was no guards while Struggle for the Flag was ongoing
meant that the station had already been eaten by another group. Once we
confirmed this, we immediately approached the flag holder.

[The station has already been occupied by 'Dongmyo Station'.]

[If you want to occupy the station, take the flag of Dongmyo Station
or occupy its flag holder.] It was as expected.

Then Kang Ilhun's body twitched. His body was shaking like he was having
seizures and his condition was strange. I released the thread blocking his
mouth and Kang Ilhun shouted.

"N-No…!"

"…What's happening?"
"D-Dongdaemun… Dongdaemun Station…!"

Saliva spilled from Kang Ilhun's mouth as he stuttered. I felt something and
unintentionally put a hand on his shoulder.

Then.

[The character Kang Ilhun is now a wanderer.]

It was evident that Kang Ilhun's affiliation to 'Dongdaemun' had changed.
Jung Heewon asked, "What is happening?"

"It seems that Dongdaemun Station has been taken over."

"…Huh?"

Suddenly everything made sense. Yes. The people who leaked the
information had this in mind.

"…A double trap."

They incited the Myeongdong Group and Dongdaemun Group to strike
Chungmuro because they knew the two groups would die in Chungmuro.
While the main force were gone, they wanted to take Myeongdong and
Dongdaemun. The unidentified people at Myeongdong Station probably
also belonged to them.

But… how did they know we would win? They couldn't know about my
presence. The representative of Chungmuro Station in the third turn was
originally…

…Ah right. That jerk. Was this what they aimed for?

I was certain. The Prophets who created this plan were surely…

At this moment, Lee Hyunsung reacted.
"People are coming."

A group of people were approaching from the Dongdaemun tunnel. On the
surface, they were a group with a considerably good weapons.

The items seemed to have an average of a C-grade or above. It wouldn't be
easy to arm them to this degree already… it was unbelievable power.

The man in the center of the group spoke to us first. The man had a slim
build and wore all types of items on his arms and neck.

"Eh, Kang Ilhun-ssi? Geez, you brought a needless load of crap to me."

Kang Ilhun was shaking and he fainted with foam around his mouth. I
wondered, perhaps this guy?

[The exclusive skill, Character List is activated.]

A moment later, amazing messages were heard.

[The information of this person can't be read in 'Character List'.]

[This person isn't registered in 'Character List'.]

Look at this?

The man looked at us. "Is there going to be a self-introduction? Or…"

The group of men simultaneously pulled out weapons.

I took the lead to reply. "We are from Chungmuro."

"Chungmuro?"

At this moment, sparks popped in the air.

[Someone is using Explore Attribute on you.]
[The exclusive skill Fourth Wall has blocked Explore Attribute!]

The man stumbled like he had been shocked. He hesitated for a moment
before turning bewildered eyes towards me.

"…I'm sorry, what is your name?"

I glanced at Jung Heewon and Lee Hyunsung once. Then I smiled and said
towards the man. I spoke in my coldest and heaviest voice.

"I am Yoo Joonghyuk."
                 Chapter 48: Ep. 10 – Future War, VI


It wasn't an illusion. The guy's eyes instantly widened when he heard my
name.

"Don't tell me…?"

He carefully observed my face. That reminded me, what was the
description of Yoo Joonghyuk in Ways of Survival? There wasn't a
detailed appearance but the word 'handsome' was attached. And my face…
Could this be considered a fictional allowance?

"What is it?"

"Ah, nothing."

His tone became politer. I didn't know what was going on in there but his
head was probably in a complicated state right now.
At least one thing was certain. The man in front of me had clearly read
Ways of Survival.

I became more certain because he wasn't registered in Character List and he
was surprised to hear Yoo Joonghyuk's name.

His eyes urgently returned to Lee Hyunsung by my side.

It was inspecting the attribute… I see. Was he digging up information? I
deliberately gave him some time to observe Lee Hyunsung before opening
my mouth.

"Impertinent person. You better move your eyes carefully."

"…Heok?"

He confirmed Lee Hyunsung's name and also noticed that he couldn't view
my character window with Detect Attributes. I didn't know how far he had
read in Ways of Survival but there were a few characteristics that could be
used to identify Yoo Joonghyuk.

One of them was the SS skill, Sage's Eye which allowed for universal
detection and protection against detection skills. Now he would be
convinced that I had Sage's Eye.

"Did you think I wouldn't know that you peeked at me with a B-grade

skill?" The spasms started from the man's eyes and spread through his face.

Then his eyes wandered to the red flag I carried on my back. It was as I
guessed. There were limits to the evidence that he could find about Yoo
Joonghyuk.

"You son of a bitch…!"
One of the men in the group hadn't figured out the situation and pointed a
spear at me. The moment that Jung Heewon and Lee Hyunsung were about
to come forward.

Peeok!

The man's head burst and red blood splattered like a fountain. The group
immediately screamed. From beyond the blood, I saw a serious looking
man.

…Look at this bastard? He slowly walked through the crowd towards me.

"I'm sorry. Such a distinguished person had to see a horrible sight."

"Who are you?"

The man tried to manage his expression at my cold tone. He was pretty
good. If I was him, I would look like my heart was going to burst.

"I will formally introduce myself. My name is Lee Sungkook. I am the
deputy in charge of Dongmyo Station."

This guy approached and bowed before me. I liked it. Then I started the
fullfledged Yoo Joonghyuk cosplay.

After I snapped at him, I opened my mouth and spoke in a cold voice.

"Dongmyo Station? I see. Then get out."

"…Huh?"

"This is my station from now on so get out."

This guy's mouth dropped open.

"What…"
"You aren't going to listen to me?"

I looked down at the flag holder that had the Dongmyo flag. Lee Sungkook
belatedly understood my point.

"T-That is impossible. You can't transfer a station already occupied…"

"Do you think I'm a fool? You are the deputy."

"Yes?"

"If you have the authority of a deputy, the station can be transferred at will.
You didn't know?"

"…!"

"If you don't take it out by the time I count to three, I will cut your neck.
One."

Lee Sungkook's face stiffened. The men slowly surrounded me, giving off a
nasty atmosphere. Jung Heewon and Lee Hyunsung were nervous because
they didn't know why I was suddenly doing such a crazy thing. I continued
speaking.

"Does it sound like I am joking? Two."

Was it hard to remember after reading the novel 10 years ago? It looked
like he forgot who Yoo Joonghyuk was. Then I had to jog his memory.

[The exclusive skill 'Purest Sword Force Lv. 2' has been activated.]

[Blade of Faith is activated!]

Chiiiiiing!

I saw Lee Sungkook's pale face beyond the burning white blade. This was a
game of chicken.
Remembering Yoo Joonghyuk meant he knew a bit about who Yoo
Joonghyuk was.

If he knew how ruthless the early Yoo Joonghyuk was then he would never
be able to continue this game.

If he didn't know Yoo Joonghyuk properly? Then it didn't matter. I would
play the game and run away if we were going to lose. Now I had enough
strength.

At this moment, Lee Sungkook hurriedly shouted.

"W-Wait a minute! I-I'll give it to you!"

This brat, he had read Ways of Survival. But he didn't read it properly.

"No need."

"…Huh?"

"You answered too late."

"Yes?"

"This place isn't enough. Give me Dongdaemun as well."

Jung Heewon made an astonished expression by my side. She looked like
she was ready to act. But she couldn't go out.

No, I had to act. Because I was now Yoo Joonghyuk. I had to speak more
nonsense in order to make him believe I was Yoo Joonghyuk.

I aimed my sword at Lee Sungkook and declared.

"If you don't do this, there won't be a deal."

"B-But…!"
"I will count to three again. One."

Lee Sungkook's expression changed in real time. He was starting to believe
that I was Yoo Joonghyuk. The protagonist of a novel was standing in front
of him.

How would he cope? The way he acted here would determine my
relationship with these guys in the future.

"I-I can give you Dongdaemun History and Culture Park! But…"

"But?"

"I don't have the authority to hand over Dongdaemun… if you don't mind,
would you like to meet our representative?"

It was a great response. It was just the level of prey that I wanted.

Lee Sungkook kept on talking.

"Yoo Joonghyuk-nim's reputation is well-known. Our representative will be
greatly looking forward to seeing Yoo Joonghyuk-nim. Please give our
group a chance to talk with Yoo Joonghyuk-nim."

"You know me?"

"How can I not know Yoo Joonghyuk-nim?"

Lee Sungkook shut his mouth the moment he said this. He thought he said
something strange. Yoo Joonghyuk couldn't be famous this early on.

"A-Anyway, it will be an honour if you accompany me."

I stared at him and replied. Yes, this level was acceptable.

"Okay, show me the way."
Lee Sungkook's expression brightened and he added useless words.

"Don't worry. I swear on the King's Honour that I won't harm Yoo
Joonghyuk-nim."

[Dongmyo Station's deputy, Lee Sungkook has sworn on the King's
Honour.]

[If he breaks this vow, Lee Sungkook can be punished by you.]

What a great guy. But he did the right thing if he really thought I was Yoo
Joonghyuk. Wasn't his understanding of Yoo Joonghyuk better than I
expected?

Then he would pay for it.

"Hurt me? You guys?"

"Of course, none of us can lay a finger on Yoo Joonghyuk-nim. Ha, haha.
Then… this way."

"Just a minute."

"Yes?"

I pointed to the flag holder.

"Give me that."

"…"

[You have received the transfer of Dongdaemun History and Culture Park.]

[Currently Occupied: Chungmuro (Main Base), Myeongdong,
Dongdaemun
History and Culture Park]
[The achievement points of the red flag are rising.]

The flag was changing before my eyes.

It was a good start.

No, wasn't this too easy?

"Then let's go."

I watched Lee Sungkook's shaking shoulders and felt strange.

Wouldn't it be okay to continue living as Yoo Joonghyuk?




We were guided by Lee Sungkook towards Dongmyo Station.

The Dongmyo members didn't know my identity but Lee Sungkook's
attitude was so stubborn that they couldn't protest.

I walked with my party at the rear of the group. Lee Hyunsung hesitated
before looking at me and opening his mouth.

"Excuse me, Dokj…"

Kuk!

Jung Heewon noticed quickly and hit Lee Hyunsung's stomach. There was
the sound of wind being blown from the lungs and Lee Hyunsung moaned.

As expected from Jung Heewon. She didn't know the exact situation but she
knew how to match the mood.
I muttered out of the side of my mouth. 'You

know what to do without me telling you?'

'Yes, roughly'.

I watched Jung Heewon and then Kang Ilhun being carried by Lee
Hyunsung. The most important person right now was that guy.

'Make sure to restrain that guy. Understood?'

Jung Heewon nodded and made a strange gesture. She kneeled in front of
me and cried out in an exaggerated voice.

"Yes, Joonghyuk! I will do as you say!"

Anyone who saw it would think about medieval knights. The funny thing
was that the surprised Lee Hyunsung did the same thing.

"I-I will do as you say…!"

Lee Sungkook, at the head of the group, was surprised to hear these two
voices. It was embarrassing but the result was good. I couldn't read Lee
Sungkook's inner thoughts but it would be like this if I could read it.

「 He must be Yoo Joonghyuk. 」

Lee Sungkook met my gaze and quickly turned his head back to the front.
This was how a main character felt.

Not long afterwards, we arrived at Dongmyo Station.

They were a pretty powerful group seeing as many people were on the
platform. There were some people with weapons like Lee Sungkook's
group, but most of them didn't have any.

They were probably wanderers from other stations who lost their group.
"Move faster!"

"I-I understand."

They were slaughtering the ground rats while being supervised by the
Dongmyo members or disassembling the corpses of the monsters to make
equipment.

The so-called 'slave' class. It was a common scenery in the age of kings.

Jung Heewon frowned.

"This isn't a real

kingdom…" I spoke to Jung

Heewon.

"Don't be disgusted. Wait here and look at the situation."

"Yesss…"

I ignored Jung Heewon and started to observe the surroundings. It was to
take into account additional variables.

Dongmyo was quite important in the original novel. If I remembered
correctly… the representative of this place was the 'invalid'.

But the story was likely to have changed if the Prophets intervened. I
looked at the back of Lee Sungkook's head.

At this point, I had two questions. One, did Lee Sungkook have his own
text version? Two, how many prophets were there?

And if I had to say a third question, did they have the same 'skills' as me…
It didn't seem like it. Otherwise he would've used Character List instead of
Detect Attributes at the beginning.

Besides, he didn't seem to have the Fourth Wall when I used Character List.
In other words, he was a case like Lee Gilyoung.

Well, I read over 3,000 chapters. It would be unfair if they received the
same perks as me when they only read a few chapters.

Speaking of which, I don't think they had a text version…

By the way, what was this person looking so hard at? Lee Sungkook was
looking at his smartphone.

[5,000 coins have been invested in agility.]

[Agility Lv. 20 -> Agility Lv. 30]

[An amazing agility lies in your body.]

I approached Lee Sungkook like a ghost.

"What are you looking at so hard?"

"H-Huh? It is nothing!"

The guy hurriedly hid his smartphone. It was a flash but I saw the screen. A
yellow background and familiar speech bubbles.

I felt a sense of discomfort. If my eyes weren't wrong… I had definitely
seen a chat room on the screen.

…The Internet? Right here?
                Chapter 49: Ep. 10 – Future War, VII


The Internet, it wasn't possible.

Since the scenario started, the Internet had been shut down all over Seoul
due to the activation of the dokkaebi channels.

No, wait a minute. This was Dongmyo Station. Ah… right. Then the
Internet was possible?

Lee Sungkook looked at me with an uneasy expression and opened his
mouth.

"Excuse me, Yoo Joonghyuk-nim?"

"What?"

"We've arrived. The representative is waiting inside."
I saw a medium-sized tent roughly set up in the middle of the platform. The
representative had an assortment of goods.

"Let's go."

Lee Sungkook bowed his head and guided me. The inside of the tent was
quite luxurious. It was unbelievably luxurious for such a shabby tent.

There was a red carpet and a bed that seemed to have been stolen from a
luxury hotel. There was a round table for a meeting and a small desk with a
computer.

The most interesting thing was the boy concentrated on surfing the Internet.
The face seemed only a few years older than Gilyoung. The boy had dark
circles and sat on the chair in his pajamas.

And there was a navy blue flag held tightly in his arms. Amazing. This boy
had already passed the halfway mark of the King's Road.

 * Currently under a powerful hypnosis.


I clearly remembered. Dongmyo's king. Maybe this boy would soon
become the Hermit King of Shadows. The poor boy king was busy replying
to Internet comments.
–Is it true that Seoul is now isolated? ㅋㅋ Gangnam land prices will fall
~~ Are the rich people crying??

┗ㄴㄴ It isn't just Seoul but all the capitals in the world. Tokyo, Beijing,
all of them are trapped in that dome.

┗ Isn't there a plan to recapture Seoul? Didn't it start yesterday?


–ㅋㅋㅋ But now all the people inside have awakened powers ㅋㅋㅋ It
isn't a crazy fantasy.

┗ It became a fantasy the moment the monsters appeared.

The long-familiar Internet screen looked weird. I once again felt it was real.
Indeed. This was the situation we were in now. On the outside of the dome,
many people still didn't know the truth.

The boy king's fingers started to move.

–You guys, have you ever heard of the Prophets? I don't know what they
are but they claim to know the secrets of this situation ㅎ ㅎ

[Character 'Han Donghoon' has activated Comments Manipulation Lv. 3.]

As soon as the activation message popped up, dozens of comments
appeared under the boy's one.

┗ Who would believe that?

┗ I thought that as well, but not anymore… I saw a prophecy not long ago
and it all came true. For real.
┗ For real? Where is their place of action? Shoot me the address.

The comment started to spread all over the Internet with tremendous power.
It was surprising. They were already using the ability this way.

"Representative Han Donghoon?"

Lee Sungkook called out and the boy raised his head.

"A guest has come. Greet him."

The boy, Han Donghoon's sunken eyes turned to me.

"H, He, H, Hell…o."

Han Donghoon wasn't in a normal state.

This boy, who was called the 'Seventh King of Seoul' in Ways of Survival
now looked so haggard. Originally, he avoided humans due to his nature
but it wasn't this much.

Han Donghoon staggered up and sat on a chair at the round table, biting at
his nails.

Lee Sungkook smiled as if he was satisfied.

"Now Yoo Joonghyuk-nim. Let's start the talk with the representative in
earnest."

I gazed at Han Donghoon and laughed.

"Talk? What talk?"

"Huh?"
"Are you joking with me right now?"

Han Donghoon's eyes were blank.

"…This is the representative?"

Obviously, the boy was the representative of this station. In name. But…

The word representative didn't meant in 'reality'.

"How long are you going to make fun of me? You want to make me talk
with a doll?"

I looked back and saw Lee Sungkook's hands shaking. He probably didn't
think that Sage's Eye would find out. He opened the smartphone to check
something and sighed.

"…Yoo Joonghyuk-nim, I'm not usually like this. Please forgive me."

"You are the real power of this station. Isn't that right?"

"Yes."

"How many other people know?"

"Only a few top executives."

Setting up a person with a strong ability as a scarecrow and taking control
of the station. It was a strategy often used in Ways of Survival but it was
strange to see it in reality.

"If you are the real power, why did you bring me here?"

"It was to avoid the attention of other people. I don't know if you
have realized, but there is a Sound Wave Blocking skill around the
tent." I had expected it. In fact, this was one of Han Donghoon's
abilities.

"It must be really important."

"That's correct. Yoo Joonghyuk-nim, it is important for you and for all of
us."

"All of you?"

Lee Sungkook took a deep breath and opened his mouth.

"I'm a Prophet. To be precise, I am one of them."

The information I wanted was finally coming out. I waited silently for his
next words.

"Yoo Joonghyuk-nim, you will never know the enormous joy we are
feeling right now. My colleagues and I have been waiting for this day of
great victory for Yoo Joonghyuk-nim."

Did I hear wrong? This guy started speaking strange words.

"We know about Yoo Joonghyuk-nim's special ability. A miracle that
allows you to go back to the past after dying. In this world, only Yoo
Joonghyuknim received such special power!"

I was a bit nervous about the constellations' filtering but I decided to keep
listening.

"Maybe Yoo Joonghyuk-nim has already repeated a few lives. You have
fought against terrible enemies and struggled against the beings of this
world to save people. Enduring alone, lonely memories… We respect your
sublime spirit."
This jerk, such skillful flattery. Yoo Joonghyuk would be moved to tears if
he heard. Later when he was depressed, I would have to tell him these
words.

"But Yoo Joonghyuk-nim should've realized it from your past
regressions. Even if you have an outstanding miracle, you alone can't
fight against the disasters that will come." Plus, he was right.

"Yoo Joonghyuk-nim, this time will be different. It is because we are here.
We Prophets have received a special blessing and have been sent to help
you."

Wow, look at this?

Lee Sungkook smiled faintly.

"You must be wondering. Why did these guys who didn't appear last time
suddenly show up now? It is very confusion but I hope you can trust us. It
is because we have already received a revelation for this day 10 years ago."

"…Revelation?"

"Yes. In our world, there is a 'revelation' that is secretly shared among the
Prophets. Yoo Joonghyuk exists in it and is a living myth. It is a single
revelation that records all of the past and future.

Wait. Don't tell me 'that' was the revelation?

"You don't believe me yet. We already knew that Yoo Joonghyuk-nim
would gather Lee Hyunsung. They didn't come with you but you probably
already have Delusion Demon Kim Namwoon and Maritime Admiral Lee
Jihye. But that isn't enough. At the very least, according to the
revelation…" I hid my nervousness and asked.

"Where is the revelation?"
"Unfortunately, it has been damaged and we can't find the original. Don't
worry. We each remember a fragment of the revelation. Through these
fragments, we are prepared to walk the right path with you."

…Ohu.

"If you live again the way you have always done, Yoo Joonghyuk-nim…
will die again. But it will be different with us."

Lee Sungkook was going in circles. I slowly closed my eyes and said, "I
see."

Lee Sungkook hurriedly stopped talking. Maybe he was nervous. Yoo
Joonghyuk had Lie Detection.

Of course, I didn't have this skill. But even if I did, his story wouldn't get
caught by Lie Detection. It was because Lie Detection couldn't distinguish
such falsehoods.

That's why I felt it even more.

"…It is surprising."

It was true. I was shocked beyond surprise. This was a great 'setting'. A
setting that was squeezed out in a short amount of time. Human creativity
was really great.

"You are called Sungkook?"

"Yes, Yoo Joonghyuk-nim."

I could write the book Ways of Survival. In order to help the hero who kept
dying, readers received a revelation and came from outside the novel? This
was more exciting than the real Ways of Survival. But that was it.
"Don't go around in circles."

This was it.

"Get straight to the point."

I heard the set up so it was time to speak.

"You have received the revelation of the future. Then what exactly are you
going to do?"

Lee Sungkook quickly replied.

"We would like to form an alliance with Yoo Joonghyuk-nim. I-It is an
alliance in name but it actually means going under you…"

He was a funny guy. In the end, this was his purpose? Riding the bus that
was the main character?

"I see. An alliance. You want this."

"Yes."

"It is an interesting suggestion."

"This means…"

I tapped my fingers against the table.

"But the order is wrong."

"Huh?"

"How can I form an alliance with people whose identities I don't know? If
you want to ally with me, isn't this the first thing you should start with?"

"M-My identity… I already…"
I got up from the chair and sat on the plush bed in the room. Then I crossed
my legs and declared.

"Kneel down."

"Huh?"

"Kneel."

Lee Sungkook was embarrassed for a moment before getting down from his
chair while hiding his expression. As his knees slowly reached the floor, I
opened my mouth.

"Tell me your attribute."

Once I saw the strong hypnosis on the king candidate, I guessed this guy's
attribute. However, I needed to make sure.

Lee Sungkook looked up at me with complicated eyes. His mind was
probably working hard. He would think this.

「 Yoo Joonghyuk can see my information with Sage's Eye. 」

「He already knows it so what is the reason for asking about my
information? 」

Lee Sungkook struggled for a moment before speaking.

"My attribute is… Hypnotist."

As expected, it was Hypnotist.

"I see."

Lee Sungkook looked a bit brighter at my nod. He thought he had passed a
test.
"Is that all?"

"…Huh?"

Lee Sungkook's eyes shook.

"…O-One more."

I nodded.

"Tell me."

"T-The 9th…

"The 9th?"

Lee Sungkook slowly lowered his head like he was ashamed.

"The 9th person… to get off."

I see. This brat, the 9th…

…No, wait. Then how many people were there?
            Chapter 50: Ep. 11 – Night of the Prophets, I


"The 9th person to get off… it is the first time I've heard of this attribute."

"Oh, you probably wouldn't have. This is the first time us Prophets have
seen it."

This brat was giving an excuse. I wanted to tease him a bit.

"But it is strange. If you really received the revelation, why aren't you a
'revelator' instead of 'someone who got off'? What is with this name?"

"T-That… the revelation… no, the book of revelation…"

Lee Sungkook stuttered. It was delightful watching him try to avoid Lie
Detection. I wondered how honest he could be. Lee Sungkook finally
closed his eyes.

"When I read the book of revelation… I stopped!"
"You stopped reading it? Why didn't you read it?"

"The contents of the Book of Revelations are very difficult, vast and
profound…"

"Then you were the 9th person to get off?"

"Yes…"

"I don't think that will be of much help to me."

"N-No! I can definitely help you!"

The confused Lee Sungkook continued to speak gibberish while uneasily
turning his smartphone off and on.

"Why do you keep touching that smartphone?"

"I-I-I'm sorry. I am a smartphone addict…"

He was trying to get advice from the other ones who got off. But that didn't
last long.

"Are you going on the Internet?"

"Y-Yes, that's right. It is the ability of the hermit…"

At Lee Sungkook's words, I looked towards Han Donghoon. The
hypnotized boy was busy tearing at his fingernails with empty eyes.

The Hermit King of Shadows who had the powerful information
manipulation ability. This boy couldn't be kept under the prophets.

If the Prophets became involved in the story in this way, the original novel
was ruined and the plans I set up would be wasted. I had to stop these guys
before everything went wrong.
"Do the other prophets also have the attribute of 'getting off'?"

"…Yes."

"How many are there in total?"

"That…" Lee Sungkook hesitated for a moment before opening his mouth.
"As far as I know, there are 48 people."

48 people? It was smaller than I thought.

Considering that chapter 1,200 had one hit and chapter 10 had 120 hits, I
thought there would be at least 100 people.

Lee Sungkook's words resolved my curiosity.

"I know there were more prophets originally, but I expected that most of
them didn't pass the first scenario."

"They are dead despite knowing the future?"

"That… we have received the revelation but we only recently realized that
it was a 'true' revelation."

Now it made a little sense.

Perhaps at the start of the scenario, few readers thought that a novel that
started serialization 10 years ago would become a reality. They might not
remember it straight away.

I thought it was strange that Lee Sungkook survived. Furthermore, this guy
was the ninth person to stop reading so he was literally one of the earliest
readers. Then how did he survive?

"I fortunately survived the carriage. If it hadn't been for another prophet
nearby, I would've died."
Another prophet in the same place as him?

"That―"

The moment that Lee Sungkook was about to speak, the ground slightly
shook. The vibration was transmitted despite Sound Wave Blocking.

Lee Sungkook and I ran out of the tent at the same time.

Kung!

I thought it was a sudden sub scenario but that wasn't it. Two people stood
in the center of the epicenter. The man and woman facing each other. I
didn't know the man but the other person was…

"You aren't a supporting role… yet you dare to push me?"

"What are you talking about, you dog-like jerk."

…Not surprisingly, it was Jung Heewon.

"What? Dog…? You bitch!"

The man grabbed a very large ring sword from his back. His overall level
seemed in line with Jung Heewon's. But it wasn't enough.

Jung Heewon movements were already above incarnations of the same
class. Jung Heewon's blade moved lightly as the man attacked.

[The character 'Jung Heewon' has activated the special option of Mikazuki
Munechika, "Death God's Footsteps'…]

"Jung Heewon!"

Jung Heewon stopped his black just before she cut off the man's head. The
hairs were rising on the man's neck.
It was a tremendous difference in speed. If I hadn't intervened, the man
would be dead.

The startled Lee Sungkook cried out, "Jung Minseob! What are you doing
now?"

I realized it when I saw Lee Sungkook's confusion.

[The exclusive skill, Character List is activated.]

Then the expected message popped up.


[The information of this person can't be read in 'Character List'.]

[This person isn't registered in 'Character List'.]

That's right. He was also a Prophet.




After a while, another prophet was on his knees in front of me, with Lee
Sungkook next to him.

"I'm sorry, my friend didn't know anything… Hey, apologize quickly!"

The man sitting beside him bowed towards me.

"…I'm sorry."

Unlike Lee Sungkook. he was a very prideful person and couldn't
completely remove the anger from his face. I looked at Jung Heewon and
said.

"Jung Heewon, I told you not to be reckless."
"T-This bastard…!"

"Jung Heewon!"

Jung Heewon made a surprised expression for the first time.

"…I'm sorry, Yoo Joonghyuk-nim."

Jung Heewon bowed and turned to leave, Lee Hyunsung following her with
a strange expression. I knew that Jung Heewon wasn't the type to raise a
sword to someone for no reason.

However, it was dangerous to move in this current situation.

The other man looked at me and asked, "Are you really Yoo
Joonghyuknim?"

"Yes, are you also a prophet?"

"…Yes."

There was a complicated expression on his face. He looked between me,
Jung Heewon and Lee Hyunsung. Then he glanced at Lee Sungkook and
said.

"Excuse me, Yoo Joonghyuk-nim. I'm sorry but I'm afraid I'll have to
leave you for a moment. Sungkook, talk with me for a minute." He left
the tent while Lee Sungkook bowed to me.

"I won't wait long."

"Yes!"

It wouldn't be like this if it was the original Yoo Joonghyuk. But I had a
reason for allowing them to talk. As soon as Lee Sungkook left the tent, I
immediately called to Bihyung.
'Hey Bihyung'.

[What is it? Having fun again…]

'Hearing enhancement, 2,000 coins'.

[······.]

Now Bihyung had adapted. It took less than three seconds before an
advertisement went up.

[2,000 coins have been consumed.]

[The exclusive skill 'Hearing Enhancement' has been acquired.]

Bihyung warned.


[Hey, be careful from the fourth scenario onwards. For such a wide-
scale scenario, the intermediate dokkaebis have jurisdiction…] I
ignored Bihyung's words.

[The exclusive skill 'Hearing Enhancement Lv. 1' is activated.]

I moved my body outside the tent blocked by Sound Wave Blocking. Then
voices started to be heard. They weren't too far from where I was hiding.

"Hey, isn't it slightly strange?"

"What?"

"Do you see that as a handsome face?"

"What are you talking about suddenly…?"

"The author said that Yoo Joonghyuk was handsome."
This bastard? Fortunately, Lee Sungkook dismissed it.

"The author might have different tastes… He is Yoo Joonghyuk for sure.
He has the same dirty nature."

"You only got off at the 9th chapter, what do you know…?"

"This…! You don't really remember it since you read it a long time ago!"

"Still, aren't some scenes pretty clear with the 'Memory Benefits? Would
you even remember the prologue without this privilege? You might not be
alive if it wasn't for me…"

Their voices were coming closer.

"It is weird no matter how I look at it. Setting aside Lee Hyunsung, who is
that strange woman? If I remember correctly, there wasn't such a woman in
the third regression."

"Then check it. See if he is really Yoo Joonghyuk."

"…But what if he is real?"

"We will go according to plan. If we get Yoo Joonghyuk here, we can deal
with those who read until the 50th chapter."

Some really good information was coming in. Despite wanting to hug onto
the main character, these guys were unleashing all types of curse words
because of their situation. This was why they were humans.

Lee Sungkook and the man was coming closer.

"I apologize for the long wait. Let's go inside."

We went back into the tent.
"Yoo Joonghyuk-nim. I apologize for my previous disrespect. I will
greet you again. I am Jung Minseob." The man smiled and bowed.

Once again, this guy had pretty good items for being beaten by Jung
Heewon. In particular, there was the useful Fugitive's Mask which allowed
the user to freely change their face and appearance.

I cut to the chase.

"Then where did you get off?"

Jung Minseob glared at Lee Sungkook. He seemed to be saying something
with his eyes.

"…The 1,089th person to get off."

1,089. Considering the number of views for chapter 1,200 was 1 and the
number of views for chapter 10 was 120, this guy was a person who got off
quite late.

Maybe this was the guy who saved Lee Sungkook in the first scenario.

"As a prophet who has read the Book of Revelation, I am glad and
honoured to meet Yoo Joonghyuk-nim. However, Yoo Joonghyuk-nim…
I'm sorry but can I ask you some questions?"

"Question? What is the question?"

"That, regarding Yoo Joonghyuk…"

"Do you doubt that I'm the real Yoo Joonghyuk?"

"…T-That's not it."

His face was red from my intense gaze.

"Try it."
"Yes?"

"Ask me."

The confused Jung Minseob nodded.

"Um… Then excuse me."

In order to properly trick these guys, I had to keep a few things in mind.

"As far as I know, Yoo Joonghyuk took Delusional Demon Kim Namwoon
as a companion in the third regression. Yet you have a strange woman with
you instead of Kim Namwoon."

"…"

"I thought she was Lee Jihye but she doesn't seem to be in her teens. I also
heard you calling her a different name."

His memory and observation skills were quite good. Like Jung Minseob
said, this world had already changed from the third turn that I knew. Now I
had to shift this changed world to 'suit my taste' as much as possible.

"If you are asking me why I don't have the Delusional Demon with me, the
answer is simple. In this turn, the Delusional Demon doesn't exist."

"…Huh?" D-Doesn't exist? Perhaps… did he die?"

"Yes."

Their faces were filled with confusion for a moment. Jung Minseob asked,
"No, how… Who the hell killed Kim Namwoon?"

"The Delusion Demon Kim Namwoon…"

These prophets' mouths were slowly dropping. Now I would drive in the
last wedge.
"He died at the hands of a prophet like you."
