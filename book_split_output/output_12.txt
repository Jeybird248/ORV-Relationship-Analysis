549: Epilogue 5 - The Eternity and Epilogue, IV


Yoo Joonghyuk dreamed a particular dream. It was about the time he
participated in the 'Journey to the West scenario' with the rest of the <Kim
Dokja's Company> members. In the dream, he was running on top of the
Tongtian River's surface. He could see the figures of Jung Heewon, Yoo
Sangah, Lee Hyunsung and Shin Yoosung running next to him.

【Notnotnotnotnotnotnot】

Yogoes were screaming out their death throes repeatedly.

His memories grew clearer and clearer. Right, they were participating in the
Journey to the West in order to rescue Kim Dokja.

But then… where was Kim Dokja?

Tsu-chuchuchu…

【…What a pathetic sight this is. With only this much, you actually dared
to come out to the 'outside of the story'?】
A voice could be heard coming from somewhere.

【I was wondering why dangerous Story ripples could be detected in the
vicinity, but… He was the cause, then.】

【What are we going to do, captain?】

【We decided not to interfere anymore, right? Are you really going to help
him?】

Voices that were familiar, yet also quite foreign to him.

Was this a part of his memories? Who could have said those words?

Suddenly, the front of his eyes seemed to get darker, only to reveal a
pitchblack shadow standing there and blocking the light. An Outer God
stood in the middle of the dim shadows. Even without consciously realizing
it, Yoo Joonghyuk began emitting fighting intent.

Right. He did fight against this bastard back then, too. The other him who
had witnessed the world's end after living through 1863 regressions – the
'Secretive Plotter'.

Even before Yoo Joonghyuk could use a skill, though – the 'Secretive
Plotter' spoke up first.

【Did you really think the end of a regressor will be that easy?】

The Tongtian River was upturned. Yogoes rising up from every corner of
the river's surface pounced on Yoo Joonghyuk. The discarded stories clung
onto his body all at the same time. The forgotten Stories were being sucked
into his mouth and nose. He gradually sank beneath the water as the
headwrecking pain swallowed him up.

【Do not forget. We aren't even permitted the luxury of death.】

With that true voice as the signal, his view was flipped around. Yoo
Joonghyuk woke up heavily panting as if he was vomiting out the river's
water. Yogoes that clung onto him in the dream were nowhere to be seen
now, having disappeared to somewhere unknown. However, someone else's
presence could be felt, instead.

[Whew. You really shocked me there, making me think you were dead and
all.]

A clear, gentle voice greeted him. Yoo Joonghyuk shook his still-dizzy
head. A blurry figure was before his eyes. A warm, caring aura emitted
from this silhouette gently wrapped around his entire body.

…Was he still dreaming?

His vision recovered gradually, and the face of the blurry figure could
finally be seen. Yoo Joonghyuk hurriedly rubbed his eyes without even
realizing it. Was he hallucinating, instead? This young girl's external
appearance resembled Kim Dokja's, somehow. Her eyes sparkling like stars
were quietly observing him.

[I didn't expect to see you here, captain. You probably can understand now
how I felt while wandering around the world-lines. Right?]

This child, she…

[You don't have to worry. I've already repaired most of your scattered
Story. And just in case, I've even started a sub scenario so you should be
fine for the time being.]

Could she be…

[That's so disappointing. Do I have to speak like this for you to recognise
me?]

As the girl smiled mischievously, a small horn suddenly grew out of her
head. Her lips parted a little, and a familiar cry he'd been missing for so
long jumped out.

[Baat.]
"Has master got in touch yet?"

"Nope. I'm sure he's taking good care of things," replied Han Sooyoung.

It had already been three months since Yoo Joonghyuk left on his voyage.
The work on the manuscript continued on without a hitch, and the updates
were continuously being sent through the Cloud System.

[Number of file downloads: 0]

However, Yoo Joonghyuk had not logged in once to the Cloud System
using the Stigma during the past three months.

'Yoo Joonghyuk, that idiot. Just what is he doing?'

The ominous foreboding slowly mushroomed in Han Sooyoung's heart. She
even began thinking that maybe she should've been the one to head out.

Yoo Mia was next to her, sweating profusely while performing a series of
press-ups.

"I'll become strong enough to break both of my oppa's legs."

Han Sooyoung looked at Yoo Mia and the girl's blazing eyes, and could
only nod her head as a sign of encouragement.

And how long did she tap on the keyboard afterwards? Suddenly, a
message entered her head.

[Your Incarnation has logged into the 'Cloud System'.]
After Biyoo heard about the general gist of the situation, she responded in
the following manner.

[…Okay, so. You'll spread the story you receive via Han Sooyoung's
Stigma to other world-lines. That's the core of the plan, right?]

"Correct."

[And you're hoping that the reincarnated versions of Dokja ahjussi will read
that story.]

"Also correct."

[Not bad. To think that you'd come up with a plan to take advantage of the
'Oldest Dream's nature like this…]

"I also thought it's not a bad-sounding p…"

[…Did you really think I'd be impressed by that plan? How did you
even cook up such a hair-brained scheme, seriously?!] …Was Biyoo's
personality originally like this?

[But then again, captain, you're completely capable of doing something this
crazy without batting an eyelid.]

Yoo Joonghyuk frowned deeply at that somewhat mocking tone of voice.
The more he heard her talk, the more she began sounding like Kim Dokja
for some reason.

[The odds of success are not very good, you know.]

"I know."

[The 'Oldest Dream' of that world-line might not even read the story. And
the more advanced a civilisation is, the less important the contents made up
purely of letters becomes. So you may not even get a chance to approach
such a world, too.]
"Before that, crossing the world-lines is the biggest problem."

Yoo Joonghyuk stared at the half-destroyed ark. Although he got lucky
with Biyoo's help and managed to survive, it was impossible to visit other
worldlines without the vessel.

Biyoo thought about something for a while then spoke what's in her mind.
[Why can't you go? What are the coordinates? Give to me.]

With a slightly unconvinced face, Yoo Joonghyuk handed over the list of
coordinates Yoo Sangah gave him earlier. Biyoo confirmed all the
worldlines on it and smiled refreshingly.

[You do know who I am, right? I'm none other than the 'Dokkaebi King',
you know.]

It was right then, Yoo Joonghyuk recalled an obvious fact.

The [Final Ark] was an item belonging to the Bureau. And the top
representative of the Bureau was precisely the 'Dokkaebi King'.

[Can you guess what I had been doing in the 'Dark Stratum'? While you and
other companions went to the 1865th turn, I too had been working my butt
off somewhere, that's what.]

The deep, boundless wisdom could be sensed behind Biyoo's eyes drawing
a smiling arc.

The Dark Stratum. A place where the time's density was far greater than
any other spacetime.

Just how long had Biyoo been staying in such a space?

She pulled out a Wenny pouch from her inner pocket and continued on.

[I've got my hands on the dead Wenny King's dimensional doorway so
jumping to the nearest world-line isn't going to be a problem at all. As for
those in the far-flung distance… Well, it should be doable after repairing
the ark a bit, I think. The problem is with the energy to be used as the
fuel…] Yoo Joonghyuk looked down at his own Incarnation body. Thanks
to Biyoo saving his life, most of his injuries had been healed, but the
majority of his Stories were left badly mangled after they protected him for
over 300 days of adrift at space, as well as during the battle against the
hounds.

[I guess that's also been sorted out now, too.]

"…Mm?"

He wasn't sure how it happened, but his inside was overflowing with
Stories. A truly extraordinary amount of Stories were writhing around
within him, getting ready to be unleashed.

[Just where did you acquire the Stories of the 'Nameless Ones'? Not only
that, such a humongous amount, too…]

Stories that had been discarded by the scenario was now trying to speak to
him.

[Stories with unknown names from 'Outer Gods' wish to accompany you.]

Stories from the 'Nameless Ones' he had run across in the final scenario
once upon a time. Existences born in a place no stars paid attention to, and
who had to die in a place no one was looking at.

They were currently talking to Yoo Joonghyuk.

[Stories with unknown names are picking up the scent of an ancient dream
from you.]

[Now that I think about it, something felt a bit off when I was picking you
up. The 'Nameless Ones' that didn't possess any ego were busy protecting
you, you know?]
Yoo Joonghyuk recalled the dream he had not too long ago – the Journey to
the West scenario, the voices of the 'Secretive Plotter' as well as the 999th
turn's individuals.

…But, it couldn't be.

He hurriedly enhanced his perception, but couldn't detect anything. While
listening to Biyoo's voice, Yoo Joonghyuk quietly observed the view of the
space spreading out like an endless ocean.

[By using those Stories as our fuel, we shouldn't have any problems
travelling long distances. Okay, let's get a move on, then. The hounds'
territory is nearby, so if we take our time lounging around here, things
might get dicey again.]

Since Yoo Joonghyuk had no thoughts of encountering those hounds again,
he quickly nodded his head as well.

[It's a bit cramped inside for two people, so… Baat!]

Pure-white and abundant fur sprouted from Biyoo's body, then she suddenly
shrunk down to the size of a single fist.

[Dokkaebi King 'Biyoo' has started the ark's voyage!]

Along with that message, the ark's main engine came to life. The vessel left
behind the blue-hued Story traces and disappeared from there in the blink of
an eye.

…

…

…

A short while later, five shadows appeared near where the ark used to be.

【Do you think he'll succeed?】
【That's uncertain. However, this is as far as we can help him.】

【Let's hurry up and return, shall we? Today's the parent's day at school,
after all. By the way, who agreed to go with Dokja?】

【Me, me, me, me!!】

【You idiot obviously aren't qualified.】

The 'Secretive Plotter' watched the ark disappearing beyond the distant
galaxy and murmured out.

【I pray that we don't have to run into each other again, Yoo Joonghyuk.】




Jang Hayoung working on the revision of the second act yawned grandly in
boredom and asked a question. "By the way, Han Sooyoung? Can I ask you
something?"

"No."

"What did you tell Yoo Joonghyuk regarding the method of delivering the
manuscript?" Jang Hayoung spoke in a tone of voice indicating her distrust
of the man in question. "I took a look, and well, besides him knowing how
to play games, he didn't seem to know his way around a computer, you
know? Would he even know how to upload novels to a website?"

"He can't personally serialise the novel. That would mean he'd be stuck in a
world-line for too long."

"What then?"

Han Sooyoung thought about it for a second, then muttered out. "The most
ideal way would be to find someone who can serialise it for us…"
⸢The planetary system Z865123. In the year 2020 of the imperial
calendar…⸥

On that day, a webnovel writer named Lee Hak-Hyeon was busy writing up
his manuscript inside a one-room flat for students, only to get into a verbal
tussle with his editor over the phone.

 –        Author-nim, just what are you planning to write this time?
 What's the titleof the novel?

"…It's the Me-sword Master."

 –         The Me-sword Master? What is it about?

"Okay, so… The protagonist is a method actor in a fantasy world, and he
eventually masters his acting skills and also becomes a swordmaster…"

 –        Ah, I see. That's enough. By the way, didn't I tell you many
 times before tonever start with the line 'imperial calendar' this and that?

Lee Hak-Hyeon listened to the editor's voice continuing on for a long while
afterwards, and his expression became gloomier and gloomier.

 –         Have you forgotten what happened with your previous novel?
 Author-nim,please think about this carefully. I beg of you… Lee Hak-
 Hyeon recalled his previous outputs.

His debut work, ⸢⸢Orc Philosopher⸥⸥, completely tanked with a pathetically
embarrassing score – this novel's paywalled chapters were bought only by
his best friend and no one else besides – and the follow-up he wrote with
much fanfare, ⸢⸢How to Become a Famous Author⸥⸥ also tanked pretty hard
because well, he was not a famous author, to begin with. And just like that,
this was his third try.
"Those who will succeed, will succeed. While those who won't, won't. I'm
the latter, I guess."

He was three months behind on his rent, and with what little money he had
on him, it'd be difficult to even buy tonight's dinner.

Lee Hak-Hyeon stared at the empty Korean word processor page, before
rushing up to the rooftop of the building. The ground as seen from the fifth
floor looked pretty far enough.

"…Nah. Even then, this is… Hah-ah… Huh?"

Lee Hak-Hyeon rubbed his eyes. Was he hallucinating? Something was
wavering before his eyes.

"What's going on? My tears?"

A man was standing there. Not just any man, but an incredibly handsome
dude wearing a black coat, no less. And a figurine with fluffy fur was
sitting on this man's shoulder. Even a blind could see that this guy was
someone extraordinary.

He'd be pretty much perfect as a protagonist from a novel, in a way…

"You over there. You seem to be a webnovel author."

The black coat-wearing man's powerful aura caused Lee Hak-Hyeon's legs
to tremble even unbeknownst to himself. The latter managed to eke out a
reply. "Y-yes, I am."

"In that case, you should know how to serialise a novel, then."

"Well, that…"

It was at that moment that a realization dawned on Lee Hak-Hyeon. He'd
heard about this weird rumour from someone, somewhere – a legendary tale
of those authors who mysteriously vanished from the world, only to
triumphantly return with stunning epics in tow. The tale of incredible luck
that only a select handful of writers are blessed with.

Lee Hak-Hyeon realized what kind of a situation this was, and his shoulders
began trembling.

'I-i-is this the chosen author cliché??'

If all the webnovels he had read so far had some dose of reality in them,
then that black coat-wearing man should take Lee Hak-Hyeon into the
world of a novel. And then, he'd ask the latter to fix the conclusion written
by another writer. The latter would utilise his brain honed by clichés to its
fullest extent and go on to perform truly fantastical feats.

"Yes, yes! I know how to do it! I shall change your world's future!"

"…??"

"Please, hurry and take me with you! I may look like this, but I'm a pro
webnovel author with prior experience in paid serialisation…"

A dull thud rang out as something hit the back of Lee Hak-Hyeon's head.
He blacked out immediately.




[Wait a minute, captain!! What are you doing, knocking the guy out!!]

Biyoo cried out sharply.

They were currently in the planetary system Z865123. They had to go
through no less than 17 layers of [Dark Stratum] from Earth they had been
living in to barely reach this world-line.

"It couldn't be helped. He was too talkative."
[…Now what are we going to do?]

Yoo Joonghyuk began pulling out several instruments from his inner
pocket. "From now on, we need to forcibly insert the novel Han Sooyoung
has written into this man's brain."

[What are you talking about?! Do you even know how long that will
take?! Are you going to brainwash people like this every time you enter a
new world-line??] "That is…"

When he thought about it, he realized that this method could only take them
so far. They couldn't stick around and keep their eyes on this man forever,
and the brainwashing could stop working after Yoo Joonghyuk had left this
world-line.

[You said that Han Sooyoung hadn't finished writing the novel yet, right?
We don't have the time to visit this world again later. At this rate, even if
we hand over the novel, the serialisation might stop in the middle, you
know!]

"Han Sooyoung, that fool…"

[Stop blaming someone else, and activate that thing called Cloud System or
something. Hurry.]

Since she sounded as if she had a plan here, Yoo Joonghyuk didn't argue
and did as he was told.

[Sync your display with mine.]

Biyoo then began browsing and poking at the [Cloud System]'s files
floating up before her eyes. Soon, her hands stopped moving before a
specific file.

[Dokkaebi King 'Biyoo' is trying to approach the Cloud System using the
authority of the Bureau.]
[Will you allow the access to the portion of the files?]

Yoo Joonghyuk clicked on the confirmation icon. When he did, a
transparent thread extended out from the file and got connected to the head
of the unconscious webnovel writer.

[Dokkaebi King 'Biyoo' has exercised her authority and altered the 'Cloud
System'.]

[The system's influence is minimal in this worldview. Additional
Probability will be consumed!]

[The set-up, 'Inspiration Sharing', has been created!]

Biyoo wiped away the strands of sweat from her forehead and spoke. [I've
synchronised the cloud's files with this guy's subconsciousness. From now
on, the stories Han Sooyoung writes in the future will be updated
automatically to this guy's subconscious mind.]

Now that was a truly stunning Story manipulation ability. Even Han
Sooyoung needed quite a lot of time to create a single Stigma, so this…

Yoo Joonghyuk asked her. "Is this method safe? What if this fool
unnecessarily starts suspecting something…?"

[Suspect? Not very likely. No, he's gonna love the change, actually. I mean,
he's being showered by inspirations, so which writer wouldn't welcome that
with open arms? He'll definitely believe that he's the one writing this story.]

Biyoo smirked and looked down at the still-unconscious man. Yoo
Joonghyuk alternated his gaze between such Biyoo and the unmoving
webnovel writer as a strange little thought crept into his mind. Could it be
that a 'novel', any novel, was written like this, to begin with?

Biyoo lightly knocked on the head of the unconscious writer and spoke.

[He will probably think that a muse came to bless him or something.]
When Lee Hak-Hyeon opened his eyes again, he found himself slumped
over his own desk.

"…Was I dreaming? Urgh…"

He slowly got up and wiped his mouth, then began massaging his temples.

That was one strangely vivid dream. A dream where he was being
threatened by a man wearing a black coat. And then, there was a figuring
floating in the air, seemingly made out of a lump of wool… It seemed
rather likely that,

him secluding himself in this small room for too long while attempting to
write something, had finally pushed him over the edge.

Lee Hak-Hyeon spat out a long, long groan and switched on the once-
empty notebook screen. But on it was…

⸢There are three ways to survive in a ruined world.⸥
…A sentence he didn't remember typing was there.

On top of this, his hands were actually moving on their own to continue
typing away.

⸢My ancient smartphone displaying the webnovel platform struggled to
move through the screen. I scrolled down, then up. How many times did I
do that, I wondered.

"Really? Is that really the end??"⸥
"…Oh?"
Lee Hak-Hyeon looked at his hands typing away at a frightening turn of
speed and began wondering if he had finally lost his mind. Hell, he thought
that he could even hear some sort of a voice coming from within his mind,
too.

…You tanked badly the last time by making the author the protagonist.
How about making the reader the protagonist this time around?

⸢Kim Dokja(金獨子). My father wanted me to become a tough man even if
I was left alone so he gave me such a name.⸥
When he typed one sentence, another one would pop up in his head, and
when he finished typing that one, yet another would appear in his mind.
Inspirations surged in him like a powerful waterfall.

By the time he regained his wits, he had already completed the prologue as
well as the first chapter.

⸢This was the moment when my life's genre had changed.⸥

Lee Hak-Hyeon dazedly stared at the screen for a long time, before calling
the editor on the phone.

"Uhm, editor-nim? It looks like I might become successful, after all…"
     Chapter 550: Epilogue 5 - The Eternity and Epilogue, V


It had been one year and two months since Yoo Joonghyuk had left on his
journey.

The speed of the manuscript being updated started slowing down around
the time the third part was nearing completion. Even though the manuscript
was still being compiled diligently, there were just too many voids yet to be
filled up.

As the chapter number got higher and higher, stories Han Sooyoung didn't
know of seemed to also increase in number, as well.

"This might prove to be helpful, at least by a little bit," said Aileen.

If she didn't extract Story fragments from the sleeping Kim Dokja, the work
on the manuscript would've slowed down even further.

[Story fragment, 'Great adventure in the Dark Castle', has been successfully
extracted.]
[Story fragment, 'Memories of 1863rd regression turn', has been
successfully extracted.]

[Story fragment, 'Gourmet Association Story', has been successfully
extracted.]

These fragments were stories too small to become Stories. Han Sooyoung
read these fragments and filled in the previously-lacking inside of Kim
Dokja. Even then, far too many parts remained empty. She didn't try to
forcibly fill those voids, however.

[Your Incarnation has logged into the 'Cloud System'.]

Yoo Sangah asked. "It looks like Joonghyuk-ssi is doing well."

"Well, he's probably busy scaring the living daylights out of the poor
webnovel authors," replied Ham Sooyoung.

"I'm curious about what other authors are like. Surely, not everyone is like
you, Sooyoung-ssi?"

"Well, no, not everyone's like… Hey, did you come here just to grind my
gears?"

"The author in question may not even be a person when I think about it. It
could be a highly-developed AI, or…"

Han Sooyoung reluctantly nodded her head. Indeed, the universe was vast
and lots of writers existed out there. And also, writers who got a beating
from Yoo Joonghyuk should be plenty, too.

In any case – judging from how timely the revised manuscript was being
downloaded, that dude must've been doing his job properly so far.

But then…

[Your Incarnation is revising the manuscript you have written.]
"…What??"




[…Captain, what are you doing??]

"I'm fixing the incorrect portion."

Yoo Joonghyuk was in the midst of revising the updated file in real-time
while logging into the [Cloud System]. Originally, it was impossible for an
Incarnation like him to revise a file updated to the [Cloud System], but…

[Your attribute's effects are activating.]

[You can now revise the 'Cloud System's' manuscript.]

[Revision of the already recorded contents requires a great amount of
Probability!]

But, it became possible to do so from some time ago. He couldn't quite
remember just when it started, but it might have been when the attribute
related to writing sleeping inside him began manifesting its powers. Maybe
it had bloomed into life after acquiring the Stories of the 'Outer Gods'.

[…Won't Han Sooyoung get really angry?]

"Even if it's her, she wouldn't have known every story there is. Some parts
especially were in a total mess."

While saying that, Yoo Joonghyuk tapped away on the holographic
keyboard. Biyoo seemed rather impressed by this scene and spoke up.

[Oh… Captain, your grammar is better than I thought! Since you liked
swinging swords around every single day, I figured you wouldn't even
know the difference between a knight and a night but this…]
It was right at that moment that Yoo Joonghyuk's cursor suddenly began
jumping around all on its own.

[Constellation, 'Architect of the False Last Act', has revised the latest file.]

Strange words were suddenly typed over the space where Yoo Joonghyuk's
cursor had been just now.

⸢Hey, you just messed with my manuscript, didn't you?! Do you really want
to die that badly??⸥
…So, there was such a way to communicate with her, then.

Yoo Joonghyuk calmly typed the following sentence.

⸢This is because you failed to store the manuscript properly.⸥

⸢What bulldust are you spewing now??⸥

⸢There were incorrect parts in the manuscript. I've left my opinions on the
file, so confirm them yourself.⸥
After typing that, Yoo Joonghyuk took another look at the parts he had
changed.

⸢Lee Gilyoung wearing the black coat looked down arrogantly at the world
with his star-like sparkling eyes and spoke up. "Hey, you sooty bastard.
You're so weak." – Do you really think this part even makes any sense?⸥

⸢Lee Jihye emitting noble ripples of energy like rushing torrents of a
massive river began swinging her sword. "Water the Sky Sword Door, True
Body Deep Righteousness Slash Technique, Water the Sky Destroy the
Emperor
Slash!!" – There is no such sword technique in the Breaking the Sky
Swordsmanship. Also, all the Hanja letters are incorrect.⸥
Han Sooyoung was silent for a moment there.

⸢…What the hell, I don't remember ever typing these sentences before?
Wait, these haven't been published yet, right?⸥

⸢There are still some time left until the update, so fix them quickly.⸥

Yoo Joonghyuk could pretty much figure out what happened here.

⸢Seriously, those two… With my notebook PC…⸥

Undoubtedly, Lee Gilyoung and Lee Jihye must've changed the scheduled
update file without Han Sooyoung's knowledge.

Biyoo observed the sentences hurriedly being revised before their very eyes
and spoke up. [Looks like you two have become quite close.]

"We're merely communicating like this for the purpose of the mission."

Judging from how the revised version continued to be updated, Han
Sooyoung must've been hard at work trying to reconstruct Kim Dokja's
story in the most preserved, complete state.

This novel would become divorced from the reality they had to live through
when more and more parts of it were filled up via dramatisation or
imagination. As their goal was to recover Kim Dokja, this story had to
reflect the reality they had lived in.

[As long as this is a story, it's impossible to perfectly recreate something.
Every story would be distorted by the narrator, after all.]

"I'm aware of that. It'd be the same even if Kim Dokja himself personally
wrote it."

Yoo Joonghyuk thought about something related to that for a moment or
two. If it was impossible to restore the complete 'Kim Dokja' no matter
which story you wrote, then just what was the existence called 'Kim Dokja',
in the first place?

Yoo Joonghyuk shook his head.

Back then or even now, no one could know that. Well, no one in this world
knew who they were exactly, after all.

He looked at Han Sooyoung's manuscript. Those who had forgotten about
themselves were probably reading her work right about now. They should
be reading this sentence over here, then afterwards, read the one over there
next.

What Yoo Joonghyuk and Han Sooyoung wished from them was just one
thing – wishing for a 'happy ending' that they didn't know to become real
within someone's imagination.

Wishing for the world they had never witnessed before to safely exist
somewhere out there in this universe.

[Constellation, 'Architect of the False Last Act', has revised the latest file.]

⸢By the way, Yoo Joonghyuk? Just how many years have you been
wandering…⸥
[Error has occurred in the 'Cloud System' due to incorrect usage!]

[Due to the storm of Probability's aftermath, the Stigma will temporarily
shut down.]

It seemed that using the manuscript in this fashion was pushing it a little too
far.

Yoo Joonghyuk slowly raised his head and looked at his face reflected on
the ark's window. He could see subtle little premature grey hair spots here
and there on his head.

[Captain, it's not even 100 years yet.]
"I'm aware."

[The time moves really slowly, doesn't it?]

Her voice passing them by indifferently caused Yoo Joonghyuk to falter
just a little. Biyoo still in the form of little furball was staring at the passing
scenery of the Dark Stratum outside with an unreadable expression on her
face. Suddenly, he became conscious of her being Shin Yoosung in her
previous life once more.

⸢"Did you know, captain? Did you know that I had to endure incredibly
difficult years so that I can grant your request?"⸥
She was an existence who had to wander the world-lines as a lost, forgotten
being for thousands of years just to pass on the information to the past
regression.

Yoo Joonghyuk's lips parted and closed several times. He eventually
managed to squeeze some words out. "…It must've been difficult."

[Right. It was really tough. I resented you a lot too, captain.]

The disaster of flood, Shin Yoosung. The Dokkaebi King Biyoo used to
have such a name once upon a time.

[Still, these days I feel relieved to have reincarnated. Because I got to keep
the promise I made with you back then.]

"The promise?"

[Back when I was still Shin Yoosung, you promised me this, captain. You
said, we'd go on a trip together after the scenario comes to an end.]

While listening to Biyoo's voice continue on, he began digging through 41st
turn's memories. Maybe it was due to the memories given to him by the
Secretive Plotter, he could just about barely recall some things about that
day. Shin Yoosung, talking to him about what she wanted to do after the
scenario had ended.

The 41st turn's Yoo Joonghyuk couldn't keep that promise.

⸢"Shin Yoosung, you're the last one."⸥

His companions died one by one, and during the final moments, he sent
Shin Yoosung away to the outside of the world-line.

The memories from that day – just where did the moments from that day
disappear to?

He didn't know. They could have become the 'Nameless Ones'.

"I…"

[Let me say this right now. Don't apologise. The person who should
apologise, and the person that apology is intended for, they don't exist in
this world anymore.]

She was right. In a way, the person saying it and the person listening right
now weren't exactly the right people. Yoo Joonghyuk had lost the 41st
turn's life, and he had forgotten most of the memories from that period of
history ever since Biyoo reincarnated. It was now just an old story that
connected them. They thought about that story for a little while.

[Shall we get going, then?]

"Alright."

All they could do for now was to complete this lengthy journey, and also, to
find the suitable intermediary who could deliver their story.

"This time, the married couple writers over there look to be good
candidates."

More than likely, this trip would last for much longer.
But Yoo Joonghyuk didn't feel that was such a bad thing.




As the serialisation grew longer and longer in length, the number of
episodes that couldn't be filled up only through Kim Dokja's Story
fragments or interviewing the companions, happened more frequently.

Lee Gilyoung grumbled unhappily. "Can't we, like, just gloss over it like
the last time?"

"Since when did I ever gloss over anything? Lee Seolhwa, that thing I
asked you about, get it ready!"

The moment Han Sooyoung finished saying that, Lee Seolhwa wheeled in a
strange device with multiple suction cups connected to it into the hospital
room.

Yoo Sangah spoke up. "…Isn't that the Story fragment extractor?"

Lee Seolhwa nodded her head. "Yes. And from now on, we'll start
extracting
Story fragments from everyone."

"Our Stories?"

"It's possible that you aren't remembering everything, and some could be
hidden below your subconsciousness, as well. I'm sure you're all aware of it
by now, but the majority of a Story is usually accumulated within one's
subconsciousness."

"Ah, but, it's kinda embarrassing… What if weird Stories suddenly pop
out?"

As if she was obviously hoping for that, Han Sooyoung cut in with an
evilsounding voice. "Hey, Lee Gilyoung, Lee Jihye. You two go first."
That caused the duo being called out to back away while hesitating
somewhat.

"Argh, why should I? We already told you everything we know, you know?
Right, noona?"

"Of course, of course!"

Completely disregarding whether they did that or not, Han Sooyoung
grabbed and shoved them down on some chairs, before placing the suction
cups on the duo's heads.

Lee Gilyoung freaked out. "Ahhh? That feels super weird, you know!
Feels like you're putting a plunger on my head!" Tsu-chuchuchu!

"Euh-hihiheek?!"

['Lee Gilyoung's' complete Story has been extracted!]

[Story, 'Demon King Fanatic', has started singing.]

⸢"Oh, oh~ Dokja hyung said this~ back then…"⸥

"I knew it. Even the name of the Story has 'Fanatic' in it."

Lee Gilyoung didn't say anything as he slumped on the seat. Han Sooyoung
narrowed her eyes and glared at the boy, before shifting her glare over to
Lee Jihye next. With excellent timing, that girl's Story had just been
extracted, as well.

['Lee Jihye's' Story fragment has been extracted!]

[Story fragment, 'Natural-born Bender of Facts', has begun its storytelling!]

"Oh, my? Hey, why don't you write the novel instead of me?"

Lee Jihye avoided meeting Han Sooyoung's glare and whistled nervously.
"You two, touch my manuscript again, and Imma kill you dead. You hear
me?"

"…We won't."

"Fine. As for the others…"

Han Sooyoung shook her head grandly and while holding a suction cup, she
turned around – only for Jung Heewon carrying a mischievous expression
to plonk a suction cup on the former's head first.

"Ah?! What the hell! Take it off! Right now!"

['Han Sooyoung's' Story fragment has been extracted!]

[Story fragment, 'Memories of a Lemon Candy', has begun its storytelling.]

⸢"By the way, I've been sucking on that, you know?"

"Okay. So?"

"…You can be so boring sometimes. You know that?"⸥

Jung Heewon spoke up in a teasing tone of voice. "Oh-hoh, would you look
at that? Our dear author-nim, why did she omit such a delicious scene from
the main story, I wonder?"

"…"

"Sangah-ssi, let's try it out ourselves. We need to extract ours quickly so
that our dear author-nim can finish her manuscript."

While Han Sooyoung was angrily gnashing her teeth, the rest of the
companions put the suction cups on and started with their Story fragment
extraction.

['Yoo Sangah's' Story fragment has been extracted!]
[Story fragment, 'Hard work, sincerity, patience', has been extracted.]

"…What the?? Was that your family motto?"

"Everyone should learn from Yoo Sangah-ssi's example."

[Additional Story fragment has been extracted from 'Yoo Sangah'.]

[Story fragment, 'Memories of their first sharp, cold hand-holding', has been
extracted!]

Eyes of Jung Heewon confirming that Story gleamed a little. It was a Story
she also knew, that's why. However, there were some people here who
didn't know what it was about.

Han Sooyoung asked. "What's this? You held Kim Dokja's hand before?"

"Mm~. I've completely forgotten about it. There was something like that,
wasn't there."

"Why did you hold his hand?"

"Are you curious?"

"I need to write the novel, so hurry up and spit it out!"

Next to the duo, Jung Heewon wearing the suction cup on her head smiled
at them. "Hey, Han Sooyoung. It's not that strange for close companions to
hold each other's hands, right? Why do you react so…"

['Jung Heewon's' Story fragment has been extracted!]

[Story fragment, 'I've seen the Demon King of Salvation's Black Flame
Dragon', has been extracted.]

Han Sooyoung narrowed her eyes. "Oh, so really close companions can
show each other stuff like that too?"

"Hahaha… Well, I think this device has developed some kind of an error."
['Lee Hyunsung's' Story fragment has been extracted!]

[Story fragment, 'I've seen the Demon King of Salvation's Black Flame
Dragon', has been extracted!]

Jung Heewon asked, utterly taken back. "Hyunsung-ssi? Why do you also
have that Story?"

"Heewon-ssi, have you forgotten? We saw it together, didn't we?"

"What is it, what is it? What did you two see together??"

When Jang Hayoung began her nagging, Jung Heewon faltered a bit and
started mumbling away about some random stuff in a clearly troubled tone
of voice.

While the intense scrutiny was focused elsewhere, Han Sooyoung sneakily
left her spot and approached the Story extractor. For some reason, she
seemed deeply anxious. She alternated her gaze between the companions
and the extractor with a complicated expression, before cautiously
extending her finger towards the device's power button.

Jung Heewon belatedly discovered that sight and cried out. "Han
Sooyoung, what are you doing?! You better listen well now so you don't get
things mixed up la…"

[Analysis on the additional Story fragment of 'Han Sooyoung' has been
completed.]

[Story fragment, 'I burst Demon King's Black Flame Dragon by mista…]

Almost at the same time, Han Sooyoung switched the device off.
⸢"Okay, so. The attack from Jeon Woo-Chi flew into… my 'that place', is
that it?"⸥
While belatedly typing up the additional contents for the first part, Han
Sooyoung softly grumbled to herself. "Dammit, what a weird event that
was."

Her strange-sounding Story almost got discovered by the companions.

In any case, she got to write the manuscript largely trouble-free all thanks to
extracting Story fragments from the companions.

Here was a novel she wrote while using the definite information as her
foundation while omitting those parts she didn't know of. At this point, she
wasn't even sure whether to call this a novel or an essay.

"Fuu…"

As the work inched closer to the latter half, the shades of pain began
creeping up on the companions' expressions. The memories of their happier
times would eventually end up as the conclusion they had to face.

An ending where all of their effort had turned into nothing more than
bubbles, and Kim Dokja failing to return to their side.

Lee Gilyoung asked. "…What meaning is there in writing a tragedy like
this?"

"There is some."

They might have failed in changing anything, but that didn't mean they had
given up.

That fact alone was enough to console someone. Even if that someone
happened to be themselves.

And so, around the time when another eight months had gone by, Han
Sooyoung managed to write her way past the fourth and fifth part to reach
the epilogue. And as the feelings of liberation and heightened excitement
enveloped her, she began to work on the final part of the manuscript. [The
applicable world-line's system has reached the limits of its senescence.] It
was also then that something no one could have foreseen happened.

[Every system in the applicable world-line is entering the extinction phase.]

"…What?!"

[Stigma, 'Cloud System', has ceased to function.]
Chapter 551: Epilogue 5 - The Eternity and Epilogue (Complete)


…Can't upload the file to the cloud?

Han Sooyoung hurriedly checked her Stigma several times at that sudden
message.

However, it showed no signs of activating. It was as if the system's
blessings had disappeared. And for sure, her body started to feel different
from a little while ago. Her body that felt like it could fly to anywhere was
now getting gradually heavier and heavier.

…Could it be? No, hang on a second.

She figured that a day like this would come eventually, but it happened far
quicker than she bargained for.

[The 'Bureau's Story' in your possession has stopped its storytelling.]

Han Sooyoung hadn't even written the novel's final episode yet, either.
Besides, if the Cloud System was no more, even if she did finish writing the
manuscript, transmitting it would still be impossible.

"Goddammit…"

Right then, someone hurriedly shoved open the hospital room's door and
rushed inside.

"Han Sooyoung!"

It seemed that her companions had also realized the severity of the
situation.




"There's no way whatsoever? Seriously?"

"…For the time being, yes."

Devices that operated through magical energy were grinding to a halt one
by one. Thanks to that, Lee Seolhwa's hospital was urgently swapping out
the power source for the various medical equipment at the moment.

"What about Kim Dokja's condition?"

"Thankfully, there don't seem to be any complications so far."

Although the power of the system had vanished, the sleeping Kim Dokja
was still the same. A boy quietly slumbering away, neither alive nor dead.
And this very boy's other reincarnated souls living in various parts of the
world-lines should be reading the manuscript she had written.

"I couldn't update the last bit of the manuscript. At this rate…" Han
Sooyoung muttered out.
"The 'Oldest Dreams' might not get to read the last part of the story, then."
Yoo Sangah's observation caused Lee Jihye and Jang Hayoung to cry out
one after the other.

"What will happen now? Wasn't the last part of the manuscript the most
important bit?"

"What about my side story?!"

"That's not really important, is it?"

They didn't know how many world-lines Yoo Joonghyuk had paid
pilgrimage to so far, but still, quite a large number of worlds should've seen
the publication of the novel to the latest chapter by now.

"Argh, the one thing I hate so much in this world is a novel that gets
dropped in the middle…"

The final part of the novel, its epilogue, was all about the 'thing that hasn't
happened yet' to the 'Oldest Dream'.

Quite obviously, there was simply no way that all of them could perfectly
imagine a story that hadn't happened yet.

"What should we do? You said that the last episode is the most crucial
one."

"We still have one more method." Han Sooyoung chewing on her fingers
looked up to the heavens and spoke. "There is one more person who can fix
the manuscript beside me. And we don't have a choice but to believe in
him."




"…The manuscript stopped updating."
The manuscript was updated roughly once a day without fail. But for the
last month or so, the updates had completely stopped coming. At first, he
thought this was an error arising from him travelling between the world-
lines far too frequently, but when he took a closer look, even the log-in
history itself was gone.

[Captain, I think something has gone wrong somewhere.]

He had two theories. One, Han Sooyoung found herself in a situation where
she couldn't write the manuscript anymore, or two, Earth's system had
finally ground to a halt.

Whatever the case might be, this was not a good situation.

[Files are being automatically transmitted to the connected world-lines.]

The manuscript's latest chapter had been transmitted to other world-lines
already. In the world where the serialisation started first, the notice for
postponement had been issued already – what happened was that the author
panicked when he suddenly couldn't think of the story and hastily
announced the postponement.

The situation was not good. At this rate, authors losing their composure
might start cooking up their own take on the part Han Sooyoung had failed
to write and upload.

[…Captain, there isn't much time.]

Yoo Joonghyuk looked down at both of his hands. He then slowly clenched
his fists before unfurling them.

It wasn't as if there were no other options available. If Han Sooyoung was
not in a situation to finish the manuscript, then… The person who could,
had to complete it.

[Attribute's effect has been activated!]

[You can now edit the manuscript in the Cloud System.]
[A lot of Probability is required for the editing of the manuscript.]

Yoo Joonghyuk slowly closed his eyes, before opening them again.




Two months passed by after the system had entered the dissolution
sequence.

The system that started crumbling away didn't show any signs of mending
itself. The number of people who could hear the messages gradually
decreased. Also, skills and Stigmata started disappearing one by one. Even
the voices of the Stories couldn't be heard anymore.

– An airliner operating on magic energy engines has crashed in the East
Sea…

Artefacts from the bygone world that hadn't been replaced yet began
causing problems as well.

"Argh, that's why I told them to replace all of that stuff!"

Jung Heewon watching the news on the screen finally blew her top.

Han Sooyoung asked her. "Who went over there?"

"Jihye and the kids. Although pretty weak, they can still activate their
Stigmata, so…"

The two of them watched the live broadcast of the rescue attempt. The
screen now displayed the figures of Lee Jihye, Lee Gilyoung, and Shin
Yoosung – as well as their turtle ship and Chimera Dragon, both of which
were a lot smaller than before.

"The waves are too strong."
Survivors were continuously extracted and rescued one at a time, but the
incoming waves were getting rougher by the second as well. The Chimera
Dragon and the turtle ship tottered precariously. The rescue operation
continued on despite the rough, inclement weather, but the situation didn't
seem optimistic at the moment.

Han Sooyoung, unable to look on anymore, stood up from her seat. "Call
Yoo Sangah right now and get a helicopter ready. It's gonna be impossible
for those three alone."

"I already did, but due to the storm…"

Han Sooyoung quietly spat out, "Dammit," and began packing her stuff.

– Breaking news, just in. An unidentified flying object has broken into the
East Sea's atmosphere and entered the…

Inside the screen, they could now see an object flying in through the
pitchblack storm clouds. Accompanied by a massive explosion noise, a
distant spot in the ocean was enveloped in bright light. Drones broke past
the winds and waves to fly there, and continued to transmit real-time
footage from the nearby ocean.

Soon, the exterior of the flying object was revealed among the pulsating
grey foams. It was a capsule-shaped ark, and someone was standing up
from within it.

"…Yoo Joonghyuk??"




After confirming the news, Han Sooyoung and the rest of the companions
all rushed to the East Sea.

– All of the injured survivors have been safely rescued with help from
thealien being…
– The alien in question has been identified as the terror suspect who had
leftEarth two years ago…

Breaking news continued to inundate the airwaves.

How long did they wait by the docks? Finally, the rescue ships approaching
the port could be seen in the distance – Lee Jihye's turtle ship occupying the
central position in the formation. She and the kids were waving their hands.

And right behind them was a man looking at the dock and at his
companions.

"You…!"

It was an unfamiliar sight. Although his face hadn't changed a lot, his
dishevelled hair sported several grey spots now.

"Been a while," said Yoo Joonghyuk.

Han Sooyoung paused, not knowing what to say – before shooting back
reflexively at him. "What about the mission? Why have you come back so
soon?"

She knew full well she shouldn't have said that. The length of time Yoo
Joonghyuk must've endured should not be simplified with such words.

Yoo Joonghyuk replied. "I had no choice but to return."

"Oppa!"

Yoo Mia ran in from behind the group and jumped into his embrace. He
gently held her as she sobbed nonstop.

Han Sooyoung quietly observed the scene before asking him. "Who's the
girl you brought with you?"
That prompted the girl behind Yoo Joonghyuk to peek her head out and say
something. "Seriously, you too…? No one recognises me." The girl grandly
sighed out and muttered as if she was tired of doing this. "Bah-aht."



Yoo Sangah personally went to fetch the companions with her limousine.
During the transit, as Lee Seolhwa performed the medical check-up on him,
Yoo Joonghyuk began recounting all the events that had happened to him.

From the moment of leaving Earth, lost and drifting between the world-
lines, receiving help from the Outer Gods, meeting Biyoo in the Dark
Stratum, and to eventually completing his trip around the world-lines.

"…You had no choice but to return because you ran out of Story energy?"

"That's right."

It seemed that the dissolution of the system had affected Yoo Joonghyuk in
outer space, as well. In other words, this was the worst possible situation
that could happen.

"Just how long were you out there in space?"

"Are you curious?"

A faint smile-like expression floated up on Yoo Joonghyuk's lips before
vanishing completely. As that was a rather un-Yoo Joonghyuk-like
behaviour, Han Sooyoung ended up frowning deeply.

"…You actually smiled?"

"Rest easy. I've already visited all the world-lines that I could have gone to.
With Biyoo's help, a link that updates in real-time has been established, so
the authors of those world-lines should be uploading the novel in the correct
sequence."
The companions eavesdropping all breathed a sigh of relief at Yoo
Joonghyuk's words.

However, one important point still remained.

"Did you transmit everything? What about the last part of the manuscript?
What did you do with the final episode?" Han Sooyoung asked.

"Are you talking about the part you didn't send to me?"

"That's right! The last part of the manuscript that you could have fixed!"
Han Sooyoung finally exploded in impatient anger. "You also have a
writer's attribute, right? If you've been reading my novel from the start, you
should at least be able to guess how the conclusion is supposed to unfold,
right? Huh? So, did you write it? You did write it instead of me, right??"

Yoo Joonghyuk wordlessly stared at Han Sooyoung. How long passed by
like this? He quietly shifted his gaze outside the window.

Han Sooyoung's voice began trembling. "You… You couldn't have…"

"Do you believe that I should've written it?"

"What dogshit are you talking about, you bastard?! Obviously you…!"

"Do you believe that it's reasonable to write our wish that didn't come true
as the novel's conclusion?" He looked at Han Sooyoung's expression
hardening up in an instant and continued on. "Han Sooyoung. No matter
how hard we try, this story is different from the lives we had lived."

"…You, you think I don't know that…"

Indeed, she also knew. Rather, she knew it better than anyone out there.

She kept feeling this sense of separation with every sentence being written.
No matter how precise the words she wrote were, no matter how
painstakingly considered each expression she came up with was – it was
still impossible to fully capture the history they remembered and to fully
reproduce Kim Dokja who used to live in this world within the story's
pages.

"It's not as if I didn't give it a shot. I utilised the Story that I still
remembered and tried to write the final episode, just like how you did.
However…"

In order to recreate Kim Dokja, the Stories of the companions had gathered.
One piece, two pieces… The sentences they remembered were piled up to
become the imaginary 'Kim Dokja'.

⸢…You wish to hear what my boy was like when he was young?⸥

⸢The 'Dokja' ahjussi that I remember was…⸥

⸢I'm telling you, hyung really did that! For real!⸥

One percent of Kim Dokja, then two percent…

Many people still remembered him, and Kim Dokja as gathered in that
manner could potentially have ended up as the 99 percent.

"Even if Kim Dokja came back to us alive through the story we have
crafted, do you truly believe that he will be the real Kim Dokja?"

That remaining one percent of Kim Dokja they couldn't remember.

That Kim Dokja none of them could remember, where would he be left
behind in this universe, then?

"Even before his soul scattered, Kim Dokja was the 'Oldest Dream'. Haven't
you ever thought about how strange it was? Why didn't that fool ever dream
of his own happiness?"

Han Sooyoung shot back in near hysteria. "…Even if he is the 'Oldest
Dream', you can't just imagine a world the way you want. Most of the
dreaming itself is done subconsciously!!"
"In that case, Kim Dokja's subconsciousness must've thought that this
conclusion is the right one."

An existence who had never imagined his own happiness. The 'Kim Dokja'
they knew was such a person.

"I also know that! I knew that Kim Dokja was such a person… Why do you
think I started writing this story in the first place? Why, why I have…"

Drops of something wet were falling onto the backs of her feet. She wanted
to say something, anything. To shout out, to grab hold onto Yoo
Joonghyuk's neck and choke him, shake him around. However, she
couldn't.

A voice mixed with indescribable fatigue entered her ears.

"In order to save someone…"

Han Sooyoung raised her head at Yoo Joonghyuk's voice fleeting past.

"Because of your story, I was able to survive until now."

She glared at him with her reddened, tearful eyes. "That's not something I
wanted to hear from a bastard like you."

The distant view of the Industrial Complex could be seen.

That was their home. A place where every member of <Kim Dokja's
Company> used to live. A place created by someone's seemingly
impossible dream.

Everyone now looked at it.

Yoo Sangah holding the steering wheel spoke. "…So, that's what happened.
Thank you for telling us the story, Joonghyuk-ssi."
No one was crying. No one criticised Yoo Joonghyuk for his choice. This
wasn't because their sorrow had been watered down. No, perhaps they had
grown that much stronger.

It wasn't just Yoo Joonghyuk alone.

The companions regained enough strength to carry on with their remaining
time by writing the story, then reading what had been written all the while
praying for a certain someone to read this story with them. The courage not
to crumble even when the miracle they dreamed about evaporated right
before their eyes.

Now, they could carry on knowing that some people were reading their
story in the distant, far-flung other side of the universe.

Lee Jihye asked. "…By the way, that novel? Was it popular?"

"It wasn't bad."

"You think Dokja ahjussis were enjoying it?"

"Hey, you sooty bastard! Have you seen the reincarnated Dokja-hyung?
How was he?"

As if they wanted to ask about everything they were dying to know until
now, questions from the companions bombarded Yoo Joonghyuk next.

He calmly replied. "I haven't seen any reincarnated Kim Dokja.
However…" He looked at Kim Dokja's statue brushing past the vehicle's
window and continued on. "…That fool definitely has read the story. I have
a hunch."

"Dokja ahjussi must be really irritated about now. Not being able to see the
conclusion again…"

How would the Kim Dokjas of other world-lines remember this story's
conclusion? Han Sooyoung had no way of knowing. Coming up with a
good conclusion was as difficult as making your ex accept the reason why
you were breaking up with them.

"…Wait, Dokja-ssis from other world-lines aren't going to invade this
place, are they?"

That question prompted someone to whisper softly.

"That might be nice."

At the end of those words, deep silence descended on the companions. With
great timing, Yoo Sangah turned on the music right then. Notes from the
instruments cascaded like falling raindrops. No one tried to look at each
other's faces. That was the only courtesy they could exercise, at least for
this moment.

Within this weighty tenderness of the moment, Han Sooyoung's thoughts
drifted towards her novel still stored inside her notebook PC.

The story without the last chapter.

And now, no one would get to read about this novel's conclusion.

But perhaps, this world sometimes needed a story like that, she mused.

"How about we… start living in one house again?"

Everyone raised their heads at someone's suggestion.

A realization was gradually dawning on Han Sooyoung.

⸢This was the story that Kim Dokja had given to them.⸥

The companions had regained their daily lives, and Yoo Joonghyuk came
home, too.

This was the end of <Kim Dokja's Company>'s adventures. The conclusion
that the person they all loved wished to see had finally been completed.
Han Sooyoung abruptly shifted her gaze over to Yoo Joonghyuk. "…Okay,
so. Did you get to find out what your ■■ was?"

"Not yet. However, at this point, I think it no longer matters whether I get
to learn it or…"

It was right at that moment a strange sensation suddenly assaulted him.

The sounds of 'Tsu-chuchuchut' could be heard coming from somewhere.

⸢…⸥

A noise wavered within their ears like a faint, distant song. The moment
Yoo Sangah turned the music off, Biyoo's appearance as she sat in the front
passenger seat suddenly changed.

[…Bah-aht??]

Biyoo had morphed back into the figure of a large furball. But that couldn't
be possible. Before climbing into the car, she clearly said that the
dissolution of the system had paralysed her ability to shapeshift.

"Uh??"

The voices coming from the empty air grew clearer and clearer. This was
definitely sounds of Stories busy telling their stories.

"…What's going on? The system should still be broken, though?"

Han Sooyoung stared at Yoo Joonghyuk, but he was looking back at her
with the exact same eyes as hers.

[Story, 'King of a Kingless World', has begun its storytelling once more.]

Groups of blinding letters were streaming past in the skies outside the
vehicle's windows. They were from a Story the companions knew
intimately. "Yoo Sangah!!"
Yoo Sangah hurriedly stepped on the accelerator. Meanwhile, Han
Sooyoung answered her phone loudly ringing inside her pocket. The call
was from Aileen.

– Sooyoung-ssi!! Right now, it…!

Her voice couldn't be heard properly because of all the noises coming from
the surroundings.

[Story, 'Predictive Plagiarism', has begun its storytelling once more.]

Stories that had vanished without a trace along with the system's dissolution
were now streaming towards somewhere while following after one another.
Every single one of them were stories that had come to an end a long time
ago.

⸢Is the story really over when the author stops writing it?⸥

Han Sooyoung looked up at the letters floating around in the skies.

The letters that didn't hold any meaning when existing independently of
each other were beginning to find their mates and groups one by one.
"…Disconnected film theory?!"

The companions soon drove into the Complex and hurriedly jumped out of
the limousine. Then, they began running. The Stories they had acquired
until now, the Stories they had been telling until now, were brushing past
their sides.

No one knew what the conclusion to this story was.

No matter how hard they tried, 'Kim Dokja' would never come back. Even
if they did recreate the '99% Kim Dokja', that missing one percent would
always be there.

But then, what if there was one existence in this entire world that could fill
the last void of one percent? One existence, who used to possess the letters
subconsciously scattered to the distant universe?
"Sooyoung-ssi! Over there!"

They could see Lee Seolhwa's hospital in the distance. Stories leisurely
streaming there guided them. Stories were gathering towards the hospital
ward they were all intimately familiar with.

[Giant Story, 'Demon Realm's Spring', has begun its storytelling once

more.] Han Sooyoung thought to herself.

If an author didn't write it, then a story's conclusion couldn't be created.

[Giant Story, 'Torch that Swallowed the Myth', has begun its storytelling
once more.]

Even if that was true, however, did that mean those reading the story
couldn't imagine the conclusion on their own way? Han Sooyoung
powerfully bit her lip. This story was created by her own hands. But
another story she didn't know of was continuing on from the end of her
story.

⸢What will happen if the moment of someone's imagination overtaking the
author's sentences, comes?⸥

As skills and Stigma hadn't returned in full yet, Han Sooyoung ran out of
breath rather quickly. Yoo Joonghyuk supported her and kept running. Shin
Yoosung rushing up the stairs tripped and fell. Other companions reached
out and helped her up.

[Giant Story, 'Season of Light and Darkness', has begun its storytelling
once more.]

[Giant Story, 'Liberator of the Forgotten Ones', has begun its storytelling
once more.]
The Giant Stories they had acquired together were returning to them one by
one. Even the unnamed last Story of <Kim Dokja's Company> began
singing about the emotion that no one dared to name.

This desire, a wish, of those who went their separate ways a long time ago
to become one once more.

To grieve for someone else, to celebrate, to get angry, and to despair. And
eventually, wishing to become that someone else.

Someone was sympathising with their story. As her breathing grew heavier
and heavier, Han Sooyoung kept thinking to herself over and over again.

⸢If this story can really save you…⸥

If you regained just a little of your memories and remember us just one
more
time…

"Over there!"

…Then I'll keep writing the epilogue for you until the end of the time, for
eternity.

She reached before the hospital room's door, completely out of breath. Han
Sooyoung was now standing before the very room that she came to visit
every single day for the past four years.

The rest of the companions running up the staircase one step behind were
now looking at her. She looked back, and began recalling the very last
paragraph to the conclusion she didn't get to write.

⸢There are three ways to survive in a ruined world.⸥

She then heard Jung Heewon shouting out.

"Han Sooyoung!"
