499: Ep. 95 - Gaecheon/開天, III


We avoided the <Asgard>'s Constellations and ran in the complicated
network of the passageways.

[Constellation, 'One Who Lost His Arm to the Wolf of Apocalypse', is
sniffing out the scent of blood.]

[The constellation 'God of Harp and Horn's' musical notes are hovering near
your ears.]

[Constellation, 'Progenitor of the Reincarnators', is tracing your soul!]

[Constellation, 'Master of Abydos', declares that you won't get lucky the
second time!]

While some Constellations cheered us on through the channel, there were
others chasing us down through the view from the channel, too. These stars
bared their murderous intentions from beyond the tall walls of their own
worldview the moment our location had been revealed.
There was a reason why we hadn't been caught yet, and that would be
because our group consisted of us four.

"We should not go to the right. I'm getting a bad premonition from there."

We trusted in Anna Croft's hunch and changed our direction. She might be
our enemy, but in times like this, she also happened to be the most reliable
ally, as well.

Forks in the road continued to appear.

[Story, 'Predictive Plagiarism', has begun its storytelling!]

"Odds of death going to the right, 92%. 44% to the left. Keep going
forward!"

Han Sooyoung shouted out while reading through countless cliches in her
head.

"What are the odds of survival when going forward?"

"I don't know!"

She shot me a glare and ran in front of us.

"Coming from above."

This hunch was coming from none other than the protagonist himself. Yoo
Joonghyuk continuously fired off [Breaking the Sky Sword Aura];
Constellations screamed as they were struck by the pre-emptive attacks and
collapsed on the passage's floor. I thought I could hear intermittent noises
of [Breaking the Sky Swordsmanship] cutting down some things.

"Continue running."

I abruptly realized the reason why the four of us had been gathered like this.

⸢These four were most likely to clear this scenario safely.⸥
One of us was a prophet, the other one was a writer, and another one was a
regressor. As for the last person…

"Stop here."

My words caused the companions to stop immediately. All three of them
were looking at me; I glanced back at them and slowly approached the
cabin before us.

Anna Croft grabbed my shoulder. "…You aren't planning to enter this
cabin, I hope."

Yoo Joonghyuk didn't say anything.

I looked back at my companions and addressed them. "Passing through here
is the only way."

"Can't you see what's written on the door of that cabin??"

No, I could see it very well. And at the same time, I could also very well
sense the enormous Statuses of the Constellations right behind us, too.

<Olympus>.

⸢In order to reach the location I want, we must cross <Olympus>'s
worldview.⸥
According to the Story left behind by Bihyung, we had no choice in the
matter. It was rather obvious that Zeus, having tasted humiliation outside,
would never let us pass.

"Odin behind, and Zeus in front," said Yoo Joonghyuk as he stepped
forward. "If we break through here, we'll have a method to fight against
them?"

"Yes, definitely."

We sensed Odin's Status right behind us now.
Han Sooyoung shouted out. "Dammit, in that case, hurry up and open it!
Those bastards are almost here!"

We kicked the <Olympus>'s door down and jumped in. Felt as if something
was powerfully sucking us in, and when I regained my wits, we were busy
walking in the skies above <Olympus> itself.

The immense sky castle of <Olympus> could be seen in the distance.

[Nebula, <Olympus>'s Constellations have confirmed the identities of the
intruders!]

The atmosphere grew stifling; thunderclouds gathered in no time at all and
covered up the sky.

[Constellation, 'Throne of Lightning', is exercising his influence on the
entirety of <Olympus>!]

<Olympus>'s king was now waiting for us. As well as the 12 gods guarding
his sides, too.

[Constellation, 'Almighty Sun', is mobilising his chariot!]

[Constellation, 'Atrocious War God', is lifting his sword!]

[Constellation, 'Pure Hunter of the Moonlight', is nocking an arrow!]

Below us on the ocean, we could see the mythical monsters waiting for us,
too.

[Constellation, 'Monster of the Labyrinth', is howling in your direction!]

[Constellation, 'Fairy that Sings About Death', is singing about your death!]

Everything in this worldview was our enemy.

Ku-rurururu!

"Move!!"
My [Way of the Wind] and Yoo Joonghyuk's [Air Walk] activated
simultaneously.

Anna Croft's [Way of the Storm Winds] and Han Sooyoung's [Dark Clouds
Big Dipper] followed us right afterwards. We crossed the sky with the
fastest speed we could bring out.

Meanwhile, the thunderclouds took on an even more ominous vibe.

[Demon King of Salvation!!]

The 12 gods stuck very close to our rear.

Ares's greatsword sliced the air and descended upon us. I swung my
Unbroken Faith and blocked the attack just in time. Along with the noise of
'Kwa-du-duk!', it felt as if every joint in my body was collapsing; it was like
being crushed by a tank, actually. This was the true might of the 12 gods
now carrying their own worldview on their backs.

I unleashed Status from my entire body and spoke in true voice. [Do not
take us lightly, Ares.]

[Giant Story, 'Torch that Swallowed the Myth', is screeching out!]

I wasn't sure about anyone else, but at the least, I'd not lose to Ares.
Because I already possessed a Story of winning against him.

[Story, 'One Who Defeated the God of War', has begun its storytelling!]

Unfortunately, our situation had already run into serious problems.

The 'Pure Hunter of Moonlight' Artemis was pouncing on Han Sooyoung
wrapped in [Black Flame], while Yoo Joonghyuk flying in the air was
already engaged in an intense battle against 'Spokesperson of Justice and
Wisdom' Athena.

Anna Croft, situated at the lowest place among us, was beset by
<Olympus>'s lower-ranked Constellations.
[I used to cheer you on, Kim Dokja.]

A voice came from behind me.

That was from the fastest Constellation in this sky. The motifs of wings
could be seen on his shoes.

[Unfortunately, you shouldn't have come here.]

It was the 'Master of Skywalk', Hermes.

He looked at me with a genuinely rueful expression and spoke. [My father,
he's been truly angered.]

And then, the thunderclouds glowing brightly until then finally exploded;
everything seemed to enter slow motion. It felt like the view of the sky was
melting down slowly.

The lightning seemed to blanket the entire world. None living within this
worldview would be able to dodge Zeus's wrath.

Han Sooyoung was looking in this direction, shouting something. I silently
mouthed the following to her.

'It's alright'.

I slowly sucked my breath in and focused my mind. Ares was smiling
triumphantly as if the battle had been decided already. I ignored him and
raised my sword up high like a lightning rod.

KWA-BOOM!!

The thunderclap of the sky gathered towards me. This Status threatened
burst all of my Story veins in one go. However, I endured it. More
specifically, the darkness wavering about near the tip of my hand was
sucking in Zeus's thunderbolt.

An indescribable scream exploded out from my mouth.
[Giant Story, 'Torch that Swallowed the Myth', is growling!]

My vision was dyed in red, and Story began flooding out from my mouth.

Pah-chuchuchuchu…!

Zeus then unleashed an even greater amount of Status.

I couldn't endure anymore. My powerless body began falling from the air.

⸢And now, it's done.⸥

[This is the end, Demon King of Salvation. Even if it's you, in our
'worldview', you are-!]

My helplessly falling body after being struck by the thunderbolt suddenly
stopped in the air. The Unbroken Faith almost slipping out of my grasp was
gaining some strength. Next up, Ares's frozen-stiff expression could be
seen. The expression of the God of War, who'd never submit to fear, was
filled with emotions of terror.

⸢Someone was holding Kim Dokja's sword together with him.⸥

It was a very large and sturdy hand. A true voice akin to the noble night
being carved rang out vividly.

[Why do you think this worldview is yours alone?]

The gentle yet deep darkness embraced my falling body.

[How boundlessly arrogant you are, Ares.]

The night swallowing up the thunderbolt began spreading in the heavens.

[Constellation, 'Father of the Rich Night', is incarnating into the 'Final
Ark'!]
[Constellation, 'Queen of the Darkest Spring', is incarnating into the 'Final
Ark'!]

Indeed, <Olympus>'s myths weren't Zeus's alone. The reason why their
shining daylight could become 'myths' in the first place was because the
night existed to call them the day.

['Underworld' is manifesting onto the ground above!]

A world sleeping in the deepest part of the underground was now waking
up.

[Hades…!]

The King of Underworld set me down on the ground and spoke calmly
towards the sky. [It's time to settle this, my ancient brothers.]

Hades's scythe raised up to the sky screeched out, causing the darkness of
the underground to pour out towards the heavens like the waterfall flowing
in reverse.

It was the Underworld's army. When the Judges issued the order to
advance, the guardian of <Tartarus>'s underbelly, Cerberus, roared out
viciously. [You lowly creatures from the underground dare to-!]
Heroes of this worldview crossed their swords. More heroes aboard the
Argos entered the battlefield next.

The great army belonging to Zeus and the 12 gods was truly immense.
Judge Aeacus collided against Hephaistus, while Cerberus and Minotaur
began ripping into each other.

Soldiers from the forest symbolising Artemis rushed in. The 'Wise
Astrologer' Chiron's hooves trampled on the Underworld's army.

[No matter how deep your night is-!]

It was then, Chiron's head flew off into the sky.
Monsters crawling out from the underground used their huge fingers to rip
off his head and began chewing on it.

[Ze-u-s-!!]

Voices of unfathomable sorrow and resentment resounded out. I knew their
owners pretty well.

⸢And so, <Olympus>'s final <Gigantomachia> began in this fashion.⸥

The titans, Gigantes; every single titan, having spent all those sorrowful
years huddled underground, started revealing their figures under
<Olympus>'s night.

Not only that, monsters boasting physiques several times larger than these
Gigantes rose up as well. They were beings that I ran into some time ago
back in the <Underworld>'s prison.

[All titans of purgatory are looking up at <Olympus>'s sky.]

The three brothers of Hecatoncheires – the hundred-hander titan Briareus
that fought alongside me back in the <Gigantomachia> spoke to me.

[We have finally come this far, child.]

One of Briareus's hands lightly brushed past my head.

[This battlefield is for you.]

The titans challenging the heaven's authority stood up while stepping on the
night. Their roars shook the skies of <Olympus>, their Statuses mighty
enough to threaten Zeus's throne.

And in the center of this battlefield, Zeus was fighting fiercely against
Hades. The collision of these two Myth-grade Constellations caused the
pitch-black night and day to intermingle, and the world's time and space
collapsed.
Persephone commanding the Underworld's army addressed me directly.

[Now, go. Do not ever look back. Go, and witness the end you wish to see.]
I nodded and raised my tottering body up. I swallowed the [Life and Death
Pill] Lee Seolhwa gave me, and all of my fried nerves began recovering bit
by bit. I unsteadily walked forward in the battlefield where flesh got torn
apart and blood was raining down.

Han Sooyoung and Yoo Joonghyuk, plus Anna Croft, stood there waiting
for me, having broken past this scene of pure pandemonium earlier.

Han Sooyoung ran up to me and supported my figure. I looked behind and
saw the corpses of heroes, their eyes still wide open; the stars that fell from
the skies; Stories that would not be told anymore, were now looking at me
with resentful eyes.

⸢This was the path I had chosen.⸥

I knew this would happen from the beginning. It was obvious that the
Underworld would make their move if I came here.

For the sake of ■■ that I desired, I used all of their Stories.

[Giant Story, 'Torch that Swallowed the Myth', is crying out!]

We could see the exit of <Olympus> in the distance. That was where we
had to go. However, there was a Constellation blocking our path.

I had to ask him why. "Dionysus, are you going to stop us?"

The 'God of Wine and Ecstasy', Dionysus leading his congregation was
looking straight back at me. He must've downed several bottles of booze
already, because his cheeks were quite obviously flushed red.

He stared at me with drunken, unfocused eyes, before opening his mouth
while gripping the wine bottle. [All of you, step aside.]
The words of the master prompted the Bacchus's fanatic believers to make
way. And we walked on that path. The Siren's song and Orpheus's musical
performance could be heard wafting in from somewhere. Also, I heard the
sound of someone I knew dying among them, too.

⸢Kim Dokja didn't look back.⸥

My view shook as if I was intoxicated, too.

Yet, we walked and walked some more. Eventually, we reached
<Olympus>'s exit.

Dionysus was right behind us. If I look back, I should be able to see his
expression filled with sorrow. He was a Constellation who really liked our
story.

[Kim Dokja. My <Olympus> has no place in the conclusion you're heading
to, right?]

I couldn't reply.

⸢"That's because I like your story."⸥

The one who had been watching my Story for a very long time, and rescued
me many, many times in the past.

⸢"Several Constellations including me believe that you're the one capable of
reaching ■■."⸥
I was about to look back, but Dionysus spoke to me first.

[It's been fun, oh the great, noble star.]

I heard the sound of a world closing behind me.

My feet didn't want to move. I stood there for a long time without saying
anything, and eventually, someone addressed me.
"It's not over yet."

We began walking towards the darkness of the ark.

Our destination was right before us.
               Chapter 500: Ep. 95 - Gaecheon/開天, IV


After exiting from <Olympus>, we remained silent for a long while. We
either ran or walked; we ran, and then ran some more. Only the hollow
screams could be heard in the starless emptiness.

Would those screams be recorded as Stories, too? And would someone else
listen to them later? Just how many more Stories need to repeat themselves
before this world came to an end?

"Kim Dokja."

"I know."

The voice coming from Han Sooyoung still supporting me helped me to get
a grip on myself.

Eventually, the doorway to the cabin I was searching for could be seen in
the distance. Even this far, the door looked much smaller and shabbier
compared to other cabin's.
The corridor we went past earlier was getting noisier. Constellations from
different factions were colliding and making those noises. I didn't hesitate
and pushed the door open.

[You have entered 'Prop Storage'.]

"What's this? What's this shabby…"

Han Sooyoung's utterances came to an immediate stop after she clapped her
eyes on the room's interior.

The room so big that eyes couldn't see the end of, white sheets covering
many places within it; if one were to designate this place as the 'prop
storage', then it'd surely be biggest in the known universe.

⸢The cabin where 'scenario's everything' had been gathered.⸥

Bihyung's Story could be heard next. ⸢All the props that had been used in
various scenarios are displayed there. From consumable items to the
scenario's main rewards, and even Star Relics from the Nebulas that lost
their power.⸥

The 'mucus of the Hammer Seahorse' and the 'thorn of the Stonehawk' I
used to hunt the water dragon were also in here.

Back then, I thought I was really going to die, but… Seeing them like this
made me reminisce about my past.

"Not bad. Some of them are still fairly useful."

Yoo Joonghyuk had strode over to the props even before I had noticed it
and began exchanging his equipment. He sprayed the Story metal coating
on his [Black Heavenly Demon Sword]'s blade, swapped out his coat with a
new one, and even chucked away his ancient combat boots for a new pair
before picking up several Star Relics.
Seeing how his eyes were sparkling so dangerously like that, he must be
feeling very pleased with himself right now.

"Wha? 'Still fairly useful'?? I haven't even seen some of these before! Let's
quickly grab some and bounce."

Han Sooyoung too had dived into the piles of items by then, and hurriedly
picked the stuff she could use. Even Anna Croft, lucky enough to be
supported by a wealthy Nebula until recently, bent down and carefully went
through the items on display.

Like a group of unremarkable Incarnations that stumbled onto the scenario's
hidden piece, we sought out items, exchanged our equipment, and shared
happy grins with one another.

⸢They all knew, however. If they didn't do this, they wouldn't be able to
endure this moment.⸥
Yet another noise of explosions rang outside the room.

It sounded much closer than before.

"…So, what's in the next room, then?"

Was it because of fatigue? Han Sooyoung had stopped [Predictive
Plagiarism]'s story for now. Our gazes met and for a moment there, she
raised the corner of her brow slightly.

⸢"You think writers enjoy writing stories all the time?"⸥

I could understand the meaning behind her grin now.

Even if the world was destroyed, even if the scenario barrelled towards
tragedy, she'd remain as a writer, always. And that was why it was so much
more painful for her. All those different pains yet to be described must still
be inside her head even now.
⸢And that was why only him, the 'reader', could make this choice.⸥

"No, we'll make our stand right here."

⸢A choice that only the one filled with greed and obstinacy to see the
desired ending could make.⸥
Han Sooyoung erupted in anger. "We weren't going to destroy the core??"

"If we are to reach the core, we need to go through other worldviews of
large Nebulas."

"Can't we just go around or something?! Like, if we exit through that door-

!" Han Sooyoung pointed to a plain door visible in the corner of the room.

"That door will take us to <Emperor>."

"What about that one…"

"That door is connected to <Vedas>."

"Son of a…"

Han Sooyoung freaked out, and as she distanced herself from the door, she
made sure to place the locks on them.

The explosion noise rang out once more. Heavy vibrations resounded out,
and someone began pounding on the cabin's door. Along with the sounds of
some things exploding, the cabin's walls shook about violently.

"…They are right before us, it seems," said Anna Croft.

Han Sooyoung scowled deeply and began massaging her forehead.

[Story, 'Predictive Plagiarism', has resumed its storytelling!]

In the end, she had to reactivate her Story. Plot developments she didn't
want to predict were probably being drawn inside her head.
Both Anna Croft possessing [Precognition], and Yoo Joonghyuk and his
ability to read the patterns after living through countless regressions, began
getting ready to fight as well.

"We need to fight in this place. This is the only room where we have any
hope of victory."

Every cabin within the 'Final Ark' contained the recreation of large Nebula's
worldview.

⸢However, there was one location in this ark where no worldview had been
recreated.⸥
And that was none other than this 'Prop storage', where items to be used in
various scenarios were stored away.

[Applicable cabin isn't under the influence of any worldview.]

That was the reason why I chose this room as our battleground.

"They are here."

The moment Yoo Joonghyuk unsheathed the [Black Heavenly Demon
Sword], the doors in all four sides burst open simultaneously.
Constellations began flooding in through the doorways next.

[Constellation, 'Master of December 25th', is incarnating into the ark!]

[Constellation, 'One Responsible for the Universe's Rotation', is joining
the battleground along with its servants!] <Vedas>.

[Constellation, 'Master of Abydos', is incarnating in rage!]

[Constellation, 'Official in Charge of Earthquakes and Volcanoes', is
waking up from its ancient slumber!]

[Constellation, 'Ruler of Inhalation and Exhalation', is waking up its
Stories!]
<Papyrus>.

[Constellation, 'One-eyed Father', is fixing his grip on his spear.]

[Constellation, 'One Who Lost His Arm to the Wolf of Apocalypse',
has discovered you!] <Asgard>.

[Constellation, 'Great Mother God Who Created Man Out of Earth', is
incarnating into the ark!]

[Constellation, 'Daeracheonjon', is incarnating into the ark!]

[Constellation, 'Emperor of Heavens', is sitting on his throne!]

[Constellation, 'Master of the Three-Pointed Double-Edged Spear', is
taking out all of his divine weapons!] …And even <Emperor>, too.

The moment all the doors of the storage broke down, Stories within the
space collided and expanded. The 'Giant Stories' from differing worldviews
were letting their voices heard loud and clear.

Han Sooyoung chuckled. "Everyone who hates us has gathered in one
spot."

[Over there!]

Just as someone shouted that out, we quickly retreated to the back; along
with a loud explosion, jet-black ash danced in the spot we'd been standing
on a moment ago.

['Giant Stories' have discovered a new cabin!]

[Portion of Stories have begun transplanting their worldviews to the new
cabin!]

We didn't have much time here.

Kwa-boooom!!
Explosions rang out as we unsheathed our individual weapons. I too had
already kitted myself out from head to toe in all sorts of props from various
scenarios.

With our backs pressed against each other, we faced the four cardinal
directions and unleashed our Statuses towards the incoming Constellations.

Han Sooyoung fired out [Black Flame] and flung herself forward. "All of
you, just die!!"

A pitch-black sphere she threw flew in the air and landed amidst the
Constellations. I wondered what that was, only for a stonking flame wave to
explode out from the item.

[Kuwaaaaaah!!]

I instantly recognised what that was. That was the 95th scenario's reward
item called [Nightmare Flame Wave] from the 241st regression turn. It was
a horrifying Story weapon containing flames dragged out from <Eden>'s
hell that unleashed perpetual flames in the area of effect for the next ten or
so years.

[Measly flames from a destroyed Nebula dares to…!]

Along with 'Fuuu-!' noise, Nuwa's soil created a path in the middle of the
conflagration. The <Emperor>'s Constellations ran on that road and
pounced on us. Some of them happened to be the same lot that fought
against us back during the Journey to the West.

Han Sooyoung noisily gritted her teeth. "They managed to show up here,
yet why haven't you come yet, Black Flame Dragon!"

[Constellation, 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon', shouts out that you must
wait for a little bit longer!]

The number of Constellations entering through the doors easily surpassed a
couple of hundreds – three hundred, four, five… every Constellation found
in the worldviews were now streaming into this huge room.
And as their numbers continued to grow, the effects of the ⸢Stage
Transformation⸥ grew stronger in the middle of them. The once-colourless
floor morphed into the desolate desert and a massive pyramid suddenly rose
up from there.

The 'Master of Abydos', Osiris spoke up. [I was wondering who managed to
wake me up, but this…]

Right afterwards, clouds gathered in the sky above and the panoramic view
of the heavenly worlds spread out.

The 'Great Mother God Who Created Man out of Earth' Nuwa spoke to us
next. [It's not too late, children. I can make spots available for you all.]

[On whose authority?]

I thought I could hear the trumpeting of elephants, only to realize that it was
the 'Master of December 25th' Mithra riding atop the head of a gigantic
turtle speaking up.

[Only punishment fitting for those rejecting the 'celebration day for my
revival' is death.]

Odin sitting on the edge of the Universe Tree's branch stared at me with the
eye capable of seeing through all things in creation.

[Oh you foolish star, did you honestly believe you can fight against us all?]

A loud burst of laughter could be heard; all the stars, their Giant Stories
already secured within this safe 'ark', were laughing at us.

[With a Story that hasn't even reached 'myth' level yet, how dare you…]

The 'Bird that Devours Thunder' tried to throw some third-rate utterances in
our direction, but then, its mouth suddenly emitted 'Puh-shoo-shuk' noise
before being cleanly penetrated from behind.
Yoo Joonghyuk had somehow appeared behind the creature's back and cut
the fool's head off right there and then.

"You talk too much."

[Kill them!]

The battle commenced. We were overwhelmingly outnumbered, but we
aggressively utilised the nearby props to their fullest in our fight. Story
weapons we could rely on were scattered about all over the place.
Especially for the weapon storage for the 60th scenario, which seemed to be
designed solely with Yoo Joonghyuk in mind.

[Companion, 'Life and Death Companions', has begun its storytelling!]

[Companion, 'Hell of Eternity', has begun its storytelling!]

Yoo Joonghyuk's talents displayed earlier during the 'Demon King
Selection' battles were now shining brightly.

He was the 'all-rounder'; he mastered handling every type of weapons out
there while living through 1863 regression turns, and now, he was
massacring Constellations with a great bow.

[Kill him first!]

Historical-grade Constellations were sniped to death by Yoo Joonghyuk's
rapid firing, and the debris falling from the dying stars created protective
walls. We ran between them and continued to fight.

"Dodge to the right!"

Almost at the same time as Anna's warning rang out, a rapid attack from the
Myth-grade Constellation swept by near our heels. Avoiding fatal injuries
after getting struck by such attacks would be quite difficult; the stock of
Lee Seolhwa's [Life and Death Pills] had almost run out by now, so we
weren't able to deal with serious wounds anymore.
Lower-ranked Constellations of Asgard pounced on Anna Croft.

[How dare you betray our Nebula??]

Splat!

The head of the Constellation roaring out exploded, just like that. A lengthy
tongue-like thing flew out from behind Anna Croft and burst open that
Constellation's head.

[Constellation who likes changing gender is smirking.]

The backer that helped her betray the Nebula was now helping us, too.

"Kim Dokja! Holding out any further will be impossible! Yoo Joonghyuk's
reached his limit, too!"

The attentions of the Myth-grade Constellations were focused on Yoo
Joonghyuk; the weapon storage was burning in flames, while he was
swinging a huge hammer around to ward off the Constellations, his whole
body bathed in blood.

⸢Kim Dokja began rummaging through the Prop storage to find something.⸥

"…Found it."

I picked up a test tube located at the very end of the [Star Relic] category.
This was written on the label stuck to the tube: [Shindansu's seed].

I unhesitantly dropped that seed on the floor. It quickly sprouted a new bud
and in a blink of an eye, grew into a tree as tall as me. But it stopped there.

[Giant Story, 'Shindansu', is spreading its roots!]

[Giant Story, 'Shindansu', is perceiving your existence.]
[Giant Story, 'Shindansu', requires a Story for the sake of Gaecheon(開天)!]

The whole prop storage was now up in flames.

Yoo Joonghyuk was holding up pretty well until now; Constellations
looking into his venomous eyes freaked out and yelled at each other.

[This is the 'Prop Storage'! Use items to fight him off!]

The first thing they found was an item we were quite familiar with as well –
the [Absolute Throne]. The core item of the fourth scenario that granted
anyone acquiring it with the Outer God's blessing.

The Historical-grade Constellations discovering the throne rushed towards
it with greed-filled eyes.

I stopped Han Sooyoung from rushing there too. "Let them be."

The Historical-grade Constellations swarmed towards it.

[The throne is mine!]

The moment someone stepped on the [Absolute Throne], I clutched the
[Shindansu]'s leaf. No matter how hard I pondered it, the Story that I could
afford to feed this guy had to be this one.

A portion of Constellations felt something was off and hurriedly shouted at
the [Absolute Throne].

[Wait!! Stop!]

Just as the Status leaking out from the [Absolute Throne] was about to
flood in this direction, something buried deep inside my chest began to
writhe. [Story, 'King of a Kingless World', has begun its storytelling!]

[Giant Story, 'Shindansu', has detected the beginning of a new Story!]
⸢This story began by destroying that throne.⸥

Kwa-kwakwakwakwa!!

The [Shindansu] gobbled up the Story and acquired the explosive amount
of Probability, allowing it to grow larger again.

[A new worldview is taking root in the applicable location!]

⸢Shindansu⸥. The large Nebula <Hongik>'s Giant Story.

I addressed the Constellations. "As you have said, we don't have a 'myth'.
However, we have always been fighting together with a certain 'myth'."
And that Story began telling its story.

⸢No other myths could escape from this story.⸥

The [Shindansu] instantly reached up to the storage's ceiling and massive
explosion noises resounded out next. The ark's ceiling began collapsing.

[Gaecheon(開天) is commencing!]

The heavens started opening up as powerful whirlwinds swirled around.

[Aged stars of an ancient Nebula are waking up from their endless
slumber!]

Accompanied by the blinding rays of light, shadows of tree branches in full
bloom were cast on the torn sky. Stars began appearing on the ends of the
shadows like ripened fruits.

[That throne, it's been a while.]

Seven stars were now dangling on the ends of the branches. Constellations
of the Big Dipper that aided me with destroying the [Absolute Throne] were
there.
Countless Constellations began descending from the sky like shooting stars.

[Constellation, 'Bald General of Justice', is incarnating into the ark!]

[Constellation, 'King Heungmu', is incarnating into the ark!]

[Constellation, 'Slumbering Lady of Fine Brocade', is incarnating into the
ark!]

[Constellation, 'Heaven's Wind God', is incarnating into the ark!]

Only these stars were willing to become our allies in this ark.

A sword crashed down like lightning among the descending Constellations
and the [Absolute Throne] exploded into bits. The Constellation trampling
on the false king above the wrecked throne looked at me and spoke.

[Good work, descendant.]

[Constellation, 'Goryeo's First Sword', is incarnating into the ark!]
            Chapter 501: Ep. 96 - Demon-like Judge of Fire, I


[You have forcefully entered the 'Final Ark'!]

Jung Heewon was greeted by the swarm of Constellations as soon as
finding herself inside the ark.

[You have entered the 'Hot Naraka'!]

She couldn't make heads nor tails of what on earth was going on here.

"…Why did it have to be hell, of all places? Did I commit a lot of sin in my
past life?"

There was no mistaking the fact that the enemies before her eyes were
aiming for her life, though. Jung Heewon discovered the pot-bellied but
emaciated 'starving ghosts' tripping over each other and rushing towards her
like falling mountains, and urgently shouted out.

"Uriel!!"
There was no reply. But Uriel's blessing was still permeating within her. As
white wings grew out from Jung Heewon's back, crimson corona permeated
within her entire frame.

['Hour of Judgement' is activating!]

The moment she swung her sword, the swarm of starving ghosts before
were completely swept away.

[Evil-leaning Constellations have picked up your scent.]

Enemies rushed in without an end. The ones found in this ⸢Hot Naraka⸥
seemed to be parasitic creatures of other worldviews.

Fortunately, she wasn't alone in this place.

"Heewon-ssi!"

Lee Hyunsung hurriedly ran up to her location from somewhere and stood
back-to-back with her.

"I guess you've committed a lot of wrong yourself, Hyunsung-ssi."

[Demon King, 'Ruler of Crimson Fog', is glaring at you!]

[Demon King, 'Monstrous Armed Duke', is revealing its animosity towards
you!]

[Constellation, 'Hell's Parasite', is observing you!]

[Constellation, 'Flame of Muspelheim', is patiently waiting.]

Their magical energy would eventually run out trying to fend off all these
starving ghosts. Not only that, hell's Constellations and Demon Kings were
waiting for an opening to strike, as well.

"Behind you!"
Before they realized it, a swarm of starving ghosts sneaked closer from her
rear and pounced with their large maws wide open. However, a cannon
shell aiming at these creatures flew in from somewhere and blew them
away.

"Heewon eonni!"

It was from Lee Jihye's battleship. Jung Heewon's complexion brightened
as she shouted out.

"Are the kids with you?"

"I think they were dropped somewhere near Sangah and Seolhwa eonni's
vicinity! As for Pildu ahjussi-!"

"We don't have the time to worry about him, too!"

Gyaaaaaaahk!

More and more of hell's denizens appeared. The demon counts they fought
back in the [Dark Castle], and duke-level demons they encountered back in
the [Demon Realm] also began making their appearances, as well.

Every one of them had become a part of this hell, to be used as subjects for
the next scenario.

"An Archangel!!"

"Kill them, and we can also acquire the positions of Demon Kings!"

Lee Jihye's bombardment towards them commenced. All the cannons in the
[Turtle Dragon] spat out flames, causing the hell's terrain to transform and
lava to spew out uncontrollably. Demons struck by the bits and lumps of
lava all melted down, but their numbers didn't seem to decrease at all.

[Applicable worldview is a domain ruled by 'Evil'.]
Individuals thought to be dead were rising back up again a few minutes
later.
The spooked Lee Jihye hurriedly shouted out.

"General-nim!! Where are you?! Why aren't any Constellations showing up
here??"

Unfortunately, no Constellation replied to her calling. Not even
Uriel, Maritime War God, nor the 999th turn's Lee Hyunsung…
They now had to rely only on their own strength to fight.

Tsu-chuchuchuchut!

It was then, sparks began dancing in the air.

[Ba-aaaht!]

A roundish portal opened up and Biyoo popped out from there.

"Biyoo!!"

She used to be no bigger than a soccer ball, but now she had grown so big
that it was difficult to wrap one's arms around her.

⸢All Dokkaebis grow up by eating Stories.⸥

Biyoo yelled out 'Baaaaht!' and curled up as powerful sparks exploded out
from her figure. Those dancing sparks then tore open a wall of the cabin.

Dududududu!

Shells burst out of the automated turrets emerging from the torn-open wall.

"Are you alright!?"

Gong Pildu's 'moving castle' was there. His [Armed Fortress] now boasted a
scale of a complete battle-ready castle after his Stigma had evolved once
more. And on top of this fortress were Yoo Sangah, Lee Seolhwa, as well
as the two kids.

"Eonni! Ahjussi! Come up this way!"

Jung Heewon and Lee Hyunsung grabbed Lee Seolhwa's offered hands and
jumped up towards the top of the fortress.

Meanwhile, Lee Jihye's longsword gleamed dangerously towards the
starving ghosts madly chasing after them by climbing up on the fortress's
walls.

⸢In a world where no light from the stars could illuminate them, the
members of <Kim Dokja's Company> rescued their own by themselves.⸥
"Let's get started."

Through the authority of the [Lotus Pedestal], Yoo Sangah began restricting
the enemies' movements; in the meantime, Lee Jihye and Gong Pildu
continued to fire away.

The [Chimera Dragon] sat on the far edge of the fortress and fired its Breath
at the Constellations approaching from the air. As for the enemies that
managed to break through this pandemonium and climb up successfully,
they were greeted by Jung Heewon's falling sword strikes.

Lee Hyunsung's [Steel Transformation] protected the skins of his
companions, while Lee Seolhwa treated him as he got injured instead of
them.

⸢This combination had been dreamed up by a certain person a long time
ago.⸥
However, there was one boy who didn't appear in the original story.

"Aaaaaaah!"
['Wall that Divides Good and Evil' is exercising its authority!]

[Constellation, 'Ruler of the Deepest Pit' is bringing its own subordinates!]

Tsu-chuchuchu…!


A pitch-black swarm of locusts rushed in and blanketed the skies of hell.
These creatures latched onto the Incarnation Bodies of the demons reviving
from their deaths and began tearing into them.

[Aaaaahk!!!]

Demons cried out in despair as they fell into the eternal cycle of their
regenerating flesh painfully getting ripped apart and devoured repeatedly.

Jung Heewon's eyes shone in the light of hope as she observed the strengths
of the starving ghosts declining gradually. The one-sidedly disadvantageous
battle situation was slowly but surely turning on its head. Although
destroying this 'Hot Naraka' would still be asking for too much, at the least,
buying enough time seemed quite possible.

The only problem right now had to do with the Constellations that hadn't
joined the battle yet.

Tsu-chuchuchu…!

It was then, the stars filling up the skies of this hellish landscape suddenly
began moving towards a certain direction. Constellations pounded on the
interior wall of the 'Hot Naraka' and destroyed it before streaming outside
through there.

Once the lights from the Constellations disappeared, the balance of the
worldview also collapsed as well. The starving ghosts could no longer
recover and sunk back inside the abyss of hell itself.

The companions finally got to take a breather and stared at each other.
"…What just happened?"

Lee Seolhwa asked that question, but no one answered back.

One thing was for sure, though – an event humongous enough to make
those stars lose interest in this place was happening somewhere right now.

Everyone's gaze was fixed on Gong Pildu next. He groaned loudly and
began driving his [Armed Fortress].

"Fine, fine. I got it, so stop egging me on."

<Kim Dokja's Company> too followed after those stars and began moving.
Constellations flooding out from all corners of the 'Final Ark' were flying
towards a certain cabin as if they were being sucked in by a black hole.

⸢This was their first time seeing so many stars move like that.⸥

Even Jung Heewon, Lee Hyunsung, and Yoo Sangah, too… None could
tear their eyes away from this overwhelming spectacle of every star in the
sky raining down. It was at once beautiful, and rather chill-inducing, too.

⸢And also, sorrowful.⸥

By the time they abruptly woke up, they realized that all these stars were
swirling around a single star in the center. The sight of the room could be
seen through the large crack in the wall.

The [Shindansu] had broken past the heavens. And with that tree as their
center, Kim Dokja's stars were engaged in a bitter struggle.

[Stop them!! This is our Hwangsanbeol!!!!]

They were the Korean Peninsula's Constellations.

Kim Yoo-Shin, having lost his arm, was shouting out, and Gyebaek was
swinging his greatsword towards the Constellations.
The Bald General of Justice exterminated the enemies with his club, while
Seo Ae Il Pil strengthened the allied Constellations' Statuses by writing in
mid-air with his brush.

Joseon's number one sorcerer morphed into a gigantic tiger to fight against
Mithra and its turtle, while the Slumbering Lady of Fine Brocade
summoned all of her Hwarangs to defend against the <Emperor>'s forces.

There was an unfamiliar Constellation among them, too – a star with its
eyes closed in the center of this tree. The [Shindansu]'s Story was bubbling
up with him as its core.

[Constellation, 'Virtuous Wanggeom', is gathering the Probability of the
founding gods!]

It seemed that he was one of the Korean Peninsula's 'founding gods'.

His blessing enveloped Kim Dokja and the Korean Peninsula's
Constellations, and protected them.

"…General-nim…?"

They could also see Constellations atop the Turtle Ship, as well.

The sight of the rolling ocean, brought to reality through ⸢Stage
Transformation⸥; that's where Lee Jihye's Constellation sponsor was.
[Today reminds me of that day on Noryang. It's my honour to fight
alongside you, Jungyeong.]

[It is mine, as well.]

The blade of menacingly-growling Cheok Jungyeong collided with Thor's
hammer. Unfortunately, the <Asgard>'s forces were simply too many for
this small group to fight against.

[Constellation, 'Flame of Muspelheim', is summoning its greatsword!]
Eventually, even the Constellations coming from the same hell as Jung
Heewon began joining in, as well.

No matter how excellent both Cheok Jungyeong and Lee Sun-Shin were as
Constellations, it was still impossible for them to stop all of them.

But then, a light flashed from the [Shindansu], and some things began
growing on the ends of its branches. The lights then descended like ripened
fruits, containing people the companions were intimately familiar with.

"It's our great masters!"

Powerful auras of white lightning, as well as sword-light of Breaking the
Sky, dyed the battlefield; then, Jang Hayoung and the Transcendents from
⸢Murim⸥ began roaming the battleground as well.

They were followed by Japanese Youkai Constellations rushing in; 'Tengus'
grasping feathered fans, and 'Kappas' rose up from beneath the water – even
the subordinates of 'Yamata no Orochi' could be seen, as well.

[You bunch of weak Incarnations dare to…!]

Fruits endlessly fell from the [Shindansu].

Among the spreading white lightning dyeing the battlefield bright, the
beings from the 6th scenario began appearing next.

"For Kim Dogeza!"

They were 'small people' from [Peace Land]. Those that fought together
with them against the calamity were descending to this battlefield to help
them out.

[Small Constellation from the small planet is pulling out its sure-kill
weapon 'Dragon Needle'.]

Every time Constellations' swords moved, the small people died in their
droves.
"Ah, ah… Ahhhh…!"

None of the companions could speak at the horrifying spectacle of the
cabin. And at the center of this battlefield, the brightest star on the middle
of the mountain made out of dead stars also didn't speak a word, either.

⸢Kim Dokja on top of the destroyed 'Absolute Throne' maintained his
silence.⸥

Yoo Joonghyuk, Han Sooyoung, and Anna Croft were all fighting there.
They were giving their all to fight against Constellations while vomiting out
blood, scraping every Story they could, and squeezing out every ounce of
willpower they possessed.

⸢The sky was rapidly changing from the collision of worldviews.⸥

<Asgard>'s Odin, <Papyrus>'s Osiris, <Vedas>'s Shiva, <Emperor>'s
Nuwa… Not just them, but Constellations from Nebulas with unfamiliar
names all joined in, causing the sky to brighten up in the deluge of blinding
light show.

⸢What blocked light wasn't darkness, but another light.⸥

The companions subjected to this chokingly bright world felt as if their very
existences were being denied. The starlights from the Constellations were
telling them this – that the history they had compiled so far was nothing.
[Giant Story, 'Demon Realm's Spring', has begun its storytelling!]

Jung Heewon also knew. She knew that those beings couldn't be defeated
even if all of her companions jumped in right now.

[Giant Story, 'Torch that Swallowed the Myth', has begun its storytelling!]

She needed an even stronger Story, one that could strike down all those
blinding stars. The kind of power that could destroy all those constellations.
However, Jung Heewon didn't possess such powers. Even with [God
Slaying] or [Hellfire], it was still impossible.

[Constellation, 'Demon-like Judge of Fire', is looking at her own
Incarnation.]

Jung Heewon looked up at the sky. Her sponsor that had been keeping
silent until then was there. She really liked her sponsor. And because of
that, there were certain things she felt scared of asking for the Archangel's
help.

"Kim Dokja…"

Even then, Jung Heewon had to say it.

"…Please, rescue him, Uriel."

Right away, her sponsor replied back to her.

[Alright.]

Hotly-burning flames blanketed the surroundings. She sensed Uriel
standing right behind her. Without a doubt, the Archangel must've been
using her uniquely noble eyes to look at the same world Jung Heewon was
looking at.

Suddenly, Jung Heewon was overcome with fear.

⸢What if Uriel dies in this place?⸥

Uriel was just a 'Narrative-grade Constellation'; even if she was very
powerful, she still couldn't fight and win against a Myth-grade
Constellation. But then, a soft hand touched her shoulder.

[Don't worry, Heewon-ah. I'll make it happen, no matter what.]

The back of Uriel walking past was smaller than Jung Heewon's. The latter
just couldn't tear her eyes away from that small back.
[Oldest Good has begun its storytelling!]

The white wings spread out from that small back and enveloped the whole
world as Uriel's true voice resounded out.

[Oh, hear me, Eden.]

Jung Heewon felt something shake noticeably inside her.

Something similar to a fragment was wriggling inside; it was a weighty
fragment that began sleeping within her ever since the conclusion of the
'Great War of Saints and Demons'.

['Wall that Divides Good and Evil' has regained its original power!] Tsu-
chuchuchut!

Right away, angels began appearing one by one. Lower- and mid-tier
angels, their number swelling from ten, then to a hundred, then shooting
past a thousand in an instant.

Among them were familiar faces, such as Archangel Gabriel. Not only that,
the spirits of the Archangels who died during the 'Great War of Saints and
Demons' could be seen among them, as well.

[Uriel.]

The 'Guardian of Youths and Travel', Raphael called out to her. The angel
who always looked at the world with sleepy eyes was slowly kneeling
down before her along with all the other Archangels.

[Will you be inheriting <Eden>?]

Uriel didn't reply, but looked back at her Incarnation, instead. A certain
faint smile seeped into the noble expression of this Archangel. Jung
Heewon called out, but her voice couldn't reach its intended target.

The moment Uriel nodded her head, Raphael loudly proclaimed.
[Uriel, from henceforth you are our 'Great Good'.] Tsu-

chuchuchuchu…!

The vast corona completely enveloped Uriel's figure.

Then, the stunningly-brilliant platinum-hued armour settled on her. All of
Uriel's Status was now manifesting itself, just like back on that day she
reigned as the terror of all demons after cutting off countless demon kings'
heads.

The strongest star in <Eden>.

The moment the 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' grasped her sword, every
kneeling angel stood right back up.

[Oh, my fellow angels, let us commence with the final 'Great War of Saints
and Demons'.]
        Chapter 502: Ep. 96 - Demon-like Judge of Fire, II


Odin from the east, Nuwa from the west, and Osiris from the south…

We were somehow maintaining a precarious balance within this cauldron of
Giant Stories ceaselessly pounding on us.

[Your Incarnation Body is breaking down!]

I forgot how many times I've heard that message by now. Yoo Joonghyuk's
body right next to me wasn't okay, either; he was left in tatters after taking
on the combined attacks from both Odin and Nuwa meant for Han
Sooyoung and me.

Our gazes met for a moment there, but he scowled at me as if to ask, "What
are you looking at?" before pulling something out from his inner pocket to
swallow it.

[Incarnation, 'Yoo Joonghyuk', is using 'Life and Death Pill'!]

In the end, he had consumed the very last Life and Death Pill Lee Seolhwa
gave us. We didn't have any left now.
[Guwaaaaah! Endure!!]

The Korean Peninsula's Constellations roared out like untamed beasts and
wielded their weapons.

Kim Yoo-Shin did, so did Gyebaek, too. Gwanchang, as well.
Constellations that crossed swords once upon a time were now turning over
a new leaf together in a single Story under the shade of the [Shindansu].

Cheok Jungyeong could be seen standing at the forefront cutting enemies
down.

⸢[This is why I can't abandon this land even though I curse it so much. Only
a few dying will resolve the issue, yet everyone's jumping in to die
together…⸥

Even Pungbaek stayed by his side to raise winds and roared out like a lion.
The one who was at odds with us back in the Great War of Saints and
Demons, was now standing up for our sakes.

⸢[I can aid the descendants of <Hongik>. I don't need any compensation.⸥

Pungbaek's winds writhed violently, and the <Hongik>'s Constellations
rode on that wind to rush forward. Lee Sun-Shin's [Ghost Fleet] kept firing
their cannons, while Gyeonhwon's arrows pierced through the hearts of
many stars.

However, the number of enemies didn't seem to be decreasing at all.

[Where is this Korean Peninsula even located in?]

[These measly Historical-grade bastards dare to…! You insects! Sweep
them all away!]

Even then, the Korean Peninsula's Constellations were enduring well.
[Giant Story, 'Shindansu', is raising the strengths of all Constellations from
the Korean Peninsula!]

If the enemies had Odin and Osiris, then we too had a Myth-grade
Constellation – the Myth-grade that could greatly enhance [Shindansu]'s
power, Constellation 'Virtuous Wanggeom'.

[Constellation, 'Virtuous Wanggeom', says that this is all the aid he can
provide.]

Unlike other Myth-grade Constellations, his sense of presence seemed quite
faint. It was probably due to the effects of this world-line; <Hongik> didn't
have a whole lot to do during this world-line, after all.

And it was quite likely that <Hongik>'s Constellations couldn't get out from
the ark's cabin due to the pressure exerted by other Myth-grade
Constellations.

[Do not show them your backs! We shall never retreat!]

[Story, 'Burning the Boats', has begun its storytelling!]

Cheok Jungyeong raised his sword, and Lee Sun-Shin continued to
command the others. These heroes from the mythical history who had never
yielded to any myth, continued their battle against the actual gods from
various myths.

Even though their flesh was torn apart and their entire bodies were
wrecked, they never knelt down and continued to wield their blades.

⸢The Korean Peninsula's surface area was getting smaller and smaller.⸥

Jeon Woo-Chi who had morphed into a tiger to fight, finally collapsed. Seo
Ae Il Pil's personal brush broke, and Lee Sun-Shin's Ghost Fleet sank one
by one. Even Cheok Jungyeong's sword, capable of cutting down thousands
of enemies, mountains and seas, was getting dull, as well.
I already expected this. I was supposed to harden my resolve several times
over by now. The Story to be written from now on would consist of texts
stained by the blood of these stars.

[<Star Stream>'s final Giant Story is sprouting new buds!]

Right next second, Thor's hammer came flying in at Cheok Jungyeong's
neck. It was an attack that not even the Korean Peninsula's greatest warrior
could dodge.

[Constellation, 'Demon-like Judge of Fire', is unleashing all of her Status!]

And it was Uriel that blocked the incoming attack.

"Kim Dokja! Archangels have arrived!"

Han Sooyoung shouted out.

More Archangels descended on the battlefield, accompanied by blinding
rays of light. And in the center of them was Uriel wielding the [Flames of
Conflagration].

⸢[…It's like, me and Gabriel want to join 'Kim Dokja's Company' too, you
see?]⸥
Uriel said that to us just before we left for the Final Scenario. She wanted to
join our Nebula, and wanted to become our strength, she said.

⸢The Constellation who has changed the most from the 'original' Kim Dokja
knew.⸥
I never figured out why Uriel liked our story so much.

⸢"Do you really wish to go that far just to help us?"⸥

All I could do now was to cowardly take advantage of her goodwill.
[A new 'Great Good' has appeared in <Eden>!]

Uriel's Status whipped about stylishly.

She was now no longer the 'Narrative-grade Constellation' Uriel.

Ku-gugugugu!

[…A new 'Great Good'?]

Myth-grade Constellations looked at Uriel and began freaking out.

The new Great Good of <Eden>, an existence meant to replace the
Mythgrade Constellation, 'Metatron'. Uriel had become <Eden>'s leader,
and chose to help us.

[All seraphim, advance!]

Along with Raphael's signal, Archangels collided against the
Narrativegrade Constellations from <Papyrus> and <Vedas>.

[Oldest Good is searching for its enemy!]

[Do you really think that the likes of a destroyed Nebula can overturn this
battle's outcome?]

Odin remained unflustered even then, and raised his spear to point it at
Uriel. And the god spear that reputedly no one could evade, [Gungnir], flew
towards her.

[Get out my sight.]

The Statuses of [Flames of Conflagration] and [Gungnir] collided.

Odin's thunderclaps tearing through the heavens, and Uriel's conflagration
that incinerated hell, clashed face to face.

Two Statuses fought intensely; in the battle between two Myth-grade
Constellations where neither of them would normally back down, it was
surprisingly Odin who withdrew first. His left arm summoning the spear
back was trembling ever so slightly.

[How pathetic, Odin. Allow me to help.]

Myth-grade Constellations were far more sensitive towards danger than any
other existences.

They were the oldest stars in this world that hated unexpected variables.
And that was why they would never allow any sort of danger to blossom.

Myth-grade Constellations exchanged glances in less than a blink of an eye
and commenced bombardment on Uriel simultaneously.

Kwa-kwakwakwakwa!

Even if she was now <Eden>'s Great Good, she still wouldn't be able to
defend against such an attack. However, she didn't back down. Even though
feathers of her wings were ripped off, and crimson Story splattered on her
pale cheeks, her sword didn't weaken at all.

[None of you are my greatest enemy.]

Uriel who had always been watching our Story from high up above in the
sky – her eyes were now shifting in my direction.

[Nebula, <Eden>, is readying its 'Giant Story'.]

"Dokja-ssi!"

From afar, my companions including Jung Heewon were rushing towards
us. Maybe she already knew the truth. Knew what Uriel was planning to do
here.

Tsu-chuchuchut!

<Eden> alone couldn't fight against all of these Great Nebulas. The
strengths of the Myth-grade Constellations permeating within this ark
would even equal the whole of <Star Stream> itself. So, if one wanted to
defeat them, one required a 'Giant Story' with truly incredible Probability.

[The ⸢Stage Transformation⸥ is activating!]

Simply put, a massive myth that could bring all the other myths to their
doom was needed.

[I am the 'Demon-like Judge of Fire'.]

Uriel slowly blinked her eyes currently burning up like a real demon's.

[I wish for an 'Evil' that will validate my Modifier.]

As her words came to an end, flames erupting out from her [Flames of
Conflagration] burned through the stars in the heavens. Something began
writhing from the other side of hell.

⸢The Oldest Good called out to its enemy.⸥

Right then, Lee Gilyoung's eyes suddenly became white.

⸢And the demon curled up in hell's deepest pit answered that call.⸥

Something resembling the pitch-black storm clouds rolled in from beyond
the burning sky.

Something that was not <Asgard>, not <Vedas>, and also not <Papyrus>,
flooded in towards this side while emitting truly despicable and insidious
aura.

[Constellation, 'Ruler of the Deepest Pit', is opening the Pandǣmonium!]

Demons began waking up from the skies of the burning hell.

[Oldest Evil is searching for its enemy!]

['Wall that Divides the Good and Evil' is drawing out its theme!]
The master of Pandǣmonium biding its time for an innumerable amount of
time finally revealed its true strengths in place of the absent Demon Kings.

And so, the two representatives of Good and Evil began colliding with
Myth-grade Constellations caught in the middle.

⸢And there was an ancient being observing that great battle between Good
and Evil.⸥

The [Chimera Dragon] flapping its wings in Shin Yoosung's side suddenly
began emitting light from deep within its body. It was a scene that
happened in the original, too. Finally, her dragon was evolving into an
'Ancient Dragon'.

Soon, radiant golden lustre blinded everyone. The [Chimera Dragon], now
enjoying the Status of a complete 'Ancient Dragon', roared out to the
heavens above.

The ⸢Dragon Call⸥. The howling of a dragon that summoned its kin by
sacrificing its own life.

Gu-aaaaaaaah!!

And from the other side of the darkened sky, howls of dragons could be
heard. Traces of electricity and flames danced everywhere. All dragons
living in this world heeded the [Chimera Dragon]'s call and were flying
over here.

[The ⸢Stage Transformation⸥'s degree of reproduction is rapidly rising up!]

Rather than tearing into the stars, the dragons started fighting tooth and nail
against each other, instead. Even the [Gold Dragon's Heart] replacing my
original heart was writhing powerfully as well.

It was a sight we all witnessed back in the 'Great War of Saints and
Demons'.
⸢A Dragon with seven heads and ten horns will awaken from the center of
the hottest hell.⸥

⸢He is the Dragon among all Dragons. The leader of Dragons born in the
center of chaos, the oldest hatred in this world.⸥
The 'Dragon's Festival', the riot of dragons taking place in the hottest place
in hell, had commenced.

Myth-grade Constellations belatedly realized what was going on here and
cried out in sheer astonishment.

[C-could these bastards be…?!]

[Make them stop!]

Everyone here knew very well what kind of calamity would crash the party
if another 'Great War of Saints and Demons' took place here.

[You, you bastards dare!!]

The Great Dokkaebis, not many remaining now after Bihyung's sacrifice,
revealed themselves inside the ark. The Great Dokkaebi 'Garang' with its
horn now broken off, was yelling out loudly.

[Suppress that Giant Story's Probability!]

Great Dokkaebis activated their authorities, and the Myth-grade
Constellations inside the ark used up their own Coin reserves, as well.

[Constellation, 'Master of December 25th', does not want 'Great War of
Saints and Demons'!]

[Constellation, 'Great Mother God Who Created Man Out of Earth', does
not want 'Great War of Saints and Demons'!]

[Constellation, 'One-eyed Father', does not want 'Great War of Saints and
Demons'!]
[Constellation, 'Master of Abydos', does not want 'Great War of Saints and
Demons'!]

The Probability of the unfolding Stage Transformation was being
suppressed as an incredible amount of Coins got injected simultaneously.

The <Star Stream>'s Probability flowed towards the direction the majority
wanted to see. And at this stage, there didn't seem to be anyone out there
capable of going against the will of those possessing the most amount of
Coins in this world.

⸢With an exception of one being.⸥

I heard the soft hum of an engine coming from behind, followed by the
familiar scent of a cigar.

"You've come."

The 'Mass Production Maker' stood on my side and spoke up. [This is the
type of Story that I love the most.]

He also said something similar back then, when we first met during the
'Gourmet Association'.

He was the Constellation that loved all the Stories of this world.

He formed an unreadable expression while looking at the Story of 'Great
War of Saints and Demons' writhing violently before his eyes.

He was also a Constellation that spent his life mass-producing SSS-rank
items.

[It has… taken a really long time.]

"My apologies."

[Honestly speaking, I felt puzzled when I first heard what my ■■ would be.
I believed that no such ■■ would ever come knocking at my door.]
"And are your thoughts different now?"

The 'Mass Production Maker' wordlessly stubbed his cigar and killed it off.
He then watched the Story of the 'Great War of Saints and Demons' with
me. The history of all our battles was now being recreated in that place.

The 'Mass Production Maker' laughed out. [At the very least, I think I
understand one thing – why my Story coaxed me to amass such a large
reserve of Coins until now.]

Coins began floating up from his fingertips. There were so many that I
couldn't even dare to attempt at counting them.

[It seems that it was for the purpose of completing the 'One Single Stage'.]

Coins, along with his life itself, got sucked up into the sky. And his Coins
collided with the will of the numerous Constellations. The Myth-grade
Constellations roared out in anger, and the 'Mass Production Maker' calmly
opened his mouth.

The Constellation possessing this world's greatest authority replied to them.

[Oh, my dear Constellations. I apologise, but I simply must see this stage.]

And when all of his Coins were injected into the Probability in the air, its
powerful storm began enveloping the entirety of the ark. Meanwhile, the
Mass Production Maker's body suddenly aged at a visible rate.

[Constellation, 'Mass Production Maker's' ■■ is 'Depletion'.]

[The deficient Probability has been satisfied!]

[Giant Story, 'Season of Light and Darkness', is being completely recreated
on this stage!]

Tsu-chuchuchut!
A horrifying howl exploded out from the sky. Along with that explosion,
dragons fell towards the ground. I quickly pulled both Han Sooyoung and
Anna Croft closer, and along with Yoo Joonghyuk, evacuated towards
where our companions were.

Finally, the last verse of all the scenarios – the destruction of all
Constellations – was fast approaching us.

[Do not get sucked into this measly little 'Great War of Saints and Demons'!
We've won against many so-called great apocalypses time and time again,
and got this far!]

The 'Giant Stories' of the Myth-grade Constellations began waking up all at
the same time. Every Giant Story found in this world howled out, as if they
were unwilling to be overwhelmed by the scale of the 'Great War of Saints
and Demons'.

However, it was too late now.

⸢This Dragon will look at the heaven once, and at earth once, and will strike
with its tail. Stars will fall from that single tail-flick, and a direction of the
world will disappear.⸥

A pair of eyes began gleaming from within the darkness.

Han Sooyoung shuddered uncontrollably the moment she heard the violent
howling of a dragon.

"Kim Dokja!! Could this be…!"

"It is."

"You crazy?! If you wake that thing up again now-!!"

"We aren't planning to wake that guy up."
I looked at Yoo Sangah sitting in the lotus position in the corner while
focusing all of her mind on something. Sweat drops trickled down her
forehead.

['Wall that Decides Samsara' is maintaining the seal on the Apocalypse
Dragon.]

As long as the successor of Sakyamuni was alive, the sealed Apocalypse
Dragon would never be summoned to this place.

The flustered Han Sooyoung asked me again. "T-then, what…?"

"Don't you get it?"

She looked up at the dragons falling from the sky with a dazed expression.

The 'Dragon's Festival' was a ceremony to decide the strongest dragon. And
the single dragon that managed to survive until the end would become the
'Final Dragon of Revelation'.

Since when did it start? Han Sooyoung's left arm was trembling like crazy.

[The new 'Final Dragon of Revelation' has been selected!] Ku-

ooooooohhh!!!

Eventually, a massive dragon revealed itself through the destroyed ceiling
of the ark. It was so huge that it'd easily tear apart your regular giant star to
shreds.

Bewitching black flames were dancing on the jet-black, slick exterior that
had shed its last layer of skin.

[Constellation, 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon', has incarnated into the 'Final
Ark'!]

"He's the Apocalypse Dragon now."
        Chapter 503: Ep. 96 - Demon-like Judge of Fire, III


The Final Dragon of Revelation.

The great calamity that decides the end of 'Great War of Saints and
Demons' as well as the most horrifying apocalypse of <Star Stream> itself.

[The ⸢Stage Transformation⸥'s degree of reproduction has exceeded the
percentage limit!]

The lightning bolts powerfully tearing through the storm clouds now took
on a different hue than before. Both <Asgard>'s Odin and <Papyrus>'s
Osiris jaws dropped in sheer astonishment.

"Black Flame Dragon!!"

The Apocalypse Dragon's gaze lingered on Han Sooyoung's face for the
briefest moment in time.

⸢It's possible that Uriel isn't the only Constellation different from the
original.⸥
Back in the original novel, this guy was the Constellation backer of the
'Delusion Demon' Kim Namwoon. He was the leader of evil dragons that
represented the 'Absolute Evil', not to mention the ruler of the Nebula
<Black Cloud>.

He raised his head high up to the sky and cried out.

The entirety of <Star Stream> shuddered from the screech that announced
the arrival of this world's final pages.

⸢[Constellation, 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon's' ■■ is 'Something that can't
be found'.]⸥
I had read what his ■■ was from the original novel. His description showed
up when he became Yoo Joonghyuk's ally for a little while during the
1863rd turn.

⸢The evil dragon suffering from the worst possible depression in this <Star
Stream>.⸥
The reason why the 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' believed his age to be 15
was simply that he'd not be able to continue on if he didn't.

A life stretching for thousands, no, tens of thousands of years, made an
originally solitary dragon into such a creature.

In order to stop itself from decaying, he chose not to age. He chose not to
lose his curiosity of the world. He chose to torment Incarnations or play
bizarre pranks. And for his final prank, he even chose to betray the
'Absolute Evil', too. He stood on Yoo Joonghyuk's side and while mocking
the <Star Stream>, breathed his last.

[Constellation, 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon', has reached his ■■!]

What about this world-line, though?
Did he finally manage to find his ■■ within this empty universe?

[Constellation, 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon's' ■■ is 'Pureness'!] The

'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' looked at me and smiled.

His child-like eyes were now dyeing the world in the night of apocalypse as
if he was satisfied by the role he had found.

[Fully-satisfied Probability has recreated the 'Apocalypse Dragon' in the
Final Scenario!]

[Giant Story, 'Season of Light and Darkness', has achieved perfect unity
with the scenario!]

The Myth-grade Constellations began roaring at the top of their lungs at the
reproduction of Apocalypse Dragon.

[This is impossible…!!]

Every Constellation alive was well aware of the Story of Apocalypse
Dragon, the great calamity capable of destroying a section of <Star Stream>
with nothing but its 'First Tail-flick'.

[Stop him! Kill him before the tail-flick commences!!]

The clearly-freaking out Myth-grade Constellations ungainly lost their
composure and issued their orders.

Han Sooyoung, Yoo Joonghyuk and I all looked up at that spectacle.

⸢None among these Myth-grade Constellations have experienced the
'Apocalypse Dragon' before. Because their peers that did fight it had all
perished back then.⸥

After all, these bastards had been hiding inside this 'ark', the safest place in
the entire world, and watched the moment of the Apocalypse Dragon being
unshackled as if it was a form of entertainment. In other words, they had
absolutely no clue what this fear was like, the terror, and what it meant to
risk their lives.

Yoo Joonghyuk next to me asked a question. "You… You have been
preparing for this moment all along, haven't you?"

I slowly nodded my head. "That's right."

From the moment the first scenario began, I had been calculating a certain
something.

⸢Just how much Story would I need to compile in order to massacre the
Constellations in the Final Scenario?⸥
I couldn't get to an answer. A human's lifespan was short, but stars were
eternal. Since our starting lines were different, the battle would never be
fair, and most important of all, I wasn't a regressor like Yoo Joonghyuk. I
couldn't live a life of 1863 regression turns and fight them afterwards.

"It was wrong to even think about compiling Stories to fight them. Whether
it's a legendary or mythical Story, you can't suppress those beings in terms
of pure Status no matter how many Stories you manage to amass."

"And so, this is what you came up with."

I nodded my head and stared at Kim Yoo-Shin and Gyebaek fighting
together with [Shindansu] behind them.

⸢Kim Dokja found the answer to this battle within the 'Stage
Transformation'.⸥

The ⸢Stage Transformation⸥; although it was imaginary, this power would
grow closer to reality as Probability expanded.

I confirmed the potential of this power when defeating Surya back in the
'Demon King Selection' battles, and the first outlines of my plan formed in
my head when we defeated <Olympus> back in the 'Gigantomachia'.
And I grew even more confident after we experienced the 'Great War of
Saints and Demons', then won the 'Journey to the West'.

⸢The more they succeeded in the impossible-odds scenarios, the greater the
power of reproduction their 'Giant Story' possessed.⸥
The air they breathed, the emotions they felt on that day – the fear humans
felt while facing the apocalypse, their eyes fixed to the outpouring of the
stars.

⸢And now, it was the turn of the Constellations to feel the fear people felt
on that day.⸥
[Giant Story, 'Season of Light and Darkness', is continuing on with its
storytelling!]

The Apocalypse Dragon's 'First Tail-flick' commenced.

Kwa-kwakwakwakwakwa!!

The Apocalypse Dragon's tail-flick was divided into three separate
shockwaves. The first was 'electrical wave', the second was 'heat wave',
while the true tail-flick and the third wave was the 'wave of Chaos'.

[Kuwaaaaah---! I shall block this!]

Thor, who had defended against the electrical wave with me back then,
stepped forward. He must've felt confident this time too, since he had dealt
with it in the past.

Unfortunately, that was a terrible misjudgement on his part.

[Thor-!!]

Thor's scorched-black figure crash-landed from the air.
The reason why he could defend against the electrical wave back then was
because Dionysus, me, and my master were there to aid him. However, no
one was helping him out this time.

[Uwaaaaah-!!]

Just as the fear-stricken Constellations turned around to run, all the
Mythgrade Constellations unleashed their Statuses. Along with the
incredible storm of aftermaths, all the stars in the sky flickered unsteadily.

And then, the exploding electrical wave blanketed entire surroundings like
fine fog particles.

Once the view cleared out, one could clearly see that the Apocalypse
Dragon's electrical wave had been weakened by a great deal.

[…And it only amounted to this much?] Tsu-

chuchuchut…!

The one who defended against the electrical wave was the leader of
<Asgard>, Odin. His dignified beard, which was his pride and joy, was
scorched black. His clothing had all melted down, too, leaving him
bucknaked. He revealed his skin, horrifyingly deformed by that wave, and
laughed out loudly.

[With such measly little…!]

Shu-susususut…

Right in the next moment, <Asgard>'s Constellations manning his side
began scattering away like dust. Their lives were exhausted completely
while dealing with the Probability necessary to offset the shockwave.

Odin's eye grew large from shock. Grey-coloured powder spread about
helplessly in the air. With that one attack alone, half of <Asgard> was
wiped out.
Ku-oooooooh!!

It was a similar situation with <Vedas> and <Papyrus> as well.

[…Nuwa!!]

Osiris belatedly understood the severity of this situation and looked behind
while shouting that name out. That was where he discovered Nuwa leading
the forces of <Emperor> to withdraw from this cabin. She had recognised
the unfavourable battle situation and prepared to retreat from very early on.

"Gong Pildu."

After I called out, Gong Pildu's castle moved. His [Armed Fortress]
accurately blocked off the path leading to the Emperor's worldview, and its
turrets began spitting out flames.

"You're going nowhere."

At same time, the Apocalypse Dragon's second shockwave exploded out.

The flames of the 'heat wave' boiling over from the deepest part in hell
began melting down the Constellations in the air.

[Bureau!! How long are you going to sit back and watch?!]

Odin's scream prompted the Great Dokkaebi Garang to raise its hand while
Story endlessly gurgled out from its mouth.

[…Fine. If you wish to use the 'Stage Transformation', then…]

Suddenly, I felt this ominous foreboding.

Tsu-chuchuchu…!

The ⸢Stage Transformation⸥'s authority was now in full display. A powerful
deluge of sparks caused me to hurriedly look behind, only to discover blood
trickling out from Yoo Sangah's lips.
"Sangah-ssi!!"

The lotus pedestal spinning next to her suddenly developed cracks.

She vomited out a chunk of blood and spoke in an ashamed voice. "I
stopped one… from coming out, but… a portion of the other has…"

There were two great beings sealed away in the 'Isle of Reincarnators' by
Sakyamuni. One of them was the Apocalypse Dragon, while the other
was…

['Wall that decides Samsara' is violently writhing around!]

['Wall that decides Samsara' is unveiling its theme!]

[Existence from another world is breaking past the 'Wall's' seal and has
been recreated in this world!] Tsu-chuchuchut!

Black fog was distorting the heavens as it rushed in here.

Countless eyes could be seen beyond that dark fog. It was <Star Stream>'s
cleaner, the one that should've been imprisoned within the eternal darkness
after Sakyamuni had sealed it away.

[■■■■■■■■! Oh, the 'Indescribable Distance'!]

I realized what the Dokkaebis were trying to do. They were trying to use
the same method I used back in the 'Great War of Saints and Demons' to
stop the Apocalypse Dragon.

⸢And so, the two calamities representing the absolute worst-case scenario of
<Star Stream> collided.⸥
[Haha, hahaha! You shall never reach the final verse! You shall never-!]

With those final parting words, the heads of all the Great Dokkaebis
exploded.
The 'Indescribable Distance' sucked in their Stories and violently writhed.
And then, this Outer God that had earned the Great Dokkaebis' Stories, and
the Black Flame Dragon that earned the power of apocalypse, glared at
each other.

[Third shockwave is now commencing!]

The Apocalypse Dragon's tail moved. The calamity moved very slowly, its
speed very measured but assured.

Nuwa grew impatient and yelled out loudly in the air.

[Just what are you all doing?! Fu Xi! Shennong! All of you damnable
Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors, just for how long are you planning
to enjoy the slumber of abyss?!] Ku-gugugugu!!

Nuwa's true voice managed to wake up the <Emperor>'s ancient
Constellations. The blessings from the Myth-grade Constellations that
hadn't shown themselves until now completely enveloped Nuwa's
Incarnation Body.

The truly explosive rise in her Status forced Going Pildu's [Armed Fortress]
back.

We needed to stop her.

We couldn't afford to let them escape back to their own worldview.

[Giant Story, 'Journey to the West', has begun its storytelling!]

The Nebula <Emperor>'s Giant Story began its story; Nuwa transformed
into a gigantic Imoogi and her flames began amassing within her maw.

Just before the <Emperor>'s Constellations gathered their fighting spirit and
rushed towards us…

Kurururung! Rumble!
Lightning bolts struck down from the sky and Nuwa screamed loudly.

[Giant Story, 'Liberator of Forgotten Ones', has begun its storytelling!]

The sight of Tongtian spread out in an instant, and an existence draped in
the golden tiger hide defended me.

Kwa-kwakwakwakwa…

He was the sole existence capable of standing up against the <Emperor>'s
vast Myth-grade Constellations.

[Constellation, 'Most Ancient Liberator', has incarnated into the 'Final

Ark'!] He was also a star that became my brother.

['Meihouwang' is looking at you.]

['Bimawen' is looking at you.]

['Douzhanshengfo' is looking at you.]

All of the Sun Wukongs addressed me.

['Great Sage, Heaven's Equal' is turning his back to you.]

[Go now, maknae-yah.]

We could see the Apocalypse Dragon's tail colliding against the
Indescribable Distance in the distant sky. We all knew very well the likely
outcome of that collision.

⸢He dreamed of every star's destruction. But, did he really wish for such a
result?⸥
I had never forgotten the final moment of the 1863rd regression turn.

The Great Sage turned around and rushed towards the <Emperor>'s
Constellations.
Even before I could reach out, Yoo Joonghyuk and Han Sooyoung grabbed
me and ran away.

Gong Pildu continued to shout something or rather, while Lee Seolhwa was
pulling out all the recovery medicines in her possession. I couldn't tell
whether Lee Hyunsung's forged steel covered us first, or the pure-white
flash of light managed to blanket the world before that. It felt like my whole
body was melting down from the incredible heat, only to become deathly
cold as if I was exposed to a cold snap.

When I came to, we were already cast outside the cabin.

Stories leaked out indiscriminately from the gaps of the crumbling walls,
painfully singing the end of the stars.

The prop storage's door hadn't been closed yet. Ash drifted out through the
half-open doorway.

['The Fourth Wall' is violently trembling.]

Maybe, somehow, everyone inside that cabin was…

Shu-sut…

There was a faint presence of someone beyond it, and Han Sooyoung's
voice entered my ears almost at the same time.

"…Kim Dokja?"

I crawled towards the door. My heart didn't want to stop pounding away. I
barely managed to reach the rim of the doorway, and saw someone standing
there.

⸢Torn white feathers were cascading downwards one by one.⸥

My lips bobbed up and down. I wanted to say something.

But in place of my mouth wanting to open, Uriel slowly bent down first.
[…Dokja…]

I couldn't hear her true voice properly. I tried so hard to get back up as Uriel
reached out to me. And her white hand brushed past my face as if she was
stroking my cheek and brows.

I saw the enemy Constellations standing back up from beyond Uriel's
broken wings. Some stars somehow managed to survive even from this
utterly horrifying calamity.

[The 'Stage Transformation' has concluded.]

I could no longer sense the Status of the 'Indescribable Distance'. I then saw
the huge body of the 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' now lying unmoving on
the floor – and the Constellations from the Great Nebulas pouncing on top
of him, as well as demons tearing into the wings of Archangels.

Countless enemies were approaching Uriel.

"Urie…!"

I was about to open the door, grab my sword, and cut them down for Uriel.

⸢However, the door didn't open.⸥

Uriel held fast the doorknob from the other side and didn't let go.

Jung Heewon's cry, as desperate as a real scream, resounded out. "Uriel!!
Hurry!! Hurry and get out of there-!!"

[It's okay.]

I didn't want to hear what she was about to say next. Uriel smiled at me.

[You guys, you've only seen up to this far in the story, that's all.]

The cabin's door was closed shut.
[You have accomplished a feat that no star in <Star Stream> has ever
managed to accomplish!]

The story beyond the door could no longer be heard. Some of us screamed
out, while some despaired. The ark seemed to tilt out of balance, before it
crashed against something along with a loud boom. I rolled around on the
floor ungainly. The vibration of the ark had already come to a stop by the
time I lifted myself up, the wave of vicious dizziness washing over me
nonstop.

I didn't have any energy left to even stand. I could only manage to raise my
head and look ahead. My eyes followed after the broken partitioning walls
to discover a new location.

That unknown something colliding with the ark had become connected to
the vessel's interior.

[All the stars in <Star Stream> will never forget you.]

None of those stars were looking at us now. But, there was one existence
remaining still looking at us.

['King of Stories' is waiting for you.]

A yellowish mineral-like object rolled down the slope of the destroyed ark.
I recognised what that was. That 'gemstone' was what we had been
searching for inside this ark all along, after all.

However, neither me nor my companions had any energy left to focus on
that gemstone.

"…"

I left the ark and slowly scanned our surroundings.

We were greeted by a wall so vast that its ends couldn't be seen. Stories
leaking out from the ark was permeating into that wall.
⸢And so, Kim Dokja has finally arrived at his destination.⸥

That wall was now talking to me.

⸢The end of all these stories. The 'Final Wall' was right before their eyes.⸥
        Chapter 504: Ep. 97 - The star that can't be seen, I


The smartphone inside my coat vibrated and emitted 'Woong, woong' noise.

⸢This whole story began the moment he read that novel.⸥

Texts rose above the phone. The expansive wall before me seemed
uncannily similar to the screen of this device.

From Yoo Joonghyuk's 3rd regression turn all the way to the 1863's – the
wall that, most likely, had recorded all the stories that I knew of.

⸢Kim Dokja used to think about a certain thing back when he was working
for the QA team: 'What if I'm the only one who knows about this bug?'⸥
"You…"

I turned around and found Han Sooyoung there. She seemed to have
something to say, but was unable to find the right words. The bandages
imbued with the Abyssal Black Flame Dragon's grace wrapped around her
left hand were slowly scattering away.
I took a close look at each of my companions. Jung Heewon was on her
knees, her visibly-shaking hands pressed to the ground, while Lee
Hyunsung was carrying the unconscious Lee Gilyoung. Lee Seolhwa and
Gong Pildu were supporting each other while exiting from the ark.

And in the distance, I spotted Jang Hayoung who had narrowly escaped
from the cabin along with our masters.

"…Ahjussi."

Shin Yoosung was looking at her hands. Rather than calling out to me,
though, her voice was much closer to a murmur directed at herself. A lone
piece of scale from the 'Chimera Dragon' rested in her palm.

Yoo Sangah approached her and placed a hand on the girl's shoulder. As
her hand felt the soft, trembling sob, Yoo Sangah wordlessly shifted her
gaze over to the exit we all escaped from.

⸢The stars they used to know had grown dark.⸥

My vision shook from the dizziness. I couldn't sense the gazes of the stars.
Was it because every single one of them was extinguished?

But, that couldn't be. No, this was simply because all the Great Dokkaebis
had disappeared, that's all. Every channel operated by the Bureau had
received massive impact and that caused system errors. Had to be.

⸢He wouldn't be able to go on if he didn't believe in that.⸥

I staggered but still managed to find my balance. The last person I spotted
was Yoo Joonghyuk. His Black Heavenly Demon Sword was currently
stabbing through the corpses of Great Dokkaebies. Stories from dead
Constellations dripped steadily from the edge of his blade.

He was staring at me with his usual expressionless face of his.

⸢Is this the conclusion you desired?⸥
['The Fourth Wall' is violently shaking!]

['The Fourth Wall' is activating even more strongly!]

My mouth opened slowly, only to be shut again.

[Completion of the Final Scenario is imminent.]

The ark's core I had been searching for all this time rolled around on the
ground. It was a piece of mineral emitting a brilliant yellowish hue, The
powers of countless 'Giant Stories' drifting around in this world-line were
condensed to create this hardened essence.

The [ark's core].

It was the source of energy for the great Story weapon, 'Final Ark'.
Destroying it would bring an end to this 99th scenario and conclude our
battle.

[The completion of <Star Stream>'s final Story is around the corner!] Tsu-

chuchu…!

Suddenly, my steps came to a stop. Vines sprouted out from the ground and
wrapped around my ankles. 'Zarathustras' appeared from seemingly out of
nowhere and used restriction skills on me.

Selena Kim was avoiding my gaze as if she was apologetic about this. Soon
afterwards, I could hear the prophet's voice.

"Thanks to you, our workload has been greatly lightened, Demon King of
Salvation."

Anna Croft, already holding the ark's core, was looking in this direction.

⸢Humanity's hero that dreams of a different conclusion to Kim Dokja.⸥
"You shouldn't be too surprised about this. I shall be taking this core with
me."

I had already heard about the world she dreamed of.

The 'Perfect Night'. She dreamed of complete freedom from the gazes of all
Constellations, and that dream entailed migrating safely to a different
worldline along with every Incarnation from this world.

However…

"The ark is already destroyed."

"It can be rebuilt."

Anna Croft looked back at the wrecked ark. It was broken beyond salvage,
unable to be re-used ever again.

However, she didn't lose hope.

"One of the human Incarnations is proficient with crafting Story weapons.
Aileen under your care is another person capable of doing that, as well.
Now that there aren't any Myth-grade Constellations to hinder us, we…"

"Give me that core."

"…I see. There is still a 'Myth-grade Constellation' remaining, isn't there?"

Her eyes glowed in red.

The [Eye of Great Demon]; her power to read this world's past and future
began tying me down. She had completely awakened the power of that eye,
and currently, she enjoyed Status rivalling a decent Narrative-grade
Constellation.

⸢The opponent of all the stars.⸥

This was the same as the original, too. Anna Croft hated all the
Constellations in this world. And that was why she swore to use the power
of stars to destroy the stars themselves. In order to complete her night, she'd
not spare me, either.

⸢If this story was really the same as the original, that is.⸥

The tip of her blade pointing at me seemed to be hesitant over something.

"…It's not too late, Kim Dokja."

The event that had never happened before in the original.

I sensed Yoo Joonghyuk, standing not too far while holding the [Black
Heavenly Demon Sword]'s grip, being faintly surprised. Anna Croft lightly
sucked in her breath and began telling her story.

"I… do not know the conclusion you dream of. My [Precognition] can't
read that far ahead. However, I can make an educated guess. The fact that
my [Precognition] can't see your conclusion means that it's related to that
[Final Wall]. However, please consider this carefully, Kim Dokja. Consider
whether that is the best course of action for us all, for the rest of humanity
or not."

This would be her first time speaking so many words at once.

I silently listened to her.

"Isn't this enough already? You have experienced enough tragedies by now.
You've lost so much, and your most precious things have been ridiculed
upon. Even then, are you still curious about this world's 'One Single Story'?
Just for something like that, are you going to forsake the survival of the
human race?"

Every word she spoke contained desperation. Words that emphasized her
justice, while resenting mine.
And soon, that had become a Story, too. A blindingly bright Story wrapped
around 'Anna Croft' and the Zarathustras. Although not as clear or flashy as
a Constellation's, it nevertheless was indomitable and beautiful. Every facet
of the Story they had compiled together contained their unyielding belief.

The emotion that countless stars had forgotten about a long time ago. She
got this far because she hadn't forgotten her pledge.

"Kim Dokja. Please give up on your ■■."

"…"

"I ask of you. Please, let us head to my 'perfect night' together."

Those words caused the eyes of several Zarathustras to grow wider. That
was understandable, however. The offer she made just now was basically
the same as going against her own beliefs.

What Anna Croft said was tantamount to asking me to become the lone star
that would shine in the night of the brand new world.

Although I was thankful for the offer…

[I'm a Constellation.]

…I could never accept it.

Tsu-chuchuchu…

I lightly aroused my Status and the vines restricting me all fell away. And
as if to mock her goodwill, all of my Stories began telling their stories.

[Giant Story, 'Demon Realm's Spring', has begun its storytelling!]

The horn of the Demon King grew up on my head, and…

[Giant Story, 'Torch that Swallowed the Myth', is howling out!]

The Unbroken Faith that slew gods viciously cried out, and…
[Giant Story, 'Season of Light and Darkness', is looking at the world of
humans.]

Wings I received by betraying the Archangel spread out next. Then…

[Giant Story, 'Liberator of the Forgotten Ones', is mocking <Star

Stream>.] The ominous and evil aura of Chaos enveloped my entire body.


Anna Croft's eyes were trembling uncontrollably. They shifted around
urgently as if to find any remaining trace of humanity from my appearance.

However, there was this thing that we both knew. How could you call an
existence a regular human when you had to search so hard to find his
humanity?

"…In the end, you're the same, is that it? Demon King of Salvation."

Deep anguish was thickly pervading her murmurs. Rather than a calm
revelation of the truth, her voice contained her determination over a certain
something, instead.

"I shall kill you right here."

Stupendous Status began flooding out from Anna Croft's figure. I already
knew that she had been conserving her strength while getting this far.

"Even if you're a 'Myth-grade Constellation', you can't stop me with your
current physical condition. Besides, your companions don't seem to be in
their right frame of minds, so I…"

Jung Heewon, Lee Hyunsung, Lee Gilyoung, and even Shin Yoosung, too.
They still hadn't recovered themselves yet, it seemed. Even Han Sooyoung
was wordlessly staring at me. Her eyes, the ones that always trusted in me,
were shaking for the first time ever.
Perhaps it was inevitable. They had witnessed their sponsors getting
slaughtered right before their own eyes, after all.

"Let's end it here."

A dozen or so Zarathustras all dashed towards Yoo Joonghyuk in an instant.
And right next second, Anna Croft approached me like a streak of light, her
dagger stabbing towards my neck.

I calmly watched the tip of that blade, before opening my mouth.

[Enough with your pranks, Loki.]

Along with those words, Anna Croft's movement froze up.

I lightly raised my finger and brushed her dagger aside.

Looking clearly astonished, she muttered out in sheer confusion next.

"W-what is the meaning of…??"

[Constellation that likes changing gender is cackling away.]

"Loki, you! This is not what you promi…!"

A massive amount of Status bore down on Anna Croft and the Zarathustras.
The so-called Constellation that liked changing gender, the final star of
<Asgard>, 'Loki' was now standing there.

Not one among the Zarathustras could resist his power. Because it was
precisely him who freed them from the <Asgard>'s control.

"But, I'm doing this for humani…!"

Those were Anna Croft's last words before she passed out. The core fell out
from her hand and rolled on the ground towards my feet. I bent down and
picked it up.

[It's really been entertaining, Demon King of Salvation.]
I straightened my back to discover a man standing before me – a man with
green hair and a mischievous smile.

[Constellation, 'One Who Changes His Existence', is looking at you.]

The One Who Changes His Existence. One of the highest-ranked
Constellations in <Asgard>, Loki.

Also, a Constellation who helped us many times during our journey up to
this point, someone with an agenda that we couldn't figure out before.

He had safely escaped from the Apocalypse Dragon's calamity and chased
after us.

"Thanks for your help."

[The conclusion to this world is literally right before us, so I can't afford to
let that go to waste because of a measly little human… Besides all that.
There isn't anyone left for you to frighten here, so why don't you undo that
scary appearance of yours?]

I dismissed my horn and the wings, then spoke up.

"Why don't you reveal your true self as well?"

[What do you mean?]

"I thought we both tacitly agreed to drop the pretence?"

My words caused Yoo Joonghyuk observing the situation to address me.

 –         Kim Dokja.

 –         Your suspicions are correct.

I glared at Loki.

The Constellation, 'One Who Changes His Existence'. If my thoughts were
correct, then this guy was no 'Constellation'.
[Constellation, 'One Who Changes His Existence', is revealing his true
identity!]

[Cons■tellation, ■ his ■ ??iden■ty??'…]

Blinding light blanketed Loki, then his silhouette began changing next. His
height shrunk down a little, and creases on his face rapidly increased in
number. And eventually, two large growths ballooned out with his cheeks
as the middle.

⸢The existence capable of exploiting the <Star Stream>'s bug at will. The
irreconcilable enemy of every Dokkaebi in the world, and the founder of
the 'Seekers of Apocalypse'.⸥

I had encountered this being once before.

Back in the Journey to the West's Tongtian river, he opposed the Great
Dokkabies trying to obstruct me in my stead.

His lips distorted slightly to form an insidious grin.

[That's right. You people aren't the only ones dreaming of <Star Stream>'s
end.]

"…The Wenny King."

Having discovered the creature's true identity, Yoo Joonghyuk unhesitantly
unsheathed the [Black Heavenly Demon Sword].

[Why don't you put that thing away. I have no thoughts of fighting you.]
The Wenny King playfully waved his hands about and continued on. [What
I wish to see is only one thing. The unknown 'something' found beyond this
Final Wall that you've been searching for. That's all. And also…] Go-
ooooooh!

[I don't think now isn't the time for you folks to worry about me.]
The moment I looked back, someone angrily grabbed hold of my collars.
Lee Jihye's face was pressing right up to mine. Stories of rage and
resentment leaking out from her entire Incarnation Body was pounding
down hard on my body.

"…Ahjussi. What the hell is this? Huh? Was this a part of your plan, too?"

The spirit of the ocean that used to permeate her could no longer be felt.
That gentle scent of saltiness wafting in when I first met her back in the
subway could no longer be picked up.

"Kim Dokja!"

Lee Jihye was crying as she shook me around. No one tried to stop her. Not
Yoo Sangah, not Jung Heewon, not even Shin Yoosung. Everyone's head
was lowered, their eyes fixed to the ground.

⸢And Kim Dokja understood their feelings.⸥

All of their resentment was my burden to carry.

⸢However, there was someone who didn't think that way.⸥

"Lee Jihye."

⸢It was Han Sooyoung.⸥

"Let me go!"

Lee Jihye's reaction to Han Sooyoung's hand grabbing her shoulder was
vicious, to say the least. However, the latter didn't let go. Her dogged hand
swept back Lee Jihye's bangs, wiped the thick teardrops away, then she
continued with what she wanted to say.

"The Black Flame Dragon, Uriel, the Maritime War God, they are not dead
yet."
"How, how do you know that??"

"I can sense them. It's really faint, but I can definitely feel they are still
alive.
Also…"

Her voice sounded cold yet caring, to the point and didn't waver once. Only
Han Sooyoung could have spoken in such a voice.

"Wipe your tears away and take a good look. Look at the state of the
bastard you're choking right now."

The stupefied-looking Lee Jihye had dropped her head, only to raise it back
up again. And for a very long time, she hesitated and stared at me. I didn't
try to avoid that gaze.

"But, why…?" Lee Jihye's voice was trembling. "Why are you crying too,
ahjussi…?"

Her hands grabbing hold of my collars let go. Han Sooyoung quickly seized
that opening to dig in and punched me in the face.

"Get your shit together, you idiot! Now, give us a proper explanation! You
probably didn't come here without a concrete plan, right?"

If one were to flip her words around, then she was threatening to really kill
me if I caused such an event without thinking too much about it.

She continued with her questioning. "There is a way to save our Sponsors,
right? Right…??"

⸢There was no such method.⸥

Lights from many, many Constellations were turned off in the <Star
Stream>'s pitch-black night sky. However, you'd still be able to spot a few
that flickered away when taking a closer look. They were stars with lights
faintly discernible only after staring at them for a very long time.
⸢Kim Dokja hated the Constellations. He had never forgotten that emotion,
not even for a second.⸥
"…Right. I…"

⸢However, this world's scenario managed to change such a Kim Dokja.⸥

I looked at the [Final Wall]. The wall where all the 'Stories' were recorded
on.

The wall that existed solely to record the 'One Single Story' that all the
Dokkaebis longed for.

"But, it might be too late now."

All this tragedy existed to be recorded on that wall.

No, hang on. Maybe it was the opposite.

All these events happened because 'it was already recorded on that wall'.

"However, it's also possible."

Changing what happened already was impossible. It should not be possible
to revive those whose souls had been extinguished, and get rid of the pain
as if nothing happened. Indeed, it shouldn't be possible at all to save a
worldline that had been destroyed already.

Because the damn Probability of this world wouldn't permit that. Because
such a story would be the same as the 'squared circle' Han Sooyoung
mentioned earlier.

⸢However, what if such a thing was possible…?⸥

⸢What if a 'wall' that could bring the 'squared circle' to reality existed in this
world?⸥
I squeezed the core gripped in my hand tightly.

[Main Scenario #99 – 'Enemy of the Story' has been cleared!]

[Calculation for the completion reward has begun.]

[Currently, no Great Dokkaebis exist to take the role of calculating the
reward.]

[Reward calculation is being delayed.]

…

…

…

[You have earned the qualification to meet the 'King of Stories'.]

The blinding wall opened its jaw for us.
        Chapter 505: Ep. 97 - The star that can't be seen, II


[<Star Stream> wishes to name your last Story.]

[You are now given the choices of Final Story.]

[Nebula <Kim Dokja's Company>'s epic has become the final candidate for
the 'One Single Story'!]

[Stars that will be born in <Star Stream> will extol your Story!]

While reading the messages popping up one after the other, we took stock
of our current situation. Although they all still looked shellshocked, we
simply couldn't afford to stop here. Gong Pildu suddenly raised his voice.

"…Will the main scenario end with this?"

Unlike how it usually was, no new scenario was issued even though a main
scenario had come to an end. What entered our ears instead was a system
message.

[<Star Stream>'s main scenario system has entered the closing sequence.]
It was a message none of us had ever heard before.

Curtains were finally closing on the vast world of scenarios. We all formed
blank expressions, not knowing what to say.

"If this thing ends… what will happen to the world?"

Gong Pildu stared at the Wall with a hollow expression. Countless texts
blooming on the Wall must've sensed his gaze, because they repeatedly
scattered only to reform again. Some among those texts were even related
to Gong Pildu himself.

⸢The man who lost his family at the start of the scenario.⸥

He seemed to be deeply fatigued, somehow. I could've been mistaken, but I
thought there was something welling up in his eyes, too. I hesitated for a
bit, before addressing him.

"There is one more being remaining, the one that controls all the scenarios."

"That bastard… has to be killed off, too?"

"If you're too exhausted, it's fine to remain here."

"After coming all this way?" Pure rage bubbled up on Gong Pildu's face. "I
can never forgive that bastard. It won't nearly be enough for me to rip him
apart into little pieces."

It felt as if I was the one being attacked the moment I peered into his eyes.
At the same time, I thought I saw the Stories of regular people who died
during the scenarios reflected behind his back.

⸢And all those Stories seemed to blame Kim Dokja.⸥

"That bastard took away my family and my lands. I, I must definitely…!!"

Gong Pildu spoke up to there, and keeled over as bloody foams bubbled out
of his mouth. Lee Seolhwa quickly supported him and felt his pulse.
"…The damage to his Incarnation Body is extensive."

During the battle inside the cabin, Gong Pildu protected the companions
along with Lee Hyunsung. His proud [Armed Fortress] was seriously
damaged. The Status of his sponsor, the Defense Master, could barely be
felt, too. It was quite likely that this was as far as he could go.

"I'll take him with us. He also has the right to witness the end, after all."

"Please take care of him."

Lee Seolhwa activated her unique skill [Stretcher], and placed Gong Pildu
on the bed made out of magic net.

In the meantime, both Lee Jihye and Jung Heewon regained their energy
and stood up from their spots.

"Let's go, Dokja-ssi. Whatever happens, we should still try to see the end, at
least."

I was ashamed by the fact that Jung Heewon had to say those words.
Because she must've been the one to resent me the most among our group.

She lightly tapped me on the shoulder.

"Don't think about anything unnecessary. My sponsor told you, right? We
only got to see that far in that story."

"…"

"Meaning, no one knows what will happen next."

Her voice contained an icy determination. Lee Hyunsung put Lee Gilyoung
on his back and nodded his head after hearing her.

"Heewon-ssi is correct."

It was the same story for both Shin Yoosung and Lee Jihye.
⸢Even though so many things happened, the companions still believed in
Kim Dokja.⸥
Could my companions see that sentence?

Was it okay for someone like me to read that sentence?

Tsu-chuchuchu…!

[Will you enter the interior of the 'Final Wall'?]

A new message floated up soon afterwards.

The Probability's sparks whipped about madly above the Wall. With those
sparks as the center, the Wall seemed to retract; letters above the white
surface rescinded and a small entrance we could go through was generated.

Han Sooyoung asked in a suspicious voice.

"…Do you have a plan for what's beyond here?"

Greyish fog filled up the inside of the entrance. It was a veil of fog I was
familiar with – from the sentence that I had memorised after reading them
over and over again.

⸢Finally, Yoo Joonghyuk who lost everything was looking beyond the fog.⸥

This passageway was the very same one that the 1863rd turn's Yoo
Joonghyuk had passed by.

"…You said that what happens next isn't even mentioned in the 'Ways of
Survival'."

I nodded my head.

The only remaining thing was to enter. Although, my last concern was…
"…Please go ahead. 'Zarathustras' can't go any further. We've been
informed that we don't have the qualifications to enter."

Unlike Anna Croft, her subordinates 'Zarathustras' didn't possess all that
many Stories connected to <Kim Dokja's Company>. They looked at me
with sorrowful eyes for a little while, then silently moved out of the way
and created a path.

[Incarnation, 'Selena Kim' has accepted her ■■.]

[Incarnation Selena Kim's ■■ is 'Unreachable Dream'.]

– Please, take care of Anna.

Selena Kim's voice was transmitted through voice projection. I slowly but
deeply nodded my head and turned around to leave.

Footsteps belonging to my companions could be heard coming from behind
me. My companions had become one constellation; my companions, who
didn't emit light in the same direction as everyone else.

"Let's get going."

⸢Even then, everyone here all wished to confirm the conclusion.⸥

It was right then, a shadow suddenly appeared drifting around in the fog
before us. Anna Croft's blonde hair spread in the air. However, the one
controlling her body wasn't her.

Yoo Joonghyuk focused on the Wenny King's movements while tightly
grasping the hilt of the [Black Heavenly Demon Sword].

"Are you thinking of trusting the Wenny King?"

He hadn't lowered his wariness since a while ago, and continued to emit
intense bloodlust towards the Wenny King at every opportunity he could
find.
I also didn't like the Wennys. They tried to kidnap Biyoo, and even tried to
pull a fast one on me back in the Demon Realm, too.

"I don't trust him. We're just entering a temporary alliance, that's all. We
made a deal in the past."

"A deal?"

I didn't offer up a detailed explanation. Because the one who could do it for
me made his appearance, that's why.

[Looks like you don't trust me at all, regressor.]

Seeing the Wenny King speak through Anna Croft's mouth, I couldn't help
but think that this had to be the worst combination imaginable. To think
that two individuals Yoo Joonghyuk hated had been combined into one…

Yoo Joonghyuk wordlessly sent his magical energy to the [Black Heavenly
Demon Sword]. He was getting ready to strike down at the slightest hint of
provocation.

[I heard the story from other Wennys. It seems that you've cut off the lumps
of my children.]

"And do you wish for yours to be cut off, too?"

The Wenny King cackled as if he was deeply amused.

"What's so funny?"

[I truly enjoy your unnecessary aloofness. You were the same back in the
Demon Realm and in Murim. I had been spending a really long, boring time
there, but things became rather entertaining all thanks to you.]

"One more word, and I shall cut off your lumps."

"Oiii, Yoo Joonghyuk."
Yoo Joonghyuk seemed to be more fired up than usual, so I quickly stopped
him. Nothing good would come about by getting into a scuffle with the
Wennys here.

Why did it happen, though? His unfocused aura was different from his
usual self. Maybe his thoughts had gotten complicated now that the end was
upon us.

The Wenny King alternated his gaze between Yoo Joonghyuk and me
before opening his mouth.

[I see that you two are good friends.]

Even as the scary glare in Yoo Joonghyuk's eyes was rekindled, the Wenny
King carried on.

[I too had someone like that once upon a time. He used to love the stories a
lot, just like the 'Demon King of Salvation' over here.]

"I don't want to hear about your sob story."

[We carried out the scenarios together. We overcame many close shaves
and fought against the absolute beings that ridiculed us. We compiled
Stories to create more Stories, and after compiling Giant Stories, we even
created an epic yarn, too. And with that epic, we eventually reached the
'Final Wall'.] …The 'Wenny King' had reached this 'Final Wall' before?

This information never appeared in the 'Ways of Survival'.

[You probably never heard about it. That story doesn't even remain as a
Story anymore. Maybe someone like the 'Apocalypse Dragon', who had
gone insane from the repeated history, might be able to barely recall it.]

"…There was <Star Stream> even back in your day?"

[Back then, it was called a slightly different name. The name <Star Stream>
was given only after we saw the end of this world.]
Here was a being that saw the 'end of the world' before us.

What was the ■■ for them back then? And just what happened back then
that caused this creature to become the 'Wenny King' and drift around the
scenarios?

[And that bastard is now called the 'King of the Stories'.]

The sound of something collapsing heavily could be heard from beyond the
fog.

[That's why I'm looking forward to your last verses. I'm genuinely curious.
Curious, on who'd end up as the final winner of this scenario…]

Tsu-chuchuchu…

The fog before us began rumbling loudly.

[Looks like it's time to go meet my old friend.]

Along with those words, all traces of the Wenny King vanished. However,
his message continued to be heard.

[It'll be wise for you to start moving soon. Before you all get devoured, that
is.]

…Devoured??

"Ahjussi!!"

Lee Jihye following us from behind suddenly cried out and disappeared
through the floor. And then, hands-like things suddenly emerged from the
floor and nearby walls to grab and yank at our arms and legs.

"Jihye-yah!!"

[Character 'Lee Jihye', has become a part of the great story.]
Jung Heewon reached out towards Lee Jihye being sucked into the floor.
However, it was too late. Even Jung Heewon herself was being sucked in
now.

Walls transformed into bottomless quicksand and swallowed her up.
[Character 'Jung Heewon', has become a part of the great story.]

"Heewon-ssi!"

I watched Lee Hyunsung dash towards Jung Heewon, but that only made
me lose my bearing.

Did something like this happen back in the 'Ways of Survival'? Just what
the hell…?!

⸢Yoo Joonghyuk was the only person crossing this passage back in the
'Ways of Survival'.⸥
I had overlooked that simple fact. Not even once did Yoo Joonghyuk try to
cross this passage with these many people before.

"Everyone, gather around me!"

Unfortunately, it was too late by then. Lee Hyunsung, Lee Seolhwa, Gong
Pildu, and even Yoo Sangah and the kids, were all snatched up by the hands
of the walls and got absorbed.

[Character, 'Shin Yoosung', has become a part of the great story.]

[Character, 'Yoo Sangah', has become a part of the great story.]

My heart was racing nonstop. The word 'Character' especially got on my
nerves amidst all those messages.

"Han Sooyoung! Yoo Joonghyuk!"

He was already half-sucked into the floor by now. There wasn't even
enough time to resist.
"Step back!"

The sword wind Yoo Joonghyuk fired pushed me back. I barely managed to
evade the texts trying to grab my ankles.

[Character 'Yoo Joonghyuk', has become a part of the great story.]

Eventually, even Yoo Joonghyuk was taken away. Han Sooyoung was the
only one remaining. However, one of her arms was already being
swallowed up.

"Hurry, this way…!"

I used every ounce of my strength to pull her out. The effects of the [Way
of the Wind] permeated into my feet and the explosive forward momentum
wrapped around me.

['Final Wall' is exposing its greed over your epic!]

['Final Wall' is looking at the individual not yet included in its story!] Tsu-

chuchuchut…!

Han Sooyoung's body was trembling as if she was having a seizure.

⸢The only other person who wasn't a 'Character' besides himself was Han
Sooyoung.⸥
I ran as hard as I could. Unfortunately, the Wall's pursuit proved to be
persistent. What's worse, I had no clue where exactly I was running off to.
Front, back, side, up; I looked everywhere, but couldn't see a place I could
escape to.

Poof.

Along with the sensation of stepping on air, the ground vanished. This was
the same tactic that took away Lee Jihye and Jung Heewon. The Wall was
now sucking me in, too. Han Sooyoung and I began falling as if this was an
endless emptiness. The grey fog rushed in with every heavy breath I took,
constricting me.

⸢Kim Dokja was scared of the stories he didn't know.⸥

Texts with incredible density interfered with my breathing. I couldn't
recognise this Story due to the inordinate amount of letters. As the term
implied, the 'Great' Story was crushing me.

I struggled and flailed about trying to escape from this Story somehow.
However, the more I struggled, the more this vague fear dug into me. It felt
like everything inside me was emptying out.

Texts were escaping from the tip of my fingers. Stories that formed the
basis of me were disappearing. It was then.

⸢The Stories that constitute you exist through what you see, experience, and
feel.⸥
That one sentence got stuck by my fingertip. That was the 'Story control'
method Yoo Hoseong taught me back in the 'Isle of Reincarnators'.

⸢Let them know that you're looking at them, too.⸥

I grabbed hold of that sentence. When I did, the things that constituted the
Story along with that sentence began popping up inside my head.

⸢Kim Dokja calmly controlled his breathing.⸥

I decided to stop my escape attempt from this vast cosmos of texts. Stories
opened their maws wide as if to swallow me up in one go.

⸢These things wouldn't even exist if I don't look into them.⸥

There was no need to fear them. These were just Stories.
Tsu-chuchuchu…!

I stared into the words rushing in. I didn't even blink and glared at those
texts, to let them know that I was reading them right here.

Right next second, the words scattered around like fog, before coalescing
together again.

⸢In order to not get devoured by the Story, one had to become a
'dokja/reader'.⸥
As if to express their gratitude towards the one discovering them, the
sentences began circling around my feet. Soon, they became footholds for
me to walk on.

⸢A person who loves Stories yet still reads on without getting drunk in
them.⸥

⸢Only then will the Stories become viable means to oppose the formless
emptiness.⸥
My falling stopped. I lightly stepped on the sentences piling up below my
feet. They were not the texts from the 'Ways of Survival'.

⸢"I'm Dokja."⸥

⸢I used to introduce myself to other people in this manner, but that would
lead to the following misunderstanding.⸥
Even then, they seemed somewhat familiar to me.

While reading those sentences, I walked forward a step at a time. Some
among them were stories that I already knew, some that I didn't, and some
whose memories had faded now.

⸢When Kim Dokja was young, he began thinking about a certain thing.⸥
The young me was scribbling something on a notebook. It was a
wellorganised power balance sheet of the 'Way of Survival', as well as
hidden piece locations. And also…

⸢What's this? I wouldn't have done it that way.⸥

I began cooking up my own methods of conquering the 'Ways of Survival'.
⸢What an idiot. You should've conquered that pitch-black place like this.
The item you'll need is…⸥

⸢Getting the ampoules from the laboratory is the core of the theatre
dungeon's conquest plan, and…⸥

⸢You definitely need to get the Ganpyeongui at this point in time. It's
even more important than getting the Four Yin Demonic Beheading
Sword.⸥ The sense of deja vu grew stronger as I took more steps forward.

⸢There's no other choice but to kill all the Constellations. There's no other
way at this point.⸥

⸢To become stronger without regressing…⸥

⸢As I thought, the best route is this. The first 'Giant Story' must be earned in
the Demon Realm.⸥
The sentences my younger self wrote now illuminated the path I was
walking on. I began thinking as I tread on those words.

⸢To save everyone…⸥

Maybe, this path began long before the time I could recall?

Ttuk.
Eventually, the sentences were cut off.

And a small, white door waited for me where the words had ended.

It was the exact same door the 1863rd turn's Yoo Joonghyuk had opened.

⸢The [Epilogue] to the all the stories he hadn't read yet was beyond that
door.⸥

I wordlessly stared at the doorknob.

⸢Just to turn this doorknob…⸥

The entire story that began with Yoo Joonghyuk flitted in and out of my
head. And in this very moment, that one question I had from a very long
time ago, but never spoken out aloud, floated back up to the fore.

⸢What kind of an epilogue did tls123 want to write for the 'Ways of
Survival'?⸥
I reached out towards the door's handle, only to unwittingly look behind
me. There was a path made out of vast Stories. This sight felt bizarrely alien
now that I looked at it from this far.

⸢I stared at that road for a long time.⸥

Then, opened the door.
       Chapter 506: Ep. 97 - The star that can't be seen, III


⸢The universe in the beginning was 'one'.⸥

When I regained my wits, that sentence was floating in front of my eyes. I
couldn't tell whether that was just a line of text, or a memory of something
taking possession of the sentence.

⸢The 'one' was truly omniscient and omnipotent in this world. Because the
'one' was the universe itself, and the universe was the 'one'. The 'one' was
perfect. And it was perfectly alone.⸥

Right after that, a blinding explosion went off.

⸢And that's how 'one' became 'two'.⸥

That was the first explosion. People, later on, would call it the Big Bang.

⸢'One' was no longer omnipotent afterwards.⸥
An incredible dizziness assaulted me, and I fell down on my hands and
knees.

This was inside the door, the deepest part of the 'Final Wall'. The wall didn't
try to suck me in anymore. Maybe, I had already been sucked in.

I looked around to discover Han Sooyoung collapsed on the floor. I placed
her unconscious figure on my back, and stood up. I raised my head to
realize that Anna Croft was now standing before me.

[…Looks like you saw the First Story.] The Wenny King currently
possessing her was smiling in my direction. [I made the exact same face as
you when I first saw it, too.]

I didn't reply. I had no time to shoot breezes with him like this. Where did
my companions disappear to?

Maybe he read my anxiousness, because he continued to speak to me.

[Aren't you curious? Why does this thing called 'Story' exist in this world?]

"…I didn't come here to discuss such things with you."

[However, it'll be impossible to go any further without talking about it first.
It was the same for me.]

I could hear Han Sooyoung's breathing coming from my back. Her breaths
soon became a Story and unfolded before me. The world seemed to distort,
and a passage decorated with display shelf-like things appeared next.

⸢The universe became 'two', and the 'one' grew lonely.⸥

⸢Things that weren't necessary back when there was only 'one' began
appearing.⸥
Figurine-like beings were engaged in combat above these display shelves.
The history of 'scenario' that began in countless planets, including Earth,
was on display right there.

⸢The 'Good and Evil' was created to differentiate the two.⸥

Agares and Metatron were bitterly fighting each other. That was the 'Great
War of Saints and Demons', where angels and demons, even as they bled
crimson-coloured Stories, never compromised on their ideals.

⸢The 'communication' was invented to soothe the two's loneliness.⸥

Citizens were battling demons within the walls of the [Industrial Complex].
And I saw Jang Hayoung trying to dissuade this battle between those walls.

⸢And 'Samsara', a wish to return to when it was 'one', was created.⸥

Next up was Sakyamuni gently stroking a certain Incarnation Body trapped
within a water tank inside his chamber. It was the Incarnation Body
belonging to the now-dead Tang Sanzang, who loved Sakyamuni once upon
a time.

⸢However, 'two' could never go back to being 'one'.⸥

All the Stories I had been reading were displayed here.

These battles were repeating themselves within the predetermined
conclusion.

Han Sooyoung must be slowly waking back up, because I could feel her
tremble a little.

⸢The 'two' needed something to connect the divided two. An existence that
would live through all the Stories, and act as a proxy to their good and evil,
their communications, and their Samsara.⸥

My feet came to a dead stop just then.
⸢The 'Character'.⸥

I couldn't leisurely watch on anymore.

The 'Wenny King' walking next to me like a ghost spoke up. [It's such a
malicious joke, don't you agree?]

He cackled before hiding within my shadow.

The number of individuals appearing on the display cabinet grew. Some
were simply put on display like some plastic figurines, while there were
some still trapped in the wall with only their faces exposed as if moulding
hadn't been completed yet.

"…Jihye!! Yoosung-ah!!"

I recognised those faces.

I tried so hard to free them from there, but the more I struggled, the deeper
their faces sunk into the wall.

I ran along the display shelf. Lee Seolhwa, Gong Pildu, Lee Gilyoung, Yoo
Sangah… everyone from <Kim Dokja's Company> was here. And also…

"…Yoo Joonghyuk."

Yoo Joonghyuk's figure revealed itself from beyond the thick fog. His
entire body was currently tied up with copper-coloured chains, his eyes
closed and unmoving.

And a faint silhouette could be spied below him.

⸢That was none other than the 'King of the Stories'.⸥

The fog obscured his face, so I slowly walked over to him.

[You have encountered the 'King of the Stories'!]
[End of the main scenario is here!]

There never was much info on the Dokkaebi King within the pages of the
'Ways of Survival'. However, not appearing in the novel didn't mean that no
information regarding him could be found elsewhere.

Because I knew of those that had met him already.

⸢However, none of them mentioned what the 'Dokkaebi King' looked like.⸥

At the end of the 'Final Fog', the 'King of the Stories' was waiting for me.

[The 'King of the Stories' is smiling at you.]

And then…

['The Fourth Wall' is intensely trembling!]

I had to doubt my own eyes next.

⸢This was from a very old memory.⸥

The head-pounding dizziness assaulted me as my vision shook greatly.

⸢There is no way. No, such a thing is simply impossible.⸥

[Finally we meet, the apostle of ■■… No, wait.]

Small bits of sparks danced before my eyes and removed the filtering
altogether.

[Oh, the 'apostle of eternity and epilogue'.]

⸢Kim Dokja roared out like a thunderclap and rushed forward.⸥

I didn't even have enough time to think. I grabbed him by the scruff of his
neck. I wanted to choke him to death right here, right now – but for some
reason, my hands wouldn't listen to me.
⸢That man was tall. He always looked down on his son from high above.⸥

This man, he couldn't be here.

⸢The man with an always-flushing face. Always drunk, and because of that,
the son never really met gazes with this man. No, the son prayed that their
gazes would never meet each other's.⸥
[Dokja-yah. Kim Dokja.]

⸢The world would turn into a nightmare if their gazes met, that's why.⸥

[I really did come up with a splendid name for you, didn't I?] Tsu-

chuchuchuchut!!

I threw out a punch with all my might.

⸢His height that seemed so tall back then, was now about the same.⸥

The time seemed to be slowing down.

⸢Those protruding veins only served to make him look emaciated, instead.⸥

Tsu-chuchuchut!

⸢The son thought he could win now. He was not a powerless little child
anymore.⸥
The fist I swung with all my power was stopped right before his nose.

Sparks exploding brightly illuminated the man's face. The 'Dokkaebi King',
his eyes glowing bright blue, smiled like a devil at me while standing there.

[What do you think you're doing to your own father?]
I roared out. I was not cognizant of what I was saying nor even doing at that
moment. [The Fourth Wall] was crumbling down.

"Kim Dokja! Get yourself together!!"

And then, a voice could be heard.

There was this warmth still pressing onto my back. Han Sooyoung's Story
was being transmitted to me.

⸢This was the dokja/reader's Story.⸥

The story that protected me.

"The Fourth Wall! What are you doing! Wake up!!"

['The Fourth Wall' is strongly revitalised!]

['The Fourth Wall' is growing as thick as an impregnable fortress!]

It was then the expression on the 'Dokkaebi King' changed.

[You're obstructing me?]

It seemed that he was now looking not at me, but the thing inside me.

[The last fragment of the Final Wall, your duty is now over.]

['The Fourth Wall' is viciously growling!]

[You have safely reached the end of the entire story. Along with the
successor that meets all the requirements.]

[The Fourth Wall] was speaking from inside me.

⸢Th at is for Kim Dok ja to de cide⸥

I gradually regained my calm while listening to those words.
⸢This creature before me was not my father.⸥

The memories shared with my mother became a Story and flowed right
before my eyes. Her memories got swallowed up by [The Fourth Wall]. Her
sentences floated up above that wall and tried to speak to me.

⸢He died on that day.⸥

"…You are not my father."

[How can you be so sure?]

"Stop with your pranks. It's impossible for you to be my father,
Probabilitywise."

[Probability, is it? Hahah, I've no excuses after hearing that. I thought it'd
be the most natural thing to see this face at this point in time.]

The Dokkaebi King smiled even as I continued to grab him by his scruff.
His face then began transforming.

[In that case, how about this face?]

He morphed into my mother's appearance, and then…

[These faces aren't too bad, either.]

And then, he even changed into Persephone and Hades.

I swung my fist one more time, but my whole body was flung away in the
opposite direction as powerful sparks danced in the air.

"Show me those faces one more time and I'll kill you."

[Fufu. I guess my pranks have indeed crossed the line. My bad.]

"Change back! Show me your true appearance!"
[I'd love to, but I can't. I have already forgotten what my real appearance is
like a long time ago. I lived my life as far too many different beings.]

He maintained Hades's appearance and slowly blinked his eyes. When he
did, Stories began leaking out from behind him. Stories that were somewhat
familiar.

⸢On that day, the world's most ancient demon ascended in awe.⸥

[I was a king of a Demon Realm once upon a time.]

⸢All the Archangels of <Eden> ceaselessly worshipped him.⸥

[I was also the messiah to the Archangels.]

Cold sweat trickled down my back.

These Stories, they were stories that I had heard before.

The vanished great Demon King, the messiah of Eden – I also sensed
founding Stories of other myth-grade Nebulas from him, too. <Emperor>'s
Pangu, <Olympus>'s Cronus… Hairs began standing up all over my body.

This existence before my eyes was on a completely different realm
compared to every other Myth-grade Constellation I had encountered so far.

⸢The oldest existence in this world.⸥

I remained tense while gripping the Unbroken Faith even tighter.

"All of those things, they were your doing? Even <Eden>, the <Demon
Realm>, all of them? Is that what you want to tell me?"

My words prompted the 'Dokkaebi King' to vigorously shake his head.

[No. In the end, everything is simply reincarnated from the old stories. We
are all nothing more than a part of the massive tale reincarnating itself.
You, me.]
He was now staring at the flow of <Star Stream> in the distance. The sky
where stars had fallen was spreading out in emptiness. That sky resembled
a huge wall.

The [Final Wall], that seemingly stretched on forever.

This world was, in the end, a story taking place within that vast, endless
wall. I saw faint stars falling down like ink spilt during scribbling. So many
stars had fallen by now, yet there were still some remaining up there.

Stars that couldn't be seen, unless one took a closer look. I remembered the
names of those stars. And that reaffirmed what I came here to do.

"Release my companions."

[They are just the means to an end that served their purpose. What meaning
is there for you if I released them?]

"…They are my everything."

The 'Dokkaebi King' slowly approached me.

Han Sooyoung used [Midday Tryst] to talk to me as she stood at my side.

 –         Kim Dokja.

She tightened the tattered bandages around her arm and began rousing up
the last bits of her fighting spirit.

 –         I'll count to three. We subdue him together on the signal. One,
 two…

[Stop whispering amongst yourselves. I can hear you clearly.]

We stood there frozen stiff and exchanged glances.

All settings found in <Star Stream> had to go through the 'Dokkaebi King'
first. In other words, there was no sentence in this world that he couldn't
read.
Han Sooyoung and I gripping my hilt tightly glared at him. Now that our
plan had been outed, whatever we did couldn't be called a sneak attack
anymore.

The 'Dokkaebi King' stared at us as if he was greatly amused, before slowly
extending his hand towards me.

[The successor of the stories. Only you have arrived here at the perfect
timing.]

"…Wha? Son of a bitch, can't you see that I'm also…!"

Along with the 'Tsu-chuchuchut' noise, Han Sooyoung's voice disappeared.
Trapped inside what looked like a water tank, she began pounding on the
transparent walls surrounding her.

[You have cleared all the main scenarios!]

[You will be recorded in the cosmos-spanning unified <Star Stream>.]

Accompanying the system messages was a sudden rise in the Status of my
existence.

[You've already shown the world such a cool Story, so how come you're
still stuck in the old-school mentality? You are in possession of the noble
wall's fragment, so I need to ask why you can't detach yourself from this
world and watch it from afar?]

The owner of the voice seemed to be criticising me. His awe of all these
stories could clearly be felt within the depths of that very voice.

He gazed at the wall near his position. No, more correctly, he seemed to be
imagining a certain something beyond the wall itself.

[There is no meaning in the things you treasure. This world is simply a
story dedicated to the great, noble existence. Everything in this world is
nothing more than a fleeting daydream to the noble existence.] The great,
noble existence's daydream, was it?

"Is the [Final Wall] recording the dreams of that 'existence'?"

[Correct.]

I figured out who that existence was. The instigator of all these tragedies.

I recalled the 'First Story' I heard when entering this place.

⸢The universe in the beginning was 'one'.⸥

The first 'one'.

The existence who regressed Yoo Joonghyuk, and also gave birth to all the
'myths' in this world.

"Is that bastard tls123?"
       Chapter 507: Ep. 97 - The star that can't be seen, IV


[tls123?]

The Dokkaebi King's expression as he murmured to himself looked rather
strange. Bluish sparks were dancing on top of his lips that trembled as if he
was suffering from some kind of lag.

I changed my question.

"I'm asking if that guy is the author of this world."

The Dokkaebi King tilted his head before replying.

[Rather than an author, you could say that the 'Oldest Dream' is much
closer to being a reader. It's not an existence that writes stories for
someone else. It's lazy and can be quite greedy.] The 'Oldest Dream' isn't
'tls123'?

If that's true, then who had been sending me the text files? The author
responsible for writing the novel I had read for over ten years, just who…
[You seem to be quite curious about the beginning of everything. However,
there is no meaning in trying to guess it. Doesn't matter how this world
came about, if there is no one to look at it, then it's the same thing as this
world not existing in the first place.]

The 'Dokkaebi King' stared at the <Star Stream>'s universe.

Blinding fragments of Stories rode on the stream of cosmos and flowed to
somewhere. Wherever his gaze stopped, the fragments repeatedly created
meanings only to lose them again.

I shifted my own gaze towards Yoo Joonghyuk suspended in the air with
chains wrapped around him. The empty <Star Stream>'s universe could be
seen behind him.

"There are things that exist without being seen."

The darkness in the universe was simply too wide and expansive. Its
vastness couldn't be crossed even with the speed of light. However, that
light would eventually arrive at its destination. Unable to see it didn't mean
nothing existed there. There were some things that emitted light where no
one was around.

⸢Faint starlights could be spied within the deep darkness of the space.⸥

Stars that rose up among the darkness. Stars that hadn't lost themselves yet.
The light from those stars became Stories – became sentences.

As those sentences were lowered on top of the Final Wall, the already-
closed story's door opened up again.

⸢The Abyssal Black Flame Dragon raised itself up as black blood trickled
out from its whole body.⸥
The moment I saw that sentence, I gasped out loud. The sentences soon
became video footages. Not too long afterwards, I saw the Abyssal Black
Flame Dragon raise its body up within the devastated battlefield.
Han Sooyoung was right; although he had lost the powers of the
'Apocalypse Dragon' after the ⸢Stage Transformation⸥ came undone, he was
still none other than the Black Flame Dragon.

⸢The Great Sage, Heaven's Equal floating in the skies of a different world
opened his tired eyes, and…⸥
The Great Sage was still engaged in a bitter struggle against the surviving
Constellations among the thunderclaps continuously going off.

⸢The final 'Great Good' was forging her way towards the end of the Good
and Evil.⸥
And Uriel, too; she was wielding her [Flames of Conflagration] to brighten
the darkened night skies of <Star Stream>…

[No. They do not exist if no one is there to see them.] Along

with that declaration, the Story footage scattered away.

I unknowingly reached out towards the Story scattering in vain.

The Dokkaebi King addressed me as if to mock my actions.

[There is nothing more futile than a story continuing on when no one's
reading it. Everything is created the moment they are observed. That's how
this universe has been constructed. If no one observes it, that Story can't
prove its existence.]

"…They definitely do exist."

[You still wish to see what happens next?]

[<Star Stream> is waiting for your decision.]
[The 'Final Wall' is waiting for your decision.]

The whole world was waiting for my answer.

"I…"


I hesitated with what to say. Han Sooyoung was still struggling within the
transparent walls.

⸢Will I be able to see what I wanted if this Story continues on?⸥

The 'Dokkaebi King' chuckled as if he could understand my hesitation.

The 'Final Wall' viciously shuddered about. Sentences were flowing above
the wall; as if it was providing a free service, the Story was lazily being
reproduced once more.

The Great Sage, Abyssal Black Flame Dragon, and Uriel began fighting
again.

⸢[…Hey, Flame Dragon-ah. Don't you dare to cry because your noona is no
longer here!]⸥

⸢[Keke. You're too quick to give up, Archangel! I still have one arm left that
I haven't used yet…!]⸥

⸢[But, it looks like that arm's been already sliced off, Black Flame Dragon.]⸥

⸢[This body of mine is perfectly fine without an arm, you dumb monkey!]⸥

The Good and Evil Constellations, and one that was neither, had gathered
together and were participating in the final battle.

While watching that spectacle, the Dokkaebi King addressed me.
[Your Story was truly amazing. Even the greatest Giant Story <Star
Stream> decided to side with you. Although many parts of your epic are
still unfilled, it's more than enough to stand as the foundation for the
'beginning' of a new world.]

"I didn't continue my story just to become something like that."

Stories were shining brightly behind the Constellations.

[Giant Story, 'Torch that Swallowed the Myth', is continuing on with its
storytelling!]

[Giant Story, 'Season of Light and Darkness', is continuing on with its
storytelling!]

[Giant Story, 'Liberator of the Forgotten Ones', is continuing on with its
storytelling!]

Those were our Giant Stories.

Stories weren't <Kim Dokja's Company>'s alone. Those that watched a
certain story for a long time would eventually emit the same light as the
story itself.

Constellations that had watched our story were now emitting the same light
as us.

[That is the end of the story you have created.]

⸢The Black Flame Dragon roared out viciously as its tail was cut off.⸥

⸢Uriel's broken conflagration was scattering away like ash.⸥

⸢The Great Sage, Heaven's Equal swung his broken Ruyi Jingu Bang
towards the Emperor's Constellations.⸥
The sentences written on the [Final Wall] were steadily losing their light. I
reached out towards that light.

Tsu-chuchuchuchut!

[You don't have the qualification to interfere with the 'Final Wall'.]

Pain rushed in from my fingertips. Sparks had scorched them pitch-black.

I gritted my teeth and shouted out. "I do have the right to control that story!
I have already cleared the main scenario."

The reward for the last scenario was the [Final Wall].

The 'Dokkaebi King' smiled. [Indeed, you do have the right. However, you
don't have the authority to change that story. Doing that will violate the
'Probability'.]

I stared at the sentences floating up on the Final Wall in real-time and
unleashed my true voice.

[…Stop that story, right now.]

All the Stories I had compiled until now were screeching out.

It wasn't too late. For Uriel, Black Flame Dragon, and the Great Sage, too.
They were still alive.

⸢[Hades, our ■■ is here.]⸥

It could be changed if it's right now. Those flowing sentences, they could be
fixed. I could grab the ends of the unfinished sentences and write something
else over them.

[Do you wish to save them?] The 'Dokkaebi King' asked. [I too was like
you once upon a time.]

The world he had been living in spread out from behind his back.
A planet I wasn't familiar with appeared. The scenario was underway on
that planet.

[I too had experienced horrible misfortunes. Tragedies that no single
existence could ever handle alone… By the time tragedies no longer felt
like tragedies to me, I found myself arriving in this place.]

Like a dam bursting open, a portion of the wall rained down on me. The
enormous story held in the Final Wall's embrace began flooding in towards
me.

Tsu-chuchuchuchuchuchu…!!

My mind felt like it was breaking down.

The stories that I already knew, and those that I didn't – Stories of the
whole universe was accumulating within my soul.

['The Fourth Wall' is violently resisting!]

['The Fourth Wall' is protecting your crumbling mind!]

The deaths I had experienced, and the deaths I had witnessed, were
overlapping with each other.

[Why did so many bad things happen to you?]

These stories that could easily be categorised as misfortunes began crushing
down inside my head.

[Do not get drunk in the Stories. Because this is merely one of the countless
world-lines you will create in the future, after all.]

Little by little, the emotion of sadness grew dull. Lamentation and despair,
too. All these emotions of sorrow were lumped into one clay-like mass, and
became something that couldn't be differentiated.
⸢So many misfortunes exist in this world, so is there a reason to feel sorrow
for every single one of them?⸥
Far too many things would grow stale eventually.

[You asked me who was the author of this world. You can be that
existence.] The 'Dokkaebi King' continued on. [If you wish to save them,
you must acknowledge the fact that everything you love has no meaning,
that the already-written Stories are simply illusions that can be changed
easily, and that they are just shadows of the great, noble daydream.]

Along with the Dokkaebi King's whisper, the Giant Story's Probability
began shifting.

[Become the architect of the brand new world, so that you can lead the next
generation of <Star Stream>.]

It was an incredibly tempting offer. If I accepted the Dokkaebi King's
suggestion and become the new architect of the <Star Stream>, then I'd be
able to save everyone. I'd get to save this world-line by rewriting all these
Stories.

And there was only one price to pay for that salvation.

⸢To give up loving that story.⸥

It was then, someone grabbed my hand. It was soaked in blood as if it had
been hitting something for a while.

It was a hand of someone who had been writing stories for a very long time.

"…Wake up, will ya? You are not a writer."

When did she escape from the transparent walls? Han Sooyoung spoke to
me while tearing the bandages with her teeth and wrapping them around her
fists again.
"No, you're a reader who promised to become the first reader of my novel."

At the end of her words, Stories exploded out from her entire figure.

[Story, 'Predictive Plagiarism', has begun its storytelling!] Tsu-

chuchuchuchut!

The sentences written on the [Final Wall] began growing restless.

[Incarnation, 'Han Sooyoung', is activating her attribute!]

"Even if there are lots of tragedies in the world, a sad thing is still sad, you
dumbass!"

The moment Han Sooyoung slammed down on the floor, a portion of Story
clinging onto the [Final Wall] tumbled down.

The Dokkaebi King's eyes grew wider. […The Wall, you dare…!]

He couldn't finish what he wanted to say.

Because someone's hand broke past the gap of the Wall where the Stories
had fallen down. It was a smooth, pale-skinned hand. A hand of a certain
someone who was more righteous and stronger than anyone I knew.

"She's right. Sorrow is still sorrow. Just like how happiness is still
happiness."

[The 'Wall that Decides Samsara' is distorting the gap in the 'Final Wall'.]

Yoo Sangah and her refreshing smile was escaping from the wall. Shin
Yoosung and Lee Gilyoung sticking close to her side could be seen, as well.

"Ahjussi!"

"Hyung!"
The rift Yoo Sangah created spread out wider and wider, and eventually,
even reached the wall on the other side. And the voices of people I knew
well could be heard coming from beyond that wall.

[The 'Wall of Impossible Communication' is raising the volume of the
inaudible voice.]

"De-mon-King-of-Sal-va-tion!!"

It was Jang Hayoung's voice. Along with crumbling noises, something
small popped out from the opposite wall's gap. It was Kyrgios.

"You pathetic fool. Did you get swallowed by a measly little Story?"

Soon afterwards, noises akin to a bulldozer flattening the ground resounded
out as a man-sized hole appeared in that gap.

[The 'Wall that Decides Good and Evil' is re-establishing the boundary
between Good and Evil!]

"Dokja-ssi! We came to find you!"

It was Lee Hyunsung and Jung Heewon.

The gap where my companions popped out rapidly recovered. Stories
recorded on the [Final Wall] were quickly filling it up. And the stories of
the stars began streaming again above the Wall.

"Dokja-ssi? Just what is…?"

"Hyunsung-ssi!! Over there!"

Jung Heewon's voice prompted all my companions to look at the [Final
Wall].

Stories of the Constellations still fighting inside the closed-off cabin was
being displayed there.
It was a hellish landscape where the dead easily outnumbered the living.
Uriel was kneeling down, and the Abyssal Black Flame Dragon was
collapsing. The Great Sage was fighting right until the very end to protect
them.

⸢[Stand up, maknae's story hasn't ended yet.]⸥

Sentences continued to just stream by.

At this rate, they would all die. Uriel, Abyssal Black Flame Dragon, even
the Great Sage, they would all die.

While still being subjected to intense pain, I reached out towards them. Pain
severe enough to almost completely take over my soul meant I couldn't
speak nor use my true voice.

⸢St op it⸥

['The Fourth Wall' is speaking in your stead.]

⸢St op th at st ory fr om con ti nuing on⸥

Companions dashed towards the [Final Wall].

Even if I didn't say anything to them, they already knew what they needed
to do. That story wasn't over yet. If only we could prevent the next
sentences from being written… Tsu-chuchuchuchu!

The violent aftermath's storm burned away at the companions. The
Dokkaebi King's power was suppressing them. Despite that, they didn't
stop. They endured against the blinding sparks dancing all over their bodies
and walked forward a step at a time in their own paces.

[All Stories of <Kim Dokja's Company> refuse to be recorded on the 'Final
Wall'!]

Stories we had created were speaking up now.
The 'Dokkaebi King' muttered as if he was replying to them. […I see. So,
you still wish to carry on with the scenario, is that it?]

He then stared at me as if he was rather amused by this. The moment I met
his gaze, goosebumps broke out all over my skin.

The 'Dokkaebi King' was the strongest existence in this world-line. No
Myth-grade Constellation could ever contend with this creature. Everything
within <Star Stream> was nothing more than some toys to him, after all.

With a single wave of his hand, the new scenario's contents floated on the
[Final Wall].

[<Star Stream>'s Final Scenario is being reset!]

[<Star Stream>'s Final Scenario will be…]

CRAAACK!

The streaming sentence came to a sudden stop.

A single sword was stabbing into the spot where the sentence had been cut
off. The aura containing the ominous power of Chaos was disrupting the
order of the sentence.

And then, a new sentence was generated, instead.

⸢The sole existence who had seen the end of this world after wandering for
the inordinate amount of time.⸥
The broken chains clanged in the empty air. Shadows from countless
regression turns were overlapping on top of a certain black coat as if
thousands of afterimages were gathering as one.

Right at that moment, I realized that my judgement was wrong.

⸢There is. One person, who did.⸥
A being who had already killed the 'Dokkaebi King' before.

[Story, 'Hell of Eternity', has begun its storytelling!]
   Chapter 508: Ep. 98 - Have you protected all that you were
                     supposed to protect, I


⸢A man named Yoo Joonghyuk was there.⸥

From the 0th turn all the way to 1863rd.

The history compiled by Yoo Joonghyuk overlapped with the ends of his
coat and whipped about wildly. As if to speak up for his Story, his words
floated up on the [Final Wall].

⸢"I will never forget. Not even one thing."⸥

[Story, 'Life and Death Companions's' special effect is currently in
activation!]

The Stories of the 3rd turn's Yoo Joonghyuk and the Secretive Plotter's
were resonating together.
Terrifyingly-resplendent powers of Chaos extended out from the tip of the
[Black Heavenly Demon Sword] buried deeply in the wall. The entire wall
seemed to grow restless from the disorderly aura of Chaos.

That was obvious, though; his story should be occupying the most
important part of this wall, after all.

The protagonist of the ⸢Three Ways to Survive a Destroyed World⸥, Yoo
Joonghyuk. This whole world couldn't even have gotten started without him
in the first place.

The Dokkaebi King spoke up as if to ridicule him.

[Oh, the puppet of the Oldest Dream. Your film is truly lengthy and
extensive.]

He sounded as if he already had predicted this appearance.

[No one could have accompanied you in your boring and unwieldy
story. Even if it was the 'Oldest Dream'.] Tsu-chuchuchut!

Yoo Joonghyuk slowly blinked, and the [Sage's Eye] was unleashed along
with a radiant golden light. His eye glowed brightly as if it had absorbed
every starlight existing in this world.

The owner of that eye spoke up.

【Have I come too early this time as well?】

The moment I heard the Secretive Plotter, I recalled a certain memory I saw
through the [Disconnected Film Theory]. A memory from the 1863rd turn
when he encountered the 'Dokkaebi King'.

⸢[Oh, dear unfortunate puppet. You have arrived too early. You can't
complete this universe.]⸥
The 'Dokkaebi King' tilted his head as that memory was transmitted to him
in real-time and muttered out. [Is that what happened? I see, the me of the
different world-line told you such a thing.]

【Your manner of speech is different from the one I met.】

[Just like how your regression turns aren't the same, I too am different.]

The 'Dokkaebi King' shrugged his shoulders as if he found something rather
amusing. Then, he yanked out Yoo Joonghyuk's [Black Heavenly Demon
Sword] and threw it back. The latter caught the flying sword with his bare
hand.

Only the sword scar remained on the [Final Wall] like a cursor. Soon,
though, the scar was gradually forced close, and sentences appeared on the
wall's surface.

⸢However, all these world-lines existed for the sake of treading the same
path.⸥
The 'Dokkaebi King' addressed Yoo Joonghyuk while sounding immensely
proud of this story. [The completion of the great, noble world is at hand.
You shall be able to fulfil your long-cherished wish now.] I knew very well
what Yoo Joonghyuk's wish was.

[Giant Story, 'Pilgrim of the Lonely Apocalypse', has begun its
storytelling!]

And that was to be freed from the chains of this horrifying curse. The
1863rd turn's Yoo Joonghyuk only lived on for that very purpose.

⸢However, his aim wasn't only that.⸥

The 'Secretive Plotter' turned his head to look at me. The meaning behind
that stare was rather obvious – he was telling me not to forget the deal I
made with him.
⸢"I shall kill the culprit of all these worlds."⸥

The 'Dokkaebi King' read that sentence floating above the [Final Wall] and
muttered out. [Kill, is it… How amusing. Do you still believe such a thing
is possible?]

【Of course, it is. And to make it possible…】

A pair of swords were now held in his hands.

The pitch-black blade of the [Black Heavenly Demon Sword] was now
joined by the chillingly-pale blade of [Splitting the Sky Sword].

【…You, bastard, need to disappear first.】

Along with a loud 'Ka-boom!', sparks began pounding the entire Wall as if
to break it down. An explosion of light occurred right afterwards, revealing
two figures locked in combat mid-air.

I saw the sturdy barrier-like wall of the Story surrounding the 'Dokkaebi
King'. He was an existence that used the oldest stories in this world as
weapons.

[Giant Story, 'First Messiah', has begun its storytelling!]

The Story in possession of the master of Nebula <Eden> was now
streaming out from his fingertips.

Sentences tightly coagulating scattered sacred light around. The light from
a great Constellation was now raining down on all the creations on the
ground. There was no doubt that anything touched by that Status would
melt away without a trace.

"Dokja-ssi!!"

Lee Hyunsung freaked out and hurriedly ran towards where I was. Forged
steel extending from his body spread out to protect me and the companions.
However, I simply shook my head.
"There is no need, Hyunsung-ssi."

"Pardon?"

Instead of a reply, I simply pointed to the front.

Even as the pulsing migraine continued to assault me, I didn't stop looking
at the view unfolding before my eyes.

Other stars were right. I too, might be nothing more than a mere
Constellation. Maybe, I endured over a dozen-plus years to witness this
spectacle.

[Exclusive attribute, 'Terror of the Stars', is activating!]

The brilliant radiance of the Dokkaebi King was splitting apart. A man
wearing a black coat was using two swords to defend against the light of
messiah capable of ending all evil in this world.

Tsu-zuzuzuzu…!

The Stories on the Wall melted down as the light touched them.

The 'Secretive Plotter', no, Yoo Joonghyuk, was walking forward step by
step while scything past that light. Sweat drops formed and dripped down
from the end of his chin, and the edges of [Black Heavenly Demon Sword]
and [Splitting the Sky Sword] grew increasingly dull from the light, yet he
didn't back away, not even once.

This caused the Dokkaebi King's expression to shift gradually.

[As expected. How about this, then?]

[Giant Story, 'First Evil', has begun its storytelling!]

The First Evil. That was the Story of 'Baal', the great Demon King who had
ascended to heaven. It was the absolute power that no Good in this world
could ever dare to oppose.
Now carrying the entirety of the Demon Realm on its back, the Dokkaebi
King dropped a pitch-black bolt of lightning on Yoo Joonghyuk. It was the
thunderclap from the corrupted heaven that no Archangel could withstand.

Lee Seolhwa cried out in the distance. "Joonghyuk-ssi!!"

Yoo Joonghyuk didn't avoid the incoming lightning bolt. No, he instead
raised his sword up like a lightning rod and faced the attack head-on. That
wasn't the end, however.

[The ⸢Stage Transformation⸥ is activating!]

Through the Stage Transformation, souls of Demon Kings were being
revived. There were some that died by our hands, while some were killed
off by the Apocalypse Dragon. All Demon Kings had been summoned to
the battlefield once more by the 'First Evil', and they were now howling
towards Yoo Joonghyuk and me.

Gu-waaaaaah!!

The weapons thrown by the Demon Kings were enveloped in the
malevolent magical energy, creating a purple-coloured storm of lightning. It
was so powerful that not even a Myth-grade Constellation would be able to
withstand it.

As the lightning flooded in, Yoo Joonghyuk's pale face was illuminated like
an evil apparition. He remained utterly calm even as the ominous storm of
Status raged on.

Just like someone who had been waiting for this very moment for a long
time.

【They are all bastards that I've killed before.】

[Exclusive attribute, 'Demon King Slayer', is activating!]
Yoo Joonghyuk leapt into the air and marched forward while deflecting the
incoming weapons. Everywhere his swords drew arcs, Stories of evil
crumbled down.

Like a monster born only to destroy, he swung his swords again and again.
Every single one of his sword strikes contained the resentment of the
worlds he had lived in.

Tsu-chuchuchuchut!

A huge rift was opening up in the corrupted skies of the Demon Realm.

The martial prowess powerful enough to dissolve the ⸢Stage
Transformation⸥ all by himself; the monster created by <Star Stream> was
now working towards destroying <Star Stream> itself.

Guwaaaaahk!

The blade of [Black Heavenly Demon Sword] cut off the head of the
revived 'Black-mane lion' Marbas, while the [Splitting the Sky Sword]'s
trajectory pierced past the heart of the 'Merciless hunter going against
heaven's will', Barbatos.

No Demon King could announce themselves as a king in front of this man.

The Dokkaebi King growled and shouted out as if he too had finally
acknowledged the threat. [You arrogant puppet…! You are not the
protagonist of this world-line!]

At the same time, the surrounding terrain began changing again.

[Giant Story, 'Star Stream Game System', has begun its storytelling!]

[The ⸢Stage Transformation⸥ is activating!]

The Wall's appearance was changing as if pixels were breaking apart.
Yoo Joonghyuk's figure seemingly grew smaller and smaller. The path he
needed to tread became a maze, as if he was now trapped within the 'maze
of Daedalus'. Even a monster with a large mouth chasing after him could be
seen, too. [Automated turrets] suddenly popping from here and there began
firing at him, while the ground his feet landed on morphed into a deep
quagmire.

It was as if he had entered a video game.

⸢Yoo Joonghyuk was laughing.⸥

[Exclusive attribute, 'Ruler of Games', is activating!]

He overcame the exceedingly-simple traps and flung himself forward like
an arrow. He tore the approaching monster's head off, then proceeded to
utterly destroy the maze's walls.

As if he already knew the method of clearing this world, he didn't even
permit a single attack to land on him.

[Applicable 'stage' cannot deal with the target's Status!]

The maze collapsed, and Yoo Joonghyuk was already standing right before
the Dokkaebi King. The latter's eyes were now dyed in the colours of
fluster.

【Is that all?】

It was only obvious why the 'Secretive Plotter' would win against the
'Dokkaebi King', however.

His whole life existed solely to fight and win against <Star Stream>. He
must've killed the Dokkaebi King in a similar manner during the portion of
the original I didn't get to read.

The latter was hastily retreating, his eyes now shifting towards me.
⸢What is Yoo Joonghyuk's weakness?⸥

The moment I read that sentence floating above the [Final Wall], the back
of my neck grew icy-cold.

The sights of a different world-line were projected onto the Dokkaebi
King's irises. Memories not from this world, but another world-line was
currently entering him.

He stopped looking at me as if he had found the right answer, and with a
chilling smile, shifted his gaze back to Yoo Joonghyuk.

[Oh, dear puppet. Is your mind as sharp as your sword, I wonder?]

[The 'King of Stories' is forcibly reproducing your Story!]

[The ⸢Stage Transformation⸥ is activating temporarily!]

[The similarity of the surrounding terrain is greatly enhancing the level of
stage's reproduction!]

Corpses of Demon Kings were strewn about everywhere. Yoo Joonghyuk
and his devastated expression standing on top of dead Constellations and
Demon Kings, was now slowly taking in the surroundings.

⸢The final world he used to live in was now unfolding in this place.⸥

There was no way he didn't recognise this 'world'. It was none other the
'Secretive Plotter' himself who had sent me to that place, after all.

⸢The 1863rd regression turn. The last world of the 'Ways of Survival'.⸥

The Dokkaebi King approached Yoo Joonghyuk like an encroaching
shadow as the latter dazedly looked up at the sky. No, he was no longer the
'Dokkaebi King'. With every step he took, his face and his silhouette
changed.
⸢The pale cheeks; two eyes gleaming like stars, were now looking at him.⸥

The white coat perfectly matching mine was dancing in the wind.

[Do you remember it? Back in the 33rd regression turn. What Lee Jihye
said after clearing the 40th scenario?]

A voice exactly the same as mine was now speaking up.

Sparks danced in the air as Yoo Joonghyuk's body froze up stiffly.

The Dokkaebi King easily reached out and grabbed hold of Yoo
Joonghyuk's collars before continuing on.

[Now, remember. You weren't always unhappy, right? In all the regression
turns, there were always moments of happiness, even if they didn't last
long.] Both the [Splitting the Sky Sword] and the [Black Heavenly Demon
Sword] trembled powerfully. And in the midst of the tremor, they drooped
powerlessly.

⸢The regression depression.⸥

That was the only weakness of Yoo Joonghyuk, who had repeatedly
regressed for a very long time.

[In the 173rd turn. You managed to protect Earth for a pretty long time.
You got to see Lee Jihye receive her high school diploma, and you even
got to see Lee Seolhwa smile with another's child in her arms.] The light in
Yoo Joonghyuk's eyes was wavering.

⸢It wasn't despair that could defeat Yoo Joonghyuk.⸥

⸢Small feather-like memories settled down inside his head one by one.⸥

The 'Dokkaebi King' was using the exact same method I relied on back
then.
⸢The breathing got harder, and the lungs were getting tighter.⸥

⸢A man drowning in water would sink even deeper under the surface from
the weight of a mere feather.⸥
I couldn't afford to idly watch on anymore. I shouted at Yoo Joonghyuk,
telling him to wake up, and not to fall for such an illusion.

However, my voice couldn't reach them as if a non-conductive barrier was
set up between us. And the 'Dokkaebi King' was smiling away, perhaps to
mock this entire story.

[Yoo Joonghyuk, have you protected all that you wanted to protect?]

Slowly, Yoo Joonghyuk's knees sank down.


I roused the Status of Stories. I needed to undo that ⸢Stage
Transformation⸥ right now, But, how should I… Grab.

There was a hand still tightly clutching mine. It was Han Sooyoung.

"That's not a battle you can interfere in."

"But, if he's left alone…!"

"…Even a star that can't be seen still emits light. You said that, right?"

…A star that can't be seen?

Her words made me look back at Yoo Joonghyuk once more.

His gaze being lowered had come to a stop. Blinding sparks were
completely enveloping him.

Tsu-chuchuchuchu…

Something was waking up his fading consciousness.
[Giant Story, 'Ones that Remember the Apocalypse', has begun its
storytelling!]

That was a Story I wasn't aware of.

As the sparks lessened gradually, several silhouettes revealed themselves.
Now that I took a closer look, Yoo Joonghyuk wasn't alone. No, four others
were standing beside him.

A tall man, a young man with blonde hair, a girl with a ponytail, and
finally…

【He couldn't protect anyone. That's why he now stands in this place.】

…An Archangel with blindingly-pure wings.


Astonishment quickly dyed the Dokkaebi King's expression.

The Story from the destroyed 999th turn was now burning brightly like the
conflagration of end times on the edges of the Archangel's blade.
【Because he believes there are still things left to protect.】
   Chapter 509: Ep. 98 - Have you protected all that you were
                    supposed to protect, II


The Dokkaebi King's brows quivered. The Stories from the 999th
regression turn were now looming before him.

The Stories discarded by <Star Stream> had begun telling their stories one
by one. They were waking Yoo Joonghyuk up from the depth of 'regression
depression'.

The 'Dokkaebi King' frowned deeply next. [Why are you here? Did you
not make a deal with me? You don't have a pretext to help him.]
Sentences began floating up above the [Final Wall].

⸢We made a deal with the Dokkaebi King, you see? If we destroy this
worldline, he will send us back. He will get in touch with your Sponsor, the
'Oldest Dream', and…⸥

Those were the words of the 999th turn Lee Jihye.
The 'Dokkaebi King' spoke once more. [It was I who summoned you all to
this world. Do you wish to be cast out of the world-line again? I ask you, do
you wish to taste the everlasting pain while wandering the horrifying gap
between dimensions without an end in sight?]

His words continued on as if to threaten them.

[This 'Yoo Joonghyuk' is the enemy you've been searching for. He's the
very culprit who destroyed your world-line, the one who thrust your Stories
into misery.]

There was a slight hint of agitation on the expressions of the 'Outer Gods'.

The 'Dokkaebi King' was right; just like how it was with Yoo Joonghyuk,
they too came this far to settle the score from the world they used to live in.

It was then, someone opened his mouth.

【What dogshit are you yapping on about? It's you, asshole, who dropped
us into this damn game, isn't it? If the scenarios didn't start in the first place,
would I even be standing here doing this shit?】

The 'Monarch of the Great Abyss', 999th turn's Kim Namwoon spoke with
a thuggish attitude. As if he had already finished making up his mind, truly
incredible power of Chaos was being unleashed from his entire figure.

[Giant Story, 'Delusional Design', has begun its storytelling!]

【Keuh-euh, it's been so long since we fought together.】

Kim Namwoon cackled as he undid the bandages from his hands.

He was a monster that even surpassed his own sponsor, 'Abyssal Black
Flame Dragon'. His pitch-black obsidian hand, filled to the brim with
thicker, more evil aura than anything Han Sooyoung could ever produce,
began sucking in the <Star Stream>'s night.

[Giant Story, 'Heart Sealing the Sorrow', has begun its storytelling!]
Right behind him, there was another man raising his huge figure up as well.
It was the 999th turn's Lee Hyunsung, the 'King of the Silver Heart'.

The completed 'Story metal' armour wrapped around his entire figure.

【Dokkaebi King, I'm excluded from that deal since I have never agreed to
it.】

Next up, the 'Master of the Sunken Island', 999th turn's Lee Jihye
summoned her gigantic battleship up in the air.

[Giant Story, 'Wanderer of the Eternal Horizon', has begun its storytelling.]

The atmosphere of the great ocean could be felt from her Twin Dragon
Sword.

【…】

She wordlessly unsheathed her sword and protected Yoo Joonghyuk's right
side. With that, the kings' decision became clear.

[Exclusive skill, 'Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint', is forcibly activating!]

Their thoughts and determination were being transmitted to me in full.

They all hated the 'Secretive Plotter'. However, that hatred was born out
from the deep-seated yearning they all held.

⸢No one treasured 'Yoo Joonghyuk' as much as them in any of the universes
out there.⸥
It was all thanks to Yoo Joonghyuk that they got to reach this far. To make
sure they would reach here, the 999th turn's Yoo Joonghyuk sacrificed
everything of him.

His arm was cut off, his legs were torn off, he lost both of his eyes, and in
the end, he even sacrificed his life, too.
⸢It was Yoo Joonghyuk who saved them, and killed them.⸥

They only lived for Yoo Joonghyuk; how could people like them ever
forget about him?

The wrath that had to be chained within the sinking island, the sorrow that
could only be endured after turning your heart into steel; the pain that could
only be forgotten by throwing yourself into the abyss.

[Giant Story, 'Flame of Eternity', has begun its storytelling!]

And the ache that could only be appeased by burning oneself away. They
repeatedly connected the film that threatened to be cut off at any time, and
eventually reached the final pages of the story.

【Step aside, Dokkaebi King. We only want one thing.】 The 999th turn's
Uriel, the 'Living Flame', spoke up. 【And that is to witness the 'end' we
didn't get to confirm back in our world-line.】

At the end of her words, the [Flames of Conflagration] moved.

Kwa-kwakwakwakwa!

The [Hellflame] that utterly devastated the N'Gai's Forest was now burning
the interior of the Wall. Almost at the same time, the right hand of the
999th turn's Kim Namwoon stabbed into the Dokkaebi King's thigh.

【Hahaha! Let's kill a Dokkaebi for a change!】

Kim Namwoon's madness-filled Stigma sliced past the time and space,
destroyed Stories, and aimed at the Dokkaebi King's figure.

The two exchanged the exact amount of Stories during their attacks and
defenses; weapons created from the delusion grew out of Kim Namwoon's
right arm, while Star Relics summoned by the 'Dokkaebi King' appeared
from several spots of the Wall and blocked off the former's weapons.

Tsu-chuchuchut!
The [Final Wall] was the location where the Dokkaebi King's Story could
display the greatest level of power. With the stage being what it was, the
direction of the battle soon flowed disadvantageously for Kim Namwoon.

⸢Oh, the spear that rips the oceans apart and draws the borders in the seas.⸥

⸢Oh, the arrow that shot down the eye of the sun.⸥

Sentences leaking out from several spots on the Wall soon became reality.

Shu-shushushuk!

The Star Relics matched the Dokkaebi King's signal and flew in, turning the
entire figure of the 'Monarch of the Great Abyss' into Swiss cheese; a spear
stabbed into his thigh, while the arrow pierced into his arm. However, even
as the pitch-black Story dripped out from him, Kim Namwoon was
grinning.

【Go! Taekwon Hyunsung!】

Along with Kim Namwoon's cry, a figure taking the spot behind him rose
up.

Kwa-dudududu…

It was the 999th turn's Lee Hyunsung. His powerful, sturdy arms wrapped
tightly around the Dokkaebi King, then forged steel occupying the space
grew out from his entire body. As the powerful sparks exploded, the steel
tightly secured the Dokkaebi King's arms and legs.

【Jihye-yah!】

At the end of the 999th turn Lee Hyunsung's signal, the 'Master of the
Sunken Island', made her move.

【Load the cannon.】
A massive battleship floating in the night sky could be spied within the
Wall's gap created by the impact with the ark. Along with a powerful
whirlpool swirling about, something was being loaded in front of the ship.
The Status emitted from there was more than enough to blow up a planet in
its entirety. When taking a closer look, it was not a shell that had been
loaded into the gigantic cannon.

【Fire!!】

And while issuing a huge explosion noise, a shooting star fired out from the
ship. It was the 'Living Flame', descending like a star with a blindingly
bright tail behind her back.

She had willingly become a bullet and now, was flying straight at the
'Dokkaebi King'. The 999th turn's Uriel shot forward in a shocking turn of
speed while melting everything getting in her way. The 999th turn's Story
concentrated on the tip of her sword began burning up violently.

【It's not only the Supreme King that have killed you before.】

⸢This was the method the 999th turn's characters used to clear the final
pages.⸥
The incandescent sun shattered the Wall's exterior and advanced forward.
Stories clinging onto the Final Wall writhed in pain from that incredible
heat.

This was the attack that no one in this world-line could possibly defend
against.

⸢Yet, the 'Dokkaebi King' was doing exactly that against such an attack.⸥

Creaaaaaaaaak-!!

The Dokkaebi King's eyes glowed sharply under the hellish heat.

Ah, aaaaaaah!
Countless Stigmata engraved on his body screeched out. They were texts
seemingly taken from the [Final Wall]. Giant Stories began directing their
exaltation towards them.

Even the Stories in my possession were getting agitated, as well.

⸢The Modifier 'King of the Stories' was not just for a show.⸥

The 'King of the Stories' that existed at the peak of <Star Stream>. His face
looked noble, evil, beautiful and sorrowful all at the same time.

⸢Once upon a time he too was a human.⸥

The weapons pouring out from the [Final Wall] collided with the [Flames
of Conflagration], and…

⸢He was a demon.⸥

The ash-coloured Story leaking out from the Dokkaebi King's horn stopped
the approaching Uriel's movement.

⸢He was a saviour, and…⸥

The divine light emitted from white wings restored the Dokkaebi King's
stamina.

⸢And eventually, an existence that became a Dokkaebi.⸥

The unending Stories began enveloping him. As if, this world couldn't end
in this place.

⸢This place was not the 999th turn.⸥

I sensed the 999th turn's characters now shifting their gazes in my direction.

⸢Now, make your move.⸥
⸢You must be the one to finish it.⸥

⸢You haven't forgotten your promise with us, yes?⸥

Unfortunately, I couldn't move.

[Giant Story, 'Guardian of the World', has begun its storytelling!]

[Giant Story, 'Guardian of the World', is now looking at the next Guardian!]

Because the Dokkaebi King's Story was also looking directly at me.

[…Kim Dokja!!] The Dokkaebi King shouted in my direction. [Do not go
against your predetermined destiny. You love the Stories more than anyone
in this world. I too was like you. I understand the feelings you have towards
this world better than anyone in this universe!]

The Story extending from his body reached out towards me.

Han Sooyoung next to me covered my ears and growled angrily. "Don't
listen to him. It's not even worth it hearing him out."

Jung Heewon and Lee Hyunsung stood before me, while Yoo Sangah, Shin
Yoosung, and Lee Gilyoung stood around me to protect me. And from
behind my back, the howl from Lee Jihye's sword resounded out.

[All the stars in the Nebula <Kim Dokja's Company> are shining brightly!]

However, there were some things that would become more visible the
harder you tried to obscure them. Some words would become clearer the
more you tried to cover them up.

[Exclusive skill, 'Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint', is going out of control!]
⸢[Black Flame Dragon! Black Flame Dragon! Goddammit, open your eyes

already!!]⸥
⸢[Kim Yoo-Shin! Wake up! Our Hwangsanbeol is not yet…]⸥

⸢[Great Sage!]⸥

Those were Stories streaming on the [Final Wall].

Constellations were collapsing on the battlefield where an even fiercer
battle than ours was taking place. Stories were endlessly leaking out from
the Great Sage's body, now tattered to resemble a torn rag. As if he had lost
both of his eyes, his once-blinding 'Golden Gaze Fiery Eyes' were currently
not emitting any light.

⸢[…I can't see my maknae all that well.]⸥

Uriel was supporting him. The Archangel with both of her wings torn off
held his hand and stroked the nightscape.

⸢[He's alive. There he is, still shining.⸥

The Constellations still doggedly surviving until now rushed towards them
from among the chaotic night sky.

The scene then changed to show Persephone embracing the fallen Hades.
He was trying to say something, but she simply shook her head.

⸢[Do not worry, my ancient night.]⸥

<Olympus>'s sun was setting above her head.

All these endings became wretched sentences and rushed above the Wall.
These sentences were being written only for the purpose of finishing them
off.

[Do you not wish to save them?]

I felt vomit rising up from the deepest part of my body.
The 'Dokkaebi King' shouted out. [The current you can't save them. The
one who loves the story can never change that very story.] Can't change it,
because you loved it.

[Only the one who overcomes the story, the one who understands the trivial
nature of everything, can escape from the suppression of the Probability.]

The surrounding storm of aftermaths was growing even more vicious,
accompanied by the 'Kka-gagagaghk!' noise. The power of the Stories
flowing out from the 'Dokkaebi King' was gradually overwhelming the
combined might of the 999th turn's characters.

The Dokkaebi King tore off Lee Hyunsung's Story metal and extended his
hand in my direction.

[The 'One Single Story' you have compiled is more than enough to inherit
the position of <Star Stream>. Take my hand. What you want is the same as
what I want. I do not wish to see the stories of those stars be erased.]

His voice even sounded desperate, too. The light in his eyes and his Story
all acted as proof of his sincerity.

The <Star Stream>'s Story glowed brightly from his figure.

⸢The story he had been reading for a long time had eventually become a
part of him.⸥
He was now the <Star Stream> itself.

He genuinely didn't want this story to end.

[Continue with… this story. Become the protagonist of a new world-line,
and along with the Story you have created, continue the banquet of the
'Oldest Dream'. You are the existence born solely for that purpose. You
were able to reach this far, only for that purpose!]
While listening to those words, I began recalling all the lucky moments that
happened to me so far.

[<Star Stream> is looking at you.]

Why was the <Star Stream>'s Probability so generous towards me?

The Dokkaebi King's Story was telling me the reason for that. The lights
continued to explode before my eyes.

[Do not forget what you truly want. You're not the 'last verse'. No, you're
the
'Eternity'!]

The Constellations' Stories streamed behind the Dokkaebi King.

He was right. I didn't wish for those stories to end.

⸢The Great Sage, Heaven's Equal watched the falling star and sensed his
own approaching demise.⸥
I slowly turned my head around and saw Yoo Joonghyuk, now almost freed
from the 'regression depression'. His seemingly-empty eyes were locked on
me.

⸢However, there were some stories that had to end.⸥
   Chapter 510: Ep. 98 - Have you protected all that you were
                    supposed to protect, III


That was an old promise.

⸢"I'll finish your story for you."⸥

I couldn't keep that promise during the 1863rd turn.

[Your ■■ has begun shaking unsteadily!]

I pushed myself up while gripping the Unbroken Faith tightly. The hilt of
the sword that accompanied me from beginning till now through almost all
the scenarios, could be felt in my hand.

The tip of the sword touched the ground and sentences began rising up.
Sentences that I had never seen before.

⸢He was more curious about the end of this world than anyone, and…⸥

⸢And more than anyone else, he wished for this world not to end.⸥
My last Story had begun.

"…Kim Dokja?"

I removed Han Sooyoung's hands covering my ears.

Her eyes were trembling. My reddened appearance was reflected in her
irises. A lengthy wound was running across my cheek; wings were torn,
and the Demon King's horn was broken. I was truly in a mess.

And Han Sooyoung believed in such a mess of a man until now and came
this far.

[Have you made up your mind?]

The Dokkaebi King in the center of all the exploding sparks asked me.

The beings from the 999th turn, the 'Outer God Kings', were doing
whatever they could to fight back. The battle so far had been evenly
matched, but judging from the direction of the storm of the Probability's
aftermath blowing in, it should be the 999th side falling into a disadvantage
in the end.

"That's right." I replied to the Dokkaebi King. "I shall cross the 'Final Wall'.
And then, meet the one behind it."

The culprit of all these tragedies, the 'Oldest Dream'.

"I'll meet that guy, and stop all of this world's tragedies."

The 'Dokkaebi King' grinned as if he was satisfied with my decision.

[Indeed. Very good. That's eminently possible when you become my
successor. Now, come this way. Hurry, and inherit the <Star Stream>'s
will…]

"I never said I'll take you up on your offer."

I activated [Way of the Wind] and the [Electrification] at the same time.
This world's fastest movement technique was soon enveloped by the
purewhite electrical energy, transforming my body into a single streak of
light beam. With the fastest speed I could ever produce, I shot past both the
Dokkaebi King and the Outer Gods.

The destination I chose was the deepest part of the [Final Wall].

[You…!!]

I heard the stunned voice of the Dokkaebi King. I also saw the sentences
dashing across above the [Final Wall] in the distance.

⸢The place where the Abyssal Black Flame Dragon's last scale, and Uriel's
last feather, had fallen.⸥
I roared out in panic and dashed towards that very sentence.

⸢The place where Persephone's last teardrop had fallen.⸥

I needed to stop those sentences from finishing. Even if I saw the end of
this world, I must never let those words come to an end.

Perhaps he had realized my intentions, the Dokkaebi King was shouting out
in sheer astonishment.

[No, stop! You are not a permitted being yet! You can't even touch that
Wall, let alone cross it!] Tsu-chuchuchut!

The moment he was finished, the storm of the Probability's aftermath
suppressed my entire body. The sparks exploded with enough force to
utterly crush my Incarnation Body right down its atoms, and for a moment
there, the inside of my head blanked out from the pain.

[The 'Final Wall' is rejecting your approach!]

The Wall was rejecting me.
It was stopping me from touching its sentences, to change them, and even
from crossing over it. As if I couldn't even be permitted to reach it at all.

In an instant, the words on the Wall widened the space, and retreated to a
faroff distance.

⸢Those sentences weren't Kim Dokja's.⸥

Powerful gusts of wind knocked me off my feet. I was like some words cast
out to the distant empty blankness, miserably rolling on the ground towards
my rear. Then, my back collided with something while issuing a loud 'thud!'
"You idiot! You think you can achieve something by rushing out all
alone??" It was Han Sooyoung. I replied to her with a grin.

"I wasn't rushing forward alone."

The <Kim Dokja's Company>'s members were running towards us from
behind.

I didn't want to lose anyone. I simply couldn't afford to lose anyone.

"Dokja-ssi! Keep running!"

Jung Heewon, her [Hour of Judgement] activated, rushed towards us while
scattering the reddish glow from her eyes.

Lee Hyunsung and Lee Jihye were positioned either side of her, while Yoo
Sangah and the kids were right behind them. Meanwhile, Jang Hayoung
and our masters were taking up the rear of the group.

"Take this with you! It's the last Life and Death Pill!"

Lee Seolhwa couldn't come with us because of Gong Pildu, so she threw
the pillbox at us, instead. I took a [Life and Death Pill] out right away and
swallowed it. My wrecked Incarnation Body began recovering rapidly.
[Stop!!]

Along with the Dokkaebi King's cry, bizarre-looking creatures revealed
themselves from among the contexts of the paragraphs recorded on the
Wall. They were 'Outer Gods', too – beings that hadn't earned Stories
worthy enough to be recorded on the Wall.

【■■■!!▪▪▪ ▪▪▪ ▪▪▪!!】

Not all Outer Gods followed their kings. There definitely existed some that
chose to become the Dokkaebi King's underlings despite possessing great
powers themselves, and voluntarily worked as the slaves of the scenarios.

Kwa-kwakwakwakwa!!

[Stop them! If you do, I shall record your Stories on the 'Final Wall'!]

Our martial art masters discovered tentacles rushing in from all directions
and unsheathed their weapons.

"Leave this place to us."

The Breaking the Sky Saint's [Breaking the Sky Swordsmanship] and
Kyrgios's [Purest Sword Force] combined into a single ray of light, and
engraved their sentences over the Wall.

[Giant Story, 'The 1st Murim', has begun its storytelling!]

Two greatest experts of Murim stopped the tentacles and a desperate
struggle soon ensued. Unfortunately, the time they could buy was only for a
fleeting moment.

There were simply far too many 'Outer Gods' flooding out from the 'context'
the Dokkaebi King had opened up.

[All Stories of <Kim Dokja's Company> are emitting bright light!]
We couldn't afford to waste the time our masters bought for us. The Wall's
surface recording Uriel's and the Great Sage's Stories had already grown
that far away.

There could only be one answer. We needed to approach it fast than its
retreating speed. But, how could we…

It was right around then a certain paragraph floated up on the [Final Wall].

⸢To think that a 'Green Zone' is located on a wall… To begin with,
people were responsible for attaching the concept of 'rooms' on it,
weren't they.⸥ I abruptly looked down at the floor we were standing on.

The floor itself was another type of 'Wall', laying in a different direction.
And our footprints were left engraved on the Wall we ran on. The Stories
we had compiled were floating up on the footprints we left behind.

⸢"By the way, Dokja-ssi, what are you so focused on reading just now?"⸥

⸢It was the moment when my life's genre changed.⸥

⸢"The number of people remaining in the subway cabin is twelve. And there
are only three insects inside the net."⸥

⸢One world was dying, while a new world was being born. And I was the
sole reader who knew the conclusion of this world.⸥
It was from the first scenario. Back when we were trying to escape from the
subway.

⸢Please select your backer. Your chosen backer will become your trusty
sponsor from now on.⸥
⸢[Constellation, 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' is disappointed in you.]⸥

⸢[Constellation, 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' is amused by your

choice.]⸥

Those were from the Sponsor Selection. Starlights were illuminating our
feet.

We began running again. The Stories created the path we should be running
on.

⸢"Is it true that you're monopolising the food?"⸥

⸢"Stand up, everyone. The scenario has just begun, after all."⸥

⸢"An arrogant tenant showed up, I see."⸥

⸢"Hyunsung-ssi, do it now. Destroy everything, please."⸥

Past the battles of Geumho and Chungmuro Stations, and…

⸢"I'm the… ninth quitter.⸥

⸢"…My apologies, but, may I inquire what your name is?"⸥

⸢"I'm Yoo Joonghyuk."⸥

The memories from the battles of the 'Capture the Flag' and the life-
anddeath struggle of the prophets were remembered next.

⸢"What an amusing thing this is. All this history belongs to the past, yet
why have you all gathered in this place once more?"⸥
⸢"That bastard is nicknamed the tyrant king. Doesn't matter whether you're
a man or woman, you'll be taken as a concubine if you're pretty enough, and
if you're not, either you'll be killed off or become his slave."⸥

⸢"In that case, Dokja-ssi, you'll end up as a slave if you get caught."⸥

⸢The top dog among the Seoul's Seven Kings was, of course, the Supreme
King Yoo Joonghyuk.⸥
We greeted the Gwanghwamun's 'Battle of the Kings', and…

⸢"That's why I will not sit down on the 'Absolute Throne'."⸥

…And, I destroyed the [Absolute Throne].

⸢"However, I won't permit anyone else to sit down on this throne, either."⸥

Every moment had been a battle against adversity. Not one scenario was
easy, and we always had to risk our lives and fight the odds.

All these tragedies had become a story in the end. And we were running
with that story.

Stories untangling endlessly like a ball of threads soon formed a single
image. That image soon morphed into a white tiger. A white tiger sporting
noble whiskers and stripes was now running beside me.

[Story, 'King of a Kingless World', is seeing you off on your journey.]

The 'King of a Kingless World' – my nativity Story was seeing me off.

The white tiger created the path we must tread on and roared out loudly,
before coming to a sudden stop – as if the road from here on wasn't its to
create, its yearning eyes chasing after my path.

[Story, 'One Who Opposes the Miracles', is seeing you off on your journey.]
Before long, my second Story taking on the figure of a blue hawk was
flying above my head. It was the Story I earned by killing the Returnee
Myung IlSang who descended as the 'Calamity of Questions'.

[Story, 'One Who Scorned the Storyteller', is seeing you off on your
journey.]

Our every Story was enabling us to run on the [Final Wall].

The expressions of my companions also changed as their own Stories
appeared. Lee Hyunsung hesitantly looked behind over and over again,
while Shin Yoosung couldn't hold it anymore and broke down in tears.

⸢This was the road they had lived on, and the story they need to finish.⸥
[Story, 'One Who Hunted the King of Disasters', is seeing you off on your
journey.]

The Story I earned by hunting the shadow of 'Yamato no Orochi' back in
the [Peace Land]; a gigantic shadow of a snake was supporting the road we
were running on.

Every single one of them was a precious story to us. We lived all those
moments to their fullest and that's why all of us were here now.

Tsu-chuchuchuchut!

Our Stories lost their strengths and collapsed as the storm of aftermaths
grew harsher and harsher.

[Story, 'One Who Murdered the Outer God', is seeing you off on your
journey.]

A Story resembling a massive squid protected us from the aftermath's
storm.

[Story, 'Demon King of Salvation', has begun telling its last story.]
With every ounce of energy I could muster, I wielded the Unbroken Faith.
We shook off the incoming 'Outer Gods' and dashed towards the [Final
Wall].

The Stories of the Constellations were still telling their stories in the
distance even now.

⸢The 'Flame of Conflagration' fell out from Uriel's hand. In that last
moment, she looked up at a certain star shining in the night sky. And
then…⸥
It was still not too late. Uriel, the Abyssal Black Flame Dragon, and even
the Great Sage, they were all still alive.

This story could be changed.

[The 'Final Wall' is not permitting your approach!]

We only had to go a little bit further.

['Access prevention process' has been initialised.]

And then, our steps came to a halt.

Right before our eyes stood thin, transparent walls layered one after
another. Each wall was made up with incredible density.

We struck it several times, but its sturdiness couldn't be broken through the
powers of individual Stories.

We could now see the 'Outer Gods' ignoring our masters and rushing
towards us. The Dokkaebi King seemed to be relieved now as he shouted
something at us, too.

I ignored them all and looked up at the night sky.
⸢All the stars of the universe had dimmed, but that didn't mean every single
of them did.⸥
A ripple-like thing spread out from a certain spot in the night sky. The first
one to realize what was going on was Han Sooyoung. She rubbed her eyes
hard and muttered out.

"He's way too late!"

The front section of a train could be seen dashing towards us. Surya's sun
train was rushing in our direction as the ark's debris could be seen bouncing
off its hull.

[Constellation, 'Supreme God of Light', is incarnating into the Final
Scenario's location!]

[Apologies for my tardiness, Demon King of Salvation.]

He had finally attained the Status of a Myth-grade, and arrived in this stage
by crossing the night sky.

"Not at all. You are just in time."

[Giant Story, 'Demon Realm's Spring', has begun its storytelling!]

Finally, the condition for the 'Beginning/Gi(起)' had been satisfied.

[The 'Stage Transformation' is activating!]
   Chapter 511: Ep. 98 - Have you protected all that you were
                    supposed to protect, IV


The night sky momentarily turned pure white from Surya's sunlight.

Just like how we fought together back in the 'Demon King Selection' battles
as well as in the 'Gigantomachia', Surya's train was rushing towards us.

"Will pay the train fare later!"

With Han Sooyoung shouting out pompously as our lead, we got on Surya's
train.

An incredible explosion of sparks occurred at the train's wheels. The
vehicle did a huge doughnut once in the air while emitting loud noises,
before shooting straight towards the transparent wall as sonic booms
exploded out from its rear. Lee Hyunsung shouted out.

"It's breaking!"

Along with the loud 'Craaaaaaack!', the transparent walls began crumbling
down.
We continued to break past the layers of walls and dashed forward. The
[Final Wall] recording the Stories of the Constellations was gradually
getting closer.

The Dokkaebi King's loud roar was messily intermingling with the Stories
from the 999th turn.

[Constellation, 'Supreme God of Light', is unleashing all of his Status!]

Surya's entire body as he sat in the engine room glowed brightly like a
white-hot incandescent sun. Stories dripped out from the wounds visible all
over his body. Maybe, he too had already paid a hefty price to reach this
place.

[Constellation Supreme God of Light's ■■ is 'Final Engineer'.]

Even then, his Story didn't stop. Without showing anything outwardly, he
used his own body as fuel to operate the [Sun Train]. As if that was his duty
as the one who lived until now as the 'Supreme God of Light'.

[Giant Story, 'Demon Realm's Spring', is seeing you off on your journey!]

[The power output still isn't enough!]

Despite his fierce will burning throughout his entire body, the train's speed
was gradually slowing down. It was all because the closer we got to the
center of the [Final Wall], the thicker the density of the protective walls
became.

And just before the wall seemingly made out of net of texts collided against
the front of the train, Jung Heewon made her move.

"Leave it to me!"

"H-Heewon-ssi?! Eck!"

The moment she grabbed Lee Hyunsung's neck tightly, his body shrunk
down rapidly and eventually transformed into a steel sword. And this
weapon's blade was soon burning hotly in the flames of the [Hellfire].
[Giant Story, 'Torch that Swallowed the Myth', is seeing you off on your
journey!]

'Development/Seung(承)'.

The Story that illuminated the battlefield of <Gigantomachia> was now
glowing brightly to scorch the [Final Wall].

Kwa-kwakwakwakwa!

Truly a stupendous amount of flames gushed out from the front of the train,
enveloping the frontal surface of the vehicle in intense heat.

Jung Heewon releasing [Hellfire] from her entire body shouted out in a
voice seemingly sizzling in lava.

"Story, shmeeble! It's all going to end right here!"

Every time her sword glowed brightly, the net of texts was torn apart.

She wielded her sword over and over again. Even as the sparks from the
aftermath's storm ravaged her, she didn't forget to improve further upon her
way of the sword.

This was the path Jung Heewon's life had created. We were running on this
path. However, it was still not enough. We needed a much stronger power
than this.

The sentences on the [Final Wall] were unfolding in the distance.

⸢In that final moment, Uriel reached out towards the sky.⸥

⸢My Story might come to an end today, but.⸥

⸢There will be a star that shall never forget this story.⸥
[Giant Story, 'Season of Light and Darkness', is seeing you off on your
journey!]

The Story of both Uriel and the Abyssal Black Flame Dragon crossed the
Wall to be transmitted.

The Stories of Good and Evil collided energetically and protected us, and
wings made out of texts sprouted from the sides of the train. Just like a
roaring Apocalypse Dragon, the vehicle devoured the walls before our eyes
and continued to advance forward.

[Stop!!]

The 'Dokkaebi King' began chasing after us even before we realized it.
Stories flooded out from his arms and legs, and despite the 999th turn's
individuals pursuing him, he still extended his arm towards us.

Tsu-chuchuchuchut!

The Probability's sparks exploded out from the floor, shaking the train's
central axis. The vehicle shook hard, and just as it was about to lose its
balance, more sentences floated up above the [Final Wall].

⸢The Great Sage watched the thunder spear fly towards his neck and spoke
up.⸥

⸢Don't stop, maknae-yah.⸥

The Great Sage, Heaven's Equal who never yielded right up until his final
moments, was there. At the same time, a man wearing a black coat riding at
the rear of the train stood up.

"Yoo Joonghyuk!"

The 'Secretive Plotter' possessing Yoo Joonghyuk raised his hand to the air.
When he did, countless 'Outer Gods' rose up from amidst the storm of
aftermaths occurring on the floor. They weren't the regular 'Nameless
Ones', either.

[Giant Story, 'Liberator of the Forgotten Ones' is seeing you off on your
journey!]

【Gogogogogo】

【WillhelpWillhelpWillhelpWillhelp】

【DidntforgetDidntforgetDidntforgetDidntforget】

The 'Nameless Ones' that helped us or fought against us during the 'Journey
to the West' propped up the rocking train. As if this vehicle was a ship
riding on the rough waters of the Tongtian River, they were carrying us
towards the [Final Wall].

[You have approached the core of the 'Final Wall'.]

Eventually, all the walls protecting the [Final Wall] crumbled down. The
train was damaged everywhere, and Surya must've had blacked out as he
was no longer releasing his Story.

Not too far away, we could see the real [Final Wall]. A wall far thicker and
expansive than any other I had ever seen.

【This is the wall that I couldn't cross.】

The 'Secretive Plotter' spoke up.

⸢'Is it also not doable this time too?' That was the final moment for the 58th
turn's Yoo Joonghyuk.⸥

⸢'I made a mistake. But, during the next turn…' The 96th turn Yoo
Joonghyuk closed his eyes in that manner.⸥
Countless ends for Yoo Joonghyuk streamed by above the wall. It wasn't
just him, though.

⸢'The last hero of Hwangsanbeol' Gyebaek continued to shake his eternal
rival who'd never wake up again.⸥

⸢Goryeo's number one swordsman and the Maritime War God, having lost
an arm each, stood back to back and unleashed their final Statuses.⸥

The Wall that recorded the endings of all the Constellations. The last
moments of all the Constellations that included Uriel and the Great Sage
were being recorded on the Wall in real-time.

The companions and I disembarked from the unmoving train and dashed
towards the wall.

⸢If only those sentences were erased; and if all those tragedies could be
stopped.⸥
[You can't interfere with the 'Final Wall's' sentences.]

[Applicable paragraphs are prohibited from being overwritten.]

[Please input the cancellation code.]

The 'Secretive Plotter' spoke up. 【No regular methods will work. I've
already used physical force before, but couldn't destroy this wall.】

Jung Heewon shouted out. "We came this far, so there must be…!"

【From here on, it's your job.】

He was now looking at me. Somewhere within that gaze was the 3rd turn
Yoo Joonghyuk's, who had completed the scenarios alongside me.

⸢What exactly is the 'Conclusion' you wish to see?⸥
This was what I needed to do in order to answer that question.

Lee Jihye opened her mouth. "He couldn't do it even after 1863
lifetimes, so… ahjussi, can you really do it?" It was as she said.

I was not a 'protagonist' like Yoo Joonghyuk, nor was I a 'writer' like Han
Sooyoung. However, because I was neither the protagonist nor the writer,
maybe there was something only I could do.

Maybe, I could remember that one thing that the protagonist couldn't see,
and the writer had forgotten all about.

⸢The job that only him could do, him that read the 'Ways of Survival' for a
very, very long time.⸥
I quietly stared into the 'Final Wall'. I focused all my attention and read the
wall's surface again and again. Not too long after that, the wall radiated
brilliantly. Just like a certain screen in the past that I had been reading over
and over again.

⸢'Three Ways to Survive the Destroyed World'.⸥

Everything from that epic tale was being established within me. I hadn't yet
read the final revised version of the 'Ways of Survival'. Which meant I
didn't know how this story was supposed to end. However…

⸢[Oh, dear unfortunate puppet. You have come far too early. I'm sorry, but
beyond here 'doesn't exist' yet.]⸥
The 1863rd turn's Dokkaebi King from the 'Secretive Plotter's' memories
said that.

⸢But, what if all these were handed over to me without having been written
yet?⸥
My companions and I rushed towards the wall.
⸢What if, someone wanted me to complete this story?⸥

[Exclusive skill, 'Reading Comprehension', is activating beyond the limit!]

My overheating head felt like it'd explode, but I kept my eyes wide open
and continued to glare at the wall.

The Stories written on the [Final Wall]. Those Stories were connecting with
each other inside my head. I saw how each Story was connected to another.
I saw the cleverly-installed narrative devices within the Stories and then,
the contexts surrounding them.

⸢Those that did appear in the novel, but had never been used until its end.⸥

When that happened, the previously perfect-looking story began showing
gaps within it. Gaps that hadn't been filled. Things that would be collected
as time passed by.

Things that were waiting for this story's 'epilogue'.

⸢Kim Dokja knew exactly what that was.⸥

[You have awakened a new attribute!]

[Attribute, 'Foreshadow Collector', is activating!]

The story's gaps that only I could have discovered, someone who watched
this tale as a 'reader' from the beginning till its end. I stared at the 'five gaps'
visible on the expansive wall's surface.

"Hayoung-ah."

"Leave it to me."

The first one to step up was Jang Hayoung. She accurately placed her palm
on the wall's gap that I pointed out.
[The 'Wall of Impossible Communication' has discovered its intended
position.]

[The 'Final Wall's' first theme has been completed!]

Along with the explosion of blinding light, the wall's fragment slotted back
in its spot; and then, a single sentence leaked out from there.

⸢This tale was a story about an 'impossible communication'.⸥

"Heewon-ssi, Gilyoung-ah!"

Jung Heewon and Lee Gilyoung nodded their heads and placed their palms
on their own gaps. Then, the two portions of the 'Wall that Divides the
Good and Evil' became one.

[The 'Wall that Divides the Good and Evil' has discovered its intended
position.]

[The 'Final Wall's' second theme has been completed!]

⸢This tale was a story about indistinguishable 'Good and Evil', and…⸥

And now, it was Yoo Sangah's turn.

"Yoo Sangah-ssi."

She slowly walked forward, found her gap, and reached out.

[The 'Wall that Decides Samsara' has discovered its intended position.]

[The 'Final Wall's' third theme has been completed!]

⸢And, this tale was a story about a tragedy locked in a cycle.⸥

With that, four gaps had been filled, leaving the last one. I looked up at that
empty spot.
The last fragment of the [Final Wall]. That was the fragment that never
appeared in the original novel.

⸢Kim Dok ja.⸥

[The Fourth Wall] was addressing me.

"The Fourth Wall."

Both it and I knew exactly what we needed to do here.

A blinding fragment made up of texts floated up above my palm. Those
texts were now talking to me.

⸢I li ke y our st ory.⸥

I couldn't say anything. While unable to say anything, I ran towards that last
empty gap and slotted the fragment inside.

⸢This tale was a story of a reader who wanted to change its conclusion.⸥

Right next moment, an incredible shower of sparks exploded from the wall.

[The code has been lifted.]

The wall's authority was opening up towards me. The secrets of the wall
that even Yoo Joonghyuk couldn't cross was now streaming into me.

The sentence of the Constellations floated up right before my eyes. It was
the last sentence of the Great Sage and Uriel that I wanted to stop so badly.

⸢The blades flying in at the necks of the Great Sage and Uriel…⸥

I powerfully grabbed that sentence.

Tsu-chuchuchuchut!!
It felt like my hand was set on fire. Stories clung onto me and stabbed into
my hand like sharp blades. However, I held on. I couldn't let this sentence
end like that.

[The 'Final Wall' is puzzled by your actions.]

[The 'Final Wall' is asking you, wasn't this the story you

wanted?] I didn't want it. Who would want a conclusion like this?

[Stop! I said, stop that right now!!] The 'Dokkaebi King' persistently chased
after us, Stories dripping from all over his body. Thick murderous aura was
filling up his eyes. [You must not touch the Wall! You'll regret it! There is
nothing beyond this Wall! Not even what you wished for, not even what
you wanted to see!]

He was wrong. The 'Oldest Dream' was beyond this Wall.

"Wenny King!"

The Wenny King hiding within my shadow imprisoned the Dokkaebi
King's body.

[Finally, we meet again, my old friend.]

[…The Wenny King!]

[Go on ahead, Kim Dokja. Fulfil our agreement.]

I didn't let go of the sentence still in my hand.

⸢The blades flying in at the necks of the Great Sage and Uriel w…⸥

While grabbing hold of that 'w', I prevented the next vowel from
generating. Along with 'Pu-shu-shuk!' noise, my fingers were sliced off.
Stories leaking out nonstop screamed out.

[You are not the 'Dokkaebi King'.]
[You cannot stop the progress of the applicable Story.]

It was then, something soft enveloped the back of my hand accompanied by
the "Baat!" noise. With every ounce of her energy she could summon,
Biyoo rubbed her whole body against that sentence as if she had become an
eraser.

⸢The storyteller had sided with Dokja/the reader.⸥

Along with Biyoo, I smacked down on the sentence with everything I got,
over and over again. I swung my fist at the unstoppable sentence, then even
stabbed it with my sword. Please, please, please!

⸢And eventually…⸥

Very faintly, cracks were developing on the letters.

The already-written sentences were scattering away.

The Conclusion was changing.

⸢Te bades flyin in aaat te nec of Great an Ur el…⸥

The broken words initiated a storm of powerful sparks, before transforming
into something I couldn't read at all.

⸢■■blade■■■■Ur■■■■Sage■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■⸥

【Ooooooooh-!!】

Countless 'Outer Gods' howled out. Their cries even sounded reverential as
if they were exalting a great god.

I held my hand that bled Stories nonstop, and witnessed the Wall's surface
changing. Shin Yoosung had come closer without me realizing it to tightly
hold my hand.
"Ahjussi…"

[You have acquired a new 'Giant Story'!]

[Giant Story, 'One Who Breaks the Final Wall', has been acquired.]

[Giant Story, 'One Who Breaks the Final Wall', is continuing on with its
storytelling!]

[<Star Stream> is seeing you off on your journey.]

As the messages exploded inside my head, the Wall before our eyes
collapsed.

The Stories written on the Wall and our own were now getting all jumbled
up. Countless ■s were spinning around in sync. And that made them
resemble circles.

And just beyond those pitch-black circles, I thought I could see something.
[Hahahaha!! This is it! As per our agreement, I shall be the first one to
confirm what's beyond the 'Final Wall'!!]

The Wenny King shoved the 'Dokkaebi King' aside and jumped right into
the black circle. And as the latter began crying in despair, the blade of
[Black Heavenly Demon Sword] pierced his throat cleanly.

My companions ran up to me.

⸢Everything in this world was crumbling down.⸥

The [Final Wall], the <Star Stream>, everything was collapsing.

⸢The broken wall was getting jumbled up with the companions' Stories.⸥

⸢It became gradually impossible to tell apart what was a Story and what was
reality.⸥
Something beyond the circle was looking at this side. I too stared right back
at it.

⸢…Just what is that?⸥

Little by little, it became harder to breathe. Something was sucking me in.
Everything I experienced, felt, and judged were now streaming above the
[Final Wall] in sloppy, broken sentences.

⸢Every…⸥

"one…!!"

I couldn't figure out whether I was saying that or the Wall was.

I was now simply a description on that Wall.

Some sentences could only be seen faintly, while some others couldn't be
seen at all. Eventually, all the flowing sentences began disappearing one at
the time. Slowly, so agonisingly slowly.

Just like that, every sentence above the Wall came to a st●.
             Chapter 512: Ep. 99 - The Oldest Dream, I


Within this faint light gently and warmly embracing his entire body, the
Wenny King was curled up in a fetal position, dreaming of a certain dream.

That was a very ancient dream. A tale from well before his ■■ had been
decided.

He was collapsed on the floor of a tainted forest.

– Epsilon! We only have to go a little bit further. The Demon King's castle
isalmost within reach!

In this tale, he was a warrior subjugating the Demon King. A warrior that
had set off on the Demon King subjugation expedition to protect his world.

Unfortunately, he didn't get to fulfil his long-cherished desire. Just before
the subjugation went underway, he had to close his eyes, his friend's face
the last thing he saw.

 – …Gilbert.
The scene changed, and now it displayed a warzone.

He was now a man from Murim, kitted out in a set of black-coloured
garments of a nightly operative.

– Senior brother Kwok! The main base of the demonic cult bastards is
rightover there!

He saw the face of his companion filling up his view. Longing quickly
filled him up. She was the person he loved the most out of all the lives he
had lived.

– …It's too late for me. Junior sister, please go on ahead.

A whistling noise of an arrow flying in from somewhere later, his vision
blackened once more.

His head was pounding away. As memories overflowed, the Wenny King's
ego was shaking unsteadily.

Were these scenes from his own memories or stories from the ⸢Final Wall⸥?

Where did this story begin, and where would it end?

Independent of his will, the tale continued on.

He was now a young hatchling.

He was also a monstrous creature without a name.

He was an expert from Murim, and also a knight from medieval times.

And every time that happened, he was an Incarnation clearing the scenarios.

The last thing he heard in front of the [Final Wall] was the voice coming
from a shadow without a name.

– My friend. Even during our next life, accompany me.
He gasped out loudly and opened his eyes, only to be greeted by the
pitchblack darkness. The cold sweat soaking the nape of his neck sent
deathly chills all over his body.

'I'm the Wenny King'.

That was his name. He did have a real name, but that had been forgotten a
long time ago. No, he couldn't even be certain whether that was really his
name or not.

'…Am I really the Wenny King?'

Within the swirling pitch-black vacuum, the Wenny King fell into deep
contemplation. It was the kind of contemplation he had never entertained
after surpassing the limits of mortality.

'Who am I?'

The Story acting as the foundation of his existence was now shaking
unsteadily. In order to regain himself at any cost, he began ruminating over
his own memories.

⸢In the beginning, there was a Wenny.⸥

⸢He was the first storyteller. A human that sang about Stories.⸥

⸢But one day, Dokkaebis appeared in the world, and…⸥

⸢And those Dokkaebis took away the Wenny's song.⸥

That was all he needed to remember.

Remember that those damned Dokkaebis took away the Wenny's song;
remember the fact that they expelled him from the <Star Stream>'s
scenarios by stealing away his nativity Story.

[You look confused, my old friend.]
The Wenny King was startled by that true voice and hurriedly looked
behind him. The face of the Dokkaebi King was floating within the pitch-
black darkness.

[Dokkaebi King!]

The former growled and unleashed his Status. However, things didn't go
according to plan. Within this space where nothing existed, the Status he
emitted only left behind faint sparks.

The Dokkaebi King spoke with a disinterested expression.

[You aren't allowed to fight in here. Our powers aren't valid in this place.]

[…You somehow managed to survive. I thought that you died at the blade
of that puppet.]

[It's not much different from having died already. And, will die again, too.]

In the spot where the Dokkaebi King's gaze landed, they could see a
circular exit of light swirling around. The soul forms of these two beings
were slowly heading towards that exit.

The Wenny King shouted out. [No, hold on! My Story has just begun! I
will be crossing over the 'Final Wall'! I shall encounter the lazy god that
imagined everything of this world, and become the sole creature that knows
the secret of this world!!]

[Are you that curious about this world's secret?]

[You speak of something obvious. There isn't a single creature not curious
about the origin of their own birth.]

[And that's precisely the reason why creatures become unhappy.]

The Dokkaebi King spoke in a self-deprecating manner.
[Why do you think creatures possess the wonderful ability called
'forgetfulness'?]

The Story debris was scattering away within the darkness. Stories that had
lost their contexts became just lumps of texts and slowly broke away. They
were now stories that no one could read anymore.

The Dokkaebi King gently caressed them, before crushing that Story into
powder.

[There are far too many unnecessary stories in this universe. A process is
required in order to eliminate them and to optimise everything. That is what
'forgetfulness' is.]

[Rubbish! The universe is infinite. Just like how the end of the 'Final Wall'
doesn't exist.]

[Even if there are plenty of blank margins left on the Wall, just how much
of that do you think is permitted to the measly extras?]

The Dokkaebi King looked down at his own body slowly crumbling away.

[Unfortunately, the protagonist the 'Final Wall' has chosen is neither you or
me.]

[I don't know what rubbish you're trying to spew here, but…!]

[Even then, you shall soon meet the one you so dearly wished to meet.]

It was then the Wenny King's shoulders flinched.

The exit of light could be seen. It was such a rapturous, resplendent light.
The exit was spinning vigorously and it somewhat resembled a full stop of
a certain world.

The Wenny King suddenly grew scared.

[You, have you seen what's beyond that?]
The Dokkaebi King didn't reply immediately. He had this expression of
boredom as if all sentences held no meaning after the full stop itself. Still,
he did add a comment in the end.

[What meaning is there, anyway?]

[What?]

[I'm saying, what meaning is there to knowing that this world was just a
portion of a vast dream?]

His words contained endless futility of it all.

The Wenny King couldn't understand what was being said.

The light was getting brighter, yet the expression on the Dokkaebi King
was getting blurrier. Soon, the exit of light was literally right before his
nose. The worried Wenny King asked.

[…Why did you continue on with <Star Stream> until now?]

Maybe that question was unexpected? The Dokkaebi King's expression
changed bizarrely. He quietly stared at the Wenny King, before making his
reply.

[I wonder. I can't remember it anymore.]

In that moment, several Stories overlapped on the Dokkaebi King's face.

At once, he looked like a warrior subjugating the Demon King, an expert
from the dangerous world of Murim battling the demonic sect, and a
hatchling spreading its wings towards the wide-open sky. He was…

[…You-!]

[Kim Dokja has opened a door that should've never been opened. And so,
this world will forever be mired in misfortune.]
At the end of those words, the world was blanketed by pure light. They had
finally reached the exit. The Wenny King staggered unsteadily and set foot
inside that light. He brushed past the rays of light and tread forward little by
little.

The answer was here.

The 'Oldest Dream' that created this world was here.

However, the Wenny King couldn't see anything.

The noisy blaring of hooters could be heard coming from somewhere. A
thick, choking smell that wetted his nose; it became harder and harder to
breath. His body began burning up under the rays of light.

As if, this blank margin wasn't permitted to him.

[I told you. This story is neither yours or mine.]

Along with the Dokkaebi King's words, the Wenny King's body began
melting down.

[We are simply tools of this world. That's all.]

Ah, aaaah…

Even though his legs melted away, followed by his torso, the Wenny King
never shifted his gaze away from the spectacle before his eyes.

That was where the Oldest Dream was. The secret of everything in this
world was there. That something he had been searching for forever was
there.

The Wenny King saw it. And then, finally understood what the Dokkaebi
King was saying earlier.

That, that is indeed…
The Wenny King wished to shout out so desperately. To shout out, please
look this way. Please, I'm right here. Please, look at me just once.

And then, 'that' slowly shifted its head.

However, by the time its gaze reached where the Wenny King was, the
latter was no longer existing in that place.

So, 'that' shifted its head away.

And, while keeping its head down, it began muttering about something
once more.




Cough.

I felt something scratchy inside my mouth after coughing a bit. I spat out
the stuffed-up breath, and insect-like things leaked out. I took a look and
realized that they were letters.

Sensations returned and my vision brightened. I saw the letters emitting
bright white light before my eyes. They were of familiar contents.

Just where is this…?

"Dokja-ssi? You might get sucked into the book if you do that."

Suddenly, the back of my neck grew cold. That was a familiar voice, and
with words I had heard somewhere before. Horrifying imagination made a
right old mess of my mind. I once thought that if I destroyed the [Final
Wall], something like this might happen. However, to think that such a
thing would really…
Then, accompanied by flapping noises, torn bits of paper danced around
before my eyes. I took another closer look and discovered someone lightly
shaking a book around.

"…Sangah-ssi."

Yoo Sangah was standing before my eyes.

The surrounding view gradually grew clearer. It was the view of discarded
books forming small mounds, as well as bookshelves lining up with nary a
space in between. All illuminated by the faint light from a lantern. This
wasn't the subway.

This was the location I was quite familiar with.

Yoo Sangah grinned brightly. "This

place feels so cosy to me now." We

were inside [The Fourth Wall].

"…What happened?"

"Even if you ask me… I also woke up just now. Should we go and look for
my librarian seniors?"

As Yoo Sangah shrugged her shoulders and began scanning the
surroundings, I quickly organised what happened to us so far in my head.

⸢We had gathered all the fragments of the [Final Wall] and eventually
brought it down.⸥
The memory of the 'square circle' spinning around was still vivid in my
mind.

…And then? What happened afterwards?

What about the other companions?
⸢Do n't wo rry Kim Dok ja.⸥

A voice I thought I could never hear again entered my ears. I shouted out in
happiness.

"The Fourth Wall!"

⸢Si len ce in the lib rary.⸥

This was definitely [The Fourth Wall] that I remembered, that sly
playfulness included. Separate from how happy I was, though, my
puzzlement only grew even bigger, instead.

Why was I inside [The Fourth Wall] right now?

"Dokja-ssi?"

More voices could be heard coming from the darkness. They were from the
<Kim Dokja's Company>'s companions.

"Just where are we?"

"…I found a strange book here. It's called ⸢⸢Kim Dokja and the mysteries of
sex.⸥⸥"
"You should definitely not be looking at such things, Jihye-yah."

"How about this one, then? ⸢⸢If they have their bibles, then Kim Dokja has
the Ways of Survival.⸥⸥"
"You really want to read something like that?"

I thought I could hear Jung Heewon and Lee Jihye speaking to each other.
And then, a pair of small heads popped out from a nearby mound of books
as if they were moles.

"Ahjussi!"
"Hyung!"

It was Shin Yoosung and Lee Gilyoung. I could also see Han Sooyoung
walking towards us in the darkened view.

"What a weird place this is. Is this that 'library' Yoo Sangah talked about
before?"

She pulled out a book from the shelf to toss it behind her. Meanwhile, Lee
Hyunsung standing behind her caught that and stuffed it inside his inner
pocket.

"S-Sooyoung-ssi! You shouldn't handle books so carelessly… You don't
even know what these things are!"

"Wowee, what's this! Sounds fun."

Behind them, I spotted the unconscious Gong Pildu, Jang Hayoung and
Anna Croft lying on the floor. And finally, Lee Seolhwa checking for their
pulses. At the very least, all of my companions that participated in the 'Final
Scenario' were gathered here.

⸢N ot ev ery one.⸥

I got this rather bad premonition after hearing [The Fourth Wall]'s voice.

I still couldn't see 'that guy' yet.

…Could it be??

⸢(Hahahaha! Yoo Joonghyuk! I can smell him somewhere nearby! Did he
finally show up here in order to become one with me?!)⸥
A voice loudly reverberated out from within the deep darkness. It was
obviously coming from Nirvana. And right next second, a dull impact noise
rang out. The now-silent Nirvana's limp body rolled around on the floor,
and then, a certain black combat boot trampled that poor sob's head.
"…What an unpleasant space this is."

"Yoo Joonghyuk."

Sparks were still faintly dancing around him as if he hadn't yet separated
from the 'Secretive Plotter'. Since he's here too, who was it that couldn't
come?

"…Constellations aren't here."

"What happened to everyone back on Earth?"

[The Fourth Wall] evacuating us here could only mean that some sort of a
problem had occurred in the outside world.

My heart was now growing icy cold. I recalled the [The Fourth Wall], as
well as the sentences above it, shattering into million pieces. What went
wrong? Did the world perish because I tried to change the story?

It was then, [The Fourth Wall] said something completely unexpected.

⸢Ti me not mov ing be cau se not re ading not ima gin ing⸥

Even before I could ask about the meaning of that, some creatures appeared
first.

⸢(Have you finally broken the wall, the apostle of eternity and epilogue?)⸥

⸢(…Such a day has indeed arrived before us.)⸥

They were the librarians 'Devourer of Dreamss' and 'Simulation'. I stared at
them first before addressing [The Fourth Wall].

"Let me out of here. There's something I need to confirm."

That prompted the librarians to reply, instead.
⸢(Even if it's you, you still won't survive by going outside. <Star Stream>
no longer exists. Everything in that place has now come to a dead stop.)⸥
Everything had stopped.

For sure, the Stories that could normally be heard over the wall couldn't be
heard anymore. Instead, the noise akin to a giant spring winding up could
be heard coming from somewhere. It was at once like the ticking of a
watch's second hand, or even the sound of very consistent but slow,
rhythmic typing of a keyboard.

"In that case, I'll go and meet the guy that'll wind the clock back."

⸢(…Do you really wish to go and meet the 'Oldest Dream'?)⸥

That being was at the final stop of all these stories. <Star Stream> might
have been destroyed, but there was a question that needed to be answered
still.

⸢Why did a world like this have to exist?⸥

I looked back to discover my companions making similar expressions to
each other. Every one of us had their own questions they wanted answers
for, and had certain ends they wanted to see. And in order to get there, there
was something we definitely had to do first.

Yoo Sangah spoke up first.

"Let's go together, Dokja-ssi."

"Me too! I wanna go!"

"I'm really curious about the epilogue you wanted to see, ahjussi."

"There, there. Let's not agonise about this, shall we? Who knows, maybe
a really nice Dokkaebi is waiting for us there or something. If not, we
can smack him around for a bit and make him more agreeable, too." As if
to agree with that, Biyoo added her own opinion.

[Baat!]

It was around then that Yoo Joonghyuk broke the silence he had been
observing.

"Before that, do you even have a way to meet him? The wall might be
destroyed, but the time flow of the outside world has stopped. If time isn't
moving, Stories cannot move forward. It will be the same for us."

⸢(There are some places where time hasn't stopped.)⸥

Nirvana smiled and pointed to the floor.

Right. The time inside this 'library' hadn't stopped at all.

"Could that bastard be inside this library?"

⸢(…That's not it. This library is also just another 'wall'. However, a new
passageway has opened up after you have completed the story. Meaning,
you can now cross over to the other side.)⸥

While saying that, Nirvana guided us somewhere. Somehow, I thought I
knew where he was taking us. I recalled the cliff that spanned below the
library.

⸢This is the end of the library. The end of all stories.⸥

The vast, bottomless pit. A valley laid out like the abyss itself.

It was the location I discovered back when I entered [The Fourth Wall] for
the first time.

"…It's exactly that place."
I almost fell to the bottom there when I first stumbled in here. Back then,
Nirvana told me that if I fell in there, I'd die for sure. He said that was
'beyond the wall'.

Nirvana asked me. ⸢(Kim Dokja. Do you really wish to go over there?)⸥

I nodded my head.

Then, Nirvana pulled at a rope hanging from the darkness. I thought
something like a pulley was activating, then a small elevator-like thing
slowly rose up from below.

⸢(Get on.)⸥

We all climbed aboard this elevator.

Then we were slowly lowered into the pit.

[Exclusive attribute, 'One Who Looked into the Abyss', is initialising.]

Finally, the answers I've been searching for was right before my eyes.
Stories still remaining within me were getting agitated as well.

Just how long did we climb down like this? We were eventually greeted by
the sounds of the pulley stopping.

I stepped foot on the darkness, only to be greeted by mouldy smell. The
floor was slick and damp, too; almost like the remnants of a structure that
hadn't been used for a very long time.

The light from the lantern illuminated the front to reveal a faint line made
up of yellowish blocks.

"Isn't this place…"

Jung Heewon muttered to herself. And right then, we heard the noise of
something rushing towards us from the darkness past the yellow blocks. As
a matter of fact, the darkness itself was shaking ominously now. It was a
loud, explosive noise, as if a monster was madly dashing towards us.

A short while later, a pair of faint monstrous eyes appeared from the other
side of the passageway.

"…Oh, my god."

Jung Heewon muttered out, but didn't reach for her sword even after
witnessing what kind of a monster it was. The rest of the companions
reacted the same, as well. All because everyone knew exactly what that
monster was.

⸢The beginning of all these stories.⸥

It was the subway.
            Chapter 513: Ep. 99 - The Oldest Dream, II


The subway train slowed down before coming to a stop before us, and then,
opened its doors.

There was no mistaking it. This was the subway we all recognised.

Jung Heewon's lips bobbed up and down before finally breaking the silence
first. "Why would a subway show up here…?"

Of course, no one here could answer that question.

The first one to make his move was Lee Gilyoung. Yoo Sangah shouted
out. "Gilyoung-ah! You mustn't get on that t…!"

The boy fearlessly stepped foot inside and climbed aboard the subway, and
turned around to look at us. As if nothing was going on, he shrugged his
shoulders.

Lee Jihye watched that spectacle, then grabbed Shin Yoosung's hand and
stepped forward as well. "I don't know anymore. Let's just get in first and
see what's what!"
That was the beginning; other companions still hesitating entered the
subway one by one. I too followed after them.

The moment I set foot on the floor of the subway that trembled ever so
slightly, I was overcome with deja vu.

⸢Once upon a time, this was all of Kim Dokja's world.⸥

No, that was wrong. This was not my world.

⸢This was everyone's and anyone's world.⸥

For Yoo Sangah, Jung Heewon, Lee Hyunsung, and Lee Jihye, too…
Everyone carried their own, different expressions. Just like how I rode on
this subway and lived my daily life, it should roughly be the same story
with them as well.

Someone used to be an office worker, someone was a student, and someone
used to be a soldier, but still…

"A subway, is it… Back then, I was really fed up of riding it, but now, I'm
really happy to see it again."

Jung Heewon's words made us carefully scan the interior of the subway
itself.

All the seats were brand new, while the safety bars were wiped clean, too.
Not even a hint of filth could be seen on the floor.

Of course, what proved to be even more surprising than that was…

"…By the way, why isn't anyone else riding in this thing?"

Not a single presence could be felt within the subway. This was a sterile,
inorganic space where nothing was alive besides us. This vehicle was
permeated with such a sense of abnormality.
I looked at the librarians remaining outside the subway and asked them.
"Aren't you joining us? You wanted to witness the end of the world too,
didn't you?"

⸢(We can't go with you.)⸥

"How come?"

Nirvana and the other librarians didn't answer. They exchanged somewhat
saddened gazes with each other, before finally making their reply.

⸢(You witnessing the end will be enough for…)⸥

[The doors are closing.]

The rest of their words couldn't be heard; the doors shut close, and
accompanied by the noises of a giant cartwheel turning, the subway began
chugging forward. Its speed was neither quick nor slow. And outside the
windows, we saw the view of the pitch-black darkness lazily shifting past
us.

I gazed into that darkness for a long time. Just where was this train taking
us?

"It's the line number three."

Han Sooyoung muttered that out. I also looked up at the subway map.

The line number three. It was the line that I used to commute every day.
Strangely, though, the ends of the map were broken off. Even the names of
the stations were erased, as well.

…

Meanwhile, the subway continued to chug along. Several minutes passed by
since then, but it showed no signs of stopping. It seemed that this vehicle
was planning to run straight to its final stop without a break.
With a 'plop!' noise, Han Sooyoung settled down on the cushion next to
mine. She glared at the subway map, her long eyelashes blinking
constantly.

I asked her. "What's up with that expression?"

"I don't ride on stuff like subways."

"Why not?"

Almost immediately, I realized what a dumb question that was. For sure,
someone like her wouldn't have a need to ride on subways, anyway. What
she said next was completely out of my expectations, though.

"I mean, there's nothing to see here. Both inside and out."

We both stared at the broken subway map. Without a doubt, a subway train
would travel the exact same line every single day. It would then stop at the
predetermined time. Similar things would continue to happen within these
unchanging sceneries every day.

I also hated subways. I used to stare at the smartphone during commuting
for a similar reason to hers, too.

"Subways don't operate for our amusement, though."

"…Oh, my? Now that's not something the Constellation 'Demon King
of Salvation' would say." I smiled bitterly.

We stared in the same direction next – at our companions. At the people
who endured the apocalypse with me, cleared 99 scenarios together, and
reached this place.

"…Mm. We won't suddenly go back to the first scenario or something like
that, right?"

"No, that can't be! Definitely not!"
"Should I ready some grasshoppers just in case?"

The companions saw Lee Gilyoung clenching his fist with a resolute
expression, and broke out in smirks.

What did it mean to find humour from the most horrifying memory they
held? With what kind of thoughts were they smiling at that story?

I spoke to Han Sooyoung. "They need to go back to their old lives."

"You think they'll be happier like that?"

"All stories are supposed to end that way."

"And since when did you start enjoying that sort of development?" Han
Sooyoung shot back with a retort. "Hey, you. You aren't thinking up of
anything weird again, right? Are you hiding something from me again?"

"I'd like to, but I've nothing to hide anymore."

I was being honest. Even the original novel never reached this far. It was
the same story for the 'Secretive Plotter' or the other individuals from the
999th turn. We were the first to ride on this subway.

I spoke up while looking at the end of the faintly-erased subway map.

"Han Sooyoung, I think…"

"Could it be that a final boss is waiting for us there? Isn't that how it
normally is?"

Jung Heewon said that. She wasn't talking to me, however. It seemed that
the companions were busy discussing something over there. Shin Yoosung
added her opinion.

"Maybe there's a dragon this big."

"But, I don't think a Modifier like the 'Oldest Dream' would get assigned to
a dragon. To get a Modifier like that, it must be…"
"Couldn't it be the 'author'?"

"The author?"

"You know, that…"

When Lee Gilyoung saying that shifted his gaze in my direction, the other
companions seemed to abruptly recall 'it' too, and all turned their heads
towards me.

⸢⸢Three Ways to Survive a Destroyed World⸥⸥.

They also knew about that novel now. They knew that that novel described
the stories of this world, and that only I had read it to its conclusion.

"…What do you think, Dokja-ssi?"

Every novel out there couldn't become 'stories' unless a writer wrote them
down first. The suspicion my companions held some weight if this world
was based off on the 'Ways of Survival'.

For sure, there was a good chance that the 'Oldest Dream' was the writer. I
too thought that way.

However, why do I…

"…I don't think the 'Oldest Dream' is the author of the 'Ways of Survival'."

"Why do you think that?"

"I'm not sure, but I have a hunch."

To me, the being at the end of this line didn't seem like it'd be 'tls123'. I
recalled what the Dokkaebi King said back then.

⸢[Rather than an author, you could say that the 'Oldest Dream' is much
closer to being a reader. It's not an existence that writes stories for someone
else. It's lazy and can be quite greedy.]⸥
I even began questioning whether an 'author' was necessary in our current
hypothesis. Did this world really begin because of tls123?

Maybe tls123 simply alerted me to the already-existing world, instead?

Just like how the 'Secretive Plotter' or the other individuals from the 999th
turn existed even though they weren't recorded in the pages…

"Now that I think about, I'm curious. Dokja-ssi, how did you stumble across
that novel in the first place?"

"Ahh, I was also curious about that."

Yoo Joonghyuk disinterestedly polishing the [Black Heavenly Demon
Sword] shifted his gaze towards me when that topic was brought up. Jang
Hayoung asked as her eyes sparkled.

"Was it like some kind of a fateful attraction?"

"I also know something about such a feeling! The first time I held a grenade
back when I was a private, I…!"

"I just came across it while browsing the net, actually."

Companions seemed to be disappointed by my reply. But, nothing could be
done about that, because it's true. Han Sooyoung then retorted back.

"What did you search for exactly, to find such a crappy novel?"

"That is…"

I couldn't remember it all that well now.

Lee Jihye shrugged her shoulders. "Oh, well. It's not that important now,
right? The only thing that matters is that ahjussi did read that novel
somehow."
"That's right. What would've happened if Dokja-ssi didn't read that

novel?" I looked at Yoo Sangah grinning brightly and shut my mouth

tightly.

I didn't deserve to hear those words.

⸢In the end, stars fell and the world came to a stop.⸥

We were marching towards a conclusion no one in the 'Ways of Survival'
managed to reach, but there was no guarantee that what I wanted was
waiting at the end of the line.

I too had no knowledge of the things about to happen from now on.

⸢What if it was someone else who read that novel to its end?⸥

There were better-suited people than me here. The righteous Jung Heewon,
the trusty Lee Hyunsung, the straight-shooter Yoo Sangah, they should've
been the one to read the novel. If that happened, maybe the world would've
ended up in a far better shape than this.

"Thank you, ahjussi. For reading that novel."

Shin Yoosung matched my eye level and was now smiling.

"That's right. I heard that novel was really boring, too. If it really wasn't for
Dokja-ssi…"

"If it was me, I probably couldn't get past the first page. I really hate books,
you know?"

"I tried to read a couple of books back inside the <Oz>'s military library,
but… As expected, me and reading were not really a…"

While looking at Lee Hyunsung scratching his head, I somehow managed
to force my mouth shut.
Because the 'Ways of Survival' existed, the people before me existed, too.
And because I read that novel, I was able to save them from the dangers.

"I…"

I, someone of no redeeming quality, could be loved by the others.

"Because of the Stories you taught me, I managed to get this far, hyung."
The kids' small hands were tightly holding onto mine.

I slowly raised my head, and saw the darkness of the subway streaming by.
And the Stories we lived through were passing us by within that darkness.

We silently observed those Stories. They were as beautiful as the Milky
Way in the wintery night sky, yet just as futile as the fireworks going off.
Stories that none among us could forget, but we'd do so eventually. Jung
Heewon opened her mouth.

"…Dokja-ssi. I think it's fine to ask this now, so…"

I knew already what she wanted to ask me.

"What exactly is the 'conclusion' you want to see, Dokja-ssi?"

No Constellations were looking at us now. Even <Star Stream> that ruled
over the world no longer existed. So, there was no reason to… not tell
them.

"I've already… seen one of them."

I carefully peered into the faces of all my companions. No sentences floated
up on their expressions. Even then, I could tell what the conclusion I
wanted to see from their faces.

"And the other one is to repay my debt."

"Your debt?"

I shifted my head to discover Yoo Joonghyuk glaring at me.
Ku-gugugu…

Along with the dull vibration, the train's speed began to decrease little by
little.

We slowly got up from our seats. Once-noisy companions began speaking
less and less. Nervousness was filling up their expressions.

I slowly approached the exit. Jung Heewon stood to my left, while Yoo
Joonghyuk was on my right.

The Stories passing by in the darkness were slowing down.

It wasn't just our story existing out there, however.

⸢There was the 0th turn, then the first turn.⸥

Also, the second, and the third turns, too.

⸢And that's how 1864 regression cycles have gathered, and in turn, opened
up this world.⸥
Countless Yoo Joonghyuks lived through those turns. Although none of
them lived the right way, not one could be called wrong, too.

The world was far too cruel a place to debate the ethics of life, and the
volume of despair was far too great to tell the tale of hope. However, Yoo
Joonghyuk remained resolute because he didn't try to justify himself.

⸢His sole desire to see the end of this world.⸥

I too carried that same desire.

That was the dream of 1865 Yoo Joonghyuks existing from the 0th to the
1864th regression turns, and the end of the world that I wanted, too.

"…It's really been long. Wasn't it?"
Yoo Joonghyuk shot back, as if to question what the hell I was even saying
here. "It's only been four years, Kim Dokja. Compared to the time I
experienced, it's…"

"Right."

Four years. That was how long we had been fighting together.

"Four years that felt like a lifetime."

When I said that, Jung Heewon to my left lightly poked me with her
sword's hilt.

"We'll still stick together from now on too, so why do you sound so grimly
determined? Don't worry. No matter what kind of a monster is waiting for
us, I'll finish it off."

I gently smiled. Meanwhile, the subway was slowing down even further.

My reflection could be seen in the black window of the exit door. There
was a splatter of blood on my cheek reflected on the glass. I wiped it off my
face. And then, my mood cooled down.

⸢The blood was really on my cheek, and not on the window.⸥

"Doors are opening!"

Along with Lee Hyunsung's cry, everyone got ready to fight.

"…Huh?"

However, contrary to everyone's nervousness, what greeted us was a rather
empty subway platform. Sure, there were a few people walking around in
the surroundings, but none of them paid us much attention.

"What's this, there's no…"
Jung Heewon muttered that out, and as we stepped onto the platform, I was
overcome with an ominous foreboding. There it was, the unfamiliar sense
of reality touching my feet. Faint sparks, along with every single one of my
Stories, were pointing in a certain direction.

⸢Someone was sitting on the subway's bench.⸥

A thick school bag filled with textbooks, as if its owner had left school not
too long ago. A thin, small-statured child who might have passed off as an
elementary schooler were it not for his school uniform, was sitting on that
bench.

As if he was trying to memorise English words, he was busy scribbling
something like a chart on his notebook.

As the pulsing migraine assaulted me, I somehow managed to lift my
unmoving feet.

⸢Kim Dokja made a promise. To end the culprit who made this world. No
matter what that existence was.⸥
Maybe, he was struck by someone somewhere? There was a big bruising on
the kid's pale arm. A bruising that I could more or less figure out where he
got it from. All strength left my legs and I couldn't move anymore.

⸢Time isn't moving because not reading and not imagining.⸥

I did think that all of this could be a dream, a lie. I even believed that this
was a dream the evil <Star Stream> had created.

But now, I couldn't deny it anymore.

All of my senses were telling me the truth; they said that that child was the
culprit behind all these scenarios.

⸢Y ou we re al rea dy ex pec ting this di dn't you Kim Dok ja.⸥
The Oldest Dream. The world's most omniscient yet powerless god.

['The Fourth Wall's' influence is getting weaker.]

⸢Kim Dok…⸥

['The Fourth Wall's' influence is getting extremely weak.]

I thought I heard something fall to the floor, and I saw Jung Heewon's
sword rolling around on the ground.

"Ah, ah…"

She was now looking at me. She was looking at the child, then back at me.
Her eyes were filling up with despair.

As if she couldn't believe this. As if she'd prefer that this whole thing turned
out to be a lie.

[The promise with the 'Secretive Plotter' is activating.]

I opened my mouth only to close it several times. Maybe, this might be my
punishment. It might very well be the time to pay the price for the salvation
I received.

[You have promised to destroy <Star Stream>.]

[<Star Stream> will not be destroyed unless the 'Oldest Dream' is ended.]

I now stared at the child.

At the child with the exact same face as mine.

And the boy slowly raised his head to look back at me.

[Please end the 'Oldest Dream'.]
            Chapter 514: Ep. 99 - The Oldest Dream, III


My consciousness kept trying to blank out.

⸢What would it be like if the 'Ways of Survival' was real?⸥

Whether that was my own thoughts, or something that was recorded on the
[Final Wall], or maybe even…

⸢If there was a world where I can fight alongside the characters from the
'Ways of Survival'…⸥
…The imaginations of the 'Oldest Dream', I couldn't be sure.

Countless memories rushed in like a sudden incoming wave. Imaginations
that unfolded in a messy cacophony became the fuel for the stories in
another world. The living reality had become the 'tragedy'.
⸢Wait, now that I think about it, what happens to the old world after Yoo
Joonghyuk regresses? …I should ask the author-nim in the comment
section.⸥

I always thought that I remembered the 'Ways of Survival' better than
anyone else. I was proud that I had read the novel diligently, much more so
than anyone else, too. So why couldn't I recall much about 'myself' that read
the novel?

Maybe, I was…

[You have become the 'Character'.]

Sparks overflowed above my Incarnation Body. [The Fourth Wall]'s
functions were coming to a halt. My heart was madly pounding away, and
unidentifiable screams reverberated within my devastated mind. My head
faltered, and I somehow managed to suck in several deep breaths.

[The Fourth Wall] was right. Maybe, I already knew.

There were simply too many hints.

⸢I was far too lucky in this world, and⸥

⸢Everything in this world seemed to be geared towards my convenience,
and⸥

⸢At times, this world even felt sloppy.⸥

If all of these were the result of the 'Oldest Dream's blessing, then…

⸢The genesis of all the world-lines, the original world-line.⸥

I raised my head back up, then clenched my energyless fists slowly. [The
Fourth Wall] was no longer around, but my mind was calm. No, I had to
believe that I was calm.
Only I knew the conclusion of this world.

Giiiii-iiing…

The Unbroken Faith screeched out. I slowly walked forward.

The boy raised his head up from the notebook to look at me.

Tsu-chuchuchu!

"…Uh??"

The boy's eyes, that didn't know anything.

I couldn't avoid that gaze. Those were the eyes of a child who had no one to
rely on in this world, somehow managing to carry on day by day.

The boy busy rubbing his eyes hard as if he saw phantoms, was looking at
me.

⸢In order to destroy <Star Stream>, the 'Oldest Dream' must be stopped.⸥

I had made up my mind at the beginning of <Star Stream>, and even
promised the 'Secretive Plotter'. To eliminate the culprit of all these
tragedies. And finally, that opportunity had come.

['Demon King Transformation' is activating.]

Pitch-black wings spread out from the torn shoulder blades. The boy's eyes
looking at me widened.

"Ah, ah…??"

A voice that felt so ancient. Right, I used to possess such a voice in the past,
didn't I? I walked one step at a time towards such a child.

['Angel Transformation' is activating.]
As the child's face grew closer, I got to see so many other things. Such as
the notebook the boy was scribbling on. There was a chart recording the
power balance of the 'Ways of Survival'; it was the very same chart that I
compiled once upon a time.

Yoo Joonghyuk, Lee Hyunsung, Shin Yoosung, Lee Jihye, Lee Seolhwa,
Kim Namwoon, Anna Croft… Next to the densely packed names, their
Stigmata and Skills were recorded. And finally, even the bruising on the
back of the boy's hand covering up his own untidy handwriting.

I knew the history this boy had survived, and the future he'd get to live out;
what would happen to this child in the future, and what sort of misery lay in
wait for him.

⸢All of those years, just how much of a meaning was in them?⸥

He'd get targetted by the school gang and suffer serious bullying.

He'd get abandoned by his relatives and start living alone far too soon. And
wherever he went, he'd be pursued by the reporters hunting him down.

He'd make a mistake during the university entrance exam and end up in a
third-rate school.

He'd get unlucky and pull the shortest straw during the boot camp, and get
assigned to the front lines.

He'd fill himself up everyday with triangular-shaped kimbap bought from
the local convenience store.

And eventually, stumble into a job with some no-name company by the
skin of his teeth and eke out a living that way.

During the period of ten years, he'd get to finish reading a certain novel,
and after surviving by reading that novel, he'd drive everyone he loved to
utter misery.

That boy would grow up to become Kim Dokja.
"M-monster…"

The child was opening his mouth while looking at me.

"That's right, I'm a monster."

My appearance was reflected on the boy's irises.

⸢That monster was this child's future.⸥

Now was the only chance to stop that monster.

Everything happened in the blink of an eye. Me, trying to rush forward with
my sword raised up, and Han Sooyoung's fist striking me in the face, all of
them.

"----!!"

I couldn't really hear her voice. She was shouting something at me. Her
reddened eyes were filled with tears. Her fists were pounding down on my
chest, before her rough hands tried to hold onto my shoulders.

"…Dokja!!"

I shoved her away. And then, took another step forward. Even though the
distance was only a few meters, I couldn't easily cross it. All of my Stories
were rebelling against me.

Powerful sparks enveloping my entire frame suppressed me. My feet didn't
want to leave the floor, and my hands refused to move.

The child's expression as he looked at me was one of terror. His chin
trembled nonstop, so did his eyes. Those eyes, trying to decipher whether
this was reality or not.

[The 'Oldest Dream' is questioning your existence.]
The existence that dreamed of all these worlds. And in his dream, I too was
nothing more than just another character.

Tsu-chuchuchuchut!

[The 'Oldest Dream' is denying your existence.]

As if he wanted to reject reality, the child hugged his head and curled up.
"I, I'm, I'm Yoo Joonghyuk… I'm…"

The chant that had been recited tens of thousands of times.

⸢There is a protective barrier around me.⸥

⸢Nobody can harm me.⸥

⸢Nothing can touch me.⸥

The thoughts he used to escape from the pain when the gangs beat him up,
began leaking out. The power that rendered reality into not-reality.

And that power was now being applied in the opposite manner.

"Ahjus-!!"

This really small but absolute being was now thinking of everything before
him as his own delusions. An opaque barrier was generating with the child's
figure as its center, resembling a pitch-black sphere. It was the sturdiest
protective barrier that the 'Oldest Dream' could create.

I cried out like a devil and rushed towards the barrier to swing my sword.
As the worlds collided, a blindingly-bright explosion of light went off.

The blade of the Unbroken Faith easily broke apart and flew in the air. I
stared helplessly at the flying blade piece.

⸢I can't kill him.⸥
It was impossible for a way to kill him to exist. If this story began from the
dream of the younger me, then the rules of this world were thought up by
him, too.

Winds powerfully blowing in from somewhere roughly flipped the pages of
the child's fallen notebook. When the flipping stopped, the setting of the
'Ways of Survival' the younger me jotted down could be seen on the page.

– The Disconnected Film Theory: a theory that explains the overlapping of
the world-lines in the Ways of Survival, and it…

As the sparks faintly danced about, I dazedly read the contents. I read it,
and then, read it some more. I bent down to pick up the broken blade. Then,
opened up all the Stories still remaining in me.

I stared at the black sphere surrounding the boy and spoke up. "…I know
you better than anyone in this world."

⸢Don'ttormentmeDon'ttormentmeDon'ttormentme⸥

"I'm not trying to torment you."

⸢I want to run away.⸥

"I know.

⸢But, where to?⸥

The child's story was transmitted to me, while mine also was transmitted to
him.

Tsu-chuchuchut!

There were less than two hand spans of broken blade remaining in the
Unbroken Faith. However, that was sufficient enough to carry out my plan.

⸢The method to end the 'Oldest Dream'.⸥
[The 'Disconnected Film Theory' is activating!]

[Your existence is resonating with the 'Oldest Dream'!]

I then stabbed the blade into my neck with every ounce of my energy.

The loud 'Puh-wook!' noise resounded out. Crimson blood dripped onto the
floor like teardrops.

"Kim Dokja."

The blood belonged to Yoo Joonghyuk. The blade was stopped mid-air
right before my neck, unable to move an inch. Blue veins were bulging on
Yoo Joonghyuk's hand holding the blade tightly.

"All of you, hold him down!!"

It wasn't just Yoo Joonghyuk, though – someone had grabbed me
from behind to suppress me. "Dokja-ssi, this is wrong!" It was Lee
Hyunsung.

Both of my arms were grabbed, too. Jung Heewon and Yoo Sangah were
responsible.

"…Please, stop!"

"There must be another way. There has to be."

Lee Jihye was hugging my waist, while I could see Shin Yoosung and Lee
Gilyoung holding onto each of my legs.

And then, I saw Han Sooyoung pounding on the barrier of the 'Oldest
Dream' in my stead. "Open up! We didn't come here to harm you! We just
want to talk to you for a bit…!"

Even then, the barrier was only getting thicker. I knew the truth; that thing
would never open up.
I held the sword's hilt even harder. "This is the only way."

Jang Hayoung shouted out. "Please, please stop!! There's still time! We still
have…!"

No, we didn't have time. The longer we wasted here, the harsher and
heavier the sparks surrounding us became.

[The 'Oldest Dream' is denying your existence.]

The child would continue to 'deny' us. Then, he'd erase his delusions. He
would turn the reality of another world into something that's not reality.

That was why, the only one who could do this was…

Ku-gugugu…

Thick fog suddenly came in from somewhere, and I picked up on the
ominous power of Chaos. Yoo Joonghyuk's expression as he held the blade
became weird.

"Y-you bastard…"

As he staggered about, the pitch-black Story leaked out from his mouth.
That Story gurgled out and travelled down his chin, hit the floor, and
finally, formed the silhouette of a person.

The blade of the [Splitting the Sky Sword] gleamed between the jet-black
coat; a man who only lived for this moment was standing there now.

⸢The Secretive Plotter.⸥

The being who had even forgotten about his real name after experiencing
countless regression turns. The man who lived only for the purpose of
revenge was here.

He glanced in my direction, before slowly approaching the protective
barrier.
The 'Secretive Plotter' ignored the dancing sparks and walked forward. In
that exact moment, the 'Oldest Dream's' Story came streaming into me.

⸢'I wanted to become like Yoo Joonghyuk'.⸥

Goosebumps rose up on my arms gradually.

Why have I forgotten about the memories that ruled over my childhood?

⸢The protagonist stronger than anyone in this universe.⸥

It was obvious that the 'Secretive Plotter' wouldn't be affected by the sparks.
Just how many times have I thought about this within my imaginations
continuing on like some kind of obsession?

⸢No human can control every type of imagination.⸥

Just how often have I recited that name every time bruises appeared on my
arms and legs, and every time my lips burst open?

⸢And that's why the most ideal person to end this dream had already been
determined.⸥
My sword slowly slipped out of my grasp. From here onwards, it was no
longer my job. I just couldn't get in the way of this world's most fair
revenge.

"Secretive Plotter!!"

Han Sooyoung cried out and ran towards him. So did Jung Heewon, Lee
Jihye, and even the kids, too. As if they had realized what the horrible thing
he was about to commit would be.

Unfortunately, my companions couldn't approach him as if a transparent
wall was blocking them. And only the 'Secretive Plotter' alone crossed the
platform and reached the bench with the child sitting on it.
He wielded the sword loaded with the powers of [Breaking the Sky Energy]
and sliced apart the pitch-black sphere. When he did, the child curling up
like a new born baby curled up even further.

"I'm Yoo Joonghyuk. I'm Yoo Joonghyuk. I'm…"

The child continued to tremble under the faint rays of light.

【You are not Yoo Joonghyuk.】

The regressor who had forgotten about his name through the eternity of
regressions. Such a man was now announcing his name.

"I am 'Yoo Joonghyuk'."
               Chapter 515: Ep. 99 - The Oldest Dream, IV


That was the real voice of Yoo Joonghyuk, the one that lived through 1864
lives. That voice was the evidence of the history starting from the 0th turn
all the way to 1863rd. And the protagonist of that voice was saying this: he
was none other than Yoo Joonghyuk, and he was none other than the
protagonist of the 'Ways of Survival'.

"I, I'm, I…"

The child shuddered pitifully, yet he couldn't open his eyes. As if he
already knew his entire world would crumble the moment he did. [The
'Oldest Dream' is denying his own dream!]

⸢This is just an illusion just an illusion just an illusion⸥

"This is no illusion."

At the same time as the 'Secretive Plotter' said his piece, sentences began
streaming all around the child. They were texts from the 'Ways of Survival'
that the boy read, that I read together with him.
Sentences that kept me alive, and eventually would kill me, too.

And a certain man was speaking up within those sentences.

⸢"Lee Hyunsung. It's not over yet."⸥

⸢"Do not worry. I shall definitely end this <Star Stream>."⸥

⸢"I will never forget you, Shin Yoosung."⸥

Those vivid sentences soon became stories. Stories were imagined, and the
imagination was recreated as reality in a different world-line.

Not knowing that such a thing was happening in another reality, the boy
kept desiring the story's continuation.

⸢"To the next regression turn, and then, to the next one."⸥

To survive, the boy imagined. While being pressured by his relatives, while
being bullied by the school gangs.

To not feel the pain, he thought about the next part of the story.

⸢"I shall survive no matter what, and witness the end of these scenarios."⸥

He felt solace while looking at the unyielding protagonist. And within that
solace, he wished for the protagonist to not give up until the end.

⸢Author-nim, for how long will Yoo Joonghyuk's regression continue on?⸥

He wished for this regression journey to never come to an end.

Tsu-chuchu…

The 'Secretive Plotter' didn't say anything as he watched the boy's memories
stream by.
⸢He should be remembering every one of these events.⸥

All those resolutions he had never forgotten from the 0th turn all the way to
the 1863rd.

My companions and I also watched those. Yoo Joonghyuk had collapsed
after the 'Secretive Plotter' left his body; he was groaning heavily from all
the memories flooding in. Shin Yoosung was continuously shedding her
tears, while Lee Jihye plopped down on the ground. Lee Hyunsung and
Jung Heewon too were trying to endure while supporting each other's
trembling shoulders.

Now, they all knew. They knew now that the Secretive Plotter needed to be
compensated for his life.

"B-but, but, even then…"

Shin Yoosung muttered as if she was in a religious trance, and looked up at
me. As if she wanted me to tell her how to overcome this situation.

"Secretive Plotter! Stop! I said, stop!!"

Only Han Sooyoung alone resisted the shower of sparks right before her
face and swung her fists constantly towards the empty air. However, the
'Secretive Plotter' didn't look back.

⸢And so, the 'Pilgrim of the Lonely Apocalypse' had reached the end of his
pilgrimage.⸥
The [Splitting the Sky Sword] that broke over and over again only to be
patched up, was now quietly crying out.

⸢Finally, his Constellation backer was before his eyes.⸥

"It was you."

The child's shoulder trembled pitifully as if he was having a nightmare.
⸢This was a weak lifeform that could be killed off in an instant.⸥

His Splitting the Sky Sword screeched out viciously once more. This was
the sword that cut down countless Constellations. Not even Poseidon, not
Zeus, not Nuwa, and not even the Dokkaebi King could escape from this
very blade. No star in existence could survive after daring to oppose him.

Here was the opportunity for his revenge, reached after experiencing 1864
lifetimes.

The [Splitting the Sky Sword] slowly moved.

"Secretive Plotter!! No, wait! Yoo Joonghyuk-!!"

Neither Han Sooyoung nor I could stop it. This event, it simply had to
happen. Shin Yoosung tightly holding my hand was crying. Unable to close
her mouth, and gasping uncontrollably.

Everything would end with this.

I would no longer need to consume someone else's story. Yoo Joonghyuk
would be freed from his lengthy journey of regression.

⸢However, why wasn't that sword moving even now?⸥

The Secretive Plotter's Splitting the Sky Sword continued to wander in the
air. The blade that threatened to cut the boy down at any moment was now
simply brushing aside the eggshell-like protective barrier around the child,
instead.

⸢Even though its outer shell has been shattered, this bird couldn't fly off to
anywhere.⸥
The boy's figure trembled uncontrollably. Ominous-feeling Stories were
now circling around him.

⸢"Hey, this guy's drawing something in his notebook again!"⸥
⸢"Tsk, tsk. He's so much like his mother…"⸥

⸢"Are you Kim Dokja? By any chance, do you know where your mother is
right now? Mm… I see. Don't you resent your mother? What was your
mother like in the past?"⸥

⸢"For how long are you going to keep quiet? If you don't say anything, the
whole world will misunderstand you."⸥
Slice.

The [Heave Shaking Sword] wandering in the air accurately cut down the
sentences of those memories. The boy's trembling shoulders shook a little
less than before.

⸢But, why?⸥

My mind was thrown into disarray.

⸢How come?⸥

It was then that a true voice resounded out.

【…Is this boy 'him'?】

A man with a hulking physique rose up from the Secretive Plotter's shadow.
It was the 999th turn's Lee Hyunsung. The Plotter nodded his head.

"Correct. This kid is my sponsor."

【Now this pisses me off. This little kid was the culprit of it all??】

Even the 999th turn's Kim Namwoon and Lee Jihye were here, too.

They were the Outer Gods that endured the 999th turn. It wasn't only Yoo
Joonghyuk who wanted to destroy <Star Stream>, and end the 'Oldest
Dream'.
"No."

【What was that? In that case…】

The 'Secretive Plotter' looked around at his vicinity instead of replying.

The clamour of people flooding in and out just to catch the subway could be
heard coming from the platform in the distance. He looked back, and the
train we rode on was already gone.

Instead, there was a Daehwa Station-bound train that would ferry
passengers to their unknown destination in this normal world. And then, the
crowd of people brushing past us as if they couldn't see us at all.

 –         This station is Daehwa…

People climbing aboard the subway even before the passengers could
disembark first; people pushing and shoving each other, or hurling insults
in other's directions. A granny was pushed aside by the disembarking wave
of people and fell down. No one tried to aid her. The very first person to
witness her plight was an old man sitting on the seats reserved for pregnant
mothers.

He stared at the granny for a little while, before unfurling a newspaper he
pulled out to cover up his vision. And above that newspaper, a headline of
an article could be seen.

 –         The criminal's essay will be published.

It was an article that I knew quite intimately. Many people read that,
chatted about, and then, forgot about that article.

⸢A tragedy with nothing special about it. At most, it was a tragedy that
occurred to just one life.⸥
The 'Secretive Plotter' and the Outer Gods were now looking at my Story.
Their sorrowful eyes were looking at this tragedy that only went on for a
little over a dozen or so years.

【…Oh, you sad, pitiful child.】

I shuddered almost out of pure shock from those words.

My own tragedy couldn't even compare to their pain. The sin of creating an
even bigger tragedy because of my own should not be forgiven.

【Oh, hear ye, my dear god. I have endured a truly lengthy period of time
just to meet you, but…】

The 999th turn's Uriel reached out and touched the younger me's cheek.

【You are this universe's most powerless existence, aren't you.】

The child's body shuddered once more.

I staggered unsteadily back to my feet.

【…Is that why you needed us? This is a very cruel request for help,
indeed.】

【You couldn't even control your own imagination, is that it?】

Something was wrong. A blade… I, I needed to find a blade.

The 999th turn's characters were exchanging glances. For a quiet moment
there, they were looking into each other.

The first one to open her mouth was the 999th turn's Lee Jihye.

【It's fine with me. However, will it be okay with you? You came here just
for this, didn't you?】

It was rather clear who she was talking to.
The 'Secretive Plotter' paused for a little bit before replying to her.

"It has been difficult."

This story was not something that could be wrapped up with that single
line.
The tragedy he had experienced must not be simplified like that.

"I wondered why it happened to me. I often wanted to give it all up. I lost
count on how many times I thought about killing myself." The 'Secretive
Plotter' keeping silent for a long time eventually continued on. "However,
someone ensured that I could never give up."

His hatred-filled eyes were not directed at the body. No, he was glaring at
the boy's Story.

Both the 999th turn's Uriel and Lee Hyunsung knelt down and gently
picked the child up in an embrace. Lee Jihye and Kim Namwoon then held
the boy's cold hands.

The 'Secretive Plotter' spoke up as if to proclaim to the world.

"Now, open your eyes, Kim Dokja."

The eyelashes of the child soaked in cold sweat trembled softly. His whole
body shuddered uncontrollably as if he was fighting against a lengthy
nightmare.

And so, how long passed by like this? The child's eyelids slowly opened up.

"Ah, ah, ah…"

The boy's eyes were now looking at the world. He was now looking at the
things he once believed to be his own delusions. He was now looking at the
Archangel and the Emperor of Steelsword embracing him, and at the hands
of both the Delusion Demon and the Naval Admiral. And finally…

"Really… really…?"
And the protagonist of the story he had been watching for so long was right
before him.

"Indeed. This is not a dream."

Inside this weighty silence where no one spoke, the sound of something
shattering could be heard.

Tears trickled down from the child's eyes. I knew what those tears meant,
and I also knew what the 'Secretive Plotter' and the Outer Gods had done
just now, and that was why I felt so tortured inside.

⸢That, that couldn't have been their choice.⸥

A being that lived with a certain story for a very long time would eventually
become unable to escape from that very story. Just like how it was for
Agares, Metatron, the Apocalypse Dragon, and the Dokkaebi King, it was
the same story for the 'Outer Gods', too.

Perhaps, could it be that the choice they made had already been
predetermined from the beginning?

I shouted out in a crying voice.

"He's the 'Oldest Dream'! He needs to die. If he's not dead, then your
tragedies won't end! Your regression, <Star Stream>, all of them-!!"
You must not get devoured by that 'story'.

I don't need your sympathy.

What I really truly want isn't a tale like this.

[Applicable individual is not a 'Character'.]

The 'Secretive Plotter' was now looking back at me with eyes that I couldn't
recognise at all. From within a story that I hadn't read before, he was staring
at me.
It wasn't just him, however; Uriel, Lee Jihye, Kim Namwoon, and even Lee
Hyunsung, too.

[Applicable individual is not a 'Character'.]

[Applicable individual is not a 'Character'.]

[Applicable individual is not a 'Character'.]

[Applicable individual is not a 'Character'.]

I dazedly stared at the continuously-rising messages.

⸢The world's most righteous soldier.⸥

⸢The noblest Archangel.⸥

⸢The general who doesn't tolerate injustice.⸥

⸢The devil filled with hatred towards the world.⸥

⸢The regressor who fought against the system called <Star Stream>.⸥

The 'Secretive Plotter' and the 'Outer Gods' were now looking at the world
of this child; the world that was filled with nearly-undetectable malice that
could only be felt under the careful observation.

Kim Namwoon glared at the Story of such a world and muttered out.

【Even without <Star Stream>, the world remains the same.】

He sounded as if he finally figured out the enemy he needed to fight from
now on. The Stories the 'Secretive Plotter' and the Outer Gods built up were
now baring their fangs at the reality surrounding the child.

⸢At the end of the vast, lengthy pilgrimage, the regressor chose the world he
discovered.⸥
The characters reaching the conclusion were finally breaking out of the tale.
While embracing their god, they were now heading towards a brand new
story.

I shook my head like a madman and crawled towards them.

This must not happen.

I made a promise. To end the 'Oldest Dream'. To end this tragedy.

My hand barely managing to feel around the ground discovered the broken
blade.

I did it. With this, I…

【Kim Dokja.】

The 'Secretive Plotter' called out to me. When I raised my head, he
continued on with what he wanted to say.

【Do you remember the first scenario?】

The first scenario, the 'proof of credentials'.

The 'Secretive Plotter' and the Constellations saw me for the first time
during that scenario.

【You said this to other people back then. That the scenario's clear
condition wasn't to 'kill humans'.】

I recalled the promise I made to him.

– Please finish the 'Oldest Dream'.

The world was blanketed by the blinding rays of light, and my vision grew
blurry. My surprised companions quickly gathered around me.

[You have fulfilled your promise with the 'Secretive Plotter'.]
The young Kim Dokja, now embraced by the Emperor of Steelsword and
the Archangel, was looking at me. Light was starting to return to the child's
eyes that used to wallow in the lengthy dream.

When was the dream supposed to end? That would be…

⸢…When the dream was no longer a dream.⸥

Only then did everything start making sense.

It was the same thing as the 'Oldest Dream' ending the moment Yoo
Joonghyuk of the 'Ways of Survival' reached this place.

The sounds of the next train arriving could be heard coming from the
distance.

[Constellation, 'Secretive Plotter' has reached his ■■.]

At the same time as the 'Secretive Plotter' gave his signal, my companions
and I got sucked into the train that arrived behind us.

"This place is the epilogue of that story."

The characters that saved my childhood were now disappearing beyond the
door.

Just like the 1863rd turn's Yoo Joonghyuk who killed himself to cross over
to the new world-line, they were now stepping into a world that I didn't
know.

Within the rays of light, I saw Yoo Joonghyuk's faint smile.

He looked… liberated.

[The constellation 'Secretive Plotter's' ■■ is 'Oldest Dream'.]
             Chapter 516: Ep. 99 - The Oldest Dream, V


['The Fourth Wall' is reactivating!]

The light in the world flickered on and off several times. I felt the sensation
of my body being sucked into somewhere, and within this half-awake
consciousness, the friction noise of the train's wheel meeting the railroad
tracks filled up my head.

I couldn't accept this.

Even though I knew that this wasn't a matter requiring my acceptance, I still
found it hard to swallow.

⸢Why did the 'Secretive Plotter' make such a decision?⸥

I couldn't forget his final expression.

How could he make such a face? He didn't get to complete what he truly
wanted, so how come…
⸢Wh at did Sec ret ive Pl otter re ally wa nt, th en?⸥

All of the memories regarding the Secretive Plotter flitted in and out of my
head.

The story I got to learn through the original novel's texts – while enduring
such a vast, indeterminable amount of time, what did Yoo Joonghyuk hope
to see at the end of this road?

Just what was it exactly that he expected to encounter?

⸢【Even if it's not a conclusion you wanted… Do not think of this world as
a failed regression turn.】⸥

Only those words remained stuck in my brain like a curse.

⸢Kim Dok ja⸥

'The Fourth Wall' warned me in a stiff voice as if to punish my arrogance.

⸢Thi s not a pro blem y ou ca n ju dge⸥

The wall was right. Even after that guy had left, I couldn't escape from
being this damn 'Constellation'.

Under the brilliant radiance, the figures of 999th turn's Uriel, Lee
Hyunsung, Kim Namwoon, and Lee Jihye scattered away.

Could he really become happier with this?

He made this choice himself, so was that his happiness, then?

He was a being born in the tragedy, so maybe, he wasn't aware of that
choice being another tragedy?

The Stories of the younger me and the 'Secretive Plotter' were getting
further away.
The man looking back in this direction for one last time was no longer Yoo
Joonghyuk from the 'Ways of Survival'.

⸢Be ca use he's b orn in th e tra gedy ca n he fin ish th e tra gedy too⸥

⸢"This place is the epilogue of that story."⸥

The ancient tale I've been reading concluded, just like that.

[You have reached the ■■ of all the scenarios.]

[You have now learned of the secret of the world.]

The only remaining topic for us was on how to live the story's 'ever after'.
The part of the story that the 'Ways of Survival' didn't tell me.

[The 'Oldest Dream' has ended.]

Abruptly, a certain thought popped up in my head. Something that had been
forgotten after being swept up in the situation.

The Dokkaebi King told me this: that this world was a dream of the 'Oldest
Dream'.

⸢In that case, what happens to the characters of the dream after the dream
has come to an end?⸥
The characters from the 999th turn and the 'Secretive Plotter' had all
escaped from the role of 'Characters' and were freed from the dream
through their own will.

If so, what would happen to other people, then?

After the dream was over, the people from the dream would…

[Final scenario clear reward has arrived.]
The noises of a cheek being slapped around resounded out; under the
flickering subway lights, Kim Dokja slowly opened his eyes.

"Hey, you. You awake now?"

He saw Han Sooyoung's face up close as she roughly held him by his
collars.

"…What happened?"

"That's what I want to ask you."

Kim Dokja massaged his head as if he was suffering from migraine, and
stood up from his spot.

"Where are we?"

"Inside the subway. Time for us to head back home, I guess."

Han Sooyoung saying those words seemed rather refreshed, for some
reason.

The train clunked and shook around. The darkness outside the windows
gently wavered about.

"Dokja-ssi, are you alright?"

His companions discovered him and walked in closer. Yoo Sangah, Lee
Hyunsung, Jung Heewon, Shin Yoosung, Lee Gilyoung, Lee Jihye, Jang
Hayoung… and even Yoo Joonghyuk, they were all here.

⸢Everyone was alright.⸥

Kim Dokja slowly looked around him. There was no other presence within
the subway. It was likely that this train was the same one they rode in
earlier.

⸢Are we really safe now?⸥
"I've treated your injuries. Once we return to [The Fourth Wall], we should
entrust you to Seolhwa-ssi's care, but…"

Yoo Sangah feeling for Kim Dokja's pulse faintly smiled. His companions
approached him one by one. However, even though their gazes were fixed
on him, none of them managed to readily open their mouths.

Unexpectedly, the first one to do so was Yoo Joonghyuk. Rather than
approaching Kim Dokja like everyone else, he leaned against the subway's
seat at an angle and glared outside the window.

The universe's Story was coming undone on the outside. The once-tangled
roll of thread was turning into dust and scattering away one strand at a time.

"It's the <Star Stream>."

Stories existing in countless world-lines were illuminating the space by
scattering their bright lights. The <Star Stream> they had been living in was
right there. The world they cursed and resented, but still couldn't forsake,
was slowly disappearing while emitting the most radiant light for the last
time.

As Kim Dokja dazedly stared at that spectacle, Shin Yoosung tightly
squeezed his hand.

"It's over now."

Overcome by a certain emotion, Lee Hyunsung suddenly broke down in
tears. The bear-like man who never showed a single drop of tears no matter
what transpired began sobbing away uncontrollably. Jung Heewon watched
him and bit her lower lip as her nose tip began stinging, as well. Lee Jihye
raised her head, perhaps not wanting to shed her own tears.

"It… really is over."

It was indeed over. This long and expansive tale had finally come to an end.
Kim Dokja stared at the distancing meteor shower. He stared, and then,
stared again.

As if she knew what he was thinking about right now, Han Sooyoung
addressed him. "This isn't because you read that novel, you know? You also
had no idea, right?"

Companions nodded their heads. They were also aware; they knew that this
event might not end like this.

It was just that, they were quietly staring at Kim Dokja and his Story.

⸢The world that couldn't be lived in, unless one read it.⸥

The child who had to read something, anything, if he wanted to live.

They were saved many times over by such a child.

⸢Reading something in order to survive – that was the same story for
everyone.⸥
"It would've been fine by just reading it, but Dokja-ssi, you tried to
change the story by yourself. I think that's more than enough." Jung
Heewon said that.

The one who had never reached the end of this world, starting from the
beginning of the 'Ways of Survival' all the way to its conclusion. She softly
smiled and patted Kim Dokja on his shoulder.

"So, what do you think? Is this the conclusion you wanted to see?"

Kim Dokja couldn't reply to her. He was too busy wiping away the tears
clouding his vision to do that.

⸢So that he could see with his own eyes the view of the world he
established.⸥
Kim Dokja slowly opened his eyes, and the subway's pitch-black windows
were reflected in his irises. The faces of his companions could be seen
mirrored on the glass. As if, that was a group photo with the universe
serving as its background.

⸢The conclusion of this world that he so dearly wished to see.⸥

"…I'm looking at it right now."

As if they were waiting for those words, Shin Yoosung and Lee Gilyoung
began wiping away Kim Dokja's tears. He tightly hugged both of the kids.

It was then, someone asked this question.

"We'll be happy after this, right?"

Only the vibration of the train leaving the station resounded out within this
silence like a pulse.

Maybe, this train would never go back; they would never be able to visit
that station, ever again.

They would forge ahead towards a brand new terminal.

As everyone stewed within their own thoughts, quite unexpectedly it was
Lee Jihye who threw out a realistic question first.

"…By the way, what will happen to the world-line we've been living in?"

When everyone gazed at her, she scratched her cheeks in embarrassment
and continued on.

"You know, that thing. If the Dokkaebi King is to be believed, this world is
merely a dream of the 'Oldest Dream', but if that dream is over, then…"

For sure, the time flow of the world they were living in froze after the
[Final Wall] was destroyed. In that case, even if they returned to that world
by riding on this train…
[It'll be fine. Our world is functioning normally.]

"Aha, I see. That's a relief… Ehng??"

Lee Jihye stared at Kim Dokja, then at Lee Hyunsung, and even at Jung
Heewon and Yoo Sangah. No matter who she looked at, though, they were
all making the exact same expression as her.

"Who replied just now??"

And then, everyone looked up at the air at the same time. A ball of fine fur
was floating up there.

[Baat?]

The eyes of the companions narrowed down to slits.

[Eh-baat.]

Biyoo began sweating buckets in the air, but eventually, sighed out grandly
and spoke up.

[You knew something was up already anyway, so why are you so
surprised?]




The companions heard the explanation from Biyoo.

The contents, when simplified, were like this.

[The world-line hasn't been annihilated yet. I don't know the reason, but…
the stopped time of the world is beginning to get written again. Although
the worldview shook around a lot after all the large Stories crumbled at the
same time, it'll still take several thousands of years for the world to die
naturally.]
The sights of the world they used to live in could be seen faintly just
beyond the subway's windows. The frozen time of the world was beginning
to move once more.

⸢Uriel was slowly opening her eyes within this devastation.⸥

⸢The Black Flame Dragon was asleep, curled up into a ball. And…⸥

⸢Wrapped up tightly within the Somersault Cloud, the Great Sage Heaven's
Equal was staring up at the skies above.⸥
The Constellations were alive, too.

Even the Maritime War God, Goryeo's First Sword… Everyone was still
alive. Even though they had lost their previous lustre, they were still
drawing breaths in this world-line.

Biyoo spoke up as she looked at those Constellations.

[<Star Stream> still remains. The channel system has crumbled down, and
Constellations can no longer wield as much power as they used to, but still,
it was such a huge Story that it'll take some time for it to completely
crumble down.]

A couple of my companions sighed in relief. A sigh that they themselves
couldn't really understand.

Lee Jihye asked again. "But, the dream is over, right? So how can this
world continue to exist?"

[I already told you, I also don't know. Be smart enough to listen properly
when someone tells you something the first time.]

"…Well, it sure is a relief, but since when did you learn to speak like this?
Besides all that, look how rude you are! Ahjussi! Listen to how Biyoo
talks! This creepy kid, until now…!"
Kim Dokja shifted his gaze over to Biyoo, prompting the latter to feign
complete ignorance and open her mouth as if she didn't know anything.

[Ah-bah-aht?]

Everyone broke out into a helpless chuckle. Lee Jihye panted angrily and
just before she could shout something, Kim Dokja reached out and
wordlessly hugged Biyoo.

This bundle of fur that used to be so tiny at the beginning of the scenarios
was now so big that one couldn't wrap their arms around it.

Yoo Joonghyuk watching that spectacle spoke up. "…Maybe, it's the last
miracle."

A miracle, was it? That was certainly a word that didn't suit him. Because
that was the one word he believed the least. Even then, his utterance
loosened the expressions of the companions.

"Then really, everything has been resolved with this."

"And now, all we need to do is to buy the big house where we can live
together!"

The kids spoke up, only to be shot down by Han Sooyoung.

"Our Nebula can't go on anymore. This idiot, he completely drained all of
its finances in the Final Scenario, you know."

"We can always make more money later, right?! I mean, just who are we??"

Everyone broke into smiles while looking at Lee Gilyoung triumphantly
shouting out. But then, someone quickly threw out another question,
perhaps fearful of these smiles suddenly coming to an end.

"What do you all want to do now?"
Shin Yoosung and Lee Gilyoung looked at each other after hearing that and
yelled out.

"The Han River!"

"The ocean!"

"Pizzas!"

"Fried chickens!"

As the two children began arguing, someone else piped up next.

"I'd like to go to the place that I used to live."

It was Jang Hayoung.

"The place where you used to live…"

Yoo Sangah's expression became uncertain after hearing that. It wasn't just
her, though; they all knew the truth. They knew that the places they used to
live no longer existed. The homes where their stories had been kept before
the advent of apocalypse, had all disappeared now.

But, could this be magic? Suddenly, the view outside the windows changed.
The scenery of the space seemed to scatter, and what replaced it was…

"Maybe, it really is a miracle…"

…The sight of Seoul, the one they were intimately familiar with.

And on the subway map where every name had been erased off, names of
various stations began reappearing.

[Next stop is 'Hongjae' Station.]

Jang Hayoung's steps took her towards the exit. From beyond the wrecked
terminal, the sight of her old suburb could be seen. The train's speed was
gradually slowing down.
Jung Heewon asked her. "You still want to go, even though there might be
nothing left?"

Jang Hayoung nodded her head. Jung Heewon could only reply with a wry
grin. Like how it was with everyone, there were some things that had to be
confirmed even if you knew the end results already.

"Okay. Let's meet again back in the Industrial Complex later."

The train's doors opened, and Jang Hayoung made her exit. She looked
around with a disbelieving expression, only to turn back as if she abruptly
remembered something she wanted to say.

"Kim Dok-"

However, the train started again even before her words could be heard.

The next person to speak was Lee Jihye, silently staring at the map until
then. "There's a place I want to go, too."

Jung Heewon asked her, sounding as if she already knew where the
younger girl wanted to go. "You want me to go with you?"

"Nah, I'll be fine alone. This is what I want to do."

Lee Jihye's grin was soft, her expression light. Jung Heewon's hand rising
up sheepishly went back down.

"See you guys in a sec."

Lee Jihye disembarked. The school building she used to attend was visible
in the distance.

The subway's doors closed once more. Jung Heewon asked a question. "Is
there anyone else who wants to go somewhere?"

No one answered back. Most of the companions had no places they wanted
to return to. However, that didn't mean they didn't have a place to return to.
Yoo Sangah then asked everyone. "We are all going to get off at the same
place, yes?"

"Can't we switch trains somewhere? Looks like we'll have to hoof it from
Jongro."

Han Sooyoung grumbled and scanned the subway map.

Their destination was Gwanghwamun, the location of the [Industrial
Complex].

"We gotta think up of what to tell the others. It's not like we can tell them
everything, right?"

[Next stop is 'Jongro 3rd street' Station.]

Everything was resolved now, but in reality, it'd be not like that. They
would be facing the reality of new daily life after their return, that's why.

⸢The train's doors were opening up.⸥

Yoo Sangah holding the children's hands lightly hopped off to the station's
platform with a soft "Eusha!" She looked back and saw that both Lee
Hyunsung and Jung Heewon had also lightly hopped past the safety line on
the ground.

"What are you doing, not getting off?"

That left only three people behind.

"Kim Dokja."

It was unknown who among Han Sooyoung and Yoo Joonghyuk called that
name out first. The former asked with a questioning pair of eyes.

"We are getting off together, right?"
[Someone has activated 'Lie Detection Lv… ']

That prompted Kim Dokja to smirk softly.

"Of course. We should."

['Lie Detection' has confirmed 'Kim Dokja's' words as truth.]

"Let's go."

Kim Dokja took a step forward and lightly slapped the backs of the other
two. That caused the two to stagger forward, as well. The frowning Han
Sooyoung muttered something in Kim Dokja's direction, while Yoo
Joonghyuk grasped the hilt of his sword, his eyes glaring nonstop.

Kim Dokja spoke to the latter. "…You do know that the scenarios are over,
right? From now on, it'll be a criminal offence to carry around a sword…"

"What a foolish utterance that is. It's not over yet, Kim Dokja."

"He's right. We haven't even figured out who tls123 is, and also…"

The subway's doors were slowly closing; the story of a new world was
streaming within the noisy clamour of their voices. Kim Dokja laughed in
genuine happiness, and the kids continued to bicker away.

A tale of this new world continued to flow on.

But then, just as the subway's doors closed, Han Sooyoung looked behind
her with a slightly unsure, hard-to-read face of someone that left something
behind.

Even Yoo Joonghyuk looked back, too.

The only person who didn't was Kim Dokja.

Han Sooyoung and Yoo Joonghyuk's gazes ran into each other, and
they began growling at the same time. "What you looking at?!"
"I should ask you that, you basta…"

And then, the doors closed. The subway began moving again in silence. It
was leaving the station that welcomed the beginning of a new story to enter
the railway of infinity. Names written on the subway map began
disappearing one by one.

The sight of bickering Yoo Joonghyuk and Han Sooyoung could be seen in
the distance. Then, the sight of brightly smiling kids holding onto Kim
Dokja's hands, as well as Yoo Sangah looking up into the sky while
shielding her eyes, could be seen, too.

⸢And I was quietly staring at that scene.⸥

That prompted 'The Fourth Wall' to ask me.

⸢Will th is re ally be o kay?⸥

Right in the next second, my transparent figure emerged from the empty
space. Accompanied by a slight case of dizziness, my body fully
materialised and revealed itself above the subway.

[The percentage of memories you currently retain is '51%'.]

I smiled wryly. "This was the only way."

I looked up, and the messages clogging up the message log all floated up at
once.

[You have cleared the 'Final Scenario'.]

[You are the only person who knows the secret of this world.]

[Currently, the 'Oldest Dream' is absent.]

[The world's time will not flow if the dream doesn't continue.]

These were the messages only visible to me.
[You have earned the qualification to take over the role of the 'Oldest
Dream'.]

[Will you continue with the dream?]

If this dream was to be stopped now, then the world would forever be
frozen still.

⸢It truly was a cruel thing; the world that barely managed to gain a chance at
happiness stopping for all eternity.⸥
Although it started off as a tragedy, this universe was already born. Even
though that was the case, there were still some that searched for happiness
in this universe, and they had finally reached the terminals they always
wanted to get to.

⸢Yoo Seung ee and Gil Yeong ee wi ll be s a d⸥

"I know."

⸢Y ou are de cei ving th em⸥

"…At least I didn't lie to them." I looked up at the sky and carried on. "A
part of me definitely exited the train with them, didn't it."

There was a certain skill I got from the 'Secretive Plotter' while returning
from the 1863rd turn.

⸢【What will do you now for skills? I'm sure you haven't earned a new skill
over there.】⸥

⸢"Indeed, I haven't earned any skills, but… Is it possible to receive this type
of a reward, instead?"⸥

⸢【It is possible.】⸥
What I received back then was, technically speaking, not a 'skill' per se.

[Currently, 'Bookmark' skill is in activation.]

[Due to the blessing of the 'Oldest Dream', the applicable skill's activation
period has been changed to infinite.]

[Currently, the sixth Bookmark is in activation.]

[The Character registered in the sixth Bookmark is 'Director of the False
End'.]

The Director of the False End, the 1863rd turn's Han Sooyoung.

[Your degree of understanding on the applicable individual is very high!]

[Exclusive skill 'Avatar Lv.???' is currently in activation!]

[You have used up 49.00% of your memories to generate an avatar.]

[Due to the influence of the world-line, the connection to your avatar has
been cut off.]

[The applicable avatar will possess its own free will and act accordingly.]

"…This is the right way."

I felt around the lost portion of my memories, now faint, and staggered
unsteadily.

My 'other me' would continue to live on, oblivious that he was an avatar.
He'd live in a huge house with the other companions.

He'd go to the ocean with Gilyoung-ie, and eat pizzas with Yoosung-ie.
He'd get to see Lee Jihye admitted to a university, and then, he'd hand over
the congratulatory bouquet of flowers to Lee Hyunsung and Jung Heewon.

He'd go around house hunting with Yoo Sangah, and search for tls123 with
Yoo Joonghyuk.
And then, he'd get to read the novel Han Sooyoung wrote.

That would be my salvation.

From the beginning till the end, I was always the one being saved.

So, this was my small bit of atonement for their sakes.

⸢Y ou wi ll re gret th is you wo n t ev er me et th em ag ain⸥

I smiled without a sound.

"But, I can still see them, right?"

Just like how it used to be, a really long time ago.

And so, this story would continue on in that manner.

"…That's enough for me right now."

I stared at the back of the subway disappearing into the darkness. Now, the
figures of my companions couldn't be seen all that well.

⸢And everyone lived happily ever after.⸥

I always hated that phrase.

However, the current me dearly wished for that phrase to become true.

[Constellation, 'Demon King of Salvation' has reached his ■■.]

[You have become the 'Oldest Dream'.]

The disappearing lights in the distance resembled the Constellations that
still remembered me.

And with that, my endless voyage got underway.

[Your ■■ is 'Eternity'.]
           Chapter 517: Epilogue 1 - The world of zero, I


The panoramic view of the cosmos could be seen beyond the pitch-black
window. I rested my forehead against the cold glass and wordlessly stared
at that dark world.

I couldn't tell how long it had been. I wanted to look back; if I did, then
maybe, they would still be sitting in their seats even now, so I thought.

⸢Kim Dokja finally stopped crying.⸥

"I didn't cry, you dumbass."

⸢He lied, too.⸥

"…Just for how long are you going to stay as the narrator? The story's over
now."
[The Fourth Wall] cackled on. I felt slightly encouraged by that laughter
and took another look beyond the window.

The ones I wanted to see were no longer reflected on the glass. The planet
Earth I used to live had grown distant beyond my reach.

Of course, that didn't mean I wasn't there.

['Avatar' skill is currently active.]

[Due to the separation of the world-line, the connection to the 'Avatar' has
been cut-off.]

[Your Avatar will continue to live his life with its own ego.]

The me of 49%.

[The applicable Avatar will no longer be under your control.]

That guy would never realize that he was an Avatar. He'd simply live the
life of ever after along with the companions as Kim Dokja.

⸢W hy 49%, tho ugh?⸥

"I was trying to divide exactly by 50% each, but it didn't work out."

⸢W hy 49%, tho ugh?⸥

The exact same question again; it was impossible to hide anything from
[The Fourth Wall].

"You already know why."

⸢N ot v ery li ke y ou⸥

"No, it is exactly like me."
Something that the idiotic, immature, and selfish during the crucial
moments 'Kim Dokja' would have done.

⸢2%.⸥

That number was the proof – and the lie – that I remembered my
companions far better than my Avatar.

Even if no one knew of this version of me existing here, even if the
companions' stories had come to an end like that… But, at the very least, I
swore to myself that I'd never forget about them.

⸢Y ou re gre tting it?⸥

A soft noise came from the clunking subway. I was treated to the view of a
completely empty subway interior. The handles no one held onto limply
shook about.

⸢Don t fe el so lo nely⸥

"I'm not."

I slowly regulated my breathing.

I had already experienced a similar situation before. It was also like this
back when I became the 'Demon King of Salvation' and fell into the story's
horizon. In a way, my situation was better than back then. Well, I wasn't
currently suffering from the penalty of leaving the scenario, after all.

If there was one thing different from back then, it'd be…

⸢I'd never be able to meet my companions.⸥

"…Do I have to stay inside this subway forever?"

⸢S t a y?⸥
"I'm asking if I can go outside."

[The Fourth Wall] remained silent as if to ponder what I was asking here,
before making its reply.

⸢Th ere is no con cept of 'access' in t his p la ce⸥

"What do you mean?"

⸢T his p la ce is a sanctum. A p la ce whe re the 'Oldest Dream' sle eps⸥

After I heard that, it began to slowly dawn on me.

Every world-line related to the 'Ways of Survival' was a dream of the
'Oldest Dream'.

⸢All the worlds were dreams that were given life in this place.⸥

Along with a 'Flash!' all the windows of the subway transformed into
display screens.

At first, I mistook them for the TAS advertisement installed in the special
area within the subway network. Scenes from various scenarios were
streaming past the windows. Of course, there was no way that I was looking
at mere advertisements.

Tsu-chuchuchu…

A vague migraine assaulted me. The sights of the world-lines scattered
around the universe were now streaming by.

Only then did I gain a new appreciation of just what kind of an existence I
had become.

⸢He was now the 'Oldest Dream'.⸥
My shaky steps took me closer to the window. The screen gently trembled
like the surface of water, looking fragile enough to be broken at any time I
wanted to.

⸢Kim Dokja was scared.⸥

I didn't need someone to tell me that to know.

Every 'story' in this world existed only because a reader read them.

⸢If he doesn't watch, the world will come to a stop.⸥

Staring at the world and dreaming endlessly…

⸢…This was the weight the 'Oldest Dream' had to bear.⸥

I slowly closed my eyes. This was what I chose. And obviously, being able
to watch was far better than not being able to.

And on top of that, it was the same thing as me having become the ultimate
Constellation that could peek on every world-line out there, so…

"The Fourth Wall?"

⸢Wh at⸥

"The 'Oldest Dream' acted like a Constellation, didn't he?"

Under the guise of a 'Constellation', the previous 'Oldest Dream' sent
messages during the regression turn I lived in. Although it was the
subconscious actions of a child who didn't know anything, there was no
denying the fact that such an action nevertheless interfered with the system.

⸢Cor rect⸥

"Then, how about me connecting to the world-line I lived in as a
'Constellation'…?"
⸢Y ou th ink th at wi ll be pos sible?⸥

"It's not?"

⸢N ot the pro blem of pos sibil ity or n ot⸥

I mulled over what that could mean for a bit, before biting my lip, hard.

"…Right, I shouldn't do that. I understand."

I recalled all the hardships my companions and I had to experience to reach
this conclusion. We fought to eliminate the Constellations, and to erase the
<Star Stream> system. And we succeeded.

But for me to revive <Star Stream> after coming this far, now that would…

⸢Lu ckily y ou can't e ven if y ou wa nted to⸥

"Why not? I'm the 'Oldest Dream' now, aren't I? If I imagined it, it'd
become reality, right?"

⸢Ca n't con trol eve ryth ing just be cau se y ou're the 'Oldest Dream'⸥

Sparks gently danced along with 'Tsu-chuchut!'

It seemed that the current 'me' couldn't fully exercise the 'Oldest Dream's'
power to influence.

⸢Y our mast ery over the dr eam is n't en ough⸥

…As I thought. If it was that easy to control, then it'd not be called the
'dream' in the first place. I didn't know when it'd be possible, but at least for
now, I couldn't do it.

I chewed my lips for a little while, before continuing on. "In that case…
what about just watching?"
It was right then, something inside me wiggled.

The inner 'me' that I couldn't rule over – I sensed this humongous
subconsciousness taking root deep within me. This subconsciousness
extended its roots towards another world-line, and through these roots,
began pulling up the stories of this world.

My vision darkened, then the sights of the world-line spread out like a
kaleidoscope.

⸢It was the view of the world he missed so much.⸥

I thought I saw the distant lights of the [Industrial Complex]. Then, I saw
the backs of my companions headed there. Not a shade of darkness could be
spied on their expressions. In the middle of the group as they walked
shoulder to shoulder was another Kim Dokja, kitted out in the white coat.

I already knew.

Even though I knew…

My heart crazily pounded away, my breathing getting shallower, faster. I
panted heavily and screamed out. I endured the sensation of vomit welling
up, shook my head, and opened my eyes.

As I felt for the floor while swimming in dizziness, I realized that I was the
only one inside the subway.

⸢W hat's wr ong? Do n't wan na wat ch?⸥

I did want to watch. Their happy faces, their expressions of finally escaping
from the scenario's hell. I wanted to read the story that I so desperately
longed to see. However, I couldn't.

If I did, then without a doubt, I'd want to go back.

"…I have to see it, right? If I don't, the world won't move forward, right?"
⸢Y ou're al rea dy wat ching⸥

"What?"

⸢Sub con sciou sness is a part of con sciou sness. Y ou are al rea dy wat

"In that case…"

⸢No ne ed to bur den y ours elf⸥ [The Fourth Wall] spoke as if to console
me. ⸢Y ou d ont h ave to do an yth ing. Y ou're al rea dy wat ching sub con
sciou sly an yway⸥

I could just close my eyes and forget everything. It'd be fine to enjoy myself
within the dream just like a pure, innocent child with no guilt weighing me
down. [The Fourth Wall] was telling me that there was absolutely no reason
to mull over the tragedy once more and get hurt in the process.

⸢However, Kim Dokja wasn't a child.⸥

"I can't do that," said I, while wiping away the cold sweat. All these
worldlines were my sin. I created them, and I destroyed them. "I must see
them." And this was the only way to atone for them.

As I slowly stood back up, the world-lines appeared on the windows.

The countless world-lines from the 'Ways of Survival'; the tragedies of
someone, brought to reality because I had read them, were now being
displayed there.

…Perhaps, there was something I should see first before seeing the stories
of my companions.

As if it knew that already, [The Fourth Wall] addressed me. ⸢Wi ll be a v
ery long ni ght, Kim Dok ja⸥
I'm sure it'll be.

I smiled back. "Don't worry. I can do this properly. This is the story that I
adore the most. I know I can definitely watch it until my dying day and not
get sick of it."

⸢But y ou mi ght gr ow to h ate the st ory you l ove the mo st one d ay⸥

"If that happens…" I spoke while reaching towards the scenes appearing
within the screen. "That will be the price I must pay."

I slowly pressed on the glass, and my fingerprints were engraved on the
display.

[The world is now receiving your gaze.]

[A world-line has received the power of life from your consciousness.]

When I reopened my eyes, my body was levitating off the floor, about a
hand-span high or so. It felt like I was having an out of body experience.

I was startled by the bustling nearby and looked around to discover a crowd
of people. They walked right into me and past me as if I was invisible to
them.

Every one of these tired faces belonged to the office workers on their way
home.

This place…

I scanned my vicinity and saw the orange colour denoting the subway's 3rd
line. Surprisingly enough, I found myself floating above the subway
platform. The current time and all sorts of subway-related information were
displayed on the LED screens installed on the ceiling.

[6:55 PM]

Exactly five minutes before the beginning of the scenario.
Soon enough, the Bulgwang Station-bound train arrived along with the
noisy announcement.

People climbed aboard the train one by one. I'd have stopped them if only I
could. However, nothing would change even if I did. The scenario would
begin regardless of where you were, anyway. All I could do now was to
climb aboard the train along with them and watch all these tragedies unfold.

⸢And a face Kim Dokja was intimately familiar with was there.⸥

The Bulgwang Station-bound train no.3434, the car number 3707.

A certain man absent-mindedly staring outside the subway window was
there. After observing his face for a little while, I ended up smirking a little.

When I thought about it, it was pretty obvious.

In the end, all these world-lines were repeated through one man's
regressions. So, it was only obvious that I'd encounter this fool at the
beginning of the story.

⸢This world's protagonist.⸥

Quite obviously, Yoo Joonghyuk failed to sense my presence.

No, his disinterested gaze remained locked on the outside of the subway,
his mind currently submerged in his thoughts. A face that remained calm
even when knowing that the scenarios were about to begin; I had no choice
but to be impressed by that.

…You're really an amazing guy, aren't you.

I had already witnessed the end of the scenarios, but my skin still trembled
simply by re-entering this scene. Yet, you managed to endure these
moments dozens, hundreds of times.
The stopped subway train began moving and the time flowed forward once
more. That 'thing' should begin soon, if my knowledge served me correctly.

⸢During the 3rd turn, Yoo Joonghyuk would begin by killing everyone
within this subway car.⸥
I recalled the beginning of the 3rd turn that I knew of. I wasn't sure which
regression turn this was, but the beginning wouldn't be so different from
that. I slowly scanned the surroundings and spotted a man acting
suspiciously by the exit.

"Heuh, heuh-euh…"

Several people shifted their gazes over to the man after hearing his
intermittent grunts. The man carrying a twisted expression sniggered and
looked around himself, then suddenly, pulled out a home-made bomb and a
lighter.

⸢On that day when the paywall began, there was a certain man riding on the
same subway car no. 3707 as Yoo Joonghyuk.⸥
"…What's that?"

"H-hey, man!"

⸢The subway terrorist, Choi Han-Gyu.⸥

The shocked crowd screamed and retreated. People freaked out after
witnessing the sparks exploding from the man's hands and stood up from
their seats, causing the scene to turn chaotic.

As for Yoo Joonghyuk, he was quietly staring at that man.

Hey, what are you doing? Hurry up and snatch that away.
According to the storyline I knew, Yoo Joonghyuk should've suppressed
Choi Han-Gyu the moment they climbed aboard the subway and took away
the bomb. However, he hadn't done that.

Why was this? Yoo Joonghyuk's expression, the one I thought was
calmness personified, was now pale-white in fright.

It was then, the interior of the train became dark along with the screeching
noise. People's screams morphed into sorrowful cries as they witnessed the
flame being lit up within the darkness.

Something had gone awry here.

⸢Why isn't Yoo Joonghyuk making his move?⸥

Hang on a minute, could this be…?

[7:00 PM]

And then, as the 'Tick!' noise resounded out, the world's rules changed.

[The free service period of the planetary system no. 8612 has concluded.]
[Main Scenario has begun.]

The flames lit up by the terrorist brightly illuminated Yoo Joonghyuk's
face, his eyes trembling in pure fear. He stood there, unable to do anything.
I too, had fallen into a bout of panic. Pages of the Ways of Survival began
flipping inside my head.

…Just which regression turn was this?

Was this around the 900th, when he lost his mind? Or around the 1200th?

During which regression turn was this half-wit Yoo Joonghyuk…?

[Channel #B-7623 has opened.]

[Constellations are entering.]
"Heuh, heuh-heuh, heuh-euh…"

The crowd began running towards the next car of the train, away from the
figure of the terrorist clutching the explosive as the man's eyes glared at the
surroundings.

[Extremely small number of Constellations are getting interested in
Incarnation 'Choi Han-Gyu'.]

And Yoo Joonghyuk was still standing in the same spot. The one I knew
would never react like this. No, Yoo Joonghyuk was someone who'd resort
to the perfect showmanship to suppress the situation from the get-go. But
now, he was making this stupid face that I had never seen before under the
terrorist's threat.

One I had never seen before… Never seen…?

It felt like a lightning bolt had gone off in my head.

So, that's what this was, this storyline.

Countless pages flipped inside my head, before the book itself was closed
shut.

This was the regression turn that got treated as nothing more than a passing
reminiscence back in the 'Ways of Survival'.

Some stories would actually begin from a moment that wasn't written.

"P-please, don't… don't kill me!"

"Aaaaaahk!"

⸢This story is the unknown beginning of the 'Ways of Survival'.⸥

This world-line was the one that I didn't get to read – Yoo Joonghyuk's 0th
turn.
          Chapter 518: Epilogue 1 - The world of zero, II


Yoo Joonghyuk was reading the article of a portal site on a person's phone
next to him.

 –         Pro gamer Yoo Joonghyuk, for how long will he stay under the
 radar?

Several private matters that other people didn't know, such as discord
between the teammates and the tyranny caused by the director's
highhandedness, brushed past his mind. However, they were stories from
years ago, and he couldn't think of an answer no matter how hard he
thought about them.

 –         We found their home address.

That text message appeared on his smartphone. It was from the detective
agency he hired, letting him know that his parents had been located. This
was the reason why he decided to step outside the house for the first time in
a while.
Yoo Joonghyuk wished to know about his origins. To find out who gave
birth to him, and who had abandoned him. To find out who left behind a
little sister in his care when he was on a fast track to success.

Yoo Joonghyuk oh-so-desperately wanted to find out.

 –         Huh? Did people like that live here before?

 –         Eh-iiing, I don't know, either. It's been too long.

Even though he spent a considerable sum to hire the detective agency, the
only thing he got in return was an address of an empty house. The agency
told him that there was nothing more they could find out.

His parents were gone without a trace, as if they had evaporated from this
world. How could such a thing happen, though?

28-year old Yoo Joonghyuk seemed to exist all alone, without being able to
recall a single memory concerning his parents, or anything nostalgic from
his childhood. As if he was a being crafted to be an adult from the moment
he was born.

As he rode in this noisily-clunking subway of the 3rd line, Yoo Joonghyuk
was facing a philosophical quandary for the first time ever in his life.

'Just who… am I?'

And that was why he didn't react in time.

"Heuh-euh…!"

"Uwaaaaah!"

He noticed the ruckus only after a short while later.

A giant of a man, with a scraggly beard on his chin; the home-made
explosive device clutched in his hand, and the cogged wheel of the lighter
turning with pronounced 'tick, tick!'; only after someone smacked past his
shoulder did he awake to this surreal situation.

⸢The terror.⸥

The lights in the subway went away the next second. The train came to a
sudden emergency stop, and the surroundings rapidly filled up with
darkness.

Yoo Joonghyuk felt all the hair on his arms stand up. The inside of his head
felt dizzy. Was this really an act of terror? Something that he'd only ever
heard about was really happening in South Korea, too? Where should he
evacuate to? Should the police be notified? Or…

[Welcome, everyone. Nice to meet you.]

Yoo Joonghyuk's dilemmas were carefully extinguished by a small CGI-
like lump suddenly appearing in mid-air.

[It's getting tiring to make the same introduction over and over again, but…
Anyway, this situation isn't a movie shoot nor is it a terror inciden… Huh?]
These creatures would later introduce themselves as 'Dokkaebis'.

That unknown existence floating in the air observed the situation within the
train and broke out into a wide smile.

[What's this? Hahahaha! Dear Constellations, please take a look over here!
The scenarios haven't even begun yet, but something entertaining is already
underway!]

The Dokkaebi spoke in a languid but cruel tone of voice and laughed.

[I'm already beginning to look forward to this particular car. I pray that
you'll all show us an entertaining tale.]
[Main Scenario has arrived.]


  <Main Scenario #1 – Proof of Worth>

  Type: Main

  Difficulty: F

  Clear condition: Please kill one or more lifeforms.

  Time limit: 30 minutes

  Reward: 300 Coins

  Failure: Death

  And 'hell' began from then.




…Bihyung, that fool. He was rather adorable back then; there used to be a
moment like that in the past, didn't it?

While listening to the screams resounding out within the subway, I fell into
a bit of ill-timed reminiscence.

⸢Are you saying you want to sign the <Stream Contract> with me?⸥

It felt like only yesterday that I met the guy for the first time and discussed
getting into an exclusive contract with him.
Back then, I really got lucky. If I failed to sign the contract, then…

⸢"Kim Dokja. You and I aren't companions."⸥

…Then, Bihyung wouldn't have died on that day.

⸢"I actually wanted to witness your Story till its end, though."⸥

Maybe, 'Yoo Joonghyuk' trembling over there might get to feel this
sentiment after going through over a thousand regressions.

"…Scenario? What is that?"

The passengers of the car no. 3707 began murmuring after receiving their
very first scenario.

Desperate struggles taking place in other locations were then broadcast on
the panels in the air – of the scenario where if you didn't kill, you'd be killed
instead.

"A g-game… t-this is a game!" The terrorist Choi Han-Gyu was shouting
out. "Hahahaha!!"

Choi Han-Gyu the terrorist. Information regarding him appeared once in the
'Ways of Survival' via Yoo Joonghyuk's reminiscence.

⸢If Choi Han-Gyu manages to survive, he'll evolve into 'demonic bomber' at
a later stage.⸥
Choi Han-Gyu pulled out a hammer from his side, and proceeded to hit the
back of a middle-aged man's head right next to him. The victim's knees
powerlessly buckled.

"I-if I do this…"

[Incarnation 'Choi Han-Gyu' has achieved the feat of 'first murder'!]
Choi Han-Gyu began his awakening as he stared at the Coins raining down
before him.

Just like how it always had been, the ones that adapted fastest to <Star
Stream> were those that couldn't adapt to the real world.

"D-did you all see that? I, I, just now?"

"Uwaaah!! Murderer! He's a murderer!!"

Choi Han-Gyu watched the crowd freak out and retreat away from him, and
tilted his head. "W-why are you all n-not doing anything? Y-you're all
making me look like t-the strange one."

"Don't come near me!"

"M-maybe, you need t-this?"

He smirked towards the crowd, and then suddenly, chucked several tools
hanging on his sides towards them. He then wielded the spanner once more
and slammed down on the back of the already-dead man.

"I-it's easy. L-like this. You do it l-like this, a-and then…"

Sprays of sticky bloody rose up from the back of the man.

"…Then, e-everyone can become rich."

The timer in the air was ticking down bit by bit.

[Remaining time has decreased.]

[Remaining time: 10 minutes]

Yoo Joonghyuk wordlessly stared at the spanner that rolled towards his
feet. Even then, the crowd showed no signs of movement.

Choi Han-Gyu shook his head as if he was disappointed, and stood up from
his spot. "S-should I just k-kill everyone?"
But then, a man suddenly reached out and grabbed hold of a hammer that
Choi Han-Gyu had thrown.

"F-fuck this… I don't know anymore!"

"Ahjussi! What are you doing??"

This man gripped tight the thrown spanner and began attacking everyone
next to him indiscriminately.

⸢This was the car no.3707 that Yoo Joonghyuk managed to survive.⸥

"F-forgive me. I'm sorry…!"

"Uwaaaah!!"

As voices futilely spread out, people began waking up to the new reality.
They couldn't tell what kind of a situation this was, but they were sure of
one thing.

⸢They'll die if they don't kill each other.⸥

[Extremely small number of Constellations are satisfied by the sight of the
applicable subway car.]

[Extremely small number of Constellations are expressing their interest in
Incarnation 'Choi Han-Gyu'.]

[A Constellation who hasn't revealed their Modifier is sponsoring
Incarnation 'Choi Han-Gyu' with 100 Coins.]

Choi Han-Gyu was laughing in satisfaction at the crowd. As for me, I was
watching all these happenings next to this man.

⸢Kim Dok ja⸥

I slowly removed my hand from Choi Han-Gyu's neck.
'…I know already, so don't worry'.

I must not change this story.

Everything happening now was 'events that have already happened'.

I looked at Yoo Joonghyuk. He was bending down to pick up a spanner that
came from Choi Han-Gyu's possession.

I could vividly feel the deep conflict he was in from his expression. It was
an expression of a man who had chosen to take a life.

But, why was this? That expression was different from the Yoo Joonghyuk
that I knew. The one that I knew would gnash his teeth from someone's
betrayal; Yoo Joonghyuk, who didn't trust others easily nor easily made
companions. Yoo Joonghyuk, who always pursued after the most optimal
route, and didn't hesitate killing others ahead of time if they were going to
betray him later.

⸢That was why the 3rd turn's Yoo Joonghyuk could slaughter the fellow
passengers of the same subway.⸥
However, this Yoo Joonghyuk before my eyes wasn't from the 3rd turn.

Not from the 4th, not 5th, and definitely not from the 1863rd, either.

⸢He was the 0th turn.⸥

Yoo Joonghyuk of the 0th turn.

His feet broke into a sprint. His feet that couldn't use either the [Red
Phoenix Shunpo] nor [Ways of the Wind] yet.

There were plenty of targets present. A trembling college student hurdled
on the floor; a middle-aged man hiding next to the disabled seating; an
office worker, too absorbed in assaulting the others and not having enough
time to look behind.
Yoo Joonghyuk ran past all of them. And then…

⸢He selected the hardest opponent within this subway car as his target.⸥

"Euh-heuh… heuh?"

Choi Han-Gyu smiled insidiously while observing the spanner flying in. He
took an agile step back to evade, then an ultra-sharp survival knife jumped
out from his waist. Along with the 'Swish!' noise, Yoo Joonghyuk dodged
the blade with nary a gap to spare.

⸢Why did Yoo Joonghyuk make this choice?⸥

I couldn't tell. Why did this guy, frightened out of his mind, make such a
choice?

Choi Han-Gyu still carried several other tools, and not only that, he was in
possession of a home-made explosive, as well. On the other hand, all Yoo
Joonghyuk had was a spanner as thick as a child's arm.

Even then, I wasn't worried.

Although I didn't know the finer details of the 0th turn, Yoo Joonghyuk
wouldn't die in this place. Not before he got to experience all these
tragedies,
and not before they led him to that vast cycle of regressions, Yoo
Joonghyuk… wouldn't get killed.

[Incarnation 'Yoo Joonghyuk's' attribute, 'Pro Gamer' is awakening!]

He was awakening his exclusive attribute, the one that I was quite familiar
with. It was a skill that allowed him to digitise everything in this world like
a video game and analyse them. A skill to control his body, as if he was
moving his game avatar.

His spanner accurately struck Choi Han-Gyu's wrist. The bomber screamed
out for a moment as the home-made explosive fell out from his grasp.
Yoo Joonghyuk's spanner then accurately flew in towards the neck of
flustered Choi Han-Gyu next. It was an unavoidable attack, a perfect
counter that his talent had calculated.

Unfortunately, even he had failed to take into account this one thing.

[Incarnation 'Choi Han-Gyu' is investing 900 Coins to 'stamina'!]

And that was precisely the system of this new world.

"T-that, hurts."

Although a dark-red mark was left behind on Choi Han-Gyu's neck, it
wasn't broken.

His muscles swelled, and he grabbed Yoo Joonghyuk by the neck. The
latter's complexion paled greatly as he dangled up in the air. While
grabbing hold of his victim's collars, Choi Han-Gyu's free hand picked up
another hammer.

"D-die."

Right in that moment, Yoo Joonghyuk saw the fallen 'home-made bomb' on
the floor. And I realized what he was thinking of.

Yoo Joonghyuk throwing the spanner in his hand, and I making my move,
happened simultaneously.

The time flow slowed down greatly.

The slowly-flying spanner was accurately heading towards the center of the
home-made bomb. I quietly stared at this spectacle.

Even if that thing went off, Yoo Joonghyuk wouldn't die. That simply had
to be, if what I read was correct. But, why was this?

…Why were my hands shaking so much like this?
'The Fourth Wall'. After hearing the air making the 'Tsu-chuchut' noise, I
continued on. 'Does Yoo Joonghyuk's sponsor exist in this world?'

⸢He ex ists⸥

The 'Oldest Dream' existed in this world.

The being that became the 'Oldest Dream' much earlier than me – the
younger version of myself. Or, something that was presumably my 'younger
version'.

'If that's the case, why can't I sense anything?'

That's what's been bothering me.

I could sense everything in this world. Everything in the scenarios,
including individual Incarnations all the way to the Constellations
blanketing the heavens above.

However, I failed to sense just this one thing.

'Where is the Oldest Dream right now?'

[The Fourth Wall] didn't answer me.

Yoo Joonghyuk's spinning spanner flew in, and was about to reach the
homemade explosive.

'Could it be…'

⸢How did the 'Oldest Dream' manage to form a contract with the 0th turn's
Yoo Joonghyuk?⸥
All those questions simmering away inside my head until now were going
off all at once.

⸢The 'Oldest Dream' dreams through the 'Ways of Survival'.⸥
Indeed, the younger version of me imagined this world while reading the
'Ways of Survival'.

⸢And the 'Ways of Survival' was a story that started off from Yoo
Joonghyuk's 3rd regression turn.⸥
So, could he even properly imagine the Ways of Survival's 0th turn?

Was he even capable of picturing a story not mentioned in the original, a
world that he hadn't read before?

⸢If that's the case, then just who was the 'Constellation Sponsor' that
appeared during Yoo Joonghyuk's 0th turn?⸥
The bomb exploded. The shower of debris flying out stabbed into Choi
HanGyu's back, then into the bodies of people busy hacking away at each
other. Accompanied by a loud screeching noise, the subway's ceiling was
caving in. Several pieces of debris were flying straight towards Yoo
Joonghyuk's heart and neck.

Tsu-chuchuchut!

[You're the owner of the 'Final Wall'.]

[Your 'Mastery' isn't sufficient enough to interfere with the world-line.]

[The world-line's Probability is resisting you!]

I ignored the Probability and caught the flying debris. Along with the
vicious heat enveloping my hand, the debris scattered into ashes in my
palm.

[A deux ex machina the world-line doesn't recognise is activating!]

[The world has sensed your interference!]

⸢Right at that moment, Yoo Joonghyuk raised his head.⸥
Yoo Joonghyuk crawled out from underneath the collapsed Choi Han-Gyu
and stared at me.

⸢Although it was for the briefest of brief moments, Yoo Joonghyuk felt that
there was someone standing before him.⸥
"Who…?"

[Main Scenario #1 – Proof of Worth has concluded.]

[You have acquired the normal clear reward of 300 Coins.]

[100 Coins have been deducted as the channel usage fee.]

[Additional reward calculation has commenced.]

Along with the scenario calculations, the heads of the people began
exploding. And as the deluge of blood rained down, I silently looked at Yoo
Joonghyuk on the floor.

Bihyung's excited voice coming from the distance, as well as [The Fourth
Wall]'s words of warning, could be heard next. Even the messages of
Constellations suspecting the Probability streamed in, too.

In the meantime, Yoo Joonghyuk was staring at the message spreading out
before him with quaking eyes.
['Sponsor selection' is commencing!]


  <Sponsor Selection>

  – Please select your sponsor.

  – The backer you choose will become your trusty sponsor.

  1. God of Wine and Ecstasy

  2. Mouse that Eats Fingernails

  3. Abyssal Black Flame Dragon


[A new Constellation has entered the channel!]

[A new Constellation is participating in the 'sponsor selection'!]


  4. Demon King of Salvation
          Chapter 519: Epilogue 1 - The world of zero, III


[Currently, the applicable regression turn is under the 'Overwrite
restriction'.]

[Currently, the applicable world-line's copyright holder is absent.]

[As the owner of the 'Final Wall', you can act as the substitute copyright
holder.]

[Will you activate 'Overwrite' to interfere with the worldview?]

The warning messages floated up one after the other in the empty air.
Almost at the same time, [The Fourth Wall]'s voice entered my ears.

⸢Kim Dok ja⸥

'…I know already, so stop trying to scare me'.

I could already tell what [The Fourth Wall] was going to say. Probably, it'd
be something along the line of there's no meaning in changing the
predetermined past.
⸢…⸥

I sensed a certain glare squarely locking onto me from the empty air, but I
tried my best to ignore that.

Although I had no clue how the original 0th turn unfolded, if the paragraph
I read in passing inside [The Fourth Wall]'s library was true, then… The 0th
turn's Yoo Joonghyuk shouldn't select his backer until much later.

He would lose Lee Seolhwa and Lee Jihye during this turn.

He'd lose the ones precious to him, those he barely managed to meet, and
then…

…And then, he'd desperately think about this one thing as his death
approached him.

⸢'If only I had a sponsor, what could it have been like?'⸥

I stared at Yoo Joonghyuk as he read the system messages with quaking
eyes.

Through this turn, his cycle of regression would begin. He'd get to repeat
countless regressions and thereby walk on the 'Hell of Eternity'.

⸢Ev en if y ou cha nge thi s turn…⸥

'The past that the Secretive Plotter lived through won't disappear. I know
that'.

Even if I changed this world-line, the predetermined tragedies would still
happen. The Yoo Joonghyuk I know would live through the 1st, 2nd, 3rd,
and eventually, all the way to 1863rd regression turns. He'd become the
'Secretive Plotter', and start hating me.

However, even if that was the case…
'I can't pick up any traces of the 'Oldest Dream' that isn't me in this
regression turn'.

It was quite likely that the cause of this event was the younger me not
knowing anything about Yoo Joonghyuk's 0th turn. Whatever the case
might have been, one thing's for certain; at the very least, I could take on
that role during this world-line.

I could become Yoo Joonghyuk's sponsor during this world-line.

⸢Wi ll y ou ma ke him re gre ss?⸥

[The Fourth Wall] asked as if it was intrigued. I shook my head.

'No. I'll make sure he doesn't'.

⸢Ev en if he's cha nged, the fu ture won't…⸥

'I know. That's why I feel even more relieved'.

The past I changed wouldn't deny the Yoo Joonghyuk I know of.

⸢If Yoo Joonghyuk got to experience a regression turn that wasn't tragic,
even if it's just once…⸥
I slowly extended my hand towards the air.

['Overwrite' has commenced!]

[Interfering with the applicable worldview has begun!]

[As your mastery over the dream is insufficient, currently it's impossible to
interfere too aggressively.]

As the sparks exploded with a loud 'Tsu-chuchuchut!', messages popped up
one after the other.
[The 'Demon King of Salvation' is registering his temporary Constellation
name.]

[You're currently participating in the 'sponsor selection' as a Constellation.]
[<Star Stream>'s system is suspicious of your eligibility.]

[Low-grade Dokkaebi 'Bihyung' finds your Modifier unfamiliar.]

[Small number of Constellations are flustered by your sudden

entrance!] I bit down on my lip while observing Yoo Joonghyuk's pale

expression.

This might prove to be a bad decision. Yoo Joonghyuk might end up even
more miserable because I changed this world-line.

However, if it was the me of right now…

[Ho-oh-ra, the 'Demon King of Salvation'? Well now, a new
Constellationnim has decided to enter the stage!]

If it was Kim Dokja the 'Oldest Dream' who had witnessed the end of one
world and had the knowledge of the scenario's epilogues, then wouldn't it
be possible to change the predetermined destiny?

[Looks like we might need to extend the time since the candidates have
increased.]

Bihyung updated the message floating in mid-air.

[Sponsor selection time period has been extended by 5 minutes.]

The survivors in the near vicinity, having somehow lived through that
ordeal, began opening their mouths one by one.

"…Just what is all this?"

"Sponsor selection, is it…"
I didn't find it weird since I had read the 'Ways of Survival' before, but still,
I could guess how confused they must feel after facing a situation like this
for the first time ever.

[Incarnation 'Yoo Joonghyuk' is activating his attribute!]

In the midst of all this, only Yoo Joonghyuk was regaining his cool. His
calm eyes were proof of that.

…Well, I'm getting curious about what he's thinking here, so.

[Exclusive skill, 'Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint Lv.???', is activating!]

Although I felt a bit sorry about taking a peek inside the feeble 0th turn's
head, I simply had to look this time. What if, in a one-in-a-million chance,
he chose a different backer, then…

[You are the 'Oldest Dream'.]

[You can utilise 100 percent of your skill's abilities regardless of your
understanding on the target!]

The inside of Yoo Joonghyuk's head spread out like an anatomy chart.

⸢What about Mia? What happened to her?⸥

⸢I must rescue Mia.⸥

⸢In order to do that, I must get through this selection thing before my eyes
first⸥

⸢Backer selection. Sounds like I must pick my sponsor.⸥

I grew slightly tense.
During the original 0th turn, this guy apparently didn't choose anyone as his
backer this early on, but that'd always be nothing more than a story from the
original. No one could tell what might happen this time.

Unexpectedly though, it wasn't Yoo Joonghyuk displaying his interest in
me, but other Constellations.

[Constellation, 'God of Wine and Ecstasy', is greeting you.]

[Constellation, 'God of Wine and Ecstasy', thinks your Modifier is a cool
one.]

It seemed that Dionysus's outgoing personality was the same regardless of
the regression turns. If he didn't yield to us back in the Final Ark, the
ensuing battle would've been so much harder.

Just as I was about to greet him back, someone else butted in.

[Constellation, 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' is keeping his eyes on you.]

…Now that I thought about it, this dude was also here, wasn't he? Hey, you,
aren't you supposed to be eyeing Kim Namwoon in the next subway car?
Just how many bridges are you planning to straddle here?

[Constellation, 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon', thinks you are copying from
his Modifier.]

I was about to ask just which part sounded the same to him, but in the end,
held back. Only three minutes remained; no need to waste my energy on
something completely unnecessary.

I shifted my head to discover that Yoo Joonghyuk had begun considering
his choices earnestly.

I swallowed back my nervous saliva.
  1. God of Wine and Ecstasy



Yoo Joonghyuk stared at that Modifier for a little while before shifting his
gaze away.

⸢Something feels messy about that name.⸥

Soon after, his eyes landed on the second candidate.


  2. Mouse that Eats Fingernails


I grew nervous when he stared at that Modifier for quite a long time.

Wake up, Yoo Joonghyuk. You'd be better off choosing the Abyssal Black
Flame Dragon instead of this.

⸢Sounds weak.⸥

I barely managed to breathe a sigh of relief.

Damn it, man. Stop making people nervous.
Yoo Joonghyuk then stared at the third candidate afterwards.


  3. Abyssal Black Flame Dragon


Although obvious, Yoo Joonghyuk would never choose the third option. He
might seem drunk on his awesomeness outwardly, but in truth, he wasn't a
fan of such flashy and grand-sounding words. That's why…
⸢That's a fairly strong-sounding name.⸥

…Wha? H-hang on a…

⸢Maybe, it might be an unexpectedly powerful sponsor.⸥

It's true that he's powerful, but… That guy, he makes his Incarnations recite
weird summoning spells, you know?

Hey, Joonghyuk-ah, please open your eyes properly and take a closer look.
The only ones that can handle this guy are Kim Namwoon or Han
Sooyoung, that's it.

[Constellation, 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon', is boasting in your

direction.] [One minute remaining until the conclusion of the sponsor

selection.] And finally, Yoo Joonghyuk's eyes landed on the fourth

candidate.


  4. Demon King of Salvation


I barely managed to calm my mind and along with Yoo Joonghyuk, looked
at the backer selection list from behind him.

The God of Wine and Ecstasy, Mouse that Eats Fingernails, Abyssal Black
Flame Dragon, and the Demon King of Salvation…

'[The Fourth Wall], what do you think?'

As if it didn't get the intention behind the question, [The Fourth Wall] took
its time answering back.

'What I'm asking you is, who sounds strongest to you?'
⸢Th at is…⸥

'Not including the actual combat prowess, just judging from the Modifiers
alone'.

I thought that a reply should be forthcoming pretty quickly, but it seemed
that [The Fourth Wall] was actually in a dilemma here.

I didn't wait and spoke up first. 'Not saying this because I'm the ⸢Demon
King of Salvation⸥, but in truth, and also, objectively speaking…'
Hang on, no need to look at it objectively, either. Just think about it
logically.

The God of Wine and Ecstasy? He simply sounded like a drunkard.

The Mouse that Eats Fingernails? You weren't looking for a nail clipper
substitute, so what would you even need this guy for?

The Abyssal Black Flame Dragon? Just one look, and you should know not
to choose this guy.

Even if the 0th turn's Yoo Joonghyuk was an idiot, he should not be making
such mistakes.

The only normal-sounding Modifier was mine. And for sure, he raised his
finger and pointed at the fourth option as if he was impressed by my
Modifier. Then, he began thinking.

⸢What an arrogant-sounding name.⸥

'…'

⸢Weaklings often use names like this.⸥

Even before I could shout something out, Yoo Joonghyuk shot up from his
spot and spoke. "I've made up my mind. I will…"
As he formed a triumphant grin, his lips slowly parted.

I silently stared at the subway's ceiling. Accompanied by the
'Tsuchuchuchut!' noise, vicious heat burned on my hand.

[You're interfering in the world-line.]

['Overwrite' has commenced.]

[Excessive interference might cause the world-line to strongly resist…]

I used all of my strength to smack the back of Yoo Joonghyuk's head.




"Keo-heok!"

Kim Dokja woke up from the powerful impact on the back of his head.
"How long are you planning to sleep? Wake up already!"

He opened his eyes and found Han Sooyoung lightly dusting her hands. He
then wiped away the drool marks on the couch and gingerly sat back up.

What's this? Why am I here? Okay, so…

"What are you doing? Hurry up and get ready already! Did you forget
where we're supposed to go today?"

Yoo Joonghyuk standing in his trademark pose was standing next to Han
Sooyoung, his eyes still blazing non-stop.

"You're making us wait for no reason," he said.

It wasn't just him, though; Jung Heewon's head peeked out from behind
Yoo Joonghyuk, and the figure of Lee Hyunsung carrying an armful of
something could be seen behind her.
"Is that pizza?"

"It's fried chicken, you dummy."

Shin Yoosung and Lee Gilyoung were swallowing their saliva as they
continued to stare at Lee Hyunsung's plastic bags. And finally, Lee Jihye
standing next to these two children, too.

"Hurry up and let's go! I'm starving!"

Kim Dokja saw this spectacle and finally remembered what today was.

⸢This world's scenario had ended.⸥

When he turned his head, he saw warm rays of sunlight seeping through the
[Industrial Complex]'s windows.

⸢And today was <Kim Dokja's Company>'s first field trip.⸥




As they made their ways towards their destination, Han Sooyoung
continued to grumble away.

"Hey, Kim Dokja."

"What now?"

"You didn't really forget what day is today, right?"

"What day is it?"

"It's December 25th. What day do you think it was?"
Kim Dokja pondered for a little bit before replying to her. "The day Mithra
was born?"

"Is that supposed to be <Vedas> style humour?"'

They continued walking while exchanging banter like that. Every so often,
Yoo Joonghyuk let out a pained groan as if they were getting on his nerves.

It was around then that a red sports car came to a stop on the side of the
road while making a loud noise.

"Sangah-ssi!"

Jung Heewon was first to recognise Yoo Sangah and quickly raised her
hand. The latter, kitted out in a white long-padded coat and a pair of jeans,
took off her sunglasses and replied back.

"I'm so sorry, the filming took longer than I thought."

Perhaps finding the current Yoo Sangah not to her liking, Han Sooyoung
verbally tackled her down right away.

"Oh, my? You sure are a full-fledged celeb nowadays, aren't you?"

"Do we really need to eat by the Han River when it's so cold outside?"

"Is there anyone here without cold resistance? I mean, you should still have
that sort of a skill remaining, right?"

"We could've just eaten back in the Complex, though. As it's Christmas,
there should be quite a few people by the river, too."

"We made a promise with the kids."

While watching the two of them bickering away, Kim Dokja felt a certain
corner of his heart ache for some reason.

Why did this sight feel so nostalgic to him?
It had already been three months since the scenarios came to an end, so…

"What about Seolhwa-ssi and Pildu-ssi? I can't see the department head
Han, either."

"They'll be here. Ah, there they are! Oiii! Lee Seolhwa!"

Right in front of the Yeouinaru Station, Lee Seolhwa, wearing a white fur
coat, was waving both of her hands with a bright smile. And next to her was
Gong Pildu, staring in another direction with a cantankerous expression.

"You didn't want to show up for so long that we thought you forgot about
us again."

Perhaps she felt guilty after hearing that, Jung Heewon quickly replied.
"Eiii, there's no way that's true, though?"

"…But, you did abandon us and returned to the [Industrial Complex] first,
didn't you?"

"Hmm, hmm. W-we did go back to find you later, didn't we?"

"What do you mean, find us?! We only were able to come back because the
librarians let us leave! Seriously, if I look back to that time, I still…"

"What about Han Myungoh?"

"Myungoh-ssi didn't come, saying that he must spend Christmas with his
family…"

"What family does that ahjussi even have? …Ah."

The companions continued to walk forward under the noisy, festive
atmosphere.

Lee Gilyoung and Shin Yoosung clung onto each of Kim Dokja's arms and
growled towards one another.

"Hey, you. Stop pulling him to your side."
"You too."

"By the way ahjussi, you think Santa Claus is a Constellation, too?"

The group eventually reached the Han River public park. Maybe the cold
weather was to blame, as there weren't all that many people visible here.
What was visible, though, were the collapsed bridges of the river, as well as
the pitch-black night sky. Only an extremely few stars remained as proof of
<Star Stream> existing up there once before.

⸢Without a doubt, everything did come to an end.⸥

The group laid a mat on the ground, and installed a portable stove next to
the children. Yoo Joonghyuk then placed a picnic table next to the stove
and proceeded to make something with Lee Jihye.

Kim Dokja asked. "…What's this, we're going to make them here?"

"Of course. There are no fried chicken takeaways or pizzeria remaining, so
obviously we have to make our own, right?"

He thought about it and realized that's true. It'd been only three months
since the end of the scenarios, so pizzerias or takeaways couldn't have been
revived already.

Han Sooyoung carried on. "Be grateful that we have someone who can
make them for us."

Chicken drumsticks dismantled in an instant flew in the air, and Yoo
Joonghyuk's special sauces danced enticingly just above them. Rolled
dough spun vigorously at the end of the scabbard, too. It was uncertain
whether he was making a pizza or fried chicken, but without a doubt,
something amazing was being created right now.

"In the end, a day like today did come," said Yoo Sangah as she sat on the
mat with her knees pulled up close. Her eyes were staring at the Han River,
as if she was submerged in reminiscence.
Kim Dokja addressed her. "You must be really busy nowadays."

"It's just… Yes, I am. There are lots of things to take care of, so…"

It had only been three months since the scenarios ended. The society at
large hadn't regained its stability yet.

The system's influence hadn't completely disappeared yet, and the criminals
retaining their skills or Stigmata continued with their crime sprees even
now. Yoo Sangah was this world's hero that defeated them and protected
ordinary citizens.

"They look so good together."

In a spot far away, Jung Heewon and Lee Hyunsung were standing together
to look at the Han River.

Han Sooyoung pouted and spat out her words. "I bet 100 Coins that they
won't last a year."

It was right then, they heard something exploding in the distance. The
startled companions instinctively reached towards their individual weapons.

But when they took a closer look, the explosion noise came from the
fireworks fired from a distant building.

"…Someone's using stuff like that already?"

Han Sooyoung muttered out in disbelief.

Kim Dokja stared at that spectacle with renewed interest. Fireworks, was it?
He never expected to see them again in his life. Bit by bit, the aroma of
their food getting ready wafted in.

"Kim Dokja."

"Huh?"

"You know, you haven't been reading that thing recently."
"What do you mean?" Kim Dokja thought about it for a second before
making his reply. "Ah, that's right. I should be reading it, though."

He hurriedly switched his smartphone on. However, its battery was flat and
the device refused to power on. Han Sooyoung's figure was reflected on the
dark screen; it was still impossible to get a bead on her inner thoughts
through the look in her eyes. She wordlessly observed Kim Dokja and
muttered something to herself, before plopping down next to him with an
'Oopsie'.

"Maybe I shouldn't have bothered to come. All these useless thoughts are
making my head hurt, instead."

"Huh?"

"Nah, just talking to myself. Never mind that, though – there was a part
like this back in the 'Ways of Survival', wasn't it? You remember that?"
…The 'Ways of Survival'.

"You know, the third turn's Yoo Joonghyuk… everyone together, next to
the Han River, chewing on the ground rat's legs…"

Kim Dokja's expression as he listened to her words distorted in a strange,
vague manner. She reached out to him as he began to wobble a little. "Hey,
what's the matter? You alright? You feeling sick somewhere?"

"It's just that my head hurts without warning…"

"Did I smack you a little too hard back then? How about resting for a
bit…?"

"No, it's fine. Besides all that… you're right."

"About what?"

"About the 'Ways of Survival'. I really like that scene, too. It's the scene I
like the most from the third regression turn."
Han Sooyoung deeply stared into Kim Dokja's face, before forming a
refreshing grin.

"Really now, you 'Ways of Survival' otaku freak."

Another round of fireworks went off in the distance, much larger in scale
this time. The children let out a loud cheer as they witnessed the beautiful
flames engraving the night sky. Kim Dokja began thinking; maybe this was
the sight he'd been yearning to see for the longest time. For the longest…
Longest.

Han Sooyoung opened her lips again. "By the way, Kim Dokja?"

"Huh?"

Since from when was this? Her face was pushed real close to his. Her
pristine, perfectly-set facial features, her pale-white cheeks, and a beauty
spot just below her sparkling eyes.

Kim Dokja became flustered by the faint hint of lemony scent reaching his
nose. Just before he could say something, though, Han Sooyoung
approached him even closer. She brought her lips to his ear and slowly
whispered in a clear voice.

"Such a scene doesn't appear in the third turn of 'Ways of Survival'."

Along with the fireworks scattering in the sky, it felt as if a powerful
shower of sparks were raining down from somewhere. Kim Dokja thought
that his vision was flipped around for some reason, only to realize that he
was currently thrown onto the ground unceremoniously.

"Hey, you."

Han Sooyoung's icy-cold venomous eyes were right before him now.

⸢Everything was definitely over, yet…⸥
⸢Why did it feel like nothing was over somehow?⸥

Jung Heewon and Lee Hyunsung running over here from the distance could
be seen. Then, the expressionless face of Yoo Joonghyuk; and finally, even
the world where all the stories had concluded, too. Under the fireworks
brightly dyeing the night sky, Han Sooyoung's chilly, sharp dagger gleamed
dangerously.

"You, just who the hell are you?"
          Chapter 520: Epilogue 1 - The world of zero, IV


Han Sooyoung continued to experience this weird feeling every single day
for the last three months. It all started rather innocuously, though.

 –         Yoo Joonghyuk, did you know?

 –         Know what?

 –         That guy, he enjoys his tomatoes now.

At first, she dismissed it as just a trivial little change. Scenarios were over
now, so the dude must be changing bit by bit too, or so she thought.

 –         Hey, Kim Dokja. Why are you so absent-minded lately?

 –         Uh? Uhm…

 –         By the way, are you sure that the scenarios are really over? Why
 isn't thesystem gone? You can still use your skills, right?
 –         Mm… It might take a little while longer for everything to go
 away.

The scenarios were over, but the world didn't immediately revert back to
normal. As if, there was a story that hadn't ended yet. The proof of that was
how people still could use their skills or Stigmata.

 –        To be more specific, you can't say that everything is over until
 we find the'original author' of that novel first.

Han Sooyoung agreed with Yoo Joonghyuk's opinion. It was possible that
this world existed because the 'Oldest Dream' read the 'Ways of Survival' in
the first place.

Before all that, though, was the author who penned the novel in question.
Meaning, this story would end only after they found that creature first.

 –         Just who is tls123? We came up with a few guesses so far, but
 they wereall wrong, right? The most plausible candidate, 'Oldest Dream',
 didn't look like the author either, and… hey, Kim Dokja. What do you
 think?

The one with the highest likelihood of solving this quandary was Kim
Dokja, the reader that managed to read through all 3149 chapters of 'Ways
of Survival'.

However, his reply was this.

 –       Uh… I wonder. Well, I kinda wonder if that's really important,
 now thatwe've come this far…

Other people could say that, fine. However, he was none other than Kim
Dokja, the sole reader who read the entirety of 'Ways of Survival' till its
end.

He was Kim Dokja, the greatest reader Han Sooyoung ever knew.

"Speak. Who the hell are you?"
That's why Han Sooyoung began wondering.

⸢If Kim Dokja before my eyes is a fake, then…⸥

"Sooyoung-ssi! What are you…!"

Just as the voice of Lee Hyunsung rushing in reached here, Shin Yoosung
grabbed onto Han Sooyoung's wrist.

"What do you think you're doing??"

"Noona!"

It was the same for Lee Gilyoung, as well. The boy awkwardly blocked her
front and looked up at her with nervous eyes. The atmosphere of the
companions changed drastically once they discovered her sharp dagger.

"Eonni, can you explain yourself?"

Lee Jihye had put down the kitchen knife and before anyone noticed it, was
standing next to Han Sooyoung while gripping her Twin Dragon Sword.

Lee Seolhwa was completely taken aback, while Jung Heewon's eyes were
narrowed to slits. And Yoo Sangah, calmly observing the unfolding
situation unlike the others, was seen next.

Han Sooyoung thought about something for a little while, then let go of
Kim Dokja's collars while spitting out a long sigh. He plopped down
powerlessly and looked up at her like a guilty man.

"This guy isn't Kim Dokja. I'm not talking about anyone else but Kim
Dokja here. No way he can't remember that thing."

"What are you talking about?"

"The 'Ways of Survival'."
After hearing that, the companions all simultaneously looked at Kim
Dokja's face – at Kim Dokja, who used to talk non-stop about the 'Ways of
Survival' every day.

As if she was a lecturer trying to explain a migraine-inducing problem, Han
Sooyoung held her head and began laying out her case in a calm, logical
manner. And even decided to add this at the end, too.

"What I said just now wasn't from the 'Ways of Survival', but something
from my own novel. There aren't any scenes of the companions enjoying
their meal by the Han River in the 'Ways of Survival'."

"How do you know that, eonni? Did you actually read that novel, too?"

"Just the early parts. At least, I know for sure that no such scenes appear
during the third regression turn."

That prompted Jung Heewon to retort. "Isn't it possible to be mistaken
about something like that? From the get-go, remembering every event
happening in such a huge novel is…"

"It is possible if it's Kim Dokja. Did you all forget how we managed to
wrangle our way through the scenarios? And you really think that Kim
Dokja can't remember?" Han Sooyoung turned towards Kim Dokja and
growled menacingly. "Hey, you. Tell me how many times Yoo Joonghyuk
killed Asmodeus."

Her question simply caused Kim Dokja to dazedly look up at her face. She
scowled deeply, but just before she could go on another tirade, his lips
opened first.

"Han Sooyoung."

His voice sounded flat, monotonous. For a moment there, a certain
expectation of 'maybe…' flashed past by Han Sooyoung's eyes. And then…

"My bad, but I really can't remember. I haven't been reading the 'Ways of
Survival' lately, so…"
"Look, look! This punk, he's not Kim Dokja…!"

"Ahjussi."

The one to step in front of the dagger-brandishing Han Sooyoung was Shin
Yoosung. As if she was trying to mould a clay pot, she held Kim Dokja's
hand with both of hers and asked him. "Do you remember what I wanted to
eat by the Han River?"

The hands of Yoo Joonghyuk standing not too far away and silently
preparing the food came to a halt; the food wasn't finished yet.

Kim Dokja replied immediately. "It's pizza and Cola."

"Hyung! Me! What about me?"

"Gilyoung-ie? You wanted to eat chicken by the sea. My bad. We'll
definitely go to the seaside next time, okay?"

Lee Gilyoung's and Shin Yoosung's tearful eyes were now glaring at Han
Sooyoung.

She frowned deeply. "Hold up. Your questions are too easy. With only that,
you can't…"

That prompted Jung Heewon to step forward this time. "Dokja-ssi. What's
the name of my sword?"

"The Judge's Sword. I struggled so hard to get all the materials for it, too."

"Dokja-ssi, do you remember the very first item you gave me?"

"It was an aged iron shield, wasn't it?"

The companions then began their barrage of questions as if it was a
competition. Even Gong Pildu got in on the act, too.

"Oii, do you remember the penalty fee you paid me during the Chungmuro
scenario?"
"But, I didn't pay anything?"

"You son of a bitch. You better cough up or…!"

"Ahjussi, you told me this before, right? Jihye-yah~, to be honest, I think
you're the prettiest among all the Kim-Com members."

"I never said that."

Lee Jihye muttered "Dang it," under her breath.

"…He's Dokja ahjussi, alright."

There was this vague sense of relief blooming on the expressions of the
group.

Kim Dokja observing this situation spoke up. "I don't know what's suddenly
gotten into you, but I'm definitely Kim Dokja. And Han Sooyoung, why are
you…"

"Hey, do you even remember how many regression turns there are in the
'Ways of Survival'?"

"Sooyoung-ah." Jung Heewon couldn't let this go on any longer and stepped
forward. "I don't know why you're acting like this, but we're on a rare
outing together, so please do it in moderation."

"That's right, Sooyoung-ssi. There must've been some kind of a
misunderstanding…"

"…Misunderstanding??" Han Sooyoung's hand gripping the dagger
trembled ever so slightly. "Hey, Yoo Joonghyuk!! Don't you have anything
to say?!"

Yoo Joonghyuk chopping up veggies in silence heard her call and shifted
his disinterested eyes towards Han Sooyoung. Then, he shifted his gaze
over to Kim Dokja, before glancing at the rest of the companions. Finally,
he turned his attention back to the cutting board.
After observing that chain of events, Han Sooyoung's shoulders began
trembling non-stop. "Y-you, really…"

Her head dropped, and that's how she spotted a can of beer rolling on the
floor. She picked it up and popped the lid open, then drank it all in one go.
She wiped her lips in anger and spoke up.

"Screw it… Fine, sure. I'm the lone weirdo among you, is that how it is?"
Maybe that one can wasn't enough, she proceeded to pop the lid on another
one.

"Fine. I know it's been difficult for everyone, trying to break past the
scenarios. I know full well that you're too tired to think, and now you just
wanna kick back and relax. You think I don't wanna do that, too? I also
wanna take it easy."

Along with the 'Puh-shushuk!' noise, beer foams bubbled up vigorously.

"But then, you idiots, you really think this Kim Dokja is the real deal?"

"Han Sooyoung."

"Shut up. Don't call me by my name."

Her cheeks were getting somewhat flushed now. Meanwhile, the Story of
[Predictive Plagiarism] was creaking into gear inside her head.

⸢It's possible that the companions are right. She's wrong, and it's totally
possible that this Kim Dokja is the real thing.⸥
Han Sooyoung knew – just because he failed to remember a couple of
scenes from the 'Ways of Survival', could she really use that to argue this
Kim Dokja wasn't really Kim Dokja?

The current her acted too hastily. She failed to be logical.
Even then, Han Sooyoung couldn't stop her emotions. Even as she herself
failed to understand the reason behind her own strong reaction, she
continued to mutter on.

"The 'Kim Dokja' I remember is…"

…He was a man who could patiently read a boring novel filled with a ton
of exposition that lasted well over three thousand chapters.

⸢"In the future when all the scenarios have ended, I may want to get back to
writing novels again. When that happens, read my novel, okay?"⸥
A man who loved stories more than anyone in this whole world.

⸢"Fine, fine. I'll definitely read it."⸥

"But, it might be over three thousand chapters?"

"That's probably right up my alley, then."

"It might be boring, too."

"It's you writing it, so that's not possible, you know."

Such Kim Dokja might forget about other things, but no way he'd forget
about the 'Ways of Survival'.

Was this the fault of the alcohol? It felt as if the heat was gradually
spreading even more inside her head.

⸢If this 'Kim Dokja' is a fake, what does that signify?⸥

A trickery of the original author tls123? Or…

"Han Sooyoung, why don't we stop there, and…"

A certain hypothesis popped up in her head as she looked at the expressions
of her companions.
If what the Dokkaebi King said was the truth, then this world was nothing
more than the delusion of the 'Oldest Dream'. Meaning, this world existed
because 'he' continued to dream. But now, the 'Oldest Dream' was no more;
he disappeared along with the 'Secretive Plotter,' as well as the characters
from the 999th turn.

⸢In that case, how can this world continue to exist?⸥

This was a truly horrifying hunch. One that should never become reality.
And perhaps, a hunch that had already become their reality.

The beer can in her hand fell and rolled around on the ground.
Halfconsumed liquor spilt out among the other similar-styled cans also
rolling around on the floor. She stared at her can, now almost empty, and
muttered out in a trance-like state.

"What if… this 'Kim Dokja' is an 'Avatar'…"

"Sooyoung-ssi! What's suddenly gotten into you, saying stuff like…!"

"You think I'm doing this for fun?!"

Her serious voice caused the expressions on several companions to change.
Those that turned back all carried similar kind of looks on their faces now.

Han Sooyoung.

The only Incarnation among the group that possessed both the [Predictive
Plagiarism] as well as [Avatar] skills. It was her who took on the role of the
Nebula's brain whenever Kim Dokja wasn't around.

And her judgement was rarely, if ever, wrong.

Lee Hyunsung slowly turned his head to stare at Kim Dokja. Next up was
Jung Heewon, followed by Lee Jihye. One by one, all the gazes were
focusing on him now.
⸢What if Han Sooyoung's words are correct…⸥

A faint crack was spreading within their minds, an opening created by a
very minute suspicion.

It was enough of an opening for Han Sooyoung, though. "Whether he's
really an 'Avatar' or not, there is a simple way to find out."

By the time Jung Heewon felt the ominous foreboding, Han Sooyoung was
already gone from her spot.

"Han Sooyoung!"

Lee Jihye unsheathed her sword as fast as a bolt of lightning and rushed
forward, but by then, Han Sooyoung was already only a few steps away
from Kim Dokja. As the incredulous torrent of winds stormed in, Shin
Yoosung let out an explosion of Dragon Howling; Lee Gilyoung's insects
were wrapping around Han Sooyoung's ankles like chains, while Lee
Hyunsung dashed in to cover Kim Dokja's figure.

Even then, Han Sooyoung didn't stop.

"The dude who'll get to read my novel…"

Strings flying out from Yoo Sangah's hand restrained Han Sooyoung's
waist, and Jung Heewon belatedly making her move managed to grab hold
of her target's back. But, even as all these events were going down
simultaneously, Han Sooyoung's dagger had already left her hand.

"…isn't you."

Splat!

The sound of something splitting up resounded out next.
             Chapter 521: Epilogue 1 - The world of zero, V


Han Sooyoung's dagger accurately brushed past Kim Dokja's shoulder. He
reflexively grasped his wound. Of course, she didn't miss that.

⸢An Avatar doesn't bleed.⸥

After the <Star Stream System> had weakened, even Constellations began
to bleed real blood rather than Stories once they were wounded. So, if that
Kim Dokja was the real deal, then he should start bleeding right about now.

"Have you really gone insane?! What the hell are you doing?!"

"Ahjussi!"

Shin Yoosung freaking out hurriedly approached Kim Dokja. Even Lee
Hyunsung and Lee Jihye, too. And, the shoulder covered up by the
wobbling
Kim Dokja…

⸢If what Han Sooyoung said was correct, then.⸥
Very slowly, his palm left the wounded shoulder.

"I'm alright. Please don't worry."

No one knew who sucked in their breaths first. Nevertheless, they all
clearly saw it.

⸢Blood was flowing. A deeply crimson blood, no less.⸥

Han Sooyoung too also witnessed it. However…

"…Hold up. It's not over yet! There are Avatars that can bleed, too!"

What she said was true, because she too had created such an [Avatar]
before.

⸢An Avatar injected with lots of memories will bleed.⸥

She spotted Yoo Joonghyuk in the distance, still chopping his veggies. She
felt utterly annoyed by how his lips didn't even bob once as if he couldn't
see what's happening on this side.

Perhaps that was why she ended up saying something she shouldn't have.
"We'll know once we cut off his head. An Avatar will still move without a
head, after all."

"What did you just say???"

Only after she saw Jung Heewon's expression hardening to a frightening
degree did she realize her own mistake. The aura of [Hellfire] danced on the
[Judge's Sword]. That was Uriel's Stigma, never been activated once ever
since the scenarios came to an end.

Jung Heewon spoke in an angry voice. "If you try something like that, it'll
be your head flying off, instead."
Han Sooyoung stared at the [Judge's Sword] pointing at her and slowly
raised the aura of the [Black Flame] as well. She knew the situation was
gradually reaching the point of no return, yet she still couldn't stop herself.

Lee Seolhwa's voice trying to dissuade them was heard next. And when
Han
Sooyoung saw the expressions of both Shin Yoosung and Lee Gilyoung
busy baring their animosity towards her, something inside her snapped.

⸢Maybe, it was a miracle for them to come this far together.⸥

She was acutely aware of her not fitting in with these people. She used to be
the 'king of prophets' once upon a time, and was referred to as the 'false
king', too. She was nothing more than a villain in the epic tale Kim Dokja
had created.

Eating pizza and drinking Cola with everyone by the Han River? From the
get-go, all of that was a conclusion ill-suited to Han Sooyoung.

Ku-gugugugu!

The tense stand-off generated by the two opposing flames continued on,
only for a clear, innocent-sounding voice to break the flow.

"What are you all doing? I brought beer." Jang Hayoung holding plastic
bags on both of her hands was standing there. "Wait, are you doing one of
those hidden camera things because I showed up late?"

That voice filled with anxiety managed to wake the companions up. As if
they finally recalled the reason why they were here in the first place.

And the man who hadn't said a single word until now also decided to say
something as well. "Why don't you all give it a rest?"

The Status of a Transcendent scattered brilliantly from the [Black Heavenly
Demon Sword] stabbed into the cutting board. And the murderous aura
dominating over the park washed away in an instant.
"It's dinner time."

The delicious aroma wafting in stimulated everyone's hunger, instead.
Seven pizzas plus fried chicken were perfectly set up on top of the plates.

Lee Jihye sighed after witnessing that spectacle. "Master is seriously…"

The rest of the group saw the uber-serious look in Yoo Joonghyuk's face
and exchanged glances with each other, not knowing how to respond.

Jang Hayoung was the first one to dash towards the food, however. "What
are you all doing? Aren't you gonna come?"

Gong Pildu chuckled helplessly after seeing that.

The atmosphere relaxed just a little, prompting Kim Dokja to say
something. "I'm fine. I also get why Sooyoung-ie is getting suspicious, too.
Honestly speaking, I know I've become strangely forgetful recently. It often
feels like important parts of my memories have disappeared wholesale…"

"Dokja-ssi, this isn't something you can gloss over like tha…!"

"Let's eat first and discuss it later. I mean, it's not every day we get Yoo
Joonghyuk to cook for someone, after all."

Jung Heewon frowned, but spat out a sigh nonetheless. The companions
found their spots on the mat and settled down one by one. However, one
person wasn't here.

In the end, Jung Heewon exploded in anger. "Really, this is…"

Han Sooyoung couldn't be seen anywhere.
The faint sounds of fireworks going off came from the distance. Han
Sooyoung stared at the cold water rushing out of the tap inside the
bathroom and bit down hard on her lip.

'I made a mistake'.

It wasn't like her. She couldn't figure out why she got agitated to such a
degree. A thought of calming herself down and returning to explain popped
up in her head, but she just didn't know from where she should start her
explanation to make them accept it.

⸢From the get-go, was it appropriate to call an Avatar that shared the
memories a 'fake'?⸥
The sound of vibration came from her pocket.

 –         Sooyoung-ssi.

It was a message from Yoo Sangah. Han Sooyoung pocketed the phone
again. But the device vibrated once more.

 –         Han Sooyoubf.

"Gimme a break."

 –         Haha, that's a typo.

Just as she was about to send a reply, she sensed a presence behind her.

"Please stop sulking and let's go back."

Long, pale fingers held and gripped her shoulder tightly. Han Sooyoung
slapped that hand away and looked behind her. "Forget it. I'll only sour the
mood by showing up, anyway."

"That's not true. Everyone will understand."

"I said, forget…"
"Do you want me to respond like this, then?"

Yoo Sangah's gaze slowly transformed. Han Sooyoung frowned deeply.

Through the open doorway, she could see the figures of the companions in
the distance. And as she watched how Yoo Sangah stood there as if to
protect that scene, a strange gut feeling suddenly brushed past her brain.
"You…"

Yoo Sangah's expression back then, not even trying all that hard to stop her.
Maybe, she…

"Once upon a time, Dokja-ssi asked me this. If the cause of this world was
the 'Oldest Dream', then what would happen to the world if that guy was
eliminated?" Yoo Sangah asked.

"What?"

"What will happen to a world that no one looks at?"

Han Sooyoung grabbed Yoo Sangah's collars and shoved her against the
wall.

"You… Spit out everything you know, now."

Han Sooyoung looked into the still-calm eyes of Yoo Sangah and the truth
gradually dawned on her.

⸢There was a time when Yoo Sangah acted as a librarian of the [The Fourth
Wall].⸥
She was the only one among the companions to actually enter inside Kim
Dokja. What exactly did she see inside that library filled with countless
books?

"Spit it out! You saw something in there! That idiot, just what was he
thinking about?!"
"…"

"Why didn't you try to stop me? Why, when the situation was getting…!"

"Because I don't have the right to do so."

For the first time ever, Han Sooyoung's mouth was shut tight after she
heard Yoo Sangah's reply.

"…Protecting the world by dividing himself in half. One becomes the
'reader' watching over the world, while the other becomes its 'character'."
Han Sooyoung also knew.

She knew that maybe, that 'Kim Dokja' bled because of that very reason.

She knew that, on that day when everyone was freed from the scenario,
maybe the other side of Kim Dokja was still riding on the subway – on that
day, when she looked back, and Yoo Joonghyuk also looked back. Maybe,
Kim Dokja remaining inside the train was still watching them.

"If that was the choice of a man who knew this world better than anyone,
then…"

"How can you even say that?"

The pair of trembling hands were tightening around Yoo Sangah's collars
even further. But she lightly raised her own hand and grabbed hold of those
shaking hands belonging to her captor.

"This is the choice of a person called myself."

"You, Kim Dokja, you're all the same."

"Sooyoung-ah. Do you really believe that other companions don't know
what's going on?"

Han Sooyoung felt like she got punched in the head.
"Dokja-ssi who doesn't talk about the Ways of Survival anymore… Do you
really think others don't find that strange? Really?"

"I-in that case…"

"Most of the memories we share together, 'Kim Dokja-ssi' over there has
it."

The companions sitting on the mat and chatting away could be seen.
Figures of Jung Heewon smiling brightly, while Lee Hyunsung was pouring
beer; drunk Gong Pildu was singing, while Lee Seolhwa was clapping her
hands. Jang Hayoung stood up from her spot and noisily yapped on with an
exaggerated voice.

– So, like, back in the Demon Realm…

The 'Kim Dokja' they remembered was different from people to people.

If Kim Dokja was a 'reader' to Han Sooyoung, then to Shin Yoosung and
Lee Gilyoung, he was the 'parent'. To Lee Hyunsung, he was the 'spent
cartridge', and to Yoo Sangah, the 'work colleague'. To Lee Jihye, Jung
Heewon, Jang Hayoung, and also to Lee Seolhwa as well as Gong Pildu…

"That person is also Dokja-ssi. Doesn't matter how much percentage he is
made out of, there's no doubt that he is Dokja-ssi. Dokja-ssi who journeyed
together with us."

The festive fireworks were still going off in the distance. The children's
eyes sparkled under the light. It felt as if the history they had to live through
was fading away. Han Sooyoung dazedly stared at that view, at the smiling
face of Kim Dokja among the companions.

Without a doubt, that was the scene he had been wishing for.

⸢This was where the story of <Kim Dokja's Company> came to an end.⸥

Yoo Sangah was right.
Kim Dokja made his choice, and the companions chose to accept his
decision. They had been hurt far too many times, and none of them wanted
to be hurt anymore.

And so, this was their conclusion.

Yoo Sangah asked her. "Is there any meaning in deciphering which one is
really him?"

Just like how there was no meaning in assigning the tag of 'real one' among
the Yoo Joonghyuks from countless regression turns, there was also no
meaning in finding out which of the equally divided Kim Dokjas was the
real him.

Han Sooyoung replied while letting go of Yoo Sangah's collars. "I'm not
trying to find out which one's the real deal."

Yoo Sangah's eyes were trembling. And Han Sooyoung's face was reflected
on those trembling irises. Then, as she was left stunned by the revelation
that she too could make such an expression, as well as getting agitated by
the fact that she could even say something like this, she finished what she
wanted to say.

"No, what's important is that Kim Dokja is still stuck in that place."

Maybe, there might not be anyone needing that version of 'Kim Dokja'.
You might not find anyone out there wanting to be with that crazy loon
who only loved the 'Ways of Survival'. However, at least just one person…
– ahjussi!

It was around then that an urgent voice suddenly resounded out in the
distance. There was a commotion rising up from the mat where the
companions were currently sitting together. And also, a chilling scent of
blood wafted in from somewhere.
Yoo Sangah and Han Sooyoung realized something had gone wrong and by
the time they arrived there, Shin Yoosung was sobbing away, her hands
soaked in blood.

"The, the bleeding, it doesn't want to stop."

Kim Dokja, seemingly fine only until a second ago, lost consciousness and
had collapsed. Han Sooyoung's hand holding the dagger trembled ever so
faintly. Could it be…

"It's not because of the wound from earlier. This…"

Lee Seolhwa felt for Kim Dokja's pulse, then her face hardened
immediately.
His body was shaking ominously; blood trickling out from his shoulder
dyed the gauze crimson in the blink of an eye.

And right next second, the blood soaking the gauze began evaporating.

Pah-sususu…

The droplets of blood crumbled away, like how Stories would disappear.
Lee Seolhwa cried out.

"Take him back to the Complex! Hurry!"
          Chapter 522: Epilogue 1 - The world of zero, VI


It had been a week since Kim Dokja lost his consciousness.

The companions took turns to nurse him as he remained in a coma. Lee
Seolhwa and Aileen continued to administer medical treatment in
alternating turns, and many Incarnations blessed with famed healing skills
also paid visit, as well.

Unfortunately, none of them could discover the reason why Kim Dokja
suddenly ended up in this state.

– His internal structure is becoming unstable. We don't know the reason
yet. Maybe, it's related to the <Star Stream System>'s weakening,
somehow… A few Incarnations cautiously discussed the topic related to
the [Avatar].

"Ahjussi."
Kim Dokja remained unconscious, and while staring at him, Shin Yoosung
murmured as if to steel herself.

This person, he's Kim Dokja. Without a doubt, he is the Kim Dokja that I
remember.

However, there was one thing that didn't change no matter how many times
she told herself that.

⸢The power of her 'Constellation sponsor' cannot be felt from this existence
before her eyes.⸥
The Story that warmly embraced her couldn't be felt all that well right now.

[Story, 'Saviour of the Star', is stuttering during its storytelling.]

Even the Stories that connected her to Kim Dokja were hesitating with their
storytelling. As if, this existence before her wasn't suitable as the subject of
their story. Shin Yoosung slowly closed her eyes.

[Currently, the connection to your Constellation sponsor is very faint.]

[Currently, the communication channel to your Constellation sponsor is
disconnected.]

The 'sponsor contract' that tied her to Kim Dokja was still in effect. There it
was, the starlight within the night sky, remaining in the exact same spot and
watching her as always.

⸢If that's the case, then just whose starlight was that?⸥

Shin Yoosung stared at Kim Dokja's shoulder that still hadn't healed yet.

This arm always protected his companions. With that arm, he painted his
world. With that arm, he ended the scenarios, and brought down the Final
Wall. She slowly raised her head and looked at Kim Dokja's face. The
golden headband put on top of his head during the Journey to the West
scenario still remained where it should. The constrictive headband lost its
powers after the Great Sage's Story weakened. Shin Yoosung reached out
and brushed his dishevelled hair underneath the headband.

⸢"Don't worry, Yoosung-ah."⸥

Kim Dokja kept his promise.

⸢The PC Bang she wanted to go together.⸥

⸢Pizzas and Cola she wanted to enjoy by the Han River.⸥

Inside those fantasy-like moments, Kim Dokja was definitely there. They
were gentle, tender moments that a person sacrificed all of his life to bring
to reality.

She didn't want to deny this conclusion that they only managed to reach
through such a long, arduous journey.

Shin Yoosung buried her face on the bed and sobbed, until the fatigue sent
her into dreamland. Someone opened the quiet hospital room's door and
entered inside.

"Hey, it's time to cha…"

Lee Gilyoung entering the room discovered the sleeping figure of Shin
Yoosung and promptly shut his mouth. He lightly dusted the thin blanket
next to the chair and covered her shoulders with it. Then, he settled down
on the other side of the bed.

"Dokja hyung."

He carefully tucked Kim Dokja's hand that slipped outside the bed under
the duvet. It was a hand full of scars. It was also the same hand that gave a
certain boy his grasshopper once upon a time.

⸢There was a time when Kim Dokja was like a god to the boy.⸥
Lee Gilyoung stared at Kim Dokja for a long, long time before softly
muttering out.

"…Hyung, you're still you, right?"

He sighed deeply and slowly stood up to open up the room's curtains.

There were truly many people walking on the streets outside. People that
Kim Dokja had saved. This was the world that he had protected. Lee
Gilyoung sat near the window and silently counted the number of passersby
for a long while.




"…That stupid idiot. If you were going to make an Avatar, you should've
done it properly."

The grumbling Han Sooyoung was walking inside the Industrial Complex.

It had been one whole week since Kim Dokja had collapsed. She had come
to a conclusion in the meantime.

⸢I can't expect any help from the companions.⸥

Yoo Sangah was right – this 'Kim Dokja', and the 'Kim Dokja' she missed,
were both Kim Dokja. Meaning, this was the true ending he had been
wishing for, and everything would be fine if the companions decided to
accept it.

However, it was possible for at least one person to have a differing opinion
about it.

"Hey, shorty."

"What is it, Black Flame Dragon ahjumma?"
"Where is your oppa right now?"

"Don't feel like telling you, though?"

"You little!"

Yoo Mia quickly ran away and hid between the narrow alleyways. She was
so unbelievably fast that by the time Han Sooyoung got there, that little kid
was already long gone without a trace. However, Yoo Joonghyuk must've
been nearby considering his little sister was around here.

And so, how long did she continue to walk afterwards? An unfamiliar
noticeboard appeared before her eyes.

[Kaizenix District]

A residential area set up on the western sections of the Complex was here.
The antique architectural style reminded her of the medieval fantasy setting.
She only heard about this place from Lee Sookyung, but now that she had
witnessed the view of this rather unexpectedly well-thought-out cityscape,
Han Sooyoung couldn't help but be impressed.

Just as she began thinking that it'd not be so bad to sightsee since she was
searching for that fool anyway…

"Sooyoung-ah!"

An unexpected person found her first.

"…Yuri?"




"You've been living here?"
"For a while now. I know you've been busy, but still, I'm a little sad that
you only came to visit today."

"…You totally sound like a Korean, you know that?"

Han Sooyoung was really glad to see Yuri sipping tea before her eyes like
this.

Yuri di Aristel.

Back in the Kaizenix Archipelago, Han Sooyoung took possession of this
woman and carried out the scenario. Now that she looked back, so many
things happened back in Kaizenix. She wasted decades waiting for that
stinking Kim Dokja, for instance. And…

"By the way, who were you trying to find here? Was it me, perhaps?"

"I'm sorry. It's not, but…"

"Tch. In that case?"

Han Sooyoung briefly explained her situation, and Yuri clapped her hands
if she understood.

"Ah, you meant your fiancé?"

"My fiancé?"

Han Sooyoung thought about something for a bit, before her expression
crumpled. Now that she looked back some more, didn't she almost get
married to that guy?

Yuri asked in a teasing tone. "By the way, which one do you really prefer?
My personal preference is the shorter…"

"Never mind that. You know where Yoo Joonghyuk is right now?"

"Mm? Is that your preference?"
"Please just answer the question."

"If it's that idiot…"

…That idiot?

"Well, what good timing. There he is."

A huge shadow ran past the cafe's window with a whoosh. Han Sooyoung
hurriedly shot up and rushed outside the cafe.

"Hey, what about the bill?!"

"Sorry! I'll get it next time!"

She spotted the figure running up ahead. It was Yoo Joonghyuk kitted out
in a tracksuit, currently running through the Industrial Complex while
maintaining a constant speed. She heard the Complex's residents
murmuring to each other nearby.

"…He's running again, that guy."

"Why does he stupidly keep doing that, when you can just use your skills?"

"It's already been three months."

This was her first time hearing that. Han Sooyoung gave chase, and studied
Yoo Joonghyuk's back while doing so. It was as the residents said; he was
moving with his own muscles without using any skills whatsoever.

She lightly sucked in her breath, activated her skill, and reached next to
Yoo Joonghyuk.

"What are you doing?"

The running man soaked from head to toe in sweat glanced at her before
returning his gaze back to the road.
"Are you going to enter a marathon or something? But then again, even you
would need to find a job in this new world, so…"

Her provocation failed to elicit a reply from Yoo Joonghyuk. Just as she
began wondering what to say next to get a response from this stubborn fool,
people they brushed by could be heard muttering to themselves.

"…Look at that, another idiot showed up."

These morons, seriously now…!

Just as Han Sooyoung was about to give them a piece of her mind, Yoo
Joonghyuk opened his mouth first.

"I'm running, because I want to."

"Why? You feeling frustrated too?"

He didn't reply. Instead, a very faint shadow was cast over his expression.
She couldn't fully understand the meaning behind his current expression,
but it still felt like she could get it just a little.

"How much of that novel did you say you've read?"

Han Sooyoung ended up replying in a weirded-out voice from that
unexpected question. She didn't think Yoo Joonghyuk would ever ask her
about that. "Just a bit in the beginning part."

"What kind of a person was I originally in that world? For instance, during
the 0th turn or the first turn…"

"What rubbish are you on about? Why are you asking me that, anyway?"

"For some reason, I can't seem to remember the past all that well."

That was the first time she heard this.

"You can't remember?"
"No, it's not that I can't, but they are completely fragmented."

"You've regressed for over a thousand times so, yeah, even I would end up
like that."

Although she spoke in jest, Han Sooyoung got an idea as to why Yoo
Joonghyuk's memories were so unclear.

Technically speaking, Yoo Joonghyuk was the protagonist of a novel called
'Ways of Survival'. Every bit of info related to him came from the author's
setting, and those not told by said author were basically 'things that don't
exist'.

The novel 'Ways of Survival' began from Yoo Joonghyuk's 3rd regression
turn. So maybe, he shouldn't be fully recalling anything that happened
between his 0th and the 2nd regression turn.

"Is that really important? What you were like back then?"

Whether this was an issue of the setting, or he really did forget…
Regardless of what, the past was past. That might sound like a rather
obvious thing to say, but she still wanted to tell him – that the truly
important thing wasn't the past but the future about to take place.

However, Yoo Joonghyuk replied like this first. "It is important to me."

He continued to maintain a constant breathing pattern; Han Sooyoung
watched him force his body to its limits without the help of any of his skills
and got this feeling that she finally gained clarity on something.

⸢Yoo Joonghyuk is someone who can clear the 'scenario' the best in this
world.⸥
Paradoxically, the Supreme King who could clear the scenarios far better
than anyone lost his usefulness after the scenarios ended.
So, in this world where the scenarios were over, just what had become of
Yoo Joonghyuk?

Han Sooyoung's lips bobbed up and down several times.

"You probably were Yoo Joonghyuk even then. Yoo Joonghyuk who'd
become the regressor."

This was all she could do, returning what he said in the past back to him in
full. And in order to change the topic, she quickly followed that up with
something else.

"Besides that, I have something to say to you. Maybe you know this
already, but this world-line's Kim Dokja is…"

"He's an Avatar. I already know."

So, he did know. Han Sooyoung was about to make a retort, but clamped
her mouth shut, instead.

Getting this far wasn't the issue. No, now that she was here, her lips didn't
want to part all that easily at all.

Was it okay to suggest to this 'Yoo Joonghyuk' that they should go and
rescue Kim Dokja, the one that still remembered the 'Ways of Survival'?

She didn't know the answer to that, and could only swallow back the words
circling around on the tip of her tongue.

Unexpectedly, it was he who opened his mouth first. "If you want to rescue
him, then you need to get to the subway beyond the 'Final Wall'. The
problem with that is you can never reach there through the regular methods
of crossing the world-lines."

Han Sooyoung was surprised for a second there, but still managed to reply
quickly enough. "…If we open the 'Final Wall' one more time, we can go
there. We need to gather the 'fragments' to open the door, though. And
looks like we already have one of the fragments."
⸢That's what Han Sooyoung said.⸥

Even she could more or less hear [The Fourth Wall]'s intermittent messages
nowadays. These texts butted in irregularly as if to explain the world –
perhaps they were sentences currently being recorded on [The Fourth Wall]
that this world-line's Kim Dokja possessed.

"The issue is with the other fragments."

The 'Wall that Decides Samsara' Yoo Sangah used to possess.

The 'Wall that Divides Good and Evil' Jung Heewon and Lee Gilyoung
used to possess.

And finally, the 'Wall of Impossible Communication' Jang Hayoung used to
possess.

Those 'walls' were used up while opening the Final Wall. There must've
been a way to get them back, but the current Han Sooyoung couldn't think
of one.

"Han Sooyoung."

"What now?"

"This is the third lap."

Third lap?

Only after hearing that did she realize that the same exact scenery as earlier
was laid out before her eyes. It was the sight she encountered when
stepping foot in this district for the first time. They had been running in a
massive loop until now.

"What did you see? I was looking at the birds on top of the tower," said
Yoo
Joonghyuk. "Those birds always return there during this time of the day."
"…"

"And that cafe, it's always full around this time every day."

"You…"

"Have you seen the clock tower back in Kaizenix? Faces of different people
are engraved into the second, minute, and hour hands. Your face is also
there."

Han Sooyoung followed after Yoo Joonghyuk's words and turned her head.
The world as described by him was indeed right here. Maybe he had been
staring at this scenery while looping around many, many times.

"Why are you looking at stuff like that, though? Have you finally gone
insane?"

Han Sooyoung felt that him looping alone was truly a pity and could only
say that as her reply.

That prompted him to say this, however.

"If you run one more time…" Yoo Joonghyuk had come to a stop even
before she had noticed it, and he was now asking her. "If you get a chance
to run again, do you believe you can see it better the next time?" Han
Sooyoung also came to a halt right there.

[Incarnation 'Yoo Joonghyuk's' Stigma is emitting a faint light.]

In all honesty, she already knew. From a while ago, she realized what he
was trying to say. However, she wanted to pretend that she had no clue,
instead.

Because she thought that method was not a good one at all.

"You…"

The way to save Kim Dokja.
The way to gather the three disappeared 'fragments' again.

The way that only Yoo Joonghyuk could resort to.

⸢And that was to return to the world where that 'Wall' still existed. And

then, to walk on the hellish landscape once more.⸥ "You wanna solo that

crazy thing all over again??" Not even she and Kim Dokja wanted that.

On top of that, no matter how amazing Yoo Joonghyuk was, there was no
way he could, all by himself…

"No, it's impossible alone."

His calm, collected declaration caused her eyes to blink.

"That's why I asked you. What did you see?"

The Status of Transcendence was rousing up from Yoo Joonghyuk's
rippling muscles. This transcended form that surpassed Constellations was
evolving once more.

[Incarnation 'Yoo Joonghyuk's' Stigma is evolving.]

Han Sooyoung looked back at the path she had run past and saw the tower's
clock hands circling around. She could see the engraving of her own
dumblooking face on the diligently-moving second hand.

What would happen if she got to run on that 'time' once more? If so, would
she be able to run even better than before?

Maybe, she might be able to – if she made a thorough preparation
beforehand. And… if she got to work together with the companions she
lived with in this world, too.

She looked back, only to discover the regressor that had run on that very
distance countless times staring right back at her.
"I need your help, Han Sooyoung."

[Stigma, 'Regression', has acquired the possibility of 'Group Regression'!]
         Chapter 523: Epilogue 1 - The world of zero, VII


It had already been two months since I started observing the 0th turn.

There was this one thing I got to learn during this time period, and it'd be
the fact that regardless of which regression turn it was, Yoo Joonghyuk
would always be Yoo Joonghyuk.

"I'm not selecting anyone."

[Incarnation 'Yoo Joonghyuk' has not selected his Constellation backer.]

And with that, the second sponsor selection came to a close.

If I were to include the sudden, unannounced sponsor selection that
happened in the middle, then this would be the third time.

Yoo Joonghyuk didn't choose his Constellation backer during all three
occasions. He couldn't choose during the first one because of me, though.

Tsu-chuchut…
My palm that smacked the back of his head still stung quite a bit. Well, I
did forcibly butt in during the beginning scenario and knocked out an
Incarnation about to enter an important event, so even I wouldn't be able to
escape from the after-effects.

Whatever the case might have been, Yoo Joonghyuk began showing an
unbelievable level of wariness during the 'sponsor selection' events
afterwards.

⸢Constellations… They are capable of knocking me out cold without the
slightest warning. I must not carelessly trust them.⸥
It surely was an unfortunate turn of event from my perspective. Still, others
also didn't get selected, so it wasn't such a big loss either way.

[Constellation, 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon', complains by asking why he
was not chosen.]

[Constellation, 'Mouse that Eats Fingernails', is drooling after Incarnation
Yoo Joonghyuk's fingernails.]

[Constellation, 'Founder of Humanity', is interested in Incarnation Yoo
Joonghyuk.]

[Constellation, 'Demon-like Judge of Fire', is puzzled by Incarnation Yoo
Joonghyuk's action.]

Time passed and Bihyung's channel gradually grew larger, and the number
of Modifiers I knew had increased somewhat in the meantime.

[Constellation, 'Demon King of Salvation', is greeting the 'Demon-like
Judge of Fire'.]

[Constellation, 'Demon-like Judge of Fire', is snorting derisively.]

Uriel…
[Constellation, 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband', is cackling.]
[Constellation, 'Demon King of Salvation', is happily greeting the 'Prisoner
of the Golden Headband'.]

[Constellation, 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband', has started picking his
nose.]

Right, this was how the proper 'Ways of Survival' should be.

I was remembering the figures of the Constellations I knew and had
forgotten about that fact for a moment there.

[Constellation, 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon', warns other Constellations
that the 'Demon King of Salvation' is an attention seeker, so others should
be wary.]

Of course, the one I found most annoying of all was this dude. Just as I was
about to say something even at the cost of wasting Coins, Bihyung opened
his mouth first.

[Supreme King Yoo Joonghyuk, will you really not select any Constellation
backer? I advise you to think about this one more time.]

"No, I'm not choosing."

[Hmm, well, then. Dear Constellation-nims that applied to become the
sponsors. Allow me to present you with a special opportunity to appeal to
this particular Incarnation!]

Bihyung came to be blessed with several 'Find the Incarnation' groups all
thanks to Yoo Joonghyuk, and as a result, that huge grin refused to leave
his face the whole day long. He probably had figured out that this was his
chance to score big.

A short while later, a new message window popped up before my eyes.

[Dokkaebi Bihyung presents – a special sponsorship opportunity!]
[Please sponsor an item to the Incarnation of your choosing.]

I was about to thoughtlessly tap on the 'Confirm' icon only to spot a very
small fine print all the way at the bottom of the window.

*3500 Coins will automatically be deducted when purchasing the
applicable item.

I spat out a soft sigh.

[Current Coin balance: 500 C]

⸢Stu pid Kim Dok ja⸥

As I've completely emptied the <Kim Dokja's Company>'s coffers while
clearing the Final Scenario, obviously I wouldn't have any Coins left to my
name now.

I pondered if I could mass-produce Coins somehow by abusing the
authority of the 'Oldest Dream', but the efficiency of that was not very good
with my current power level so that plan had been put on hold for now.

[Constellation, 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon', says that if you sign the
contract with him, he can turn you into a really cool Black Flame
Dragon…]

[Constellation, 'God of Wine and Ecstasy', says that if you sign the contract
with him, the legendary brew of the Olympus will specially be…]

[Constellation, 'Slumbering Lady of Fine Brocade', says if you sign the
contract with her, the mid-rank starter pack will be…]

The sponsorship messages from the Constellations rained down from the
sky.

Hell, Constellations promising to shower him with early-stages special
items, the kind that even I didn't get to use, were practically lining up in a
queue here.
Even in the original novel, Yoo Joonghyuk from the 3rd turn didn't enjoy
this level of attention. So, how did a mere 0th turn become this famous?
Quite simple, actually.

[Incarnation 'Yoo Joonghyuk' is rejecting the offers of Constellations.]

"That's not enough."

That was all because the 0th turn Yoo Joonghyuk was way too full of
himself.

"There are far too many willing to give me such useless things. Isn't there
anyone willing to share information on hidden pieces?"

[Constellation, 'Slumbering Lady of Fine Brocade', is sweating profusely
while replying that she doesn't know much about such topics.]

"Is there anyone who can show me something similar to the revelations of
the future?"

[Constellation, 'Master of Sky Walk', says leaking such information is
against the rules.]

"You all are worse than this Demon King of Salvation, then."

[Portion of Constellations are seriously curious about the true identity of the
'Demon King of Salvation'!]

And so, the 'Demon King of Salvation' began to enjoy an unprecedented
level of popularity during the 0th turn regardless of his wishes.

 –         Demon King of Salvation! Leaker of the future revelations?

 –        <Olympus> reveals leaking predictions is impossible,
 Probability-wise…

 –        No Demon King named 'Demon King of Salvation' exists,
 declares DemonKing Association.
 –        Abyssal Black Flame Dragon: Modifier 'Demon King of
 Salvation' issimilar to the one he used to have…

By reading the information coming in through the <Star Stream Daily>, I
gained new appreciation on what the life of a Constellation entailed.

So, an Incarnation becoming a Constellation, and being one already at the
start of the scenarios, could be this different, is it?

[Your fame has started spreading around <Star Stream>.]

[Portion of gossipers have created a song called 'Conman Demon King of
Salvation' and have begun spreading it.]

[You have acquired 5000 Coins through the rise of your popularity.]

Whatever the case might have been, it wasn't such a bad deal for me.

[Heheh. Dear 'Demon King of Salvation'-nim. Will you continue with your
patronage of my channel this month as well?]

[Constellation, 'Demon King of Salvation', replies with 'of course'.]

[All thanks to you, dear Demon King-nim, this month's revenue has shot up
by a noticeable amount. If it's not too much trouble, may I enquire about
your true name…? Honestly, I've never seen anyone treat Probability like
ratshit as much as you, Demon King-nim. Ah, hahaha. That was a
compliment, of course!]

[Constellation, 'Demon King of Salvation', says he can't reveal his true
name.]

[Is that so? How unfortunate. Honestly, I'm slightly puzzled by why
someone as great as you decided to stick by this lowly one's channel. It's
not like I've got an amazing backing or anything…]

Bihyung's expression showed his lack of confidence. I quietly stared at him
for a bit before replying with these words.
[Constellation, 'Demon King of Salvation', says he's simply repaying his
debt.]




A book you've read once before could be read again without too much
hassle. However, you could also run into a road block in unexpected places.

That's how the 0th turn felt like to me.

[Incarnation 'Yoo Joonghyuk' has not selected his Constellation backer.]

In a certain way, Yoo Joonghyuk's 0th turn was pretty similar to my own
world-line. Here was a tale that had deviated greatly from the
predetermined plot development.

…Now that we were this far along, it should be impossible to go back to
the plot of the original 0th turn, right?

"Joonghyuk-ssi. Will it be fine to install the barricades over here?"

The Emperor of Steelsword, Lee Hyunsung.

"Oii, Captain! You promised to teach me that swordsmanship, didn't you?!"

The Delusion Demon, Kim Namwoon.

"Master. Can I go item farming for a bit after this scenario ends?"

The Naval Admiral, Lee Jihye.

And also, one more person had been added to the ranks, someone who
shouldn't even be there during the 0th turn.

⸢When you're about to pass by the Geumho Station, you must recruit that
person.⸥
Maybe this was me just being greedy. In this world, Yoo Sangah, Lee
Gilyoung, and even I didn't exist, but…

But at least there was one person that <Kim Dokja's Company> could
recruit.

"Hyunsung-ssi, it's not level over there."

The Judge that Destroys Evil, Jung Heewon.

I watched her go through the checklist of all the things her companions had
missed, and fell into the reminiscence of the past.

⸢"I was really happy back then. When we went to the department store
together to buy new clothes and visited <Eden> like a bunch of celebs."⸥
Although I handed over a large portion of my memories to the 49% Avatar,
I still retained quite a lot. I focused myself in order to stay on the right path
as the pages of memories rushed in like an incoming storm.

⸢"That's why, you are someone who can only do this, right?"⸥

The 'Jung Heewon' I remember should be alright.

Well, the story of that world came to a good end, after all. Companions in
that place should be going to the Han River and to the ocean, spending their
peaceful days with a version of me.

I murmured that as if hypnotise myself and tried hard to focus on the world
immediately before my eyes.

⸢Th is isn t yo ur wor ld ei ther⸥

I know.

⸢Kim Dokja's world couldn't be found anywhere now.⸥
To an existence that saw all the worlds as dreams, there was no meaning to
something like 'one true reality'. And to forget about that fact, I poured all
my being in observing the spectacle laid out before my eyes. I found it
preferable to become a thoughtless Constellation at this point. If I were to
become a greedy devourer of stories that enjoyed scenarios and created
situations he wanted to see, then I'd get to forget about everything else.

"Orabeoni! Your Mia has done it!"

And fortunately enough, this story happened to be the one I loved the most.

"I told you not to use such a manner of speech in front of others."

"Hiiing."

A bitter chuckle floated up on my lips while I observed Yoo Joonghyuk
reprimand his little sister's manner of speech.

You should fix your own first, dude.

Even if he was supposed to be a pro gamer, he must've held normal
conversations with other people before. How was it even possible for him
to live in society with that crappy manner of speech?

Was it all down to his face's 'Probability'?

"The fourth scenario will soon begin. Everyone, get ready."

Through the information I conveyed, Yoo Joonghyuk grew stronger little
by little.

⸢Manage Kim Namwoon well so that he doesn't stray. He really respects
you, so if you use that, things will become easy for you. Don't forget that no
one starts as an evil person.⸥

Information that I sent his way by sacrificing an incredible amount of
Probability every single time.
⸢Don't get cocky in the theatre dungeon and calmly clear it. The last boss
there uses mental attacks, so before you face it, get this skill first and…⸥

⸢If you tie Gong Pildu down well during the early scenarios, he'll continue
to be useful later on. He's not completely irredeemable, so do your best to
reform him. The hint is…⸥

At first, Yoo Joonghyuk didn't trust me, but after my revelations came true
one by one, he began to believe me more and more.

About damn time. Just who was responsible for you coming this far,
anyway? Honestly speaking, I was still a bit miffed by the fact that he
hadn't chosen the 'Demon King of Salvation' as his Constellation backer
yet.

"By the way, how come you know so much about the scenarios, captain?"

"…Someone is helping me out."

"Helping you out…?"

Thankfully, the 0th turn's Yoo Joonghyuk wasn't someone who'd forget all
about his benefactor.

– Hand over the next revelation.

Yoo Joonghyuk spent a huge wealth amounting to over 30,000 Coins and
opened up a one-on-one secret communication line. It was an obvious thing
to do since I kept feeding him important information, but still, I wanted to
praise him for it.

[Constellation, 'Demon King of Salvation', is granting 'a portion of
revelation' to Incarnation 'Yoo Joonghyuk'.]

⸢The core of the fourth scenario is the 'Absolute Throne'. Remember that
you must never…⸥
Tsu-chuchuchuchu…

An incredible amount of Probability was being exhausted every time I
handed over the information to him.

The standard denomination of this world was 'stories'. So, it was rather
obvious that spoiling the future events would damage the Probability far
more than smacking Yoo Joonghyuk in the back of his head.

"It's them!!"

Yoo Joonghyuk's companions all pulled out their weapons at the same time
while staring at the enemies flooding in. The closing chapters of the 4th
scenario should soon begin.

[The Fourth Wall] addressed me. ⸢Y ou kn ow what y ou ve be en d oing, ri
ght?⸥
Along with 'Pah-sususu' noise, the ends of my hand were melting down.

I observed the figure of Yoo Joonghyuk confronting Seoul's 7 Kings. The
gleaming [Splitting the Sky Sword] gripped in his hand howled out a
courageous roar.

⸢No ma tter how h a r d you t r y⸥

The 0th turn's story had completely changed from the original. Yoo
Joonghyuk of this world-line would walk on a different path compared to
every other Yoo Joonghyuks.

⸢Th at guy can ne ver see wh at's be yond the w all⸥

I knew the meaning behind [The Fourth Wall]'s words.

There was no method of acquiring [The Fourth Wall] in this world-line.
Meaning, the last key to open the [Final Wall] didn't exist. Regardless of
what he did, the 0th turn Yoo Joonghyuk would never be able to get his
hands on that key.

However, him failing to cross the [Final Wall] didn't mean he was fated to
be unfortunate. Because as long as I was the 'Oldest Dream', his world-line
wouldn't be destroyed even after the scenarios came to an end.

⸢Certain truths would make everyone unhappy simply by their existence.⸥

Even though I couldn't show him the 'truth', I could show him the 'ending'
perfectly suitable for this story.

[Congratulations! Incarnation 'Yoo Joonghyuk' has passed every trial of the
'Absolute Throne'!]

Eventually, Yoo Joonghyuk defeated Seoul's 7 Kings and stood before the
Absolute Throne. The attention of every Constellation within the Seoul
dome, as well as all the citizens gathering in the Gwanghwamun, was
closely focused on his actions.

He slowly unsheathed a certain sword hidden within his inner coat. It was
the [Four Yin Demonic Beheading Sword].

I substituted for the Lord of the Big Dipper constellation and lent him my
powers.

[Constellation, 'Demon King of Salvation' is looking at Incarnation 'Yoo
Joonghyuk'.]

One by one, seven stars grew brighter and brighter. And the [Four Yin
Demonic Beheading Sword] held in his hand emitted blinding light as it
evolved into a Star Relic.

[Outer Gods are astonished by your incredible strength!]

[The Lords of the Big Dipper constellation are startled by your presence
and are passing out from shock!]
[All the Constellations of the Korean Peninsula are…]

"I do not have any intentions of representing humans as disgraceful as you."
Yoo Joonghyuk continued on. "I do not plan on becoming a plaything for
you vulgar Constellations, and… I shall not sit on this 'Absolute Throne'."
Those were words I thought I heard before from somewhere.

Yoo Joonghyuk sword flashed next. "And I'll make sure no one else sits on
this throne, either."

The [Four Yin Demonic Beheading Sword], the weapon that could cut apart
the Star Relic's connection to a Constellation. Yoo Joonghyuk used this
very sword to ceaselessly slam down on the [Absolute Throne]. He
slammed down over and over again.

Soon enough, the loud 'Craaaack!' resounded out.

The night skies of <Star Stream> brightened as if a midnight sun suddenly
materialised, and an explosion of messages flooded out. The storm of
Probability's aftermath caused by the distortion of the scenario had begun.

I quietly extended my hand and blocked that overflowing storm.

[The world-line is dissatisfied by your excessive meddling!]

[The applicable 'Overwrite' is beyond your mastery level!]

[Portion of your Story will be lost!]

The current Yoo Joonghyuk was going through the 0th turn.

Since he wasn't a regressor, he had no information related to the future, and
he couldn't regain the techniques he used in prior turns through
[Inheritance].

From now on, the scenarios would only get tougher. He couldn't use
[Bookmark] like me, and couldn't rely on [Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint],
either.

⸢As that was the case, Kim Dokja knew very well what's necessary to fill
that void.⸥
Yoo Joonghyuk would not have to go through the regression.

He'd not become the 'Secretive Plotter', and…

…And, he'd not become the tragic pilgrim wandering in between the
worldlines.

Yoo Joonghyuk would get to see his deserved conclusion in this world.

[Incarnation, 'Yoo Joonghyuk' has acquired his first-ever Story!]

[Incarnation, 'Yoo Joonghyuk's' new Story has been created.]

He looked up at the sky. And also a Story taking on the form of a white
tiger was looking up at me from behind him, too. It was none other than
that very Story that protected me once upon a time.

[Story, 'King of a Kingless World', is born.]

I could see Yoo Joonghyuk's elated face through my disintegrating right
thumb.

'Kim Dokja' should not exist in this particular story.

⸢Even then, this was the story Kim Dokja dearly wished to create.⸥

When I slowly closed my eyes, it felt like pages were floating up right
before me. Ancient pages, with traces of someone already having doodled
on them.
⸢In that moment, Kim Dokja made up his mind. He decided to personally
write the story that didn't exist in the original.⸥
I began jotting something down above those pages.

One page, two pages – every time a page flipped by, time went by, too.

Fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth…

My fingers disappeared one by one every time a scenario was cleared.

They would regenerate some time later, but their size would always be
smaller than before. I used those fingers to write the revelations – on the
ending Yoo Joonghyuk from the original desired, the conclusion I wanted
to see, the mistakes I made, and things I gained new understandings of.

All these stories gathered as one, and soon, became a Story.

And so, just how long passed by like this?

I slowly opened my eyes.

⸢Eventually, Yoo Joonghyuk of the 0th turn had reached the final pages of
the scenarios.⸥
         Chapter 524: Epilogue 1 - The world of zero, VIII


Yoo Joonghyuk's [Splitting the Sky Sword] scythed through the air; it cut
down the Constellations blocking his path, and sliced apart the Incarnations
acting as their underlings.

Yoo Joonghyuk truly fought hard.

He was followed by the companions that broke past the scenarios
together with him – Lee Jihye, Lee Hyunsung, Jung Heewon, Shin
Yoosung, Kim Namwoon, Lee Seolhwa, Gong Pildu… – System
operation.

Seoul's 7 Kings were also together with them; King of Hidden Shadows
Han Donghoon, King of Beauty Min Ji-Won.

 –        Go, Yoo Joonghyuk!

The King of Transcendents Jang Hayoung was also here, as well.

 –        We'll take care of this, Supreme King.
Not only them, but also Incarnations from other nations, such as Fei Hu and
Ranvir Khan – and even his sworn enemy, Anna Croft helped him.

[Constellation, 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband', is cheering on
Incarnation Yoo Joonghyuk!]

[Constellation, 'Demon-Like Judge of Fire', is…]

[Constellation, 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon',…]

No other regression turn should be as complete as this one.

"Pacheonmaeng, we're moving out."

The Pacheonmaeng (破天盟). That was the name of the coalition Yoo
Joonghyuk had created.

The conclusion I completed, as well as the blueprint laid out by the 1863rd
turn's Han Sooyoung; Stories, the concentration of essence from all the
regression turns found within the 'Ways of Survival', had begun telling their
stories.

[Story, 'King of a Kingless World', is talking a big game!]

[Giant Story, 'Demon Realm's Spring', has begun its storytelling!]

[Giant Story, 'Season of Light and Darkness', has begun its storytelling!]

It was as if every story happening up to now existed solely for this moment.

[But, how…? You shouldn't be able to come here yet…!]

Eventually, they could see the astonished expression of the Dokkaebi King
beyond the wreckage of the Final Ark. Yoo Joonghyuk and the members of
Pacheonmang unhesitantly dashed towards him.

[Oh, you foolish Incarnations! Killing me has no meaning whatsoever. If
<Star Stream> is destroyed, then you'll all disappear, too. A world-line with
its events concluded will be abandoned. No one wants to look at such a
world-line!]

The Dokkaebi King resisted desperately. As if to prove that his words were
right, he utilised every single Story he possessed to fight back. However, it
was not enough; he vomited out Stories and knelt down. Even as he fell, he
continued to grin.

[It's all over. Soon, this world-line's destruction will commence. It's simply
not feasible that the great one would wish for a story like this…]

However, contrary to his expectation, the destruction did not commence.
The <Star Stream> was fine. The brows of Dokkaebi King shot up high.

[<Star Stream>'s Final Scenario has been concluded.]

[…Could it be…??]

During his final moments, Dokkaebi King looked behind him as if to
comprehend a certain someone's gaze surely looking at him from beyond
the expansive [Final Wall].

And right next moment, a line of text floated up over said wall.

⸢The legend of <Star Stream>, Supreme King Yoo Joonghyuk.⸥

The title card rose up on the screen. And along with a 'Beep-!', it was turned
off. The now-darkened panel reflected the view of a classroom and that of
children sitting closely together.

Their sparkling eyes were all focused on the face of a certain man getting
ready to start his lecture. He slowly opened his mouth.

"I'm Yoo Joonghyuk."
"Children really loved that, Joonghyuk-ssi. As expected, you're really great
at teaching kids."

"…They all seemed bored by my dull story, however."

Lee Seolhwa grinned wryly at Yoo Joonghyuk's monotone voice.

"That's not true."

He put his coat on without showing any visible changes in his expression.

⸢It had already been five years after the scenario of the 0th world ended.⸥

After the scenarios ended, Yoo Joonghyuk and his companions began
rebuilding the world.

Han Donghoon got in touch with the government and created a new
governing structure, while Lee Hyunsung and Jung Heewon went around
suppressing the acts of terror from the criminal organisations.

Lee Jihye defended the country's borders and helped out with reaching
agreements with Incarnations from other nations, while Lee Seolhwa and
Shin Yoosung rescued orphaned children who lost their parents to the
scenarios. The institution called [Star Counting Night] had been created for
that purpose.

While leaving the institute, Yoo Joonghyuk noticed the young children
looking up at him. They were orphans created by the Constellations, but
these kids would grow up while counting the disappeared stars.

"By the way, ahjussi?"

One of the children grasped the ends of Yoo Joonghyuk's clothing. He
looked back and the child, having swallowed the brave pill, was now
pointing at the older man's head.

"Grey hair."
At around the seven-year mark after the scenario's conclusion, Yoo
Joonghyuk got married. His partner was Lee Seolhwa.

Lee Jihye dabbing away her tears, Gong Pildu officiating in the ceremony,
Jung Heewon catching the bouquet… Shin Yoosung sneaked out of her
university class and sang the congratulatory song.

They didn't have children of their own. Both of them didn't want to have
any.

– There are too many children needing parents in this world already.

They established the institution and looked after the orphans. It was a
decision that fit their personalities perfectly.

⸢Time continued to tick by; ten years, fifteen…⸥

Just like pages flipping past faster and faster in order to reach the
conclusion, the time flow of the 0th turn continued to march forward
relentlessly. Yoo Joonghyuk grew older, just as he should.

More specifically, only he grew old – all because of an attribute he picked
up while clearing the scenarios.

The legendary attribute, [Life Lived to Its Fullest].

During his one thousand-plus regression turn, Yoo Joonghyuk never once
used this skill. It was an attribute that a regressor like him had no use for.

⸢An attribute that, at the cost of living a fixed lifespan, fully unleashes the
user's latent talents.⸥
However, the current him was from the 0th turn. He had no experience
earned through regressions to fall back on, nor did have much of a talent to
speak of, either. And that was why he had to choose this attribute. Because
only through this particular attribute could he be able to clear the remaining
scenarios.

"Master, how old are you this year?" Lee Jihye asked.

"I've already forgotten about such things as my age."

"Mm, it's been 20 years since the scenarios ended, so… Oh my god. It's
already…"

"Humans all grow old and die."

"Argh, master. Seriously…!"

As long as the <Star Stream>'s system existed, immortality wasn't an
impossible dream. It wasn't uncommon to see beings that lived for
hundreds, sometimes for thousands of years just like the Breaking the Sky
Sword Saint or Kyrgios. Not only that, if you compiled enough Stories and
became a Constellation, you could literally enjoy everlasting life. However,
Yoo Joonghyuk didn't do that.

⸢Stories without sacrifices do not exist.⸥

The night sky where the Bureau no longer existed, and Constellations had
fallen. While staring at such a sky, Yoo Joonghyuk continued to live in this
world's days and nights.

⸢Then, 25 years later.⸥

And eventually, on a certain day after his hair had grown completely grey,
he left the city.

"Captain, will you really seclude yourself in a backwater place like this??"
Shin Yoosung asked.
"I don't enjoy noisy things."

"But, what about Seolhwa eonni??"

Yoo Joonghyuk wordlessly polished his [Splitting the Sky Sword].

In a world with nothing left to cut down, arduously devoting himself to the
ways of the sword that had lost its purpose – that was Yoo Joonghyuk's
chosen method of utilising his remaining life.

"Stuff like training in the ways of the sword can be done back in the
Compl…"

Shin Yoosung couldn't finish her sentence, however. The clear surface of
the [Splitting the Sky Sword]'s blade reflected Yoo Joonghyuk's face. No
one would think of him as a man in his 60s. Despite that…

Yoo Joonghyuk would definitely die later. And Lee Seolhwa, left all alone,
would have to carry on living a long, long life without him by her side.

Shin Yoosung's lips bobbed up and down several times, and just as she
finally managed to open them fully, Kim Namwoon butted in first.

"Supreme King, you're now all decrepit and stuff! I guess I can finally win
against you this year, right?"

He shouted out triumphantly and unfurled the bandages off his fist, then
dashed towards Yoo Joonghyuk.

"Ku-waaaaahk!! My arm! My arrrrm! No, wait! My eyes!!"

Kim Namwoon was flung away in one hit; he moaned in pain and collapsed
on the ground.

Companions snickered softly; the sounds of Jung Heewon and Lee
Hyunsung holding hands and chatting away; the figures of Lee Jihye and
Shin Yoosung bickering with each other…
I stared at all these scenes and at the same time, read the sentence
overlapping above them.

⸢Maybe, I could have witnessed similar sights and sounds as this one.⸥

It might have been a bit different, though; <Star Stream> had been
destroyed and the influence of its system was weakening in the world I used
to live in, after all.

The people of my world would grow old, just like Yoo Joonghyuk here.
And amidst my companions steadily growing older, I too would have
grown old as well.

Yoo Joonghyuk's grey hair danced in the air as he watched his companions
leave.

His back remained straight and tall even in his advanced age. His skin still
retained its elasticity, and muscles on his arms were still strong.

Even then, his eyes no longer gleamed brightly like in the past.

⸢Kim Dok ja y ou 've be en here for too l ong⸥ [The Fourth Wall] addressed
me. ⸢Wh en sta ying ins ide one dr eam for too l ong, it g e t s har der⸥
I understood what it was saying.

I was the 'Oldest Dream', and I had a duty to pay attention to all the worlds
equally. However, I couldn't easily let go of this 0th turn. It felt to me that,
if this story were to end here, then all the tragedies would begin anew,
somehow.

In that case, if I continue to hold onto this story for as long as I can…

"Demon King of Salvation," Yoo Joonghyuk raised his head to look at
me. "Are you still curious about my story?" I hesitated a little before
replying.
[Constellation, 'Demon King of Salvation', replies he still is.]

"This world is no longer mired in scenarios. There are no stimulations, nor
any irregularities. Yet, why do you still wish to watch this story?"

[Constellation, 'Demon King of Salvation', replies that this is the story he
wanted to see in the first place.]

"You're truly a strange creature."

Stories began rising up from behind Yoo Joonghyuk.

[Story, 'King of a Kingless World', is looking at the 'Demon King of
Salvation.]

[Story, 'Demon Realm's Spring', is looking at the 'Demon King of
Salvation.]

[Story, 'Season of Light and Darkness', is looking at the 'Demon King of
Salvation.]

Stories were telling their stories while looking at me. The very same Stories
that I earned once upon a time. Memories they had built up were now
unfolding behind Yoo Joonghyuk's back.

The world that I designed, the one that Yoo Joonghyuk brought to reality.
The 0th turn's story, completed in this manner.

"Sometimes, this peace feels like an illusion… And every now and then, I
get the feeling that my life has been completed by someone else."

[Constellation, 'Demon King of Salvation', is…]

"I didn't mean to say I'm unhappy."

Yoo Joonghyuk smiled faintly.

I dazedly stared at him for a moment there, having finally learned that he
was capable of such a smile.
"I was always worried about how I should live my life."

While lightly wielding the sword in the air, Yoo Joonghyuk continued on.
Every one of his sword swings contained his Story. The Incarnation who
knew how to shrewdly apply the set rules, that was him. Yoo Joonghyuk
might have spent his life fighting the system, but in all honesty, he was
someone who'd shine even brighter when that very system was in play. "A
fight that can't be won holds no meaning to me."

His ability to analyse the situation faster than anyone, his quick wit
allowing him to clearly calculate the gains and losses, and his talent at
deciphering the advantages and disadvantages in a battle.

"However, I've grown curious lately. What would've happened to me if you
didn't help? What kind of a life would I have lived if I didn't win?"

I knew better than anyone what kind of a life Yoo Joonghyuk lived after
failing the 0th turn.

I knew all too well what would happen to him, what kind of a life he'd live,
and the kind of ending he'd witness.

"You probably are aware of it already. I do not have much time left to live."
          Chapter 525: Epilogue 1 - The world of zero, IX


Yoo Joonghyuk planted his sword on the ground as he wobbled. His irises
were becoming translucent next. His eyes, exhausted from fighting a
lengthy battle, were losing their sights.

"If I choose you as my Constellation sponsor, will I get to finally meet
you?"

[Constellation, 'Demon King of Salvation', is shaking his head.]

"Just where are you exactly? All the stars in <Star Stream> have fallen, so
from where are you watching over me?" Yoo Joonghyuk continued to
mutter out. "No, wait. I know the truth already. You are… probably beyond
that [Wall], aren't you."

I couldn't say anything. I didn't expect the 0th turn's Yoo Joonghyuk to be
able to catch onto that. He continued to speak in the meantime.

"Something felt off to me about this world."
It was my first time hearing such a shrewd tone of voice coming from him.
"One day, I suddenly came into existence in this world."

A man who came to exist in this world without a warning.

"Without any memories of my childhood, I was suddenly cast into this
world. I wandered around an illegal work site, and through sheer luck, got
spotted by the director, and thus became a pro gamer. But then out of the
blue, someone abandoned a child on my doorstep. A child, supposedly my
younger sister."

A conveniently-crafted life, a series of adversities created solely to become
a tragedy later.

"Once, I searched for my parents. However, no matter how hard I searched,
I couldn't find them. Even the professionals that could unearth the
president's hidden illegitimate child couldn't find my parents. It was as if
such things didn't exist in this world, to begin with."

[Constellation, 'Demon King of Salvation', is…]

"So I ask you, 'Demon King of Salvation'. Who am I?"

My heart was in pain. The fact that Yoo Joonghyuk had eventually reached
that question was endlessly tormenting me.

I needed to say something. Anything…

"Does the secret of this world lie beyond the wall, where you are?"

[Constellation, 'Demon King of Salvation', asks you if you're not happy
currently.]

"I am happy," he replied without a shred of hesitation. "And that's why I'm
even more curious about what lies beyond the wall."

[Constellation, 'Demon King of Salvation', is…]
"I'm curious about the reason behind all the goodwill you've shown me. I'm
also curious about the meaning of my life, where I was born, and why I had
to come here. If I had one more chance…"

From somewhere, sounds similar to the ticking clock hands could be heard.

⸢Kim Dok ja⸥

I couldn't show Yoo Joonghyuk what's beyond the [Wall]. Even if I was the
'Oldest Dream', that was still impossible.

Yoo Joonghyuk continued on. "You told me this once upon a time. If I sign
the contract with you, you will grant any one wish of mine. Back then, I
didn't accept your offer because I was suspicious of you. However, if it's
not too late…"

His fingers hovered in the air, searching for a log message that reached him
in the distant past.

[Constellation, 'Demon King of Salvation', wishes to become your
Constellation sponsor.]

[Will you accept the offer?]

"I shall accept it now."

Dizziness rushed in and the shaking of my surroundings worsened.

I called out to [The Fourth Wall].

'The Fourth Wall'.

⸢Y ou c a n t⸥

It already knew what I was going to say.

The prerequisite condition needed for Yoo Joonghyuk to cross the [Final
Wall] was to gather all the 'fragments of the Final Wall'.
However, [The Fourth Wall] had no intentions of transferring to Yoo
Joonghyuk.

I gritted my teeth and sent a message out.

[Constellation, 'Demon King of Salvation', says that wish can't be granted.]

"Why not?"

[Constellation, 'Demon King of Salvation', says that it is a truly arduous
path, that's why.]

"An arduous path?"

If I couldn't transfer [The Fourth Wall] to him, then there was only one
option for him to see the conclusion.

[The constellation 'Demon King of Salvation', says that if you wish to cross
the [Wall], you must 'regress' first.]

"Regress?"

Along with the 'Tsu-chuchuchut!' noise, my entire figure was dyed in the
sparks of Probability.

The world-line was telling me this.

It was saying that I mustn't inform him of this. It said, this information
wasn't something the current Yoo Joonghyuk should know.

Despite that, I bit down hard on my lip and shook off the world-line's
opposition. Even if I had to sacrifice much more Probability, I wanted to
show him the truth.

⸢1 8 6 4⸥

"1864? What's that supposed to mean?"
[Constellation, 'Demon King of Salvation', says that is the number of times
you must regress before you can witness the conclusion.]

Memories from the life I had lived became a Story and began unfolding
next.

[Constellation, 'Demon King of Salvation', says that even if you manage to
live all those regression turns, the odds of you successfully seeing the
conclusion will be extremely low.]

Not only that, the current Yoo Joonghyuk had broken free from the 'original
world-line'.

He was no longer Yoo Joonghyuk from the original novel.

Time-lines had branched off, and the 'future' no longer existed.

Even if he did reach the 1864th turn, there was no guarantee that he'd meet
'Kim Dokja' in possession of [The Fourth Wall]…

⸢Th ere i s⸥

What?

⸢Er ase the me mo ries of th is t u r n⸥

Goosebumps broke out all over my skin.

⸢What if I give Yoo Joonghyuk the fragmented memories similar to the
'original' and send him to the next turn?⸥
If so, the world-line should think of this Yoo Joonghyuk as the 'original's
Yoo Joonghyuk'.

He'd be incorporated back into the original's world-line, and live through
the first and the second regression turns without any memories from this
life.
⸢However, Yoo Joonghyuk would become miserable once more.⸥

⸢Why are y ou de ci ding th at?⸥

I slowly raised my head. Yoo Joonghyuk was still talking to me.

"I don't care even if the odds are low."

[Incarnation, 'Yoo Joonghyuk', has accepted your offer.]

The Story began its storytelling, and the starlights seemed to extend even
further.

[Your Incarnation is waiting for you to say something.]

I remained silent for a long time. And eventually, I came to a decision.

I had no choice but to tell him.

I slowly regulated my breath and opened my mouth.

[Yoo Joonghyuk.]

Been a while since I spoke in my true voice. An incredible storm of Sparks
raged on around me. I tried to suppress the incoming waves as much as
possible, yet it was still this bad.

Yoo Joonghyuk opened his eyes wide and looked up at the sky. "Was that
your real voice?"

[That's right.]

"…I can hear it surprisingly well."

Yoo Joonghyuk, going slowly deaf, muttered softly. A faint crease spread
over the old man Yoo Joonghyuk's expression. I pretended to not see that
and spoke.
[I can send you back. However, if that happens, I won't be able to help you
from the next turn onwards.]

The only way to make him reject the offer was to tell him the truth.

[You'll have to use nothing but your own powers to break past the
scenarios. Those scenarios will be far worse than you can ever imagine,
and… And, you might end up encountering something you didn't want to at
the conclusion you'd eventually reach.]

I thought back to Yoo Joonghyuk. I thought back to the sorrows of the 3rd
turn, the anguish of the 4th, and the despair of the 'Secretive Plotter'.

[And if you do choose 'regression', then… You will lose the majority of
your memories as you cross over.]

Those words caused the soft sounds of Yoo Joonghyuk sucking in his
breath to come out. No matter how resolute his determination might be, this
one should be a hard pill to swallow.

[Only the tiniest fragmented memories from the scenarios will remain in
you.]

"…"

[Meaning, everything precious to you will disappear. Lee Seolhwa you
remember, Lee Hyunsung, Lee Jihye, all of them will…]

"Just because I will forget about them, that doesn't mean they'll suddenly
stop existing."

I shut my mouth then.

"They definitely continue to live in this world."

⸢They definitely continue to live in this world.⸥
Like branding a seal, those words slammed into a part of my head and
invaded deep inside.

It felt as if a gigantic hand of fate was pouncing upon me.

⸢At that moment, Kim Dokja realized that this was the true completion of
the
0th turn.⸥

The reason why there was no trace of the 'Oldest Dream' in the 0th turn.
The reason why, despite that fact, Yoo Joonghyuk still managed to cross
over to the first and then, to the second regression turns. Maybe it was…

[…You dumb bastard.]

I gathered my hands and used the power to manipulate the dream gathered
in me.

The storm of Probability's aftermath crashing in caused my whole arm to
scream in pain as if it was getting twisted and torn off from my body. I
recalled all of Yoo Joonghyuk's regression turns that I knew. I gathered all
the lives he had led, as well as the Stories I knew, and created a certain
Stigma.

A Stigma that acted as the motive power of this world, as well as the source
of all of Yoo Joonghyuk's tragedies.

[Stigma, 'Regression', has been generated!]

[Your Stigma has been transferred to your Incarnation!]

Looking satisfied, Yoo Joonghyuk accepted the Stigma.

[Stigma, 'Regression Lv.1', is getting ready to activate.]

"You said earlier that I'll lose my memories."

[…I did.]
"Will I lose everything related to you, too?"

I hesitated with my answer. Yoo Joonghyuk asked me again.

"Even all that convenient information you told me, too?"

[…Yes.]

"I see."

[If you regret it, then it's not too late to…]

"You also said you won't help me from the next regression turn onwards."

[I can't help you.]

"It's fine to help, however."

[Even if I want to, I can't.]

"I heard that the scenarios exist not just for the Incarnations, but
Constellations, as well. Maybe, it was the same story for you."

[…]

"Tell me, you fool. If I continue to regress, will I ever get to meet you
again?"

I couldn't say anything. These were utterances of someone who didn't know
anything. In every sense of the word, he was the 0th turn's dumbass
continuously babbling on while having no clue about his own future.

Along with the words that hadn't been said yet, Yoo Joonghyuk's ears
began disappearing.

⸢The night sky was reflected in Yoo Joonghyuk's eyes.⸥

As if he was a child wondering about his origins, Yoo Joonghyuk estimated
where in the sky the [Wall] might be and extended his hand towards it.
He'd become the 'Secretive Plotter' someday, and…

…And at the same time, also become the 1864th turn's Yoo Joonghyuk that
I knew.

He'd grow to resent me, and eventually reach the truth of this world.

[Stigma, 'Regression Lv.1', is activating!]

[You have agreed to the activation of the Stigma.]

Yoo Joonghyuk's body began scattering away little by little. His arms, his
legs, and then, his torso, too.

During the final moments, he called out to me.

"Demon King of Salvation."

With a truly strange and mystifying expression…

"I shall pray that you may continue to exist somewhere, too."

…Yoo Joonghyuk's Incarnation body scattered into silvery powder and he
left this world-line.

[The influence of the applicable world-line's 'Overwrite' function does not
extend towards the character 'Yoo Joonghyuk's' next regression turn.]

[Your Incarnation has forgotten your Modifier.]

[Your Incarnation has forgotten all memories related to you.]

[All information related to you are now marked as '???']

All of his memories that couldn't be recorded anywhere would now be lost
forever.

In that case, where would all those memories go?
I stared at the flickering light for a very long time.




"Hey, Yoo Joonghyuk! Why aren't you saying anything?!"

Yoo Joonghyuk ended up staggering after receiving a loud impact to the
back of his head.

He turned around to discover Han Sooyoung and her deep scowl.

"I said, how do we do this 'group regression' thing?"

"I can suddenly remember."

"Remember what?"

Yoo Joonghyuk stared back with a stupid face, and muttered in her
direction.

"The 0th turn's memories."
         Chapter 526: Epilogue 2 - Not found anywhere, I


⸢Hospital room, 9:12 AM⸥

– Gather in front of the Complex's eastern entrance 19:00 tomorrow. We'll
go rescue Kim Dokja beyond the [Final Wall].

Jung Heewon received that text message last night. The sender was Han
Sooyoung. As always, her text came across as rather curt.

After receiving that text, she dazedly stared outside the window for a long
while.

⸢Jung Heewon didn't want to go back to the scenario.⸥

She fought harder than any other Incarnations. She wished to save Kim
Dokja more than anyone, and also badly wanted to end the scenarios, too.
And eventually, she reached this place.

⸢The Final Wall she saw at the closing pages of the scenario.⸥
Even now, closing her eyes brought back all those vivid memories. The
memories of fighting alongside Kim Dokja after he became the 'Enemy of
the Story'.

She survived the horrifying flood of Stories by cutting down many things
over and over again. They destroyed the wall, and she reached her own last
stop.

⸢However, Han Sooyoung was now telling her to get on that train one more
time.⸥
She was telling her to go to where the [Final Wall] was once more.

She was saying that they had left something behind in the train as they
disembarked.

"Heewon-ssi."

Jung Heewon only then noticed her trembling hand gripping the curtain.

"Hyunsung-ssi, did you also get it?"

"Yes."

"What do you think?"

"…Dokja-ssi we remember is right here with us."

The 'Kim Dokja' they remembered was currently asleep. His lashes that
forgot all the tragedies of this world quivered a little. Jung Heewon quietly
placed her hand over his eyes.

Some tragedies would end up disappearing just because they weren't seen.

⸢This Kim Dokja was the 'Kim Dokja' they remembered.⸥

Kim Dokja that survived Geumho Station, Chungmuro, Gwanghwamun,
the
Demon Realm, Olympus, and the Journey to the West, and even the Final
Wall together with everyone, was right before her. He remembered the
name of Jung Heewon's sword, and he also remembered Lee Hyunsung's
trauma. He remembered the promise he made with his companions.

So, technically speaking, this was the 'Kim Dokja' they loved, and the one
she wanted to protect.

One would wonder if it was fine to divide a person so conveniently like
that, but this problem wasn't about the issue of 'Avatar'. From the get-go,
the meaning of liking someone was that you liked certain parts of that
person.

The blood staining Kim Dokja's wound emitted 'Pa-susu' noise and
evaporated into smoke.

The crumbling Stories wandered in the air, before scattering outside the
windows and into the sky above. Jung Heewon didn't know where those
Stories were heading off to. It might be that they were extinguished forever,
or perhaps they could be returning to other Kim Dokja.

⸢Kim Dokja who remembered the 'Ways of Survival', who always loved
that one single story.⸥
Jung Heewon didn't know anything about such Kim Dokja.

No one could love something they didn't know much about.

"Hyunsung-ssi."

"Yes?"

"If Dokja-ssi was us, what would he have done?"

Lee Hyunsung didn't reply for a long time.
⸢Hospital room, 1:31 PM⸥

As if many people had come to visit already, lots of flowers and gifts were
neatly placed on top of the hospital room's table. They were gifts prepared
for the moment when Kim Dokja finally woke up.

Jang Hayoung fidgeted with the flower petal for a bit, before slowly making
her way towards Kim Dokja.

"You're the Kim Dokja I remember, right? Kim Dokja who saved me back
in the Demon Realm."

The clock placed near his head was ticking by.

The man who made the 73rd Demon Realm's frozen time flow forward
again.

The man who made her, despairing before the wall of potential, move
forward again.

The Demon King of Salvation.

"Actually, I didn't want to come back to Earth back then." Jang Hayoung
smiled bitterly and spoke. "I didn't have any good memories of this place."
She was a dimension traveller.

As was the case with most dimension hoppers, the process itself was
uncertain. One day, as she was working overtime deep into the night like
always, she collapsed while sensing a sudden crippling pain in her heart.
The moment her breathing cut out, she thought 'I've lived too hard', and if
there was next life, she swore inwardly that she'd never 'work hard ever
again'. And when she opened her eyes, she found herself in the Demon
Realm.

Jang Hayoung watched the residents of the Complex rushing somewhere to
eat their lunch and murmured. "I ended up working hard again because of
you."
⸢Hospital room, 6:24 PM⸥

"Toss it. It's my turn now."

Along with Lee Gilyoung's words, Shin Yoosung flipped a 100 Won coin
upwards. It spun around in the air and landed back on the back of her hand.
It was heads.

"How many times did we toss this thing?" Lee Gilyoung asked.

"99."

"Then, it's 49 against 50."

Lee Gilyoung dusted his hands and stood up from his spot, prompting Lee
Jihye sitting on the guardian's bed to ask. "You guys, you're still making
that wager? That wager about Dokja ahjussi still being alive if it's heads or
something?"

"What are you talking about? Ahjussi is alive right here, isn't he?"

"Okay, so what wager is it this time?"

The children didn't reply. Lee Jihye frowned. "You two, do you really
believe that claim?"

"What do you mean?"

"That story about the existence of another Dokja ahjussi that we don't know
about. About how he didn't leave the subway train…"

The two kids didn't reply again. Lee Jihye, dazedly looking at Kim Dokja,
suddenly jumped up from her spot and pointed at him. "This ahjussi is the
Dokja ahjussi I know of, okay?"

"…"

"He's the ahjussi who saved you and me, got that?"
"We know."

"You think that's all?"

Lee Jihye continued to mouth off why this Dokja was the real deal.

But strangely enough, she felt Kim Dokja was getting even further away
from her as her arguments continued on.

"And, and also…"

Lee Jihye grasped Kim Dokja's pale hand tightly.

It just didn't feel real to her. She barely managed to grow older along with
the owner of this hand. She learned of losing someone precious, and was
taught the values she needed to protect. And she somehow managed to start
breathing again in this messed-up world.

Kim Dokja too, must've learned all those from someone else.

Shin Yoosung muttered out. "…Ahjussi must've had a childhood too."

The founding Story for the 'Demon King of Salvation' in <Star Stream>
was the 'King of a Kingless World'. However, that was the beginning of the
'Demon King of Salvation', not Kim Dokja's.

⸢Most likely, the human Kim Dokja's beginning wasn't as grandiose.⸥

In order to exist with the name of Kim Dokja, what kind of stories did Kim
Dokja have to live through?

"Eonni." Shin Sooyoung asked again.

"What now?"

"Are you planning to go tomorrow?"

"We agreed not to, didn't we?"
"But, you're still going, right?"

"No, I won't. I don't want to go back to the scenarios again."

Lee Jihye looked at the heads of the children from above that had grown
taller before she even realized it.

They were kids she still had to look after.

Shin Yoosung and Lee Gilyoung quietly looked up at her, before the girl
extended her hand out.

"Noona, you want to try it?" Lee Gilyoung asked.

Lee Jihye wordlessly stared at the coin gripped in her hand. Then, slowly
tossed it up in the air. It spun around and her palm grasped it again.
However, she was unable to open her hand.

"Eonni?"

The sensation of the coin captured in her hand; she couldn't tell whether it
was heads or tails, but without a doubt, the coin did exist.

"Are you alright?"

Lee Jihye felt the texture of the coin in her hand for the longest time.




⸢Hospital room, 10:48 PM.⸥

The first person to open her mouth was Yoo Sangah.

"The Story level is still dropping lower."

As if the break down of a lifeform that should've normally taken several
decades was happening at once, Kim Dokja's blood continued to evaporate.
Lee Sookyung asked. "Seolhwa-ssi, is there any way to…?"

"As of now…"

"Can't we go with the method used to save both of us? Such as, repairing
the Stories."

Lee Seolhwa sighed softly and spoke while shifting her gaze in Yoo
Sangah's direction.

"We chose the Story repair method for both Sookyung-ssi and Seolhwa-ssi
because the <Star Stream>'s system was functioning properly back then."

It was a world where skills and Stigmata existed. Everything in the world
acted as the components of stories. And so, the 'treatment' in such a world
was all about repairing the Stories.

"Recently, the skills or Stories have stopped activating as before. Even
Aileen-ssi and I are gradually losing our powers," said Lee Seolhwa

"…Is that because the <Star Stream>'s influence is disappearing?"

"With how things are like now, that's the likeliest possibility."

"The reason why Dokja-ssi's wounds aren't healing must be of a similar
nature."

Kim Dokja before their eyes was an existence created out of the [Avatar]
skill. And the [Avatar] was a skill belonging to <Star Stream> system.

Lee Seolhwa made her final diagnosis. "Dokja-ssi will eventually disappear
if he remains in this place."

Lee Sookyung wordlessly stared at Kim Dokja.

The world he spent all of his life to establish was now killing him. As if, the
world where the stories had ended no longer needed Kim Dokja.
Lee Sookyung reached out and touched the sleeping Kim Dokja's cheek
with her hand. "…If I knew you'd end up like this, maybe I should've
stopped you back then."

The moment her extended hand touched his cheek, a Story bloomed
between the two. It was the story of two people fighting inside the [Dark
Castle]. Lee Sookyung still remembered what happened back then.

His face looking back at her through [The Fourth Wall] between them; a
wall always existed between the two. However, Kim Dokja knocking on
that wall before she could was the first time he had ever done that.

Even if she turned back the clock, she'd still fail at stopping her son.

Lee Sookyung stared at Kim Dokja for a long time before holding her son's
hand, a hand that always loved books. Most likely, the other Kim Dokja
was still busily 'scrolling' with these very hands while riding on the subway.

"Maybe I shouldn't have given you the name of Dokja."




⸢Industrial Complex eastern entrance, 8:00 PM.⸥

While standing like a pair of trees with mismatching height, Han Sooyoung
and Yoo Joonghyuk were waiting for their companions to arrive. Cold
winter winds moistened their cheeks, and warm breath leaked out of their
mouth.

Han Sooyoung shoved her hands inside the parka and grumbled. "…No
one's coming."

They figured that something like this might happen. Han Sooyoung
elbowed Yoo Joonghyuk on the side.
"Hey, isn't it fine with just us? If we combine my ingenious brain and your
nonsensical fighting prowess, then…"

"It's impossible for us two."

"Argh, why not? You've been fine so far all alone, right? But this time, it'd
be two of us, you know?"

Rather than replying, Yoo Joonghyuk quietly looked at his own hand. A
transparent ring was swirling around above that very hand.

[Stigma, 'Regression' is evolving.]

The countless regression turns he lived through were writhing within that
ring.

"You have no idea what it means to 'regress'," said Yoo Joonghyuk, as he
slowly distorted the ring within his palm. "You don't know what happens
every time I go through the regression."

Stories grasped tightly within his fist howled out in agony.

Sentences were exploding like insect eggs. Those were screams of the ones
that repeatedly died many times throughout his life.

"There is no such thing as the perfect regression, just like how there can
be no Story without sacrifices. If I regress again this time…" More than
likely, he'd lose someone again.

The world would sink into yet another tragedy.

The world about to be created in order to save Kim Dokja could be
destroyed without managing to save anyone, instead. Han Sooyoung
replied. "I know that. Also…"
She shifted her gaze over to the Complex's entrance and continued on.
Since when was it? Several lengthy shadows were drawing closer to them
under the cold wintery light.

"Those people also know it, too."
         Chapter 527: Epilogue 2 - Not found anywhere, II


Han Sooyoung explained the plan in clear, concise words.

One, in order to rescue Kim Dokja, they had to cross the [Final Wall].

Two, to cross the [Final Wall], they needed a total of five [fragments].

Three, the only remaining fragment in this world-line was [The Fourth
Wall] Kim Dokja's Avatar possessed.

Four, to acquire the other four fragments, they were to perform 'group
regression' and cross over to another world-line.

The companions stared at each other with slightly dazed expressions after
hearing that very concise plan.

The first one to ask was Lee Jihye. "…Will that even be possible?"

"This guy said it is, so I'm sure it will be," replied Han Sooyoung.
After receiving her gaze, Yoo Joonghyuk nodded his head. "It's possible.
However, my Stigma hasn't finished evolving yet, so it might take a little
while longer. We needed time to prepare ourselves, anyway."

"…Hold on. This 'regression' you speak of, Master, just what is the
principle behind it?"

"When I activate the regression, we will all return to the past, to the starting
point of the scenarios."

"Then, what about our own world?"

"A brand new world-line separate from this one will be created. If you
want to count the regression number, then… It'll be the 1865th turn." The
1865th world-line.

It was such a gob-smacking number that the companions could only blink
their eyes in stupefaction.

"So, you're saying we should give it another shot over there."

As if she had already expected something like this before coming here,
Jung Heewon's expression as she said those words was filled with sheer
determination. However, not everyone held the same view as her.

"According to my knowledge, your 'regression' this time had been a little
special, wasn't it?" Yoo Sangah was the one saying these words. "I read
about 'regressions' inside Dokja-ssi's library so I know a few things about it,
as well. All of your regressions until now had been based on the worldview
of the 'Ways of Survival'. However, this regression turn was a little bit
special, wasn't it."

Other companions seemed to have finally realized, at least a little bit, what
she was talking about.
The current 'world-line' was different from Yoo Joonghyuk's past
regressions. It was the world-line brought to life by Yoo Joonghyuk's desire
to see the 'end'.

A portion of [The Fourth Wall] caved in, and that resulted in a world where
reality and fiction combined into one. Its proof was that this regression turn
featured some people who weren't characters from the 'Ways of Survival'.

"Can all of us really go back together? Can you assure us that'll be the
case?"

If Yoo Joonghyuk's 'regression' activated with the 'Ways of Survival' as its
operational criteria, then several of the companions, such as Yoo Sangah
and Lee Gilyoung, couldn't accompany him.

Yoo Joonghyuk slowly blinked his eyes and replied. "Regression will
activate with the world-line that I am currently in as its operational criteria."

"That means this 'Dokja-ssi' can travel with us, too."

Yoo Sangah pointed to Kim Dokja lying on the hospital bed behind them.

The reason why this world's Kim Dokja was dying had to do with the
power of the system weakening gradually. However, if they could take this
Kim Dokja with them through [Group Regression], then he'd go under
<Star Stream>'s system once more.

Yoo Joonghyuk lightly nodded his head. "…Probably."

"Well, it's settled, then. Anyone not agreeing to it, raise your hands."

Shin Yoosung cautiously raised her hand at Han Sooyoung's cocky tone of
voice indicating that she didn't think anyone would oppose the decision.

"Argh, what do you think you are doing?" Han Sooyoung asked back.

"…I'm not sure if this is the right thing to do. Didn't ahjussi want
Joonghyuk ahjussi to stop regressing?"
"That idiot never really cared about what we wanted, anyway. Even steven,
I say."

"If Joonghyuk ahjussi regresses, scenarios will begin in the world again.
Lots of people will die. And they'll be thrown into tragedies again.

Constellations will use people as their toys… And many won't even get to
clear the first scenario."

Shin Yoosung was right.

Perhaps, one could argue that she was the Incarnation who understood 'Kim
Dokja's' thoughts better than anyone among the companions.

And for sure, he probably didn't want to create such misery.

However, Han Sooyoung's thoughts were different. "And so, you think
'misery' won't happen if we don't regress?"

"Excuse me?"

Han Sooyoung sighed lightly and looked up at the empty air. "Hey, you.
Just for how long are you going to sit back and spectate?"

At the end of that question, a ball of fine hair suddenly popped up in the air.

[Bah-aht?]

Han Sooyoung tutted unhappily in the direction of Biyoo employing the
innocent-looking puppy-eyes tactic. "You and that thing again."

That prompted Yoo Joonghyuk to say something. "Biyoo."

Biyoo dry-coughed a bit before opening her mouth. [Whether you regress
or not, other world-lines will continue to be destroyed.]

Biyoo's fluent Korean caused Shin Yoosung's jaw to drop.
She already knew that the small Dokkaebi could speak. But this would be
the first time since the subway that they got to converse at length.

"…How do you know that?"

[Because I'm the 'Dokkaebi King' now, that's why.]

After going 'Ahem!', Biyoo then pounded her chest with that small arm of
hers.

Not only was she not a Dokkaebi affiliated with the Bureau, but she also
happened to be one that inherited the Dokkaebi King's <Star Stream> in
full, too.

The only reason why the <Star Stream>'s influence persisted at all was
because of her, and at the same time, its gradual disappearance was the
result of no Dokkaebis other than Biyoo currently existing.

[You may not be aware of this, but world-lines are being born every minute
and every second.]

"…Every minute and second?"

[That's right. Whenever an existence in a world makes a decision on
something, a brand new world-line will be born. Every time you flipped
that coin, Yoosung-ah, a new world-line was born and got destroyed.]

The world-lines were basically like a tree's branches that got divided
whenever choices were made, Biyoo explained.

[The 'regression' is simply a special method of choosing 'world-lines', that's
all. It's like, you're returning to the point in time when the choice was made
to start a new branch.]

It was a head-trip of a revelation.

"In that case, just how many worlds, until now…"
Biyoo opened her mouth again as if she had already read the vast,
boundless despair of the gathered companions. […Only Father would know
that.] 'Father'.

There could only ever be one person that Biyoo would refer to as her
'father' in all of the world-lines.

The Constellation responsible for establishing <Kim Dokja's Company>.

And the existence that ended up becoming this universe's 'Oldest Dream'.

[You can only change one world-line out of all the countless others out
there.]




The companions earnestly started cooking up their plan on the following
day.

Project <Capture the Squid>. Han Sooyoung came up with that title.

"What was the standard of 'lifeform' as accepted by <Star Stream>, again?"

Since they all decided to 'regress' once more, they had to come up with a
truly perfect plan.

The companions often discussed the methods to thoroughly and completely
conquer the scenarios, and the one topic their opinions seemed to clash far
more than any other was the 'first scenario'.

"What about germs? Germs are also lifeforms, aren't they? If you spray
hydrochloric acid on a hand, wouldn't you get, like, ten thousand Coins?"

"If such a thing was accepted, then a person doing nothing should've
survived, too. Our bodies kill germs in real-time, you know."
"Some people survived without doing anything, though."

"We can't afford to let fate decide for us. We definitely need to kill
something."

"I killed a grasshopper to survive back then. And I heard Dokja hyung even
resorted to breaking grasshopper eggs to earn Coins."

Han Sooyoung quietly listening to the various opinions began jotting them
down on the memo.

"So, then. Insect eggs are counted as lifeforms in <Star Stream>'s
standards."

"Why don't the germs count, though?"

"I think it has something to do with you actually being able to perceive the
taking of life. Should we ask Biyoo about it?"

Even the 'Team Anna' featuring Selena Kim and Iris was added to the mix,
and the strategy meeting became even livelier than before.

"This route is the best one to take during here."

"…No, hang on. This one's better. According to my [Predictive Plagiarism]
…"

Kim Dokja didn't exist in the next regression turn waiting for them.
However, that didn't mean they knew nothing, either.

Yoo Joonghyuk was in possession of the 1863rd turn's memories he got
from the 'Secretive Plotter', and…

Han Sooyoung possessed the [Predictive Plagiarism].

And Yoo Sangah had read the records within [The Fourth Wall]'s library.
⸢And finally, they were the only beings that managed to go beyond the
[Final Wall].⸥
Han Sooyoung was able to breathe again after the first meeting came to an
end. It had been only a week; according to Yoo Joonghyuk, the 'group
regression' would only be available in a month's time from now.

The companions sometimes argued with each other over the methods of
clearing scenarios.

"The ⸢Greatest Sacrificial Lamb⸥. You gotta definitely…"

"Did you forget that Dokja-ssi died back then? If you do it this way…"

They hated the scenario more than anyone out there.

Even then, even as they discussed it at length, the companions seemed
excited about something, somehow.

Why was this? They regained their reality by barely surviving past the
scenarios, yet how could they be so jovial when discussing a plan to return
to the 'scenarios'?

⸢Reality didn't refer to a specific 'place'.⸥

Maybe this was because all of them couldn't forget about a certain
someone.

Maybe, they just couldn't forget the time they spent together with that
certain someone to survive the horrifying tragedy.

"I still remember everything about the [Cinema Dungeon]. Dokja-ssi did
this here…"

The locations where each of the companions joined the group might have
been different. The time they remembered, and the 'Kim Dokja' they
remembered, were also different.
Despite all that, just like how Yoo Joonghyuk's numerous regression turns
eventually gathered to become 'one person', it was a similar story for Kim
Dokja, as well.

"The [Absolute Throne]. According to Dokja hyung's words…"

Parts of Kim Dokja different people liked gathered to become one Kim
Dokja. And…

"…I miss it back then."

…And Kim Dokja's parts gathered in that manner caused the companions to
start loving the other parts still unfamiliar to them.

Han Sooyoung slowly turned her head and her eyes caught the figure of
Yoo Joonghyuk sitting in a lotus position. Golden rings were looping
around his entire body as he trained hard in order to evolve his Stigma.

Han Sooyoung wordlessly observed him for a while, before asking a
question. "Hey. I was curious about something."

"I'm concentrating, so stop bothering me."

"You told me earlier that you recalled the memories from the 0th turn,
didn't you?"

One of the golden rings went out of the loop. As faint sparks danced around
him, Yoo Joonghyuk cracked open his eyelids just a little.

Han Sooyoung grinned and asked again. "What exactly did you
remember?"

He hesitated for a long time before replying. "Kim Dokja was there."

"Wha? Seriously?"

"That's why I became certain. Certain that Kim Dokja was still alive as the
'Oldest Dream'."
"What was he doing there, anyway?"

"I can't remember everything, but…" Yoo Joonghyuk scowled heavily and
while looking at his [Black Heavenly Demon Sword], spoke in a seething
tone of voice. "I know for certain that he hit me in the back of my head."




I opened my eyes while sensing the clunking, noisy vibration of the subway
train.

⸢I t's ok to sl eep mo re Kim Dok ja⸥

"I've slept enough."

I stretched my heavy-feeling limbs, and sensed the vitality return slowly to
the rest of my body.

Most of the powers I spent watching the 0th turn had been recovered. The
right arm I sacrificed in order to facilitate Yoo Joonghyuk's regression had
almost fully regrown by now, too.

But for some reason, it felt as if my whole body was lighter than before.
Should I say that my body size had shrunken overall?

⸢Yoo Joonghyuk began his second life.⸥

Yoo Joonghyuk as he lived through the first turn was now reflected on the
display panel.

I recalled his figure as he was leaving the 0th turn. Even though he had
reached the most ideal conclusion that I could think of, he still chose to
regress.

To find out the reason why he was born into this world.
To find the cause behind his existence in this reality.

"The Fourth Wall."

⸢Ng⸥

"If every creature was born because someone had 'read' them… You think
there is an existence reading about me somewhere, too?"

[The Fourth Wall] didn't reply. Maybe, even it also had no clue about this
topic.

I began imagining the 'other reader' observing me from somewhere.
However, it was harder than I thought. Just like how it was with the first
'Oldest Dream', a god could very well be a helpless, powerless creature. It
could even be someone that I recognised, too.

Maybe it was one of the <Kim Dokja's Company>'s members?

Could it be that I existed in this place because they were imagining about
me?

⸢Wan na l o o k?⸥

I shifted my gaze towards the screen displaying Yoo Joonghyuk's 1st turn.
"Maybe later. I still have lots of other world-lines to look at, after all."

It was around then that the subway's speed began decreasing gradually.

[The train will be flying over the outskirts of the dream.]

A portion of the screens was switched off, and the panoramic view of the
universe was shown outside the windows, instead.

Even before I could ask, [The Fourth Wall] spoke first.

⸢Uni ver se's ou ts kir ts, bor der zo nes of oth er dim en sio ns⸥
Faint rays of light could be spied within the universe's pitch-black night
skies.

For sure, this seemed quite different from the <Star Stream>'s universe.
Because this particular universe was shaped like a warped tree.

"…What's over there? Are there universes different than mine?"

⸢'Star Stream' is j u s t one of ma ny wo rldv iews in the gr eater uni ver se⸥

[Currently, the train is flying past the outskirts of 'Tree of Illusion'.]

[Currently, the train is passing through the Dark Dimension's time axis.]

The Tree of Illusion. That seemed like the name of the tree over there.

…Was I mistaken, though? I thought I heard that name before somewhere.


"Can we go there?"

⸢Too dan ger ous so bet ter not⸥

"Is there a 'Oldest Dream' over there, too?"

⸢Th ere is but dif fer ent n a m e⸥

Numerous roots extending well below, stems created out of countless souls,
and way above them all, branches assimilated into the night sky. The roots
and branches circled around the vast distance of the universe to connect
with each other, and something resembling a massive eye was in the middle
– a lone eye, illuminating the universe with boiling, licking flames. The
moment my gaze met that eye's, I was overcome with this inexplicable
chill.

[A problem has occurred in the system!]
The subway's speed rapidly fell along with the loud clunking noise. Lights
within the train flickered and died without warning, and a metallic screech
reverberated within. This was almost the same as back when the first
scenario was issued. Loud ringing exploded in my ears, soon followed by a
bizarre machine-like grinding noise next.

Something was approaching the window of the subway.

⸢Kim Dok ja dan ger⸥

And then, I saw a single ray of light.

⸢Oth er di men sion's ab so lu te be ing⸥

At the end of that ray of light was a single blade. This light sliced past the
Dark Stratum and flew straight in, seemingly splitting the entirety of the
universe in the process. I clearly witnessed what that technique was.

That was 'Thrust'.

KWA-BOOOM!!

I was thrown ungainly to the floor as the explosion went off.

I reflexively awakened my Stories and hurriedly raised my head, only to
discover the sword that had already broken past the train's entrance. It was a
sword with a blade darker than the darkness itself. And a naked man was
standing there glaring at me, his hand gripping that very sword.

"You bastard, are you the <<Big Brother>>?"
        Chapter 528: Epilogue 2 - Not found anywhere, III


I could only stare at the buck-naked man in sheer stupefaction.

This situation was proving to be really difficult to comprehend.

"I asked you whether you are the <<Big Brother>> or not."

"…No, hang on a minute. I'm the one with questions here. Just who are
you? And what is this <<Big Brother>>?"

"It seems that you are not the <<Big Brother>>. But, how did you break
past the Time Fall and enter here? Besides, what is this train? A subway…
Is this yet another type of Tower of Nightmares? How does it even
operate?" This guy, words were obviously not getting through to him.

To think, he'd damage someone else's train and barge inside, only to start
yapping on and on about his own stuff.

I activated the [Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint] right away. And then, bore
witness to a message I had never seen before.
[Applicable individual is a 'Character' from a worldview you are not
familiar with.]

…A 'Character' from a worldview I wasn't familiar with?

Almost at the same time, bright light suddenly shone out from the naked
man's eyes.

[Someone is activating a power not registered with the system!]

Circular disks were vigorously spinning above his retinas.

[An existence of another dimension is spying on your true nature!]

[Warning! This power cannot be fully blocked by 'The Fourth Wall'!]

…Wha?

Tsu-chuchuchut!

Along with the sparks going wild in front of my eyes, all the Stories within
me exploded forth as if to resist the opposition's power. The ones that
reacted most viscerally were…

[Stigma 'Regression's' essence is writhing.]

[Story, 'Hell of Eternity', is baring its fangs!]

In an instant, a portion of subway's interior transformed into the view of the
hellish landscape Yoo Joonghyuk had lived through. The naked man looked
at the world submerged in crimson hue and formed a stunned expression.

"This 'inherent world' is… Could it be, you're a regressor?"

…Inherent world?

I was about to throw a tackle, saying that that sounded like what Kim
Namwoon might say. But then, the man's black sword suddenly began
quivering with hatred.
"You are a bastard that turned his back on reality. So, die."

Just as the chilling light permeating within his blade edge moved towards
me…

[The train is re-entering its normal tracks.]

[The authority of the 'Oldest Dream' is activating!]

[The system is ejecting the foreign matter found within!]

Along with the 'Shu-wuwuk!' noise, the man pointing his sword at me was
rapidly sucked out towards the exit.

"You dare!"

However, he stabbed his sword into the exit and held on, resolutely
enduring the train's acceleration.

It was right at that moment that my body was transferred to another section
of the subway.

[Emergency combat system is activating!]

[A portion of the subway used in the ejection will be discarded.]

I looked back to discover the tail section of the train that naked man was
clinging onto had separated from the rest and was now drifting away into
the universe. And the furious man began dashing in my direction next.

That figure of the man, with the muscles in his entire body ballooning up,
gave me this sense of inexplicable terror.

"Hurry up! That bastard is coming after us!"

⸢Don t wo rry that g uy ca n't es cap e fr om the ti me a x is⸥
That man chased after the subway at a frightening turn of speed, but was
unable to climb aboard again. It was as if a transparent wall existed between
him and the train. He continued to diligently run on the train tracks, but
from a certain moment on, he stopped his pounding steps and glared quietly
in this direction.

Only after that dude's figure had grown very far away was I able to breathe
a sigh of relief.

"…Just what was that?"

⸢But ch er of Mo nar chs Jae hwan⸥

…Butcher of Monarchs??

⸢A mon ster that tra ined for sev eral bil lion ye ars in the ti me ax is⸥

I momentarily doubted my own hearing.

"How many years did you say?"

⸢I al so don t kn ow exa ctly he exi sted be fore I was cre ated⸥

That guy was older than [The Fourth Wall]? I was getting goosebumps just
from the mere idea of that incredible length of time.

Could a human being endure billions of years without going insane? …No,
hang on a second. He didn't seem quite right in his head, actually.

"Why was he trapped in there for billions of years, though?"

⸢To des troy the sy stem of the uni ver se he bel ongs to⸥

"We are not going to run into him again, are we?"

Maybe [The Fourth Wall] was too tired, as there was no reply. It must've
been busy fixing the damaged train.
I dusted my coat, the one where the sword belonging to a crazy bastard
named Jae-Hwan had brushed past a moment earlier. Now that was truly a
gob-smacking Thrust, alright. No Constellation or Transcendent I've met so
far would be able to perform such a powerful stabbing attack.

Would billions of years leave a human in that wretched state?

The restoration of the system must've been completed, as Stories from
world-lines reappeared one by one on the train's windows. Yoo Joonghyuk
from the 1st turn shooting a terrifying glare at the heavens was among
them. I quietly glared back at him for a little while, but suddenly grew
scared of something.

"The Fourth Wall."

⸢Wh at⸥

"…How old is Yoo Joonghyuk now?"




"We depart in a week's time."

Finally, Yoo Joonghyuk's Stigma finished its evolution. People who agreed
to participate in the Project <Capture the Squid> began preparing for their
departure.

"Aileen-ssi, Bok-Sun-ssi, Yeong-Ran-ssi. We'll leave the Complex in your
care."

"I see. So you decided to go as well."

Lee Sookyung smiled faintly as people bade them goodbye. "Yes."

However, not everyone decided to travel with them.
"We can't go."

A portion of 'Team Anna', including 'Anna Croft' herself, chose to remain in
this world-line.

"The system is gradually weakening, and this world is the closest to the
conclusion that I'd been thinking of. That's why we'll remain in this world.
However, there is someone who wishes to travel with you among our team,
so… if it's not too much trouble, can you accept her, please?" Anna Croft
asked.

The sole person from Team Anna joining the <Capture the Squid> was
none other than 'Selena Kim'. She smiled awkwardly and briefly explained
that there was a debt she had to repay Kim Dokja no matter what.

Han Sooyoung confirmed for the last time. "Is there anyone else? Is this
everyone from the Industrial Complex?"

Rather unexpectedly, the person who hesitantly raised his hand was Han
Myungoh.

"What's this, ahjussi? You're obviously going, right?"

"I've raised my hand to tell you that I can't go."

"…What?"

She knew that the original relationship between Han Myungoh and Kim
Dokja wasn't very amicable. However, she figured that, as they experienced
the scenarios together, they would've gotten a bit friendlier, but this…

"I can't go."

Only after hearing those words did Han Sooyoung realize that he was
holding the hand of a young girl.

⸢In this regression turn, there were some people they simply couldn't travel
with.⸥
Han Sooyoung quietly looked into the girl's face. Outwardly, she seemed to
be in her teens, but her mental age probably hadn't even reached five yet.

Children who were born after the scenarios began couldn't accompany them
during the regression. Because this child at least didn't exist back at the
beginning.

Han Sooyoung shifted her gaze over to Han Myungoh's aged face, before
opening her mouth. "Got it. Ahjussi, you can stay."

"I'll leave Dokja-ssi in your hands."

"You worry about yourself first. And since you're going to stay behind, take
care of the Complex's matters, too. You will run into a shortage of
manpower after we leave. If I catch you playing video games in some dark
corner somewhere, I'm gonna jump across the world-lines and kick your
ass, got that?"

It was then multiple vehicles rushed in from the distance. Waves of crowd
jumped out of their black sedans and hurriedly crashed in like the incoming
tide.

"Representative Han Sooyoung-nim! Please grant us an interview!"

Han Sooyoung frowned deeply.

"Is it true that you're planning a mass regression along with the Regressor?"

The display panel in the plaza was broadcasting her face in real-time. The
unmistakable letters 'LIVE' were stuck on the corner of the broadcast, too.
Her mask was already being shown to the rest of the country without her
consent.

"We know that Representative Kim Dokja-nim places importance on the
current reality above all else. In that case, why did you make that kind of a
decision?"
"What will happen to this world-line? Are you saying you'll abandon this
world?"

Han Sooyoung chuckled bitterly at these reporters attacking her as if she
was the history's worst betrayer or some such. "Abandoning this world? Are
we really? You think we own this world or something?"

"Representative-nim, you have a duty to this wor…"

"Does this world still need us, anyway? When the scenarios are over and
done with?"

Right in that moment, the expressions on the reporters transformed. Their
camera lenses shone brightly as if they caught the scent of a scoop, and
began capturing Han Sooyoung's face even closer. She confirmed her
visage on the display panel and continued on.

"What will change if we stay here? You lot will simply come up with weird
laws to try and control us. You think we don't know about Donghoon doing
his absolute best to block the legislation from being passed in the National
Assembly? You people don't need us any more. No, you fear us, instead."

"However, we don't know when the scenarios will begin again! What if
Dokkaebis reappear in the world…!"

Han Sooyoung grinned refreshingly. Since things had come down to this,
she figured that this was for the better. "Did you mean someone like her,
right?"

Something resembling a huge hot-air balloon was floating in the location
she was looking at. Reporters realizing the identity of that mysterious thing
all screamed out in sheer terror.

[I am Biyoo, the Dokkaebi King of this world-line.]

She sounded so forceful, as if the scenarios were starting again, reminding
them of the starting point of the terror that brought forth the destruction of
this world.
Biyoo began chuckling as if she knew all about their fears.

[Those that were born will eventually be destroyed. However, this planet
will be fine. As long as there is no nuclear warfare, it'll last for tens of
thousands of years without a problem. Well, you'll still have to occasionally
dodge a few wayward asteroids that might come flying in your way,
though.] Having heard what the Dokkaebi was saying, the eyes of the
reporters all went round from stupefaction.

Unfortunately, the real thing hadn't been said yet.

[Your main scenario has indeed ended. However… I still have the authority
to issue sub-scenarios.]

The complexions of the reporters grew deathly pale from the term
'subscenario'.

"R-run away! That Dokkaebi, it's going to-!"

And then, a message popped up before their eyes.

[A ne■w sub scen■ario has arr■ived!]

The message window wasn't clear, perhaps due to the collapse of the
Bureau. Even then, it wasn't hard to read its contents.

[You aren't forced to participate in this scenario. Only those who wish to
will be accepted, and only the qualified volunteers will go through the
careful screening.]

[Applicable sub-scenario is for voluntary participation.]

[Because <Star Stream> has been destroyed, I don't have any rewards to
give you. However, if you help out <Kim Dokja's Company>…]

Biyoo was smiling as if she was satisfied by her own appearance as seen in
the display panel.
[At the very least, you'll get to relive those moments you've always
regretted about.]




And another week passed by since then.

[Sub scenario, 'Capture the Squid', has a new volunteer.]

The people who managed to survive until the end of the scenarios. These
people who had lost something precious to them had been gathering in
Seoul one by one.

Yoo Joonghyuk stared at the incoming waves of people and frowned
deeply.
"…There are too many. This might get a little difficult."

"We gotta take as many as we can. That's the only way to save lots of
people."

There seemed to be over five hundred volunteers even at a casual glance.
The members of <Kim Dokja's Company> carefully interviewed them and
through the analysis of the regression turn, they identified those with
reasons for disqualification.

Yoo Joonghyuk and Han Sooyoung then specially focused on training
them, and had them familiarised with all the necessary skills.

And, after a concerted effort to filter them out over and over again, the total
number of remaining volunteers dwindled down to one hundred.

These one hundred were everyone they could bring along from this
worldline.

"…Can we truly go back to the past?"
The one asking that question was Julius, the possessor of the attribute
'Judge of Three Generations'. He was ranked 52nd in the 'top 100 strongest
humans', his nickname was 'Judge of Wrath'.

He had to lose all of his family, his friends, and companions back in his
country, and had been living on with grief and anger aimed at the world.

He wasn't the only one, however.

The faces of Japan's Asuka Ren, and even China's Fei Hu and India's
Ranvir Khan, could be seen among the crowd. The strongest Incarnations
that managed to survive the scenarios had all gathered here.

Julius shouted out. "Please tell us the truth! We have said nothing and
endured your training regime until now, didn't we?! Is it true that we can go
back to the past?"

"No, it's a lie," replied Yoo Joonghyuk.

"What do you… in that case, why did you even gather us…"

"What you're about to go back to isn't the 'past'. No, it's simply a different
world-line. No matter what you do, humans can never go back to their
past."

"I didn't come here to listen to that obvious…!"

"What has happened will never change. People you loved are already all
dead."

His level tone of voice shut down the mouths of the others.

"They won't remember you. They won't recall their own demise, nor will
they remember the time they spent with you. Every time you speak to them,
you will gradually come to realize that the time you lived together can
never be yours again."

Deep pain was pervading in each and every word he spoke.
These words were from the only man among them who had lived on while
remembering the disappeared world-lines.

"You shall become even more lonely, and in the end, you will end up
all alone. No one will be able to understand your pain. And rather than
understanding your pain, the world will start calling you a regressor
and curse you for stealing someone else's future, instead. None of you
will belong to anywhere, and slowly wither away while still alive."
This was the curse of the regression.

"Even then, will you still choose to regress?"

And this was also the final test to become a regressor.

People who came here to become exactly that began exchanging glances.
Some were scared off by the intimidation and stepped back, while some
others, those that had been steeling themselves to what's to come, started
taking deep breaths. And then, someone slowly stepped forward.

It was Asuka Ren, the Japanese who fought together with <Kim Dokja's
Company> back in the [Peace Land]. Also, someone who lost more
companions than anyone here.

"I know that no matter what I do, it still won't bring back all those that I've
lost. However, if I regress…" She gripped her katana tightly, raised her
head, and spoke up. "At a bare minimum, I might be able to save that
world-line." And then, people began standing next to her one by one.

"I don't care if my pain is meaningless. Even if everything was an illusion."

"Just once, if I could save them just once…!"

This was their determination. Some were captured by their own passion,
while some were mired in sorrow.

And every one of them was longing for their past.
Yoo Joonghyuk knew the truth.

⸢They will all grow to regret this moment.⸥

He could've said something. He could've told them what his companions
from repeated regressions have told him.

⸢"Captain. You must live in the present. Don't get lost in the events of the
past."⸥

⸢"They are all just delusions, that's all."⸥

His dead companions from the previous regression turns were saying those
during this turn. Every time he heard them, Yoo Joonghyuk quietly
polished his sword and endured.

None of them could understand.

They couldn't understand that there was someone in this world who could
never live in the present.

"Please, take us with you, Supreme King."

And that was why the regressor Yoo Joonghyuk understood the people
standing before his eyes. The past was the only present they could choose,
and no one had the right to tell them they were wrong.

No, well, maybe a certain guy would be compelled to say that they were
wrong.

⸢"Don't ever think that, just by discarding this turn, your next one will be
better. Because just maybe, the regression turn you wish to abandon could
very well be the 'one single turn' where you get to see the end of this world
as a 'human being'.⸥

Yoo Joonghyuk slowly closed his eyes.
Could the current him reply to what Kim Dokja had said back then?

He wasn't sure.

However, he was certain of one thing.

⸢There was someone in this world who would go as far as to abandon his
'humanity' to see a certain story.⸥
Yoo Joonghyuk stood up from his spot and raised his voice.

"We are heading out. Call on the Constellations."
         Chapter 529: Epilogue 2 - Not found anywhere, IV


Lee Sookyung was standing before the darkest star.

"Will you go with us?"

[Constellation, 'Queen of the Darkest Spring', is slowly opening her eyes.]

The location Persephone rested in wasn't the Underworld. That was because
the passageway to her home had disappeared after <Star Stream> collapsed.
She was currently staying in the special guest room in the Industrial
Complex. She stayed there, staring at the night sky every day – as if to
comprehend the most ancient Stories.

[The fact that I'm still alive, it must mean that my ■■ isn't in this place, at
the very least.]

She slowly turned her head, her eyes still radiating some warmth. Warmth,
left behind by a certain someone. Lee Sookyung knew whose Story that
was. [Story, 'Promise of the Darkest Night', is continuing on with its
storytelling.] It was from the King of the Underworld, who swore to be by
her side until the end of the world. And like he promised, he died instead of
Persephone at the end of the world.

[Let us go. We must save that child.]




Jung Heewon knocked on a worn-down door of the Complex's special guest
room.

"Is anyone home?"

She turned the doorknob, and the door opened without resistance. What
greeted her immediately afterwards a holographic figurine.

⸢⸢Kim Dokja, escaping from the water dragon!⸥⸥

It was the figurine of Kim Dokja during his escape from the water dragon.
Not only that, but the line he uttered during the event also floated up below
the hologram, as well.

⸢"Alright, then. Time to go outside."⸥

Jung Heewon stared at that bizarre 3D sculpture with a slightly
dumbfounded face. That wasn't the only figurine, though.

⸢⸢Kim Dokja, destroying the Absolute Throne!⸥⸥

⸢⸢Kim Dokja, liberating the Demon Realm!⸥⸥

"…Not even Yoosung or Gilyoung's rooms look like this."
As if she came to sightsee, Jung Heewon studied each and every figurine.
As she followed the lines of these action figures arranged by the year and
the scenario number, she abruptly recalled their past. Uriel must've been
looking at Kim Dokja during all of these moments.

Among these was a rear tentacle from a squid, seemingly a part of a 'special
limited edition' collection.

⸢⸢Kim Dokja the Squid's last tentacle (made by Yangsan)⸥⸥

She looked at this thing with puzzled eyes, before reaching out to it. But,
just as her hand touched the glass display case, a true voice could be heard.

[If you carelessly touch that, Uriel's going to get really mad.]

How long had it been? An Archangel with a rather wane complexion was
sitting by the table near the display case. No, wait – not many would
actually recognise her as an Archangel these days.

A woman who silently flipped the pages of a book, not even bothering to
look even though she was the one who started the conversation. Jung
Heewon quietly stared at this woman's long eyelashes before asking her.
"Gabriel. Do you know where Uriel is?"

[Constellation, 'Lily Blooming in Aquarius', is revealing her presence.]

The power of a Story spread out like ripples from her entire figure. Perhaps
this was the Archangel displaying her last vestige of pride.

[Oh, the last Incarnation of Eden.]

Gabriel closed the book gently, her eyes gleaming brightly. It seemed that
she had already figured out why Jung Heewon came to visit.

[I've crossed world-lines before. And it was truly a dizzying experience,
indeed. But what all of you are trying to do here exceeds that. You won't
make it out alive.]
"Is that how Eden jinxes others?"

[This is your reality. You must not run away from it. You can't seriously be
considering undoing this ending you earned by finally bringing down the
<Star Stream>, now are you?]

The 'reality'. The weight of that word pressed down slightly on Jung
Heewon's chest. Rather than replying, though, she looked around at the
room's décor again, instead. The bunk bed shared by Uriel and Gabriel was
located on the corner. And the word <EDEN> was stuck above it like a
poster.

⸢The Nebula 'Eden' was finished. No one could deny that truth.⸥

"What makes one's reality isn't the environment nor the location."

Even though Eden was finished, someone still chose to call this very room
her Eden. Because Archangels were still here.

⸢Even if there were only two.⸥

"It's a cool-looking Eden, though."

Jung Heewon turned around to find Gabriel looking at her with trembling
eyes.

"Can you tell me where Uriel is?"

[…Behind you.]

Jung Heewon looked back and sure enough, Uriel was there.

She must've been coming back from her junk food shopping trip, because
her small figure was holding large bundles filled with all sorts of snacks.

Her emerald-hued eyes were opened wide as if she was quite startled at the
moment.
Jung Heewon stared at her Constellation sponsor for a long while.

The brilliant light of an Archangel couldn't almost be felt from Uriel. Her
wings, that used to be on her back, had long disappeared. Even her clothes
had changed. Instead of her favourite black dress, she was kitted out in a
grey hoodie and a pair of track pants.

[Hui, Heewon-ah.]

Jung Heewon knew better than anyone why Uriel ended up looking like
that.

"Uriel."

⸢Wouldn't Uriel be happier if she remained here, honestly speaking?⸥

Uriel the Archangel had carried out the scenarios far, far longer than
herself. In that case, was it the right thing to do, dragging her back into the
depths of hell one more time?

Rather than opening her mouth, though, Jung Heewon squeezed her fist
tightly. When she did, a faint lick of flame rose up from there.

The [Hellfire].

The purest flames in this world, given to her by her Constellation sponsor.

The moment that flame was lit up, the ever-so-slightly dim darkness of the
room was illuminated by yet another sculpture emitting the exact same
flame. Jung Heewon turned her head towards it without thinking too much,
and saw a figurine sporting the same face as hers. It wasn't only 'Kim
Dokjas' in this room, as it turned out.

As if she was under a trance, Jung Heewon approached the glass display
case and looked inside. There she was, wielding the [Judge's Sword] and
firing pure-white [Hellfire].
⸢⸢My one and only Incarnation⸥⸥

Jung Heewon worked hard to suppress the emotions powerfully welling up
inside and spoke. "Uriel."

[Heewon-ah.]

The moment she heard that warm, gentle voice, Jung Heewon realized
something. Her Constellation sponsor already knew everything.

"Please, cheer me on as I live that life one more time."

She slowly turned her head and saw Uriel smiling sorrowfully. As if to ask
whether this would be alright or not. And towards such Uriel, Jung Heewon
knelt down.

"Please, become my Constellation sponsor one more time."




"Where did that idiot Black Flame Dragon disappear to? Flame Dragon~!"

"General-nim! Where are you, my general-nim??"

Those voices came from Han Sooyoung and Lee Jihye, currently searching
for their Constellations. And in the middle of the chaotic sea of people, Yoo
Joonghyuk was looking at his young sister next to him. She had this huge
pout on her face, probably angry at something. He sighed deeply. "You'll be
safer by remaining here."

"…"

"This world will soon stabilise. And this world will…"

"But, you aren't going to be here, oppa."

This would be Yoo Mia's first time not using honorifics.
Yoo Joonghyuk was about to reply to that, but changed what he wanted to
say at the last second. "We will return."

"When?"

"After we get through to the end of the other world-line, and after we rescue
Kim Dokja."

"And when will that be?"

Yoo Joonghyuk couldn't answer.

"It'll be too dangerous. I can't take you there."

"Liar."

A faint trace of the transcendental aura leaked out from Yoo Mia's figure.
That was unmistakably the Status of a Transcendent.

Rather surprisingly, Yoo Mia had awakened the first stage of the
Transcendent after training only for the past few months. She was the
youngest Transcendent in history, which was truly a shocking level of
talent.

"If you were going to say that now, why didn't you stop me from training? I
received the same training as Gilyoung oppa and Yoosung eonni, didn't I?"

"…"

"Please be honest with me, oppa."

Yoo Joonghyuk looked into the girl's eyes that showed not a hint of
wavering, and slowly closed his.

They came up with a plan, so that no one would be lost. And it was far
more foolproof and perfect than any other.

However, variables always had a way of rearing their heads without
warning. And Yoo Mia, she could potentially fall into danger. Yoo
Joonghyuk lowered his gaze, got down on his knees slightly, and looked
straight at Yoo Mia.

"…I'd like you to come with us."

That… was the reply she wanted to hear.

Her small hand patted him on the head.

"…As soon as you regress, our companions will rush to fetch you."

"You'd all have died without me during the 'Capture the Flag' battles,
anyway."

After saying that, Yoo Mia opened her mouth wide. Yoo Joonghyuk peered
deep inside her mouth, and was about to say something with a deep frown
on his face. But then…

"Hey! We found them all!"

Han Sooyoung performing a deadly headlock on the Black Flame Dragon
was walking over there while waving her hand. And behind her, Lee Jihye
clinging onto the arms of the Maritime War God and Goryeo's number one
swordsman could be seen.

Yoo Joonghyuk frowned at them instead. "And where is the monkey?"

Han Sooyoung wordlessly pointed with her chin.

[Constellation, 'Most Ancient Liberator', is currently acting self-important.]

Yoo Joonghyuk narrowed his eyes and looked up in the air. The smirking
Great Sage was floating up there.

"When did you arrive?"

[Aren't your preparations just too slow? If my maknae dies because of your
tardiness, I'm going to rip you apart limb from limb where you stand.]
It seemed that, even though his Status had fallen and <Star Stream> was
destroyed, a Myth-grade wasn't called a 'myth' for no reason. Only the
Great Sage was capable of emitting such vigour even when the 'system' had
long disappeared.

Yoo Joonghyuk replied tersely. "If you get in my way, I will not hesitate to
cut you down."

The Great Sage smiled, his pearly-white teeth in full display.

[Why don't we end that unfinished battle of ours during the next turn? Let's
find out if you can get anywhere remotely close to the 'Secretive Plotter'…]
"Okay, okay, sure thing. Is everyone finished with their preparations?"
Han Sooyoung's voice caused tense expressions to form on the faces of the
waiting Incarnations.

All the members of <Kim Dokja's Company> participating in this
regression trip gathered around. Yoo Sangah, Jung Heewon, Lee Hyunsung,
Shin Yoosung, Lee Gilyoung, Lee Jihye, Lee Seolhwa, and Jang Hayoung.
In addition, even Lee Sookyung and Selena Kim, too.

The Industrial Complex's residents came out to bade them goodbye.

"Supreme King, please remember what I told you."

"Fei Hu, the future of the continent rests on your shoulders."

"Ranvir Khan--"

And among the crowd, a small Dokkaebi was floating in the air.

"Biyoo."

Shin Yoosung reached out even without realizing it. Biyoo, staying back
along with the rest of the residents, carried a vaguely sorrowful expression.

⸢Biyoo couldn't go with them.⸥

Just like how it was with Han Myungoh's daughter, Biyoo too was an
existence born after the world's destruction had begun. She couldn't become
the 'storyteller' during the path they were about to walk on.

Biyoo spoke as if to console the companions. [Don't be too sad. Whichever
world-line you end up, I'll always cheer you on. I'm the 'Dokkaebi King',
you know. If I train a little bit harder, and if I uncover more of the
inheritances

the Wennys left behind, I should be able to cross the world-lines, too. In
that case, we should be able to meet up again.]
"We'll wait for you. Even if it's tens of thousands of years later."

Biyoo cried out "Baat!". And firecrackers went off all over the Industrial
Complex like big-scale fireworks.

"We are heading out."

[Stigma, 'Group Regression Lv.1', is activating!]

Finally, Yoo Joonghyuk commenced the regression. The moment his
Stigma activated, the figures of Yoo Joonghyuk and his companions were
dyed in the shower of resplendent light. It was then.

"You stinking bastards!! You didn't even come to fetch me…!!"

Gong Pildu ran in from the distance and shouted angrily, before jumping
into the shower of light belonging to the regressing party.

Kwa-kwakwakwakwakwa-!!

The world began breaking down.

The companions held each other's hands tightly and stared at the
disappearing world. Biyoo's bright smile was distorting away.

Could they meet again?

Pain akin to their souls shattering into tiny little pieces followed soon after.
Shin Yoosung clenched her teeth tightly.

⸢Yoo Joonghyuk always had to endure these moments all by himself.⸥

Fortunately, he wasn't alone this time.

Shin Yoosung soon realized that she was travelling in the distant galaxy.
The background was getting further away from her at a speed too fast to
see. And different <Star Streams> from other world-lines could be seen, as
well. The Outer Gods, abandoned inside the ashes of those stories were
calling out to the companions.

【Aaaaaaah】

【Overhereoverhereoverhereoverhere】

Han Sooyoung gripped Shin Yoosung's hand even tighter and raised her
voice. "Keep your wits about you if you don't want to get sucked in there."

Shin Yoosung repeatedly looked back to the Outer Gods growing further
away from her. Kim Dokja saved 'Outer Gods' during the last regression
turn. He gave names to these forgotten stories. Even then, this universe was
still filled with so many other forgotten ones.

Han Sooyoung spoke again. "We're not Kim Dokja. We can't save all those
worlds."

Not just Shin Yoosung, but the other companions knew that.

⸢The current 'them' were in too much of a hurry to save a single world
before their eyes.⸥
…But, someday.

⸢Stories that couldn't see the end were all flowing towards somewhere.⸥

The Outer Gods in the distance all changed back to the beautiful galaxies.
Every tragedy looked so captivating when viewed from afar.

Han Sooyoung shouted out. "Hey! Was this thing supposed to take this
long? Are you sure we're on the right tr…"

It was right then that they were slammed by the thunderous noise of a book
being ripped apart.

Riiiiiiip-!!
[World-line has detected the activation of the 'Group Regression'!]

[<Star Stream> is pointing out the Probability of the applicable Stigma!]

[Applicable Stigma is a power that exceeds the limit of the Probability!]

Something had gone wrong here.

Tsu-chuchuchuchut!

Just as Han Sooyoung was about to shout something out, the view out front
was swallowed up by the darkness and it simply vanished. And when she
opened her eyes again, she found herself abandoned in a plain resembling a
blindingly-white snowfield.

"…What the hell?! Where am I??"

Her companions were nowhere to be seen. The only one she could see was
Yoo Joonghyuk carrying a stupid expression on his face.

"…The world-lines got entangled," said Yoo Joonghyuk.

"What dogshit are you talking about?! Didn't we make all the right
preparations??"

Yoo Joonghyuk closed his eyes and began sensing something, before
opening his mouth again. "We did prepare accordingly. And as for the rest
of our companions… It seems that they reached the 1865th turn safely.
Only we ended up here."

"And where is 'here'?"

"…Most likely, we're entrapped in the gap between the world-lines."

Han Sooyoung surveyed her surroundings once more.

Several massive, pitch-black structures were floating up here and there
within this snow-white field.
"Wait for a moment. I shall gather more Stories and reactivate the Stigma,"
said Yoo Joonghyuk.

"How long will that take? Hurry up, will ya? If we get there too late, our
plan or whatever will go down the drain!"

Yoo Joonghyuk seemed to be in deep concentration already, as he didn't
bother to reply.

Han Sooyoung abruptly got up from her spot and extended her hand
towards the nearest structure. When she did, something akin to jet-black
graphite particles stained her hand.

"What the heck is…"

And right next moment, the overall shape of the structure was drawn out
inside her mind.

⸢ㅁ⸥

She was sure of it. This structure, it was shaped like this. And as for that
other structure just beyond her…

⸢ㅓ⸥

Slowly, so very slowly, a creeping chill ran down her spine. She began
reading the structures one by one. And each one soon became a single
phrase.

⸢The Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint⸥
         Chapter 530: Epilogue 2 - Not found anywhere, V


The Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint.

Han Sooyoung narrowed her eyes after seeing that phrase. "…Isn't that the
name of Kim Dokja's skill?"

Why would such a thing be engraved in the gap between the world-lines?

The words continued on.

⸢This was inevitable, I thought. And the reason why I accepted mother's
actions also had to be this, as well.⸥

⸢The reason why I inexplicably started writing an essay…⸥

⸢The reason why I had to become a son of a murderer…⸥

These words were moving towards a certain direction at a constant speed.
These sentences were fluently stretching from the past towards the future. It
was then, Han Sooyoung came to realize something.
The 'regression' was an act of branching out to a new world-line from a
'certain point onwards' while going backwards in the current world-line.

So, what would happen if they get stuck in this type of gap while going
back in the world-line? If that's what really happened, then this point in
time where such sentences could be read must be…

"Hey, Yoo Joonghyuk! This…!"

When she looked back, she realized that Yoo Joonghyuk too was looking at
'something else'.

Boom, ka-booom-!

The snowfield rumbled.

Someone was pounding on the gap of the world-lines they were stuck in.

⸢"Spit her out! I said, spit her out, now!!"⸥

⸢Kim Dokja was crying.⸥

This situation, could it be…?

⸢I began crazily pounding on the wall.⸥

⸢I was overcome with goosebumps. To think that everything would become
stories. To think, every action we took and every word we spoke would
become scenarios and morph into sentences above the wall.⸥

⸢"Shut up! This is how I feel!"⸥

She couldn't see his face. But, Han Sooyoung could tell just by reading
these sentences. Kim Dokja was responsible for these words – Kim Dokja
was fighting somewhere, within the past of the 3rd turn of the 'Ways of
Survival'.
⸢Kim Dokja wanted to know. What should he do? What should he do to
break this wall down? Could this be the price for reading the 'Ways of
Survival'? Did my own reality become a novel because I read that novel?⸥
When Han Sooyoung read those sentences, she became sure of it.

"This is back then during the [Dark Castle]," said Han Sooyoung.

"…The Dark Castle?"

"This event happened right after Kim Dokja fought against the 'Devourer of
Dreams'. He told me about it some time ago. He got trapped inside his own
skill, and…"

Just before they reached the final scenario, Han Sooyoung got a chance to
talk to Kim Dokja for the entire night. It was to discuss their plan moving
forward, but also to talk about the matters of the past, as well. They thought
that some stuff they didn't manage to resolve could potentially serve as
clues for the future.

– Now that I think about it, something did feel off back then. Someone
called out to me, but… If it weren't for that voice, I might have ended up in
some serious trouble in that place.

"Hey, Kim Dokja!!"

"Han Sooyoung, stop wasting your time. This is nothing more than
recorded history."

The 'gap' must exist as a gap. Only then would the rest exist not as gaps.

However, the fact that sentences could be found in a place like this, didn't
that mean there were still stories they haven't read yet?

Han Sooyoung reached out towards the huge letters again. The pitch-black
particles stained her hand this time as well.
But, they weren't the graphite particles. No, they were very small and really
fine black particles made out of ones and zeroes.

Han Sooyoung gripped the word even harder than before.

If this was the recorded story, then couldn't it be possible to change the
records, somehow?

[A new Story of Incarnation, 'Han Sooyoung', is waking up!]

Tsu-chuchuchuchut!

An incredible shower of sparks exploded and began attacking her whole
body. It was as if every sentence existing in the world was glaring at her.

Yoo Joonghyuk cried out. "You fool… Now isn't the…!"
[Story, 'Revision Specialist', has begun its storytelling!] Tsu-

chuchuchuchut!

"Hey! Wake the hell up!"

When she gripped the sentence, the life contained within it was transmitted
to her. It was Kim Dokja's life. His life, lived for the purpose of writing this
sentence on the [Final Wall].

Han Sooyoung shouted at Kim Dokja currently wrestling against [The
Fourth Wall]. "This is your skill! Don't get swallowed up by your own
skill!"

As if she was trying to revise the recorded sentence, she grabbed onto the
entirety of that sentence and shook it, hard. Maybe she was wrong on this
one. Kim Dokja might be able to get through this danger all by himself, and
her voice might never reach him.

Even then, Han Sooyoung still left behind her own sentence on top of the
[Wall].

Tsu-chuchuchuchut!

Because maybe, just maybe, someone beyond the wall might get to hear
her.

"Han Sooyoung, the regression is starting again!"

"Shut up! Hey, you too! Hurry up and say something!"

Han Sooyoung's and Yoo Joonghyuk's figures began scattering away again
under the bright rays of light. Before completely disappearing, though, the
frowning Yoo Joonghyuk did say something.

"Cancel your skill, Kim Dokja."
Yoo Sangah blinked her eyes in a daze.

Faint rays of light were surrounding her. A monitor in front seemed to sway
unsteadily. It currently displayed the personnel records she was browsing
just now.

"…Ah."

It didn't feel real to her. She blinked again, and felt the sensations picked up
by her weak, frail body. This was the body of an Incarnation, unfettered by
the 'blessings' of the system that also had lost the powers of skills and
Stigmata. These were the sensations of a human being.

She really did come back.

The things she needed to do popped up in her head one by one. First,
confirm the starting point of her regression. Attempt communication with
the other companions through the emergency contact lines. And then…

She suddenly shot up from her seat, causing many gazes to land on her
next. She recalled old, familiar names one by one. Such as, deputy Kim
Min-Woo, the section chief Jang Eun-Yeong, and…

"Hahah, so what do you think about the HR team? Sangah-ssi, do you like
it here?"

The man walking towards her with a bit of an attitude as if to pick a fight
with her – that was the executive director Kang Yeong-Hyeon. And the
person subserviently following after him… the head of the finance
department, Han Myungoh. The latter, cautiously reading the atmosphere
until then, smiled sheepishly in her direction. He was not the 'Han
Myungoh' she grew to know for the past four years. The one she knew
didn't cross over to this regression turn, after all.

"Yoo Sangah-ssi, the sale you made this time was truly commen…"
Without saying a word, she began running. She brushed past the executive
director Kang and rushed into the corridor. Suddenly, her sense of reality
seemed to be blurring.

Did she really, truly succeed in regressing?

The view of the world that used to be so familiar went past her.

She used to come to work here at the fixed time every morning, and went
home at the designated hour, too.

That was the ruleset of this world, and she diligently stuck to it.

"Hey, look here! Yoo Sangah-ssi!"

Her employee ID card was exactly the same, too. There was a time in her
past life when she struggled so hard to have this around her neck. As if this
little thing could act as the proof of her true worth.

When she arrived at the QA team's offices, utterly out of breath, several
employees began recognising her.

"Uh? Yoo Sangah-ssi?"

Her smartphone hidden in the pocket continuously cried out – incoming
messages criticising her sudden, abrupt departure. And then, loud yells
ringing out from behind her.

Yoo Sangah approached a certain partition, one step at a time.

⸢The person she remembered, he was there.⸥

A man wearing a headphone and looking up at her.

The spare battery always being charged in the corner of the partition.

That was where the 'Kim Dokja' she remembered was.

Kim Dokja, before the scenarios went underway.
Without realizing it, she reached out and grasped both of his cheeks.

"Uht…??"

Kim Dokja's eyes were opened really wide. Surrounding people, startled by
her sudden actions, began murmuring to themselves. However, the words
she was currently listening to didn't come from them.

⸢"Yoo Sangah, why are you so cold-hearted? Just like how this 'Kim Dokja'
is Kim Dokja, 'Kim Dokja left behind in that place' is also Kim Dokja, you
know. You are…"⸥

Han Sooyoung's words were filling up the inside of her head.

Why did she respond so coldly back then?

"Dokja-ssi."

She now knew, though. Looking at this Kim Dokja's dumbfounded face,
how could she not?

⸢"Sooyoung-ah. I too have memories that I treasure."⸥

She was not an 'author' like Han Sooyoung, nor was she the 'protagonist'
like Yoo Joonghyuk.

No, she was Yoo Sangah. Yoo Sangah, who was Kim Dokja's colleague
and also his friend.

For no reason whatsoever, tears welled up to obscure her vision, but she
still managed to smile brightly.

⸢She returned here in order to protect this Kim Dokja.⸥

Kim Dokja's lips bobbed up and down. His murky eyes began to gain a
semblance of light little by little as if he had finally recognised her. And
when she witnessed the faint hints of sparks dancing within those eyes, Yoo
Sangah opened her mouth.

"Let's go and find the story you've forgotten about."




Yoo Sangah led Kim Dokja and immediately left the company building.
Just to make sure, she didn't forget to shout at other people too, as they
dashed through the corridors.

"It's not too late now, so please leave the office and try to catch a
grasshopper, at the very least!"

The duo reached the Gwanghwamun Station, and the very first one to arrive
there, Jung Heewon, greeted them. She stood under the undamaged statues
of King Sejong and Lee Sun-Shin, and waved her hand.

"Yoo Sangah-ssi!"

Out of the happiness at this reunion, they energetically hugged each other.
It seemed that the only one to reach here so far was Jung Heewon.

"What's wrong with Dokja-ssi?"

"…The state of his memories doesn't seem to be stable at the moment. He's
experiencing confusion at trying to perceive reality."

She could only guess that this state was due to him being an Avatar.

"What about Joonghyuk-ssi and Sooyoung-ssi?" Yoo Sangah asked.

"I couldn't get a hold of them yet. I don't know about Joonghyuk-ssi, but
Sooyoung-ssi is the type to call everyone before doing anything else, so…"
It was already several hours since they successfully regressed.
Those two might even go as far as to borrow phones to contact the others.
So, the fact that they didn't could only mean that something had possibly
gone wrong somewhere.

"What about the others?"

"Gilyoung-ie is currently in the countryside, while Yoosung-ie and Jihye
said they might be a little late getting here. As for Hyunsung-ssi…"

"Pant! Pant!! Heewon-ssi! Sangah-ssi!"

A huge bear was running towards them from the distance while waving
both of his hands. The bear also happened to be wearing a military uniform,
too.

"Ehng? But, didn't you say you can't come out because you were stuck in
the base?"

"I left without permission, actually."

"…Is it okay to do that?"

"The world is about to be destroyed, so it won't matter anyway."

"There is still some time left until then to say 'about to', you know."

While saying that, Jung Heewon showed everyone her phone's screen
displaying the timetable.

⸢D-28 until the start of the scenario.⸥

Lee Hyunsung formed a serious expression. "…Didn't we aim to regress to
the day before the beginning of the scenarios?"

"This is for the better, I think. We got ourselves more time to prepare, so
we might be able to save more people this way.

Vrrr…
People began showing up in the chat room they agreed to join before
disembarking. Jung Heewon used the translation app to read the incoming
messages.

– China's Fei Hu has arrived safely. Plenty of fine dust, though.

– Ranvir Khan of India, I have arrived no problem. Along with the
nostalgicsmell, too.

– This is Asuka Ren from Japan. I see the familiar ceiling. No problem
here,so far. (`･ω･´)

The past world-line's 100 strongest Incarnations, having successfully
regressed, were now gathering in one place.

The companions looking at each other nodded their heads simultaneously.

"Let's start with the operation."




⸢D-21⸥

– Arrest warrant has been issued for 'Lieutenant Lee', suspected of stealing
alarge cache of firearms from the military base…

– The sudden propagation of 'apocalypse theory' in the internet recently
hascaused some experts to…

⸢D-14⸥

– The 'apocalypse theory', expected to fizzle out as a passing fad, still
showsno signs of abating after two weeks.

– The apocalyptist 'Selena Kim' urges people to prepare supplies for
thesudden upheaval that will happen in two weeks' time…
– Several famous individuals from the world of finance have
sympathisedwith the apocalypse theory, causing the public to criticise…

⸢D-7⸥

– Many ampoules containing microbes earmarked for research have
beenstolen from a prominent pharmaceutical company…

– Recently, the frog egg collection craze has swept across children in
theirteens…

⸢D-1⸥

– Finally, only one day remains until the 'day of the apocalypse'
asprophesied by the apocalyptist 'Selena Kim', and…

⸢D-DAY⸥

Lee Seolhwa looked at the small ampoule gripped in her hand.

– Living insects or their eggs have been put inside the ampoules.

– To save as many people as possible, we even spread the locations of
thehidden emergency ampoules in the internet, too.

– And now, time to pray for some good luck.

⸢4 hours before the apocalypse.⸥

– New Delhi, India. Preparations are complete.

– Beijing, China. Preparations are complete here, as well.

– Washington, USA. We're also ready.

⸢One hour before the apocalypse.⸥
– Seoul, South Korea. Preparations, complete.

⸢Ten minutes before the apocalypse.⸥

– Team Shin Yoosung and Lee Gilyoung. Finished with the deployment
tothe third subway line's location.

Currently at the Apgujeong Station's platform for the third subway line.

While listening to the sounds of subway train rumbling in closer, Shin
Yoosung suddenly opened her mouth. "It's going to work, right?"

"Of course. How many frog eggs do you have on you?"

"102. What about you?"

"524."

Shin Yoosung furrowed her brows and glared at Lee Gilyoung's PET bottle.

"Hey, you! If you hog that many for yourself, what about other people…?!"

"Argh, they are all carrying ampoules with them, so it'll be fine. If I'm to
become stronger than that sooty bastard, I gotta start really rich this time
around! With this, I…!"

It was right then, someone snatched the PET bottle off Lee Gilyoung's
hands. The boy jumped in shock and quickly looked back to spot a familiar
man standing there.

"It's you, sooty bastard!"

"Joonghyuk ahjussi? When did you arrive?!"

"Just now. A problem occurred with the Stigma and that delayed us."

Yoo Joonghyuk panted heavily and wiped the sweat off his forehead while
tucking the PET bottle inside his jacket.
"What about Kim Dokja?" He asked.

"Seolhwa eonni is with him because of his poor condition. Maybe because
the scenario hasn't started yet, he was fine for a little while but he's
unconscious again."

"And the preparations for the operation?"

"It's all finished."

Rather than starting a lengthy explanation, Shin Yoosung simply handed a
spare smartphone to Yoo Joonghyuk, instead.

In the meantime, Lee Gilyoung grumbling away pulled out yet another PET
bottle. "Hmph. I knew you'd steal mine, so I prepared another one earlier!"

⸢6:55 PM⸥

Another subway was approaching them from the distance. All three of them
climbed aboard the train. This subway of the third line smelled exactly the
same as before. A peaceful sight of not one person worrying about the
impending apocalypse unfolded before their eyes.

While looking at the darkness of the tunnel streaming by them, Lee
Gilyoung abruptly muttered to himself. "…By the way, will the scenarios
really start?"

With a slightly unsure expression, he sneaked a glance in Yoo Joonghyuk's
direction. During the past 28 days, the boy had been preparing for the
apocalypse harder than anyone else. Somewhat ironically, though, he was
now worried about the apocalypse not happening at all.

Yoo Joonghyuk addressed the fretting boy. "It'll begin. It did so for the past
1864 times, after all."

Those were the words coming from the man who waited for the apocalypse
for a very long time. He didn't say anything else and quietly peered at his
watch.
Three minutes. Two minutes. One minute. And finally…

⸢7:00 PM⸥

Along with the loud screech, the subway came to a sudden and immediate
stop. The commuters all screamed in panic as a sudden bout of darkness
visited them. And within this scene of utter pandemonium, only three
people were carrying relieved expressions.

As if to illuminate this pitch-black darkness, Yoo Joonghyuk's voice
resounded out.

"The operation, <Capture the Squid>, will now commence."
        Chapter 531: Epilogue 2 - Not found anywhere, VI


⸢Once more, one hour before the apocalypse.⸥

"…Dammit, where the hell am I?"

Han Sooyoung held her spinning head and hurriedly scanned her
surroundings. The last thing she saw was the figure of Yoo Joonghyuk
disappearing within the shower of light. She quickly took a look at her own
body.

It was a success.

Her much thinner arms, and muscles that lost their suppleness.

She couldn't sense any of the Stories she had compiled, the skills she
trained in, nor even her Stigma.

However, that wasn't a problem. They had already thought up of what to do
with such issues, when the scenario got underway again. No, the real issue
was…
"Crap, I don't have much time left."

Her smartphone's battery was almost out of juice, and she couldn't confirm
the wellbeings of her companions at the moment. It was a fortune among
misfortunes that she somehow managed to download the locations of her
companions from the chat room just now.

"…These guys, they did pretty well without me."

Just a casual browse-through was enough for her to get a bead on where
they were currently with their operation. That wasn't too surprising, though,
considering that she was the one in charge of the operation in the first place.

But then, Han Sooyoung's eyes scanning the map of the deployed locations
began trembling.

"This idiot…"

She raised her head and looked around her.

Although it could be tight, there seemed to be enough time left still.




⸢30 minutes before the apocalypse.⸥

Lee Jihye's eyes dazedly staring at the clock was suddenly blocked by a
head full of black hair.

"Hey, crybaby. You planning to stay behind for the night classes today?"

"N-no. Uh… ng."

It had already been 28 days since the regression, but she still hadn't gotten
used to that nickname.

'Crybaby'.
When was the last time she heard someone call her that?

Once upon a time, she had other nicknames like that. And she had truly
returned to such a time.

"Really? I was just asking, but why so suddenly?"

The other girl's eyes arched as if she was smiling.

For every single day during the past four years, Lee Jihye had never
forgotten those eyes. They belonged to a pale-skinned girl somewhat
smaller than her. The blouse of her school uniform was missing a button.
Her wornout name tag, where her name could still be found.

⸢When she opens her eyes, the bloodshot irises would be staring right back
her.⸥
Lee Jihye's trembling right hand was clutching onto the pant leg of her gym
uniform.

⸢"Jihye-yah, it'll be alright."⸥

Lee Jihye desperately grabbed her trembling hand.

⸢"You must live."⸥

"Lee Jihye?"

Her friend's hand approached from the air. Lee Jihye avoided that hand
almost as if she was having a seizure.

"…Ah, sorry. Were you saying something?" She hurriedly asked.

"Are you feeling okay?"

"Yeah, I'm fine."

"You want to bounce together around seven?"
"We must not!!"

Lee Jihye shot up from her seat and shouted out even before she realized it.
Her classmates sitting near her all looked in her direction immediately. She
sat back down and spoke again. "We'll be high school seniors in a little
while, right? So we gotta study hard for that."

"…Crybaby, you sure you're not sick somewhere?"

⸢20 minutes before the apocalypse.⸥

The bell denoting the start of the first night class period went off. Lee Jihye
pulled something out from her inner pocket, a small box covered in a
crinkled wrapper.

"Bo-Ri-yah. Here."

"What is it?"

Her friend saw the box and extended her hand. However, before handing
over the item, Lee Jihye told her friend in no uncertain terms first.

"You mustn't open it right now. Okay? Only open it when it's ten minutes
before seven. Understand?"

"You didn't, like, put insects in this thing, right? You know I've got a weak
heart, don't you?"

Lee Jihye momentarily froze at those words. "…No, don't worry. I will
definitely make sure you won't die."

She finished what she wanted to say and stood up abruptly from her seat.
Then, she pulled out a longsword stashed behind the classroom locker. Her
surprised friend was still looking in her direction.

"…Where are you going?" Her friend asked.

"Bathroom."
Lee Jihye immediately left the classroom. With good timing, the teacher in
charge was walking towards her.

"Lee Jihye? What are you doing? Go back inside the class! Night classes
have begun already! And what are you carrying on your ba-"

"Teacher-nim, are you on duty today?"

It was the ethics teacher wearing the horn-rimmed glasses, with a slender
physique and somewhat haggard eyes.

"Teacher-nim, please don't forget to open the no.2 locker in the staff room
later!"

Lee Jihye slipped past the teacher, but the latter hurriedly reached out to her
shoulder.

"What? Where are you… Urgh? Why is she so strong… Hey! Lee Jihye!!"

Lee Jihye broke into a sprint. She ran down the stairs in an instant, entered
the teacher's staff room and stole the keys to the broadcast studio. She then
ran up to the third floor, her heart threatening to explode along the way.

⸢The first scenario of the 'Taepung Girls' High' location began several
minutes earlier than other locations.⸥
That was the reason why Lee Jihye had been deployed in this very location.

While panting breathlessly, she managed to unlock the door to find the
rather familiar sight of the studio. The Taepung Girls' High boasted pretty
high-end broadcasting equipment. Not only that, the school was given the
authority to make broadcasts to the surrounding regions in case of
emergency, as well.

While listening to the voice of the teacher still looking for her coming from
downstairs, Lee Jihye pulled out the emergency power source prepared
earlier. She then calmly set up the broadcasting equipment.
As she connected the wiring, some memories in her mind also began to get
connected, as well.

She used to work here as a crew member, and during the lunch hour, she'd
play the music she liked. That was her life.

⸢At least, until the apocalypse came knocking.⸥

She realized it once more while looking at her still-alive friends. The only
person to survive in the classroom on that fateful day was her and her alone.

"…Lee Jihye."

She was startled by the voice and looked back, only to find an unexpected
person there.

"Sooyoung eonni?"

She must've been waiting for a while. Han Sooyoung raised her body up
from the darkness and quietly studied Lee Jihye's face, before speaking up.
"You don't look so good."

"I'm fine." Lee Jihye stayed silent for a little while, then spoke again. "The
scenario. It's going to start, right? Otherwise, I might get suspended later,
you know."

"It'll start. By the way, you don't really have start yours from here. You
should hurry up and go to another location. Let me take care of this place
for you."

"No. This is where I need to start." Lee Jihye smiled. "Because this is
where the 'wounded sword demon' was born, after all." She then slowly
sucked in her breath.

The setting-up of the equipment was finally finished.

⸢Ten minutes before the apocalypse.⸥
And then, 'it' began.

Along with the 'Ku-gugugu' noise, the sensation of the world's 'nature'
changing could be felt. Then, the sounds akin to drums being ripped apart
came from an unknown location. And what came after that was…

[Oh, my. The channel here opened up sooner than scheduled. Ah, ah, can
you hear me?]

Lee Jihye looked at Han Sooyoung. The moment she saw the latter's face,
she knew. Somewhat humorously, they had been living only for this
moment.

[There is no need to panic, everyone. Let me say this first of all. This
situation, it's not a film shoot. It's not a terror incident, nor are you currently
dreaming. No, everyone, you're-]

That was the voice of the Dokkaebi she hated the most.

Screams resounded out from every classroom.

[Main Scenario #1 – Proof of Worth has begun.]

That was the signal to commence with their planned operation.

– Emergency broadcast will now begin.

Lee Jihye's own voice was coming out from the speakers.

– Everyone, please listen to me. Those inside the classrooms, please open
upthe cabinet for the cleaning tools, while those in the staff room, please
open the no.2 locker! Hurry!

Lee Jihye knew. Her companions must be making the exact same face as
hers about now. Everyone should be witnessing this sight through the
display panel the Dokkaebi had brought up.
 –         There is no need for you to kill each other. At least this time,
 there is noneed.

Lee Jihye thought about her companions. She recalled the promises made to
them before coming to this world.

⸢"…At least I want to choose what I kill."⸥

Shin Yoosung wouldn't start by killing a puppy anymore, and…

⸢"I'll save my aunt."⸥

Lee Gilyoung would get to save the person he detested.

⸢"Rather than going to the army again, I'll kill myself first."⸥

Lee Hyunsung would leave the army, and…

⸢"I really want to save that grandma from back then."⸥

Yoo Sangah would get to save the person she didn't.

⸢"The Probability will only allow for one opportunity. Meaning, the 'Group
Regression' can't be used twice.⸥
And Yoo Joonghyuk would never regress again.

Finally…

⸢"During this turn, I won't become the 'wounded sword demon'."⸥

As the clamour of the school's interior gradually died down, Lee Jihye
opened her mouth once more.

– Everyone, have you all found one for yourselves?
Just like Kim Dokja of the past chucking the grasshoppers to other

people… – Everyone, throw those things down to the floor with everything

you got!

Along with those words, Lee Jihye broke the ampoule held tight in her
hand. [You have slaughtered a total of 133 lifeforms.]

[Slaughter breakdown: 133 frog eggs]

[Acquired coins will be halved as you have slaughtered lifeforms lacking
defensive capability.]

[Total of 6650 Coins have been acquired.]

…

…

…

[Main Scenario #1 – Proof of Worth has concluded.]

⸢Once more, they shall create a story not found anywhere.⸥

The Dokkaebi in charge belatedly discovered the unfolding situation and
appeared before Lee Jihye.

[What the… Look here, you! What's the meaning of this? How can you
even…!]

And right next second, a powerful storm of Probability's aftermath began
slamming into the entirety of the scenario. Also, the noises of massive
amounts of Coins being sucked out came from an unknown direction, too.

Lee Jihye realized what was happening here.

Tsu-chuchuchuchut!
[Dear Constellation-nims!! This is a misunderstanding! Director… No,
wait! This isn't my fau… The Bureau's inventory… Uwaaaah!]

Accompanied by the noises of the channel being disbanded, the low-grade
Dokkaebi screamed and disappeared.

⸢7:00 PM⸥

And that was the beginning.

The night skies of Seoul were reflected on the windows of the studio.

She saw the rift opening up on the other side of the sky.

⸢Subway's third line.⸥

"Everyone, please stay calm! Grab one of these, and throw it down! Hurry!"

⸢Gwanghwamun.⸥

"Do not panic, and break the bottles you just received on the floor! Do that
and you will survive!"

⸢The hospital.⸥

"Anyone who didn't get an ampoule yet??"

Throughout all the locations in Seoul, unexpected events were taking place
at the same time.

The prearranged scenario was changing.

[Unbelievable achievements are occurring simultaneously in every location
of the scenario!]

[A massive amount of Coins are being taken out from the Bureau!]

The whole of <Star Stream> was shivering from the explosion of Coins.
[<Star Stream> is stunned by the sudden upheaval of the scenario!]

[Dokkaebis of the Bureau are freaking out at the excessive amount of Coins
being taken out, and…!]

[Many Constellations observing the Korean Peninsula are…!]

The baptism of Coins exploding in the air like fireworks – it was the sight
of a world coming to an end. Lee Jihye looked to her side and found Han
Sooyoung also looking up at the same skies as her.

As if, she was searching for those who should be looking at them from the
night sky.

"Let's go and save ahjussi."

Their operation had just got underway.




While gasping out rough, heavy breaths, I regained my consciousness.

⸢It was unknown how much time had passed by.⸥

I slowly tried to move my body. Arms, legs, shoulders… without a doubt,
the feedback I got had changed a lot from before.

⸢Kim Dok ja y o u got a lot sm all er⸥

I smiled bitterly and looked down at my shrunken hand. The digits of my
fingers had shortened by at least one centimeter compared to the last time I
saw them. With a slightly exhausted voice, I asked a question. "…How
many regression turns have I seen so far?"

⸢7 8 6th tu rn⸥
I had no idea that reading something with every fibre of your being would
be this difficult.

Every time Yoo Joonghyuk and his companions lived through one
regression turn, I too had to live through it.

The second turn, the third, the fourth, and the fifth…

⸢Th at is th e des ti ny of th e Oldest Dream⸥

I read, and then read again, the Stories created by the countless choices, and
I watched various world-lines spun off from them over and over again.

⸢Kim Dokja read the world as if he was walking along a distant beach.⸥

Story's waves rolled in and rolled out. And I gradually lost something of
mine every time that happened. When I recalled something abruptly and
looked back, I saw my own footprints left behind. Those prints were soon
washed away by the incoming waves, and after staring at the disappearing
traces, I'd resume my walk forward.

Whenever I recalled the fact that I was gradually forgetting things within
this flood of Stories, I began thinking about the regression turn I lived in.
And then, the happiness of the people who should still be living there.

If I did…

"…Uh?"

The tips of my hands were trembling.

I suddenly couldn't remember the regression turn number I lived in. I
unknowingly looked behind me, but the only things remaining there were
Yoo Joonghyuk's past regression turns.

⸢And what remains at the end, will be the desire to see the 'next story'.⸥

I looked down at my hands, now much smaller.
What was waiting for me at the end of this long, long journey?
⸢Kim Dokja recalled the 'Oldest Dream' he saw during the Final Scenario.⸥

Would I eventually become the 'Oldest Dream' I saw back then?

Would I lose all of my memories and become a giant mass of
unconsciousness that dreamt of an infinite universe?

⸢He didn't want to end up like that.⸥

I needed to think. I needed to remember.

When I came to, my hand was clutching onto my smartphone out of an old
habit. This small world protected me whenever I became too anxious and
too nervous.

The black screen, its battery having lost its charge a long time ago, reflected
my face.
I crafted a simple Story and used it to operate the phone. That prompted a
familiar wallpaper to pop up. And that's where the novel that started all of
this was.

– Three Ways to Survive in a Ruined World (final version).txt

Until now, I deliberately avoided reading this final version.

I was scared that, if I read it, something somewhere would become set in
stone. I didn't want the future my companions were supposed to live in to
be decided by a story written by someone else.

⸢However, shouldn't it be okay now?⸥

The <Kim Dokja's Company>'s story had ended, and my ■■ had been
decided, as well.

⸢If I read this, wouldn't I be able to remember all those that I've forgotten?⸥

I still didn't know who tls123 was.

And that's why I was curious.

What did the author write on this 'final version'?

What was the conclusion the author came up with?

And this story, where and how was it supposed to end?

I slowly sucked in my breaths and extended my shrunken finger towards the
text file.

Just like that day when I first began reading the 'Ways of Survival'.

⸢And so, that's how Kim Dokja's last reading session began.⸥
            Chapter 532: Epilogue 3 - Author's words, I


My thumb slowly extended and touched the cold screen.

Right at that moment, something like a spark danced just above the display.

[A new file has been downloaded.]

– Three Ways to Survive in a Ruined World (final revised version).txt

In that short time period, the name of the file had changed.

… The 'final revised version'?

I clicked on the file almost subconsciously.

But, why was this? The file had been scrolled almost all the way down to
its bottom-most section from the get-go. It felt as if the edits had been
finished only a few moments ago. Without thinking too much about it, I
scrolled down even further.
Did the 'epilogue' of the 'Ways of Survival' get added at the end, the one I
didn't get to read?

The file continued on from the point where the original novel came to an
end. It was a story that I hadn't seen before.

I unconsciously began reading it out loud.

Epilogue 3. Author's words

Each regression turn would reach their conclusion in their own terms.

It was the same story for the 1863rd turn.

[You have cleared all the scenarios of <Star Stream>.]

She did it. Countless sentences brushed past her head the moment she saw
that message.

The 'Dokkaebi King' was collapsed on the ground before her eyes, and the
companions from the 1863rd turn she had led were all here, too.

"Captain! We won!!"

Kim Namwoon was sobbing away nonstop. Only after spotting Lee
Hyunsung walking in closer to support her did it feel real to her, that she
had finally done it.

⸢This was the end of the 1863rd turn.⸥

What a long battle it had been.

From when she of the 3rd turn was suddenly summoned to the 1863rd, all
the way to greeting the suitable end of this world.

She nearly gave up several times in the middle, though. Even then, the
reason why she didn't was because of what 'that idiot' said back then.
⸢"Going to the next scenario is better than sleeping forever."⸥

That idiot, who also came from the same 3rd turn as her.

The man who wore the same coat and used the same weapon as her.

⸢"The Apocalypse Dragon being freed doesn't mean everything's over. You
know it too, don't you?"⸥
That idiot who ruined her plan, freed the Apocalypse Dragon, and
eventually, managed to even eject Yoo Joonghyuk from the scenario, too.

Even now, she could vividly recall the scenes from those moments by
closing her eyes. The scene of a 'Character' breaking past his story and
gaining his freedom…

"Captain, we did it. We really did it!"

Lee Hyunsung could barely hide his joy. Han Sooyoung killed the lit
cigarette in her hand and addressed him. "Support everyone and return to
base."

"What about you, cap…?"

"I'll be right behind you after smoking one more. So, go on ahead."

"…We can't do that!"

…This slow dude, why was he so quick on the uptake now?

Han Sooyoung glanced at the Archangel standing next to Lee Hyunsung.
"Jophiel."

The Commander of the Red Cosmos, Jophiel, the Archangel that crossed to
this world-line together with that idiot from the 3rd turn.

[Let's go, meat shield.]
"No, hang on a minute, captain!"

While lighting up her very last cigarette, Han Sooyoung watched on as the
Archangel took her companions back to Earth. The companions from the
'Ways of Survival' were getting further away. She saw how they kept
shedding tears of satisfaction derived from successfully clearing all the
scenarios and could only smile wryly.

Jophiel, her wings spread out wide, glanced in Han Sooyoung's direction as
she grew further away.

– Are you planning to go alone?

Instead of a reply, Han Sooyoung waved around her cigarette light.

And then, after all of her companions had disappeared, she slowly looked
behind her.

⸢The Final Wall.⸥

The wall that blocked the end of this world-line, and also, recording
everything found within this universe.

Han Sooyoung was aware of this wall's existence, and not only that, she
knew how to open it, too. She got to take a peek at a few scenes while
connected to the 3rd turn's Han Sooyoung, and more importantly,
information she got from Kim Dokja paying a visit to this world-line
proved to be the crucial key, as well.

[The 'Wall that Decides Samsara' has discovered its intended position.]

Han Sooyoung began slotting in the [Walls] she had gathered ahead of time
into their spots.

[The 'Wall that Divides the Good and Evil' has discovered its intended
position.]
[The 'Wall of Impossible Communication' has discovered its intended
position.]
However, she was still short of one fragment.

Throughout the entirety of the universe, only one guy possessed this
fragment – [The Fourth Wall].

Han Sooyoung silently stared at her own hand, before slowly placing it
against the last open spot on the wall.
[Story, 'Predictive Plagiarism', has begun its storytelling.]

She certainly didn't possess that [Wall].

Even then, shouldn't she be able to craft a fragment similar to that,
somehow?

[Story, 'Ultimate Lie' has begun its storytelling!]

Han Sooyoung began squeezing out every Story she could imagine.

She had witnessed the actual form of [The Fourth Wall], just once. She
definitely saw a portion of that wall when it blocked her attempt at using
the [Eye of Truth].

[Story, 'Predictive Plagiarism', is being pushed to its absolute limit!]

Her fingers moved rapidly and began writing a Story – a Story of the wall
that she came up with. The one single story that might be the basis of this
wall.

Tsu-chuchuchuchut…!

⸢"I'm Dokja."⸥

⸢Kim Dokja(金獨子). My father wanted me to become a strong man even if
I was left alone so he gave me such a name.⸥
Right next moment, Han Sooyoung's hand submerged into the wall.

Next up was her arm, shoulder, head, and her torso… And eventually, her
entire figure sank into the wall.

[The 'Final Wall's system' is surprised by your Story information and…]

[Temporary error has occurred in the system!]
Han Sooyoung fought back against the rising vomit and felt around the
ground.

She did it.

She managed to infiltrate inside this stinking wall unscathed.

The first thing she saw after raising her head was a small room. There were
quite a few bundles of packed luggage, and several small display panels
decorating this place.

She was familiar with the Story coming out from those panels.

⸢Constellation, 'Demon King of Salvation', has reached his ■■.⸥

⸢'Demon King of Salvation's' ■■ is 'Eternity'.⸥

That was the conclusion of the 3rd turn. That idiot had also cleared the
scenario of his world-line to its very last, in other words. And at long last,
he had decided to become this world's sole reader.

⸢In the world without the scenarios – filled with only the desire to see the
next story… A certain child, possessing a truly horrifying power of
imagination.⸥

He'd continue to become smaller, and eventually become this world's
subconsciousness. And with that, he'd continue on with this neverending
story.

The 1863rd turn's Han Sooyoung could tell. If you ask her how she knew,
well, she just did.

'Even I would've chosen that conclusion, after all'.

This world existed for the story.
Even Yoo Joonghyuk's story, even Kim Dokja's – in the end, they were all
simply 'stories' marching forward towards the one true completion.

Han Sooyoung stared at the subway train travelling further and further
away inside the screen. For a long while, she wordlessly stared at this
universe's god journeying towards the world that no one would ever
remember.

And then, a few steps in front of her, there was a certain existence staring at
the same screen while dabbing away its tears with a handkerchief.

[Hiii-eeek?!]

"So, then. You are the true 'Dokkaebi King' aren't you?"

[…How did you manage to enter this place?]

The Dokkaebi King her group definitely killed outside was standing
completely fine before her eyes.

Han Sooyoung unsheathed the [Black Heavenly Demon Sword] and asked.
"I was wondering why you were so weak. Okay, so. Why didn't you fight
us seriously? And what exactly have you been doing in here?"

[Uh-uh. Hang on a second. The scenarios are already over. I don't have any
thoughts of fighting you.]

It was true, she couldn't sense any fighting intentions from the Dokkaebi
King as it hurriedly waved both of its hands.

Its eyes gleamed as it observed the sparks faintly dancing around Han
Sooyoung's entire figure. Its irises were fixed on the [Final Wall] suffering
from error.

[You repaired the 'Final Wall'…? What a shocking talent that is… Just who
are you? Your soul is… it's like the amalgamation of various talents.]
"What were you planning by using such a puppet? Are you looking down
on this world-line?"

[Hu-hut, what do you mean, looking down? Every world-line is precious.
It's just that… This world-line has lost its meaning now. Its most important
Story had come to an end just now, after all.]

While saying that, the Dokkaebi King shifted his gaze back to the panels.

Han Sooyoung quietly roused up her Stories, but the King simply snickered
back at her. [What are you getting so angry for? Regardless of what, the
story of you and your group has concluded safely, didn't it?]

"Don't ever mess with this world-line's conclusion."

The moment she said that, the scenes from the 1863rd turn popped up on
the panels.

Lee Hyunsung and Kim Namwoon were supporting each other. The backs
of her companions were captured in a wide-screen shot.

[Ah, of course, I won't. It's not even an important world-line, anyway…]

Han Sooyoung saw how the Dokkaebi King shrugged its shoulders in total
disinterest, and felt this powerful sense of futility.

Was this how the story of this regression turn ends?

Was it really okay to end it in this fashion?

[And besides… the new 'Oldest Dream' would not wish to see such a thing
happen, anyway.]

After hearing that, Han Sooyoung looked up at the empty air above without
even realizing it.

The 'Oldest Dream'.

The 'Kim Dokja' she knew had become one such existence.
Which meant that the current him might be looking at this spectacle,
somehow.

[You think he will reply to you because you looked up like that? Your
world has people who believe in their chosen deities. But, did those gods
ever respond each and every time their believers called out to them?]

"This and that aren't the same."

"Well… You can think of it any way you want. Anyways, this one would
like to 'abscond' from here, so can I leave now?]

"Where are you planning to go?"

[Since this world-line's story has ended, I should go to another place, don't
you agree? I've been working hard all this time, so… Well, there's this place
I really wanted to visit since from a while ago, and…]

"Oh, so you wish to run away all the while abandoning the scenario, just
like that?"

[Why didn't you get born in a world-line with an honest, hard-working
Dokkaebi King, then?]

Han Sooyoung frowned deeply and emitted waves of energy once more.
"Hey. I clawed and fought my way to get here… So, shouldn't you give me
some kind of a clear reward or something?"

The 'Dokkaebi King' spat out a long sigh. [Well, fine. Granting one wish
shouldn't be so hard.]

"…I want to meet that idiot."

Almost immediately after saying it, Han Sooyoung couldn't believe what
she had done. Why did she blurt that out, of all things?

⸢"Because you are also there."⸥
⸢"I believe in 'you' of the 3rd turn."⸥

She wasn't sure what this frustration in her heart meant.

Just that, meeting that guy again might help her understand what she felt so
frustrated about, or so she thought.

The Dokkaebi King tilted his head. [When you say that idiot, you…]

Han Sooyoung pointed to the panels with her chin.

The Dokkaebi King jumped up in shock and roared out. [Are you freaking
blind or something?? That great one is no longer an existence the likes of
me can ever meet.]

"I don't care if it's a version of him from another world-line. I also don't
care even if he's a version who hasn't seen the end yet, too."

Kim Dokja couldn't be seen anymore within the panels.

"I want to meet that idiot one more time."

[There is only one of him in this universe.]

Since the Dokkaebi King was being so adamant, it could only mean that her
wish was truly impossible.

But then, the creature stared at the downhearted Han Sooyoung and opened
its mouth with a sly look on its face. […Well, actually. There is a way to
make your wish come true.]

"What was that?"

[Now normally, that world-line is forbidden from entry, but I've memorised
its coordinates while the new 'Oldest Dream' was ascending to his
position… However, the 'Oldest Dream' in that place will not recognise
you.]

Han Sooyoung's expression brightened as she asked. "Where is that place?"
[It's the place I wanted to visit originally. I've always longed to go there at
least once when this universe's great epic came to its conclusion.]

While saying that, the Dokkaebi King raised both of its hands up high in the
air. The aloof universe of <Star Stream> was unfolding up there.

The Dokkaebi King looked up at that view with a solemn expression and
addressed her. [Aren't you curious? Where did this universe start from, who
crafted these intricate galaxies of Stories, who created this thing called
'scenario' in this world – just who is responsible for perfecting the world of
pure contradictions where the result gives birth to the cause, and the cause
becomes the result??]

Han Sooyoung finally figured out the Dokkaebi King's true aim.

This guy, it was trying to head towards the world-line where this universe
actually began.

⸢The world where the 'Three Ways to Survive in a Ruined World' began.⸥

"You…!"

⸢The universe where tls123 was.⸥

[I'm going there to meet my god. If you want, I'll let you tag along on my
journey!]

Tsu-chuchuchchut!

Along with the deafening roar, the storm of Probability's aftermaths
powerfully rampaged between her and the Dokkaebi King. As she got
sucked into this wall of pain akin to her soul being ripped into tiny shreds,
she briefly caught the Dokkaebi King's grin.

[Let's meet again after making through this alive, shall we?]
That was the last memory Han Sooyoung could remember of the 1863rd
turn.




"Heok!"

She shot up from her bed; the time was two in the morning. Her entire back
was soaked in sweat. The second hand of the clock continued tick by.

…Was it all a dream?

Han Sooyoung ungainly got up. The sensation of soft, luxurious duvet
wrapped around her limbs – for some reason, this bed felt alien to her. She
drank the water located on the bedside bureau, entered the adjoining
bathroom and switched on the light. The orange lightbulb illuminated the
darkness and her figure was reflected on the mirror.

Her neatly-trimmed hair that had grown all the way down to her shoulders.
The beauty spot that seemed to get even more pronounced when she
narrowed her eyes – this was undoubtedly her own face. Indeed, it really
was, yet…

"…What the hell??"

Suddenly, it felt as if her heart was tightening up.

[You have entered the 'First World-line'.]

She dashed outside the bathroom. Plastic figurines were displayed on the
dressing table alongside the volumes of manga. She also spotted the
familiar school bag next to the bed. Eventually, the darkness within this
house no longer felt foreign to her. Her trembling hands opened the school
bag, only for the textbooks within to tumble out. Neatly-written words
could be seen on the cover of one of those books.
– Han Sooyoung, student no.2, classroom 2, sixth year.

Han Sooyoung had become a 13-year-old girl.
            Chapter 533: Epilogue 3 - Author's words, II


She had suddenly become a sixth-year elementary school kid. How come?

For the remainder of dawn, Han Sooyoung stewed in her stupefaction.
Initially, she wondered if she had regressed like Yoo Joonghyuk.

[Self-regulated activity period has concluded.]

[Next self-regulated activity period is scheduled to take place in around 14
hours.]

[The body's control has been rescinded.]

However, she got to figure out what happened to her after those messages
floated up and she lost control of her own body.

[You can exercise the control only when the main body's ego has entered
the sleep mode.]

She had taken possession of her own younger self.
'…Could this be a new type of scenario?'

No matter how long she waited, though, stuff like scenario messages never
popped up.

She 'watched' her younger self wake up with a dishevelled face, wash up,
eat breakfast, and head off to school. She couldn't do anything else besides
that.

And exactly 14 hours later, the following messages popped up.

[The main body's ego has fallen asleep.] [Self-

regulated activity will now begin.]

[Control of the body has been handed over to you.]

She'd stay as a dumb little 13-year-old kid during the daytime, while during
the night, her body's control would revert to her like clockwork. And then,
she'd start crying out in lamentation like this next.

"…What the hell am I supposed to do here?"

Her head was in a mess. If this was really the 'First World-line', her actions
of now could influence the rest of the world-lines yet to be born in the
future.

After sucking in deep breaths, she decided to first check out the situation
she was in.

Expensive but simple furniture filled this three-bedroom-plus-living-room
house. Han Sooyoung was quite familiar with it.

The housekeeper that came to work early every morning, the lazy guard
that monitored all visitors, and her parents that came to visit her on the
weekends in alternating turns while being driven on new cars every time.

Her father was a National Assembly member, while mother was an actress.
Han Sooyoung never thought of them as her family, though.

The world didn't know of her existence. And her so-called parents, they
probably didn't want her existence to be revealed to the world, either.

"…It's really the same."

Han Sooyoung browsed through the pile of books on top of the desk
belonging to her 13-year-old self. Some were books she really liked, while
some, she couldn't even recognise. The faint, blurry memories must be held
in possession by her other self. In any case, it was crystal clear that she had
read them all judging by the hand stains left on the books.

⸢To each and everyone, a life that's only theirs exists.⸥

She saw a line drawn under some throwaway quote and felt a chill creep
down her skin. Such unimpressive sentences piled up and would eventually
go on to become the human Han Sooyoung. Probably.

It was then that he heard a sound of doorbell going off.

…At this late hour?

She hurriedly pressed the intercom button to confirm. At first, she
wondered if it was the guard, but when she took a closer look at the
intercom screen, he had been already knocked out cold. And a middle-aged
man wearing a fedora was smiling in her direction and waving his hand.

– It's me, Dokkaebi King.




"Why do you look like that?"
"When I arrived here, I suddenly morphed into a human being. I'm almost
fully stripped of my system authority, too… But, why have you become so
much younger?"

"You made me like this, didn't you?"

"I certainly did not. The influence of the great Probability has… Actually,
forgive me for this intrusion."

Han Sooyoung groaned and guided the Dokkaebi King inside the house.

"Do you live alone?" It asked her.

"I do."

"You seem to have some spare rooms."

"…I'm telling you this now, don't expect me to put you up in here."

The Dokkaebi King pouted in disappointment from that.

Han Sooyoung boiled a simple teabag and brought it out, then asked her
guest. "Okay. What is your reason for bringing me to this world-line?"

"We shall go and search for the 'creator' together."

"How?"

"That's something we should think about from here on."

"You came here without any preparations or knowing anything?"

"Of course not. I do have my suspicions. For instance, that novel."

Han Sooyoung's expression hardened. As expected, it seemed that the
Dokkaebi King had been aware of the existence of 'Ways of Survival'.

"The author of that novel is probably the 'god' that constructed
this universe," said the Dokkaebi King. tls123.
The author who wrote 'Three Ways to Survive in a Ruined World'.

Han Sooyoung sighed softly, and fetched her notebook PC. "I've already
tried to search for it, though."

– There are no matching results.

"That novel, it hasn't been uploaded yet."

"…Hmm. Maybe something had gone wrong somewhere?"

"No, it's more like we came here too early. I'm pretty sure that the
serialisation will start this year."

"How do you know that?"

"If what I heard is right, the first time Kim Dokja read this novel was when
he was 15. I'm 13 right now, so he must be 15."

She recalled a certain crumpled memo pad Kim Dokja gave to her in the
past. He must've been in a rush, but he still managed to write down all sorts
of information on that little thing.

"That great one is 15 years old, is it… Something's rather cute…"

"I'm more curious about something else, though."

"Such as?"

"What will happen if the 'Ways of Survival' doesn't appear in this world?"

"Excuse me?" The Dokkaebi King stumbled a little from her question
before speaking up. "Hmm… If that happens, then the great one won't get
to read the novel."

"Since he won't get to read it, that naturally means the 'Ways of Survival'
won't become reality either, right?"
"…That might be plausible. At the very least, the 'apocalypse' might not get
triggered for the world-lines about to be branched off from here."

In that case, if they could prevent Kim Dokja from reading the 'Ways of
Survival', then that meant they could potentially stop the apocalypse of this
world-line, too.

"I think I get the general gist of your idea. Are you trying to stop the
serialisation of the 'Ways of Survival'?" The Dokkaebi King asked.

"That's right."

Han Sooyoung nodded her head. As long as this tls123 was not a
supernatural existence, she might be able to prevent the destruction of this
world with her powers alone.

But then, the Dokkaebi King tackled her down verbally. "Yours is indeed
an intriguing idea. However, you don't even know who the author is…"

"Have you ever read that novel before?"

"No, I haven't. Have you?"

"Yeah." Han Sooyoung pondered something for a little bit before
continuing on. "That novel, it's really badly written."

"…"

"From the very beginning, it's filled with way too much exposition, while
the chapter lengths are all over the place, and the work doesn't even try to
accommodate its potential readers. Only Kim Dokja alone managed to read
it from start to finish."

"Hoh. As expected of the great…"

"You think such a thing even makes sense?"
The Dokkaebi King narrowed its eyes as if to ask, what are you talking
about.

Han Sooyoung continued on. "An author who doesn't read his own novel?
Someone like that doesn't exist. And because of the unique traits of a
webnovel platform, you can never perfectly fix anything, so you don't have
a choice but to re-read your uploaded chapters several times even if to
check for typos and stuff. But then… past the 100th chapter, the view count
became just 'one' for the remainder of that novel."

Only then did the Dokkaebi King's eyes widened, as if it finally understood
what she was saying. "Could it be…?"

"It is. The author of the 'Ways of Survival' that I think is none other than
that idiot. I don't know why he's denying being the author even after writing
it himself, but I'm sure about this."

One of her old habits was to leave a blank Korean word processor page
displayed on her notebook. While looking at the blinking cursor, she spoke
up. "We need to find Kim Dokja. Before he starts that damn 'Ways of
Survival'."




The problem was with how to find that 'Kim Dokja'.

"Do you know where he lives? I no longer have the power of the system, so
we need to personally locate him," said the Dokkaebi King.

"I'm sure he's somewhere around Seoul."

"…Don't you know any other distinguishing traits of his?"

"He's probably hiding somewhere, busy reading fantasy novels or
something…"
"How are we even supposed to find him with such information??"

"Argh, I don't know. It's your job to come up with something. I'm only an
elementary school kid, you know."

After saying that, Han Sooyoung blacked out immediately. When she came
to, the Dokkaebi King must've gone somewhere, as it was nowhere to be
found.

"…This was why I always dozed off back in school."

She always wondered why she felt so sleepy whenever she got to school…
As it turned, her condition was due to another ego waking up and doing its
own thing during the night time.

Since waiting for the Dokkaebi King proved to be rather boring, Han
Sooyoung did what she could during the early hours of the morning.

Most of that was browsing through various blogs.

"That guy, I'm pretty sure he was a blogger…"

And when even that became too boring, she created a secret folder in the
notebook and started writing novels. Most of them were simple
'minifictions' written solely for the purpose of keeping her writer's sense
sharp. However, something truly strange happened the next day she
completed them. Her 13year-old ego active during the daytime ended up
causing a big event.

"Sooyoung-ah, since when did you learn to write so well?"

The school suddenly hosted a writing contest and she won the top prize.
Not only that, the content of her writing was exactly the same as the
minifiction she cobbled together during the early hours, too.

"Just, you know, it came flooding out," her 13-year-old self replied.
Han Sooyoung looked back, and recalled that people began saying she had
a talent for writing around the time she was 13 or so. With here as the
starting point, she would earnestly walk on the path of the full-fledged
writer.

And so, a month passed by like that, then yet another one.

Han Sooyoung grew rather invested in spectating her 13-year-old self living
her life.

As for the 15-year-old Kim Dokja, he too must be living somewhere in this
world. When she thought about that, she felt happy for some reason.

What should she first say to that unlucky idiot when they eventually get to
meet each other?

Time went by pretty quickly – September flew by, and it soon became
October.

Every now and then, her parents would stop by to leave behind presents she
didn't want, and went away again.

Finally, it was December. It was around here that Han Sooyoung began to
realize something didn't feel right.

– There are no matching results.

Why didn't tls123 start his serialisation already? Did she do something
wrong and that changed the future? But, that couldn't be possible. She
hadn't even met Kim Dokja yet.

…What would happen if the 'Ways of Survival' is not serialised this year?

Would this world continue to exist without the 'Ways of Survival'?

Maybe that wouldn't be such a bad world, in a way.
If the 'Ways of Survival' didn't exist, then this world wouldn't have to greet
its apocalypse, either. If so…

It was then she heard the phone go off.

She figured it must've been her parents again, but when she picked up the
receiver…

– I've found him.

"What? Where? N-no, hang on. Where are you now?"

Her heart began pounding away.

Kim Dokja had been found. Finally.

However, the next set of words was something that not even her [Predictive
Plagiarism] could have predicted.

– I'm currently, well… I'm in the place called a hospital's emergency ward."




Han Sooyoung avoided the guard's eyes and climbed aboard an early-hours
taxi cab. The hospital itself wasn't too far. Doctors and nurses were busily
going about their businesses despite the hour being what it was. Screams of
pain from the patients intermittently rang out. And empty beds were deeply
permeated with the lengthy tendrils of death's scent.

Even in a world without scenarios, people continued to die.

These were very small apocalypses. This was where lives not recorded went
to disappear.

Han Sooyoung, currently half in a daze, scanned all the stretchers.

"Ah…"
And that's how she found the 15-year-old Kim Dokja lying on one. His
face, deeply sunken and pale. An IV needle was stuck in the boy's wrist
wrapped tightly in bandages.

"I'm telling you, it's not our fault! In his school, he…!"

That came from a face not closely resembling Kim Dokja's. A married
couple, seemingly cousins once removed from the unconscious boy, were
shouting at a doctor in clear bouts of irritation.

Han Sooyoung stared at them, before demanding an answer from the
Dokkaebi King. "How did this guy end up like this?"

"Apparently, he jumped out of the classroom window."

Han Sooyoung slowly reached out and checked Kim Dokja's current
condition. Crude cast and bandages wrapped around his body. Swollen
bruises all over his face. His arm where not one solid muscle could be felt
lay powerlessly on the bed.

Han Sooyoung held the boy's hand.

It was as small as her own.

"Do… Do something," she muttered out.

"Please don't worry. These aren't fatal wounds. Thankfully, the classroom
floor wasn't high, and he collided with a tree on his way down, so…"

"That's not what I meant!"

The married couple walking in closer from the distance could be seen. They
must've discovered Han Sooyoung, since they seemed to be shouting
something or rather in her direction.

However, their voices didn't register in her brain.

Just why…
⸢"If it weren't for that novel, I'd probably have died back then."⸥

She wasn't sure if this was her own memory, or the 3rd turn's.

⸢"You, you. You and your exaggerations."⸥

⸢"I'm telling you the truth."⸥

Ancient, creaky memories rushed in like tidal waves while hiding within all
the ringing noises in her head. The Dokkaebi King supported her and they
left the hospital. She saw the medical staff and the paramedics hurriedly
moving the new patient into the emergency ward.

"We managed to find him somehow, didn't we?"

"…"

"Now that I've seen him personally, it was true all along. Did you sense that
incredible aura coming out from his entire figure? And now, as soon as he
opens his own world, then…"

As if it was looking forward to the apocalypse soon to visit this world-line,
the Dokkaebi King continued to yap on and on.

Han Sooyoung muttered out as she stumbled ungainly. "Kim Dokja said he
read that novel when he was fifteen."

"Yes. So, soon it…"

"What if he didn't get to read that novel… What will happen to him?"

"Pardon?"

If the 'Ways of Survival' didn't start, then this world would not be
destroyed.

However, what would happen to Kim Dokja, instead?
"Uhm, hello?"

"…"

"Are you actually crying?"

Kim Dokja's tragedy was a rather common one. If only a small number of
gazes fell upon him, if only just a tiny little bit of goodwill was shown his
way, then it'd have been easily overcome. However, he couldn't exactly
expect those small gazes or goodwill in the situation he found himself in.

Realistically speaking, could a 13-year-old elementary school kid be able to
save anyone? One who can barely regain her self only during early hours,
no less?

"But, why are you crying?"

That didn't mean she could entrust it to this Dokkaebi King, either.

Not only did it speak weirdly, but it also couldn't use the system, and its
character couldn't even be trusted, so how could she expect such a bum of a
Dokkaebi to…

Han Sooyoung dazedly stared at her own hands.

⸢"That novel saved me. So, I should pay my debt to its protagonist."⸥

The way to… save Kim Dokja.

"Hey, you have any money on you?"

"Pardon?"

"Give me five thousand, no, ten thousand Won."

Han Sooyoung quickly snatched the Dokkaebi King's cash and rushed
towards the nearby PC Bang.
The latter screamed and chased after her. "That's all the money I have!"

She sneaked past the PC Bang's owner dozing off, stole a charge card,
logged into an unused computer, and clicked on the internet browser. She
typed in the address of the webnovel platform she always connected to, and
searched for a certain author's name again.

– There are no matching results.

Even now, tls123 hadn't shown up yet.

The end of the year was fast approaching, yet the serialisation hadn't started
yet.

Han Sooyoung quietly glared at the monitor for a little while, before
clicking on the platform's [members registration] icon.

She didn't know who tls123 was. However, if tls123 was, at least, not Kim
Dokja – if the author of that damn novel was someone else, then…

– The applicable username is currently not in use. Would you like to use
thisusername?

Perhaps it didn't really matter who it was?

Her hand gripping the mouse was trembling hard.

The tragedy's button rested against the tip of her finger. If she clicked it,
then… the apocalypse of countless world-lines would begin.

However, if she didn't press it…

– Yes.

…The 'small world' she witnessed would disappear.

– Dear tls123-nim. Congratulations on your registration!

Han Sooyoung confirmed the remaining time.
[Three hours remaining in the self-regulated activity period.]

[Once the main ego wakes up, your control will forcibly be rescinded.]

She opened up the word processor and began typing away immediately. As
if she was unspooling a manuscript stuck inside her head for the longest
time ever, her fingers continued to move in a brilliant fashion. She showed
not a single error in her typing. Her exquisite sentences that seemingly
carved out a world in its entirety. However, arrangements that lacked any
consideration towards the potential reader, and expositions that had no
immersive devices to speak of. She typed, and typed some more, of this
boring story.

All the while expecting that…

…Without a doubt, one person would definitely get to read this story.

⸢This is a lie.⸥

Countless worlds were destroyed by her hands.

And countless characters died because of her.

⸢At least, until it can become the truth.⸥
All the possibilities that her [Predictive Plagiarism] could guess were
overflowing inside her head. Some of them became the narrative, while
some others became expositions.

And so, how long passed by like that? Han Sooyoung's fingers eventually
came to a stop.

⸢Yoo Joonghyuk stood before the vast, endless calamity pouncing on him
and spoke.⸥
It was not possible to figure out every facet of the story through the
[Predictive Plagiarism].
⸢"Until I witness the end of the scenario, I shall never give up. That's
why…"⸥
She wasn't sure whether Yoo Joonghyuk really said something like that or
not. Because all of this was from her imagination, after all. Because she had
created everything. That's why she wanted to write these very words. Even
if by borrowing Yoo Joonghyuk's mouth, she wanted to write these words
and put them in there.

⸢"You shouldn't give up, either."⸥

Han Sooyoung panted breathlessly and slowly raised her head. When she
looked behind her, she discovered the Dokkaebi King staring at the
computer's screen with an enraptured expression.

"Hey, Dokkaebi King?"

The creature slowly knelt down before her and waited for her next words.

"…I'm going to sleep."

[You have spent too much of your mental power during a short period of
time!]

[Your ego will become subconsciousness, and…]

…

…

…

When she regained her consciousness, she was lying on her own bed.

It was midnight. It seemed that a full day's cycle went by after she blacked
out.

'…Goddammit, what the hell did I do that for?'
While holding her head, Han Sooyoung got up from the bed. The blue
wallpaper of the notebook PC resting on the desk caught her eye. She
launched the internet browser without thinking too much about it and
connected to the webnovel platform.

Several comments had already popped up on her story she uploaded last
night. Most of them were crappy, toxic comments about how 'no jam' it
was, or how it was too obsessed with expositions and stuff.

"I quickly wrote that in mere two hours, so obviously… Besides, I was
trying my best to be as close to the 'Ways of Survival', you know??"
Among all those comments, a particular one caught her attention.

– Dear author-nim. It was a great read. May I ask about your
releaseschedule?

Such an unparalleled naivete that made him use his real name as the
username. Han Sooyoung stared at that name for a long, long time. She
looked closer, and discovered another comment attached to it.

– Are you… going to release another chapter tomorrow?

She repeatedly clenched and unfurled her fists many times. Sweat was
soaking her small hands.

Is it really okay for me to write this?

Even then, isn't it fine this way?

Han Sooyoung hesitated for a long time, before typing her reply.

While thinking about a certain someone, still alive beyond this screen.

While thinking about a certain boy who'd breathe, eat, shout some nonsense
about 'I'm Yoo Joonghyuk', and do whatever it takes to endure his own
apocalypse.
And so, the story of a regressor that reached 3149 chapters started in this
manner.

– Yes. A new chapter will be published tomorrow.
           Chapter 534: Epilogue 3 - Author's words, III


Han Sooyoung continued to write.

The short period of time given to her during the wee hours was completely
devoted to Kim Dokja.

"Hey, Dokkaebi King."

"Yes, my dear god."

"…I told you to stop calling me that. Anyways. The 'Ways of Survival' will
be published seven in the evenings from now on. The website doesn't have
the feature to schedule the chapter releases ahead of time yet, so you hold
onto the manuscript and upload them on time for me. If I upload them
during dawn, that kid is going to stay up late and wait. He won't get any
sleep."

"I shall do as you command."

Han Sooyoung spat out a lengthy groan and shifted her gaze back to the
manuscript she'd been working on.
⸢Yoo Joonghyuk examined the events of the previous regression turn.⸥

She couldn't possibly write a life that lasted for 1863rd regression turns.
3149 chapters were simply too short to contain a life lived for 1864 times.
She had to omit some regression turns, while some others had to be greatly
reduced in length.

She knew that life didn't really work that way. But at the same time, she had
to acknowledge that some lives could only be written in such a manner.
Once she came to accept that, writing those lives didn't prove to be too
difficult for her.

The life of 1863rd turn Yoo Joonghyuk was given to her in its entirety,
while she also possessed information from the 3rd turn Kim Dokja, as well.
Most importantly, though, she was an excellent writer.

The margins she couldn't fill up, they would instead be lived out by Yoo
Joonghyuk himself.

Yoo Joonghyuk, who'd take his breaths among the flowing contexts of the
words, and step above the hard ground covered by the pitch-black letters.

All she could do was to deliver such Yoo Joonghyuk's story.

Every time she wrote a single chapter, Kim Dokja's life was extended by
yet another day. As one sentence after another was compiled and recorded,
her own time also ticked forward little by little.

The 13-year-old Han Sooyoung became 14. Then, 15 years old.

⸢A serialisation that would last for ten long, arduous years had begun.⸥

It was tough. She didn't have enough stamina, and her young body was
simply too frail. Even then, Han Sooyoung endured. She thought about Kim
Dokja beyond the computer screen, also getting older like her. Kim Dokja,
who hadn't died, hadn't given up, and was still enduring his life.

– Dear author-nim, Today, Joonghyuk did…
Are you really enjoying a story like this?

Although half in doubt, Han Sooyoung still continued to write the story.

⸢"The information I gave you will come in handy later down the line. So,
take a look whenever you have time."⸥
The story would not end as long as someone was reading it.

That's how it was with the 1863rd regression turn, once thought to be the
last.

– Author-nim. I've been thinking, how about creating a new character
byusing this opportunity…?

She checked the comments Kim Dokja left behind every day. As she was
active only around the early hours, communicating with him in real-time
was difficult, but she did reply to the questions that seemingly required one.

– Should I create another main character?

– If possible, might as well as make her a pretty female character…

– Aha, you mean a beautiful young girl.

⸢Facial features more than enough to slap Yoo Joonghyuk's cheeks twice. A
beautiful young boy with brilliant blonde locks glared at Yoo Joonghyuk
and shouted out. "Hey you, dumpling man."⸥
– …But, author-nim??
Kim Dokja, 16 years old. 17, 18.

He'd consume this story and grow older, and eventually, become the 'Oldest
Dream'. Despite knowing that fact, Han Sooyoung still enjoyed this time
period. A world of a pure-white snowfield where letters were wandering
around freely. Above this world existed Kim Dokja, and so did Han
Sooyoung.
– Author-nim. I was wondering if Joonghyuk-ie is suffering way too
muchlately…

Sometimes, she'd put Yoo Joonghyuk through the wringer. It only
happened because of her desire to realistically copy and paste the story she
already knew. While writing the novel in this manner, she'd fall into a pit of
confusion every now and then.

Did this event really happen in the past?

Couldn't it be more like, it happened because I wrote this?

Whatever the truth was, she still gave it her all. She took pride in her work.
But at the same time, she had to admit that it was impossible for her to
completely rule over her own work.

⸢With a pair of seething, boiling eyes, Yoo Joonghyuk glared up into the
heavens.⸥
Sometime in the future, Yoo Joonghyuk created by the tips of her hands
would meet that Kim Dokja for real. Just thinking about that event nearly
made her go crazy from time to time.

– Unprecedented hit novel! ⸢⸢SSSSS-grade Infinite Regressor⸥⸥!

Around that time, the 'daytime ego' began working as an author in earnest,
as well. Of course, she had stolen the nighttime Han Sooyoung's talents
wholesale, so there was no way that her novel would fail. Not only that, the
'daytime ego' even went to the trouble of creating an anonymous account to
leave behind a toxic comment on the 'Ways of Survival', too.

– I'm really worried about the life of the dear author-nim actually
writingthis junk.

…What was even more flabbergasting was Kim Dokja's DM.
– Author-nim! Do know about the novel called SSSSS-grade
InfiniteRegressor? That novel's setting is exactly the same as the Ways of…
Han Sooyoung smirked and began typing her reply. She thought, right, the
dude writing a DM like this accused me of being a plagiarist during the
1863rd turn, did you?

I'm happy that my viewcount has gone up thanks to the exposure, actually.

When she was finished typing the reply, the faint rays of the daybreak had
cast onto the world outside the window. Starting from a while ago, she
didn't feel refreshed even after waking up. She'd often use up all of her
allotted time on writing the novel, and there were times when she couldn't
endure the fatigue anymore and fall asleep despite the self-regulated
activity period not having ended yet.

To make matters worse, her memories were gradually deteriorating, as well.

Information she heard from Yoo Joonghyuk, and received from Kim Dokja
– she couldn't recall them well. Things that happened back in the 1863rd
turn were getting blurrier. And also…

[Your Story is being consumed.]

Even the length of her self-regulated activity period was decreasing
gradually.




The time continued to tick by, and Han Sooyoung continued to write almost
every day.

At times, she couldn't wake up and ended up wasting an entire day. And
due to the worsening fatigue, the number of days she couldn't read Kim
Dokja's comments increased as well.
– Author-nim. I'll be joining the military the day after tomorrow. Looks
likeI'll be sent to the frontlines.

– It's Kim Dokja. I'm here at Yanggu.

– Joonghyuk-ah… I wonder, have you ever shovelled snow before?

20 years old, 21, 22…

371st turn, 621st, 972nd…

As Yoo Joonghyuk's regression turn numbers grew higher, so did Kim
Dokja's age. Kim Dokja feeding on Yoo Joonghyuk's tragedy became a
high school student, then a university student and eventually, a soldier.

Han Sooyoung observed the growth of such a man.

Her free time decreased even more as the 'daytime ego', now an adult
herself, began staying up during the dawn as well. As the time to polish up
the novel gradually dissipated, the Dokkaebi King's role also naturally grew
much more substantial.

"Please don't worry. I shall fix all the errors," said the Dokkaebi King.

"Do you even know anything about grammar?"

"Yes, I do. I'm planning to earn my living that way. A publisher was
looking for a part-time proofreader, so I confidently applied for the
position."

This guy still came across as somewhat unreliable, but she couldn't get
anyone else to help her, anyway. She definitely couldn't get the help from
the 'daytime ego', for instance. A lot of her strength had been exhausted and
her forgetfulness had worsened greatly in recent times so it took a lot out of
her just to post a reply to Kim Dokja's comments.

⸢And just like that, a few more years went by like fleeting magic.⸥
While writing that sentence, Han Sooyoung thought that her life wasn't all
that different from Yoo Joonghyuk's, in some ways.

Sometimes, a life really did get omitted like this. However, that didn't mean
a life omitted as such left nothing of itself behind, either. That's what she
thought while staring at the novel numbering over 3000 chapters currently
compiled before her eyes.

On a certain day before the completion, Han Sooyoung opened up the
platform's chat window in order to write a comment as usual.

– Please don't give up, dear reader-nim.

…Did I post a comment like this before?

Initially, she figured this was a result of her typing some random things
while half-submerged in drowsiness. However, there was more than one
post that she couldn't remember ever posting here.

– To answer your question…

Just when did she post such replies before? No matter how hard she thought
about it, she couldn't recall. Not only that, the timestamps of the posts were
weird, as well.

– Actually, rather than a mistake in the setting, it's…

Han Sooyoung summoned the Dokkaebi King right away. When she did,
the creature wearing a fedora appeared from the thin air accompanied by
the 'Tsu-chuchut!' noise.

She asked. "Did you write this?"

"Yes."

"On whose authority?"
"I sincerely apologise for not getting your permission beforehand. You
seemed very tired lately."

Han Sooyoung quietly stared at the Dokkaebi King.

This creature came to this world searching for its 'god'. And it now knew
who its creator was.

"Just what are you aiming for?"

"I am merely a 'storyteller'. And as it is with every storyteller, I love to tell a
great epic. The world you have created, of course."

"There is only one reader of this story, though."

"Do you really believe so?"

She narrowed her eyes and shot back. "I already know what you're
scheming, okay? You're planning to turn my novel into a 'paid service',
aren't you?"

Ever since arriving in this world, she constantly thought about 'that day'.

The novel she wrote would become the 'scenario' that would go on to
destroy this universe. However, who would dare to do something so
horrifying like that? The answer was quite simple when she thought about
it.

There was only one existence capable of doing something like that in this
world-line, after all.

"You brought me here for that very purpose, didn't you?"

"I won't deny that. Even though it hadn't been long since I realized what my
true role was."

Faint sparks were dancing all over the Dokkaebi King's body. That was the
evidence of the system's Probability growing stronger. Also, it meant that
this Dokkaebi was gradually regaining the power of the King of the
storytellers.

Han Sooyoung stared at the dancing sparks before speaking up. "…So,
then. The apocalypse will really begin, is that it?"

"Yes."

"Honestly, I don't get it at all. You know the chronological sequence doesn't
make sense, either."

"…The chronological sequence?"

"The only reason why I can write this is because Yoo Joonghyuk will live
his life in the future, and Kim Dokja had read the novel. But for me to write
a novel that Kim Dokja will read, that's…"

"…The time paradox. That's what humans call this. However, there are
universes that do operate on that principle. A universe where the future is
written before the past, and the cause is created for the purpose of the end
result. I'm sure you're already familiar with such a universe?"

Han Sooyoung frowned as if to ask, what on earth are you talking about?

The Dokkaebi King grinned and lightly tapped the computer monitor.
"Aren't you currently writing one?"

The stray thoughts and fragments of letters she had thrown around could be
found in there.

Countless scenes existing outside the time itself, outside the world, waiting
to be connected as one. Some scenes became futures despite being written
earlier, while some scenes, despite being written later, became the past. Han
Sooyoung's eyes trembled. "…Are you saying this whole universe is just a
novel?"

"If I am to compare it, then yes, something like that."
The letters within the screen seemed to ripple. Letters wishing to be loved
by someone were flowing outside the monitor after forming pairs and
groups with each other.

Sentences, that sparkled like the stars.

Some sentences willingly became the darkness for other sentences, while a
certain sentence became light only through those dark words. Some
sentences existed for the next sentence, while the next sentence gained its
meaning because the first sentence existed.

"There is no 'before and after' in this universe. And that is precisely the
reason why the 'First World-line' is being completed very last." Within this
giant, endlessly connecting chain, the Dokkaebi King was smiling
rapturously. "The universe was created just now, but at the same time, it has
existed for the past billions of years, as well. And a certain beginning only
appears after the apocalypse has commenced." Sentences cascaded like a
meteor shower.
<Star Stream> was singing towards its god.

Because Han Sooyoung wrote the Ways of Survival, Kim Dokja got to read
it.

Because Kim Dokja read the Ways of Survival, Yoo Joonghyuk began his
regression.

Because Yoo Joonghyuk began his regression, Han Sooyoung was able to
write the 'Ways of Survival'.

She might have written them, but these words were completed only after
leaving her hands.

⸢The story that would save someone, destroy, and help him live.⸥

Han Sooyoung stared at the horrifying trajectory drawn out by those words
and became acutely aware of the fact that she had been thrown into this
neverending cycle.
She might be the author responsible for creating this world, but she was
also a powerless god. A god that couldn't even save a single reader. A god
who was simply a part of this vast, boundless story. [<Star Stream> is
smiling in your direction.]

"Now, behold. Isn't this a truly perfect story?"
           Chapter 535: Epilogue 3 - Author's words, IV


[<Star Stream> is looking at its creator.]

Her eyelids soaked in fatigue slowly closed. As she drifted into the languid
sea of unconsciousness, Han Sooyoung listened to the Dokkaebi King's
voice.

"Please, rest now and sleep, my noble god."

And on the next day, the 'Ways of Survival's' final chapter was completed.




⸢…Three ways to survive. I've forgotten a few. But one thing's for certain.
That is…⸥
After she finished typing the very last sentence, Han Sooyoung kept her
eyes closed for a very long time. She knew a day like this would eventually
come.
But now that it was finally here, it didn't feel real to her at all.

Her lengthy serialisation had finally come to an end.

When she slowly looked behind, the Dokkaebi King was standing there just
as she suspected. With a pair of deeply-moved eyes, it was staring at the
computer monitor.

"Hey, you," said Han Sooyoung.

"Yes, my god."

"Can't you, like, not do the paid service?"

"Dear god-nim, even if I don't, the story will commence regardless."

Han Sooyoung could only smile bitterly at the Dokkaebi King speaking like
a stubborn devotee.

The daylight was breaking outside the windows. The sun would rise, and
when it was time to set again, the apocalypse would come to visit this
world.

⸢And then, Kim Dokja's story will begin.⸥

"…And I'm destined to disappear, right?"

Tsu-chut, chuchuchut…

Her Story, what little remained of it, wiggled slightly. There were some
stories that might not seem all that excellent or special, but still required an
untold sacrifice to complete. To her, the 'Ways of Survival' was one such
novel.

[Your existential Story is in a precarious state.]

If the future about to unfold was correct, her ego would soon disappear into
the main body's vast, boundless subconsciousness. And only after the main
body learns the [Avatar] skill would she be reborn with a tiny bit of the old
memories. And then, get to live the 1863rd regression turn.

⸢If that's indeed the case, what did my life exist for?⸥

Han Sooyoung dazedly approached the window. The light grew brighter
beyond the pale-naked skies, and the stars were receding away.

【Everything has already been written, and at the same time, still being
written.】

The 'Outer God' who sent her to the 1863rd turn said that to her. A universe
of repeating cycle. And in this universe, the result birthed the cause, and the
cause would eventually become the result.

In order to create a complete story, the result rejected the cause, while the
cause devoured the result in order to exist. The moment she understood that
vast, mysterious rule, Han Sooyoung began thinking that this world
resembled a chessboard. A chessboard that pursued the highest degree of
completion, ruled by a certain gigantic 'will' with an unknown origin and
form.

Even if she was the creator of the apocalyptic scenario, wasn't she merely
another chess piece, a 'knight', in this chessboard of the universe?

While sensing the waves of sleepiness crashing in, she slowly got up from
her seat.

[Your mental power has reached its limit!]

Han Sooyoung fought against the horrifying level of tiredness, fumbled
around to put on some clothes, and left her room. The hour was still very
early, but the people waking up early should be getting ready to go to work
round about now. The Dokkaebi King was following after her.

She addressed the King while not even bothering to look back. "You
worked hard trying to edit the novel until now."
"If you go outside, you'll die."

She already knew that. Because the sun was rising.

Han Sooyoung looked up at the break of dawn and spoke. "My role's
already finished, anyway. You'll take care of the rest from now on, right?
It'll be the end when you hand over the text file to him on the designated
time. I wrote that revised version too, the one we talked about, just in case.
But… that's incomplete, so you decide what to do later."

"But…"

"It's been over ten years." Han Sooyoung glared at the Dokkaebi King
several hand-spans taller than her. "Can't I do what I want at least once?"

The reason why she came to this world – it was to meet Kim Dokja she ran
into back in the 1863rd turn one more time.

She leisurely warmed her muscles, and started jogging.

⸢Han Sooyoung imagined Kim Dokja, on his way to work at Mino Soft.⸥

She heard news from the Dokkaebi King every now and then, and there
were also the comments Kim Dokja himself had written. And that's how she
knew a lot about him.

– Author-nim! I'll be living by myself starting this year!

– I'm now living near this place. And it's really weird reading about it in
anovel.

– Have you heard about Mino Soft? It'd be nice if your novel gets a
gameversion, too. Maybe I should suggest it to the…

She knew when he became independent from his tragedy, and from where
he started dealing with yet another tragedy. And also, in what shape or form
this new tragedy appeared as.
[The main body's ego is trying to wake up from her dream!]

[Warning! Your self-regulated activity period has ended!]

[Further exercising of control will cause your ego to…]

Han Sooyoung ignored the messages and continued to run. She ran, and ran
again until she could barely breathe. She ran hard, the words Kim Dokja
wrote the only things occupying her thoughts.

– Author-nim. I don't remember how many times I've said this before,

but…Those words… she'd forget them all.

[Your actions are in serious violation of the Probability.]

She'd forget the memories of the 1863rd turn.

And she'd also forget the fact that she wrote a certain novel, as well.

[Your Story is disappearing.]

She'd forget that a story existed just for its sole reader.

However, even then, even if she forgot everything…

⸢Han Sooyoung's running slowly came to a halt.⸥

There he was. A man who existed only as texts for a long, long time ever
since that day she last saw him in the hospital's emergency ward.

⸢In the distance, Kim Dokja was walking forward.⸥

That was the exact same face of Kim Dokja she remembered.

The man who came to her 1863rd regression turn. The man who she wanted
to see again. The detestable man with his own brand of ass-kissing. The
man who lied really easily. The man who she enjoyed being around, since
they could lie about something together and snicker among themselves. "---
-"

The man, who didn't remember her.

"----!!"

Her voice didn't want to come out. She couldn't tell whether it was because
she was choking up, or the control of her body was slipping away from her.

Han Sooyoung staggered and walked closer to Kim Dokja. Several
passersby brushing past her looked back in suspicion.

Kim Dokja was now walking down the subway's steps.

Kim Dokja, with earphones stuck in his ears and reading something on his
phone while walking downstairs.

She knew what he was currently reading.

"---!!"

She barely managed to shout, but her voice still didn't come out. So, she
desperately chased after him.

– Because of the story you wrote, author-nim, I was able to survive
untilnow.

Han Sooyoung was also able to survive while reading the sole reader's
words.

She managed to write the next part of Yoo Joonghyuk's life through them.

She was able to endure her boring and stuffy teen years, the days she never
wanted to go back to, thanks to those words.

– This train is bound for…
She spotted Kim Dokja standing on the platform, waiting for the next train
to arrive. A person hiding within the small world crafted out of letters to
protect himself was standing right there.

Kim Dokja, who didn't know anything about the apocalypse about to
happen.

Kim Dokja, who'd get to live on the expansive world of the 'Ways of
Survival'.

Kim Dokja, who'd get to meet the protagonist he so longed to become.

Kim Dokja, who'd become the 'Demon King of Salvation'.

Kim Dokja, who'd sacrifice himself multiple times for the sake of his
companions, and as a result, came to the 1863rd turn and met her.

Kim Dokja, who was destined to become the 'Oldest Dream', the price he
paid for loving a certain story too much.

[Your mental state is crumbling!]

[The main body's ego is regaining its control.]

[Your Story is being extinguished.]

Her legs grew heavy, and her arms didn't want to move anymore. Her body
was gradually becoming not hers.

Even then, Han Sooyoung wanted to tell him.

⸢To tell him that he was definitely not at fault for this story being born. And

to tell him that the things he was about to experience were not his sins.⸥
Because her past 13 years existed solely to say those words to him.
⸢To say that, though you have grown up while reading this story, there's no
need for you to become it.⸥
She barely managed to reach out, the tips of her hand touching Kim Dokja's
shoulder.

[Your ego will convert into the 'subconsciousness'.]

Kim Dokja felt that sensation of touch on his shoulder and looked behind
him.

However, the incoming waves of commuters heading to work swept him
up, and he got pushed into the subway, instead.

And after the crowd had left, only Han Sooyoung and her dazed expression
remained on the empty subway platform.

"…What the hell? Why the hell am I standing here??"

Han Sooyoung tilted her head, before scratching her hair hard while
wondering out loud, "Did my sleepwalking flare up again??"

She confirmed the time with her smartphone and exploded in irritation.
"Son of a… And I haven't even finished writing today's chapter, too!"

…

…

…

…

[Story, 'Predictive Plagiarism', has plagiarised your lost memories!]

…

…
…

…

Tsu-chuchuchuchu…

"Han Sooyoung?"

Tsu-chuchu…

"Han Sooyoung!!"

She heard someone call out to her among all the terrible ringing in her ears.

"Han Sooyoung!"

And right next instance, a powerful impact landing on the back of her head
helped her to regain her wits. The pain emanating from the back of the head
was hellish. She already knew which fool would hit her so mercilessly like
this.

"Joonghyuk-ssi!! What are you doing, hitting her so hard like that?! You
could've killed her right as she's waking up!"

Han Sooyoung slowly raised her head and discovered Lee Seolhwa
supporting her, as well as Yoo Joonghyuk and his massive scowl. Also, the
other members of <Kim Dokja's Company>, too. Jung Heewon, Lee
Hyunsung, Shin Yoosung, Lee Jihye… Companions, currently covered in
dust from head to toe.

Han Sooyoung intently stared at them as if to study each and every one
present. Eventually, her gaze shifted over to Yoo Joonghyuk. "…I think I
now know how you felt back when you finally recalled the 0th turn."

"What rubbish are you talking about now?"

"…I remember."
Han Sooyoung looked around here and there as if it still didn't feel real to
her yet. Then, she slowly looked behind her. That's where the field covered
in dense fog created out of letters could be seen. That was the gateway they
passed through just now, and also, the hurdle where she nearly died, as
well.

Lee Jihye checking out Han Sooyoung's complexion asked. "Eonni, are
you really alright? You were mumbling some incoherent stuff about going
somewhere to sign a contract for a novel and stuff…" [Story, 'Predictive
Plagiarism', has stopped its storytelling.] Han Sooyoung looked down at
her own trembling hands.

Why did these memories return to her only now?

…No, hold on – were they even real, to begin with?

⸢Once upon a time, she wrote a certain story with these very hands.⸥

Faint memories that were still overflowing with vividness.

Han Sooyoung organised her thoughts in a sequential manner – why she
was here, what had happened so far, and what she needed to say now.

"I'm… the 'Ways of Survival's'…"

Han Sooyoung barely managed to breathe in a couple of times, and just as
she was about to open her mouth again, Yoo Joonghyuk abruptly cut her
off. "Stop wasting time with unnecessary remarks, and let's head out." She
raised her head after hearing those words.

[Main Scenario has been updated!]

['Final Scenario' will now commence.]
Even as she stared at the scenario messages unfolding before her very eyes,
everything still didn't feel real to her. But, she knew why those messages
were floating around in her vision, though.

⸢The companions had broken past the 99 scenarios once more.⸥

"…Why are you acting so dazed like this?"

This was the tragedy that she set in motion. And the very people who faced
this tragedy head-on were extending their hands towards her.

"Let's go, Sooyoung-ssi."

Yoo Sangah lightly tapped Han Sooyoung's back and took the lead.

The backs of her companions walking ahead of her were murky, cloudy.

This was impossible. This was not something you could pull off because of
your desire to save someone else.

Even then, they still did it.

In the far-off distance, the wall of letters covering up the end of the world
could be seen.

The 'Final Wall'.

The companions exchanged knowing glances and began pulling out their
weapons one by one – and simultaneously, the roars of the Constellations
came from afar.

Yoo Joonghyuk watching this scene unfold also unsheathed his [Black
Heavenly Demon Sword]. "That fool is beyond that wall."

The Dokkaebis from the Bureau were blocking their path, and the Dokkaebi
King's figure could be seen guarding the Final Wall itself. Han Sooyoung
slowly sucked in her breaths and got up from her spot.
It truly had been a lengthy story. And finally, its ending was right before
her eyes.

⸢They have finally reached the conclusion she had written.⸥
Chapter 536: Epilogue 4 - The Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint, I


I remembered the first time I read that novel.

A really stuffy, boring hospital's ward. A single PC located in its lobby.

When I stood in line to have a go at it, a gentleman wearing a fedora
stepped aside for me. The computer screen at the time was showing the
webnovel platform that enjoyed visiting.

I dazedly stared at the screen before inputting the keywords. I might have
inserted three or so words, but couldn't quite remember what I typed back
then. However, I still remembered what I was thinking of back then. The
mechanical pencil leads strewn about on the classroom floor, the
indigohued skies extending far beyond outside the windows.

What I could tell for sure was that my hands, used to open the classroom
window, had typed something and that lead me to discover that novel.

⸢Three Ways to Survive in a Ruined World⸥
Through that story, I survived.

⸢He was definitely not at fault for this story being born⸥

I felt sick inside. I couldn't fight against the dizziness and collapsed on the
floor. The texts before my eyes were blurry and hard to see.

⸢Han Sooyoung was tls123.⸥

While panting heavily, I lay unmoving on the floor for a long time. Only
the same exact question continued to swirl around in my head – the
question of "But, why?"

⸢Why, for someone like me?⸥

I remained collapsed for a while. I thought I cried, too. However, no matter
how I thrashed and screamed and sobbed, the already-written sentences
couldn't be changed. Han Sooyoung had to spend 13 years of life just for
me, and helped me live by crafting sentences literally carved out of her.
And then, she was extinguished.

⸢Kim Dok ja⸥

[The Fourth Wall] was calling out to me. I quietly listened to the next
words.

⸢Y o u sho uld r e a d⸥

I gingerly stood back up. My reflection on the windows was a complete
mess. It'd be hard to call my body an adult's anymore. My height had
decreased a lot, and my face had gotten younger, too. The coat I wore no
longer fit me. I stared at that face for a long time, before taking the coat off
for good.

"…How many years has it been?"
⸢Ear th's ti me h a s no mea ning he re⸥

I understood what that meant.

This subway was the location where the 'Oldest Dream' had his dreams. So,
the time of other world-lines couldn't measure the 'time' flowing within this
train.

In all honesty, I had completely lost all sense of time after entering this
train, anyway.

"Even then, there should still be this thing called perceived time, right?"

⸢Ar ound 21763 y e a r s⸥

"It's not as long as I thought. I'm still way younger than the 'Secretive
Plotter', right?"

⸢St ill a li ttle r un t⸥

I heard [The Fourth Wall] cackle away. If it wasn't for this guy's presence
here, I'd have gone insane a long time ago.

Along with the 'Pah-sususu' noise, the tip of my pinky decreased a little.

Since when did this start from, I wondered. I didn't do anything, yet my
body continued to grow smaller. Well, if I were to be more specific, it
wasn't really 'I didn't do anything', though.

"…Will I keep getting smaller?" I stared at the crumbs of Stories drifting
away outside the windows and asked. "Where are those Stories going off to,
anyway?"

⸢To uni ver se's sub con scious ness⸥

"And where is that?"
⸢In a wor ld-li ne y o u ar en't con sci ous of⸥

The role of the 'Oldest Dream' was to imagine all of the world-lines. Even if
I wasn't conscious of it, my subconsciousness was still continuously
watching the world-lines.

⸢Tho se Stories wi ll be reb orn as ano ther Kim Dok ja⸥

"As another Kim Dokja?"

⸢Me ta phor ica lly spea king its li ke th at⸥

I thought I could understand what [The Fourth Wall] was saying.

Stories were streaming beyond the galaxies to head towards another
worldline.

Those Stories were, in essence, 'me'.

Just like the 49% version of me living along with my companions
somewhere in the 1864th regression turn, my fragments could very well be
reborn as 'Kim Dokja' in a world-line somewhere out there.

"If it's only that little, I think it'll be a bit of a push to call that guy 'Kim
Dokja'. I mean, he won't be the same as me with such a small fragment."

⸢Y o u mi ght be ri ght⸥

An existence that might have a different name and face to me. Even then,
that existence would come to life and start imagining the universe. He'd be
moved after reading the story, and then, stare at the world-line.

And just like that, he'd maintain this universe.

"…I see."

Somehow, I thought I could understand the principle of this universe just a
little.
I pressed my crumbling fingers against the window. When I did, the rate of
crumbling began accelerating.

⸢If y o u do th at⸥

"This is my way of atoning for this story."

Not just from my fingers, but the Stories began scattering away little by
little from the shoulders as well as my legs, too.

The scattered Stories would fly around in the universe and become
sentences that go on to support this universe from somewhere.

⸢To say that, though you have grown up while reading this story, there's no
need for you to become it.⸥
That's what the author of the 'Ways of Survival', Han Sooyoung said.

I had clearly heard her. Even then, I couldn't heed her words.

How could I make any other choice when looking at such a story?

When I closed my eyes, the overview of the entire universe would get
drawn inside my head.

Han Sooyoung wrote the story.

Yoo Joonghyuk lived that story.

And, I read that very story.

And that's how this world barely managed to reach its completion.

⸢"Dokja-ssi."⸥

Because this tragedy existed, I got to meet certain people.

Someone was able to get saved, too.
⸢Kim Dokja stared into the universe with no visible end.⸥

And now, I knew what my future was like. Every time I read something, I'd
crumble away. My crumbling Stories would scatter to countless world-lines
out there and become the 'gaze' that maintained this universe.

I would lose all of my memories, and lose everything that I hold dear. And
in the end, only the desire to see the 'next story' would remain in me.

But, without that desire, this universe couldn't continue.

This universe could only continue telling its story as long as someone was
looking at it.

Being stuck and unmoving in this universe meant death.

Tsu-chuchuchu…

The countless 'me' divided into particles continued to spread out to the
numerous world-lines out there. The rate of the Story's scattering continued
to hasten.

"If I forget about everything… I won't feel this pain anymore, right?"

⸢Y o u wo nt re mem ber any th ing af ter all⸥

To someone who even lost the traces of his loss, no such thing as 'loss'
existed.

While picking up the smartphone rolling around on the floor, I spoke up.
"… Will I have enough time to read it one more time, I wonder?"

I opened the file for the 'Ways of Survival', and scrolled up past the
[Author's words] that I had to read with great difficulty.

⸢Three Ways to Survive in a Ruined World.⸥

I started reading this novel from the very beginning.
I read Yoo Joonghyuk's 3rd turn. Some stories, I already knew. While some
others felt brand new to me.

The so-called final revised version was exactly the same as the original that
I remembered.

'Kim Dokja' didn't exist in it.

Pah-susususu…

Just as my Story scattered away, the sentences from the 'Ways of Survival'
filled me up inside. When I got tired, I closed my eyes for a little bit and
rested, and after resting, I continued reading the novel.

Fifth turn, sixth… 64th… 129th…

672nd.

914th.

1642nd…

The page continued to scroll down, and I was overjoyed or saddened
several times.

Not being able to comment did bum me out. I wanted to let Han Sooyoung
know of my emotions one more time. To tell her that I could only come this
far because of the story you gave me, that I loved your story more than
anyone in this world.

And so, I read. I read, and then, read some more.

How long did I read this very story?

Tsu-chuchuchu…

⸢…⸥

By the time I reached the epilogue, my vision suddenly grew fuzzy.
I even wondered if I became blind after reading a novel for far too long.

[A new update has been completed.]

But then, my vision was slowly restored. What I saw weren't proper
sentences, however. Sentences and paragraphs had become individual
fragments.

Words that were no longer in the form of a completed novel. Even then, I
could still read them somehow.

⸢A world had been destroyed, and a brand new one was being born.⸥

My heart was beating loudly.

A story I was intimately familiar with was there.

⸢I was the sole reader who knew the conclusion of this world.⸥

Within this story, I existed. And…

⸢"I'm Yoo Joonghyuk."⸥

⸢"Ah, it seems that I haven't introduced myself yet. My name is Han

Sooyoung. I'm the assistant to Cha Sang-Gyeong-nim in the group.⸥
And, they were there, too.

⸢"What if the 'scenarios' didn't start, what would've happened to us?"⸥

⸢"Dokja-ssi, your sponsor isn't something like the 'One-eyed Fortuneteller',
right?"⸥

⸢"Dokja-ssi, have you thrown a hand grenade before?"⸥
⸢"Ahjussi, do you have any particular food you like?"⸥

We broke past the scenarios, together.

⸢Hyung, are you maybe a god?⸥

⸢"Load the cannons."⸥

⸢"Everyone, fight to your hearts' content. I won't let anyone die."⸥

⸢"You stinking bastards!! Again, you didn't even come to fetch me…!!"⸥

⸢"The one I like isn't you, but the 'Demon King of Salvation'…⸥

⸢[Baat!]⸥

And, I lived my life together with them.

⸢"The next scenario is…"⸥

We experienced trials, and had to face off against life-threatening situations
many times.

We met Constellations.

We broke past seemingly-impossible scenarios several times.

And eventually, reached the end of the hellish scenarios.

⸢[Your ■■ is 'Eternity'.]⸥

The companions returned to their everyday lives.

⸢Some people were rebuilding the destroyed PC Bangs. They were putting
up the torn posters of the computer games once more. In the world where
the apocalypse had been overcome, people would search for other forms of
entertainment once more. Yoo Joonghyuk observed this spectacle, and
quietly clenched his right hand that hadn't held a mouse in a long, long
while.⸥

⸢Shin Yoosung and Lee Gilyoung were enrolled into a temporary school.
Not an elementary, not a secondary, nor was it a high school – no, it was as
the word implied, a 'temporary' school. Shin Yoosung was surprised to
learn that such a place could exist in this world.⸥

⸢Lee Jihye stared at the sight of the destroyed 'Taepung Girls' High' for a
long time, then started walking on the school's athletics field. She used to
run on this very field with her friends once upon a time. She quietly stared
at the worn-out track lines, before cautiously assuming the starting posture.⸥

While reading the continuing stories of my companions, I wiped my eyes
several times.

This was the ending to this story.

The companions were definitely living their lives in that place. They ate,
they slept, they met with each other and talked. And 'I' was there, too.

The 49% version of me. Kim Dokja that had the memories of the
companions, but didn't know anything about the 'Ways of Survival'…

⸢And Kim Dokja read those sentences.⸥

But then…

⸢"You, just who the hell are you?"⸥

What was going on here?

⸢"Speak. Who the hell are you?"⸥

It wasn't supposed to be like this.
⸢"I'm sure of it. Kim Dokja is still in that place."⸥

But, how…

⸢"If you get a chance to run again, do you believe you can see it better the
next time?"⸥

…Why?

Tsu-chuchuchuchu…

The story was continuing on. The story that should've ended didn't end.

More correctly, they chose to 'not end it'.

⸢[Stigma, 'Group Regression Lv.1' is activating!]⸥

I read that sentence half in despair.

This shouldn't have happened. This sentence, it should never have been
written.

But the sentence uncaringly led to the next one.

⸢"Remember this. We have only one opportunity."⸥

The companions, they were fighting again.

The hellish scenarios were a place they shouldn't have gone back to, no
matter what their reasons were. Even then, my companions returned to that
place.

⸢"Hey, shorty. You aren't going to flip a coin this time?"

"It'll be the same whether I do or not, you know."

"What do you mean?"
"Even if I flip it a hundred times and it comes out only once, even if only
one percent of hyung remains in that place, I'll still go there to rescue him.
Because that one percent is still hyung."⸥

Then, the scenario commenced. And in the midst of the banquet of Coins
exploding in the air, Dokkaebis of <Star Stream> were clearly freaking out.

Within the explosive level of interest shown by the Constellations, the
companions were shouting out loudly.

⸢"Hey, Abaddon! Choose me! I'm gonna absolutely become hundreds of
times stronger than that sooty bastard in the future!"⸥

⸢"General-nim! Are you there? I know you're looking at me right now!"⸥

⸢"I don't need any sponsors, so please just give me Coins, instead."⸥

⸢"…Black Flame Dragon, stop pestering me with messages while I'm still
being civil, okay? I told you I won't choose you this time around."⸥
They had to be insane.

⸢"Fufufu, you sure took your sweet time getting to Chungmuro. You think
you can rescue that 'Bi-sil-ie' like this? As an aside, this whole area is now
this great one's territo…" ⁽¹⁾

"Will you just shut up and hand over the flag, Gong Pildu?"⸥

These people who lost their minds were clearing the scenario with insane
methods.

Dangerous moments came in their direction many times, but the
companions never yielded once.

⸢[Incarnation, 'Lee Jihye', is activating Stigma, 'Transmission Lv.1'!]⸥
⸢"You stinking sooty bastard! This is why only you got stronger, by using
crap like this!"⸥
The [Transmission]. The regressor-specific skill that allowed one to
strongly 'ruminate' over the memories from the previous life and let one
regain their past skills.

⸢"Uriel! Great Sage! Abyssal Black Flame Dragon!"⸥

And with the aid from the Constellations added in, the companions got to
clear the scenario at a considerable pace. It truly was an amazing marching
speed.

⸢"We can clear this with Avatars. No one has to die."⸥
However, it wasn't as if they emerged as unopposed victors every single
time.

⸢"Supreme King. My apologies, but you need to die here."⸥
Some of the people they regressed with turned out to be traitors.

⸢"Had you regained your original strength, all three of us combined
wouldn't even be a match to you, but…"

"But, as it is now? It's a different story."⸥
I bit down on my lip.

These people joined the regression journey while harbouring impure
motivation from the very beginning.

And to make matters worse, they aimed for the early part of the scenarios,
when Yoo Joonghyuk was with Yoo Mia. They probably thought that he'd
be at his weakest around this point in time.

⸢However, that was a miscalculation.⸥
…Wha?

⸢"Mia-yah."⸥

Almost at the same time Yoo Joonghyuk spoke up, a lengthy sword
emerged from Yoo Mia's mouth.

⸢The Black Heavenly Demon Sword.⸥

The highest-grade item that could only be acquired around the middle
stages of the scenarios, was now firmly gripped in Yoo Joonghyuk's hand.
Chills ran down my skin. I had no idea that Yoo Mia's 'Inventory' could be
used in that fashion…

While emitting truly incredible killing intent, Yoo Joonghyuk coldly
declared.

⸢"Die."⸥

Sentences continued on sporadically after that.

⸢"The 'Demon King of Salvation' during this turn is me!"

"What the hell, we agreed that I'll be the one! That Modifier is mine,
noona!"⸥

The companions didn't concede an inch to anyone, and…

⸢Majority of the Constellations are baring their animosity towards 'Kim
Dokja's Company's' Incarnations!⸥
And, they didn't compromise once with anyone, either.

The Kim Dokja-less 'Kim Dokja's Company' continued to clear the
scenarios in a pace not too slow, but not too fast, either
Certain scenes were dealt with using simple descriptions, while some others
were completely omitted. The later they got in the scenarios, the worse the
segmentation of each scenes became. It was as if the rough sketches of
ideas had been left behind there, instead.

Companions who were at the 20th scenario were suddenly in the 15th, then
they could be found in the 35th next. However, there was no doubt that the
companions were there. And I could imagine them.

⸢They ran on the blank margins.⸥

They were running on the scenario's field of snow. And they were
advancing forward one sentence at a time. They were gradually getting
closer to me.

While looking at them, I repeated the cycle of crying and sleeping. The
fuzzier my consciousness became, the stronger my desire grew. Even
though I knew that I shouldn't think this way, I couldn't stop myself.

⸢I want to read this story for a little bit longer.⸥

Just like that, I read the disconnected sentences, and then, read the one after
that. And I imagined what might be between those sentences, as if I was
groping around in the dark.

The viewpoint that the author couldn't control, and one that no reader could
predict.

And within this space between the lines not addressed by any sentences, the
companions continued to complete the scenarios little by little.

⸢Inside this space between the lines where no one could intrude upon their
lives, they remained as gods of this story.⸥
While reading their story, I blacked out several times. My reading speed got
worse and worse, and my Story was disappearing bit by bit, as well.
Meanwhile, the sentences of my companions continued to diligently pile
up. To the 98th scenario, and then, to the 99th once more. Sentences written
by their own lives were accurately being compiled one by one. And
eventually…

⸢They have finally reached the conclusion she had written.⸥

The very last sentence arrived at my doorstep. That was the end of the
'Ways of Survival', a story seemingly abandoned in the middle of being
written. A story that didn't get completed because of that reason.

From beyond the very last sentence of the story, a certain noise came to me.
A noise that sounded like someone calling out to someone else. Or perhaps,
the noise of someone knocking on the door.

The smartphone went off with a 'tab!' noise, and its pitch-black screen
reflected my face, now that of a child. I was crying.

⸢Kim Dokja slowly raised his head.⸥

I felt the faint vibration of the subway. Since when did it start?

Thud-!

Someone was pounding on the rear door of the train's cabin.
 Chapter 537: Epilogue 4 - The Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint,
                               II


"Run! We only have to go a little bit further!"

Han Sooyoung, along with her companions, broke through the waves of the
Constellations. The Ark scattered debris as it was destroyed, and revealed
the [Final Wall] in its full glory in the distance.

The grace of a Giant Story was enveloping the companions as if to protect
them.

[Giant Story, 'One Who Rebels Against Fate', has begun its storytelling.]

It was a new Giant Story they got to earn during this regression turn.
Without it, they would've died many times over.

They could see the figures of Constellations marching towards them from
the distance. Like enraged wild beasts, Myth-grade Constellations from
<Vedas> and <Papyrus> were rushing in their direction.
⸢Unlike their previous regression turn, they didn't have 'Outer Gods'
supporting them this time.⸥

Their combat force was in an overwhelmingly disadvantageous situation.
The only reason why they weren't pushed back even then, was because the
strongest ever group in existence made out of regressors was lending them
support.

The ones taking on the frontlines were the Chinese and Indian Incarnations.

When China's Fei Hu gave his signal, Incarnations from his own force, [Ah
Q] yanked out their weapons simultaneously. As if he couldn't possibly lose
here, India's Ranvir Khan also joined the fray. The Incarnations from
[Trimurti] following after him pulled out their own spears too, and caused
the sand storm to violently rage on.

Then, [Justice] led by Selena Kim and [Solzhenitsyn] led by Iris who
tagged along with her took on both sides of the flanks.

Even then, their battle situation remained disadvantageous.

[Go on ahead, I shall take care of this place.]

[If you fail to rescue my disciple, then consider your lives forfeit.]

Kyrgios and the Breaking the Sky Saint, they too were part of the 100-
strong regressors. Weapons of these two swept across the battlefield, and
the Transcendents from Murim supported their rear and followed after the
duo. Kwa-aaaaaah!

Both Kyrgios and the Breaking the Sky Saint had grown even stronger than
before through the regression; as if they were in competition against each
other, their sword strikes raucously shook the entire battlefield. The
screams of the Constellations being torn apart by the silver-hued storm
reverberated throughout the land.

The [Wall] needed to be opened while they were buying a little bit of time.
⸢This wall had been opened once before.⸥
Han Sooyoung looked up at the massive wall they had finally succeeded in
reaching and spoke up. "Jang Hayoung."

"Yes, ma'am."

As if she was waiting for it, Jang Hayoung extended her hand.

She was now the full-fledged 'King of Transcendents' after going through
the scenarios one more time.

[The 'Wall of Impossible Communication' has discovered its intended
position.]

The [Final Wall] began vibrating as if it was reacting to their Giant Story.

"Yoo Sangah."

Yoo Sangah nodded her head and stepped forward.

[The 'Wall that Decides Samsara' has discovered its intended position.]
⸢[You are… I see… You have journeyed this lengthy cycle of time and
eventually made your way back here, my arhat.]⸥

The Story of Sakyamuni quietly entered their ears. Sakyamuni of this
worldline easily accepted Yoo Sangah's existence. He had already repeated
many, many cycles of samsara, allowing him to gain an understanding of
this universe's rules.

"Jung Heewon, Lee Gilyoung."

The [Wall That Divides the Good and Evil] they received from 'Metatron'
and 'Agares'.

Jung Heewon reached out first and placed her hand on the [Final Wall].

⸢[…Have you really come here, after witnessing what's beyond that wall?]⸥
Metatron of this world-line was deeply astonished by the companions'
existence. He accepted the eventual destruction of <Eden>, and admitted
that that result couldn't be changed. However, he made a slightly different
decision during this regression turn. The proof of that was the <Eden>'s
Archangels currently aiding the Incarnations. However, it wasn't only him
who made a bizarre choice.

⸢[How amusing. You dare to ask me, a Demon King, to hand over the
[Wall] to you.]⸥

The Demon Kings and the angels who fought against each other with
murderous intensity back in the Great War of Saints and Demons stood as
their allies this time. It was a choice based on their desire to survive, but
nevertheless, it proved to be a great help to <Kim Dokja's Company>.

[The 'Wall That Divides the Good and Evil' has discovered its intended
position.]

[A great number of Constellations are unleashing their Status towards
<Kim Dokja's Company>!]

Of course, it wasn't as if every Constellation out there became their allies.
The absolute majority of <Star Stream> still remained as their enemies, and
those Constellations who chose to help were minuscule in number.

Even then, the Companions got this far safely. Although deep scars
remained in various parts of their bodies, not a single one was lost along the
way.

This was only because no one got greedy and the end goal was the same for
everyone.

Han Sooyoung looked at Lee Hyunsung the last.

The burly man's back was carrying the pale-faced Kim Dokja. More
specifically, not Kim Dokja but an Avatar he left behind. She looked at him
and spoke. "Help us, Kim Dokja."

However, this man was also definitely Kim Dokja. Just like how the 1863rd
turn's Han Sooyoung was definitely 'Han Sooyoung'.
"The other me might not want this to happen. This story… it has ended
back then…"

Kim Dokja stammered. He had come to accept that he was Kim Dokja's
Avatar by now. Han Sooyoung quietly stared at him, before saying this.

"Why don't we ask that after meeting the other you?"

That brought a sad little smile on Kim Dokja's lips. He looked at Han
Sooyoung, then looked at the faces of the companions one by one.

"If this is… the story you wanted…"

His pale hand then touched the [Final Wall].

The last fragment of the Final Wall was [The Fourth Wall]. And as he was
Kim Dokja's Avatar, he too held a part of that key.

Tsu-chuchuchuchu…!

As if this world wasn't acknowledging his existence, Kim Dokja's body
began shaking unsteadily.

And soon after that, a portion of the wall opened up along with loud
splitting noises. Kim Dokja shaking around as if he was getting
electrocuted blacked out instantly. Lee Hyunsung continued to carry him on
the back.

Yoo Joonghyuk dusting the blade of his Black Heavenly Demon Sword
spoke up. "Forward, at top speed."

Along with his signal, the companions began running forward.

"Everyone, stay strong! Only a little bit more to go!"

"We still have enough Life and Death Pills left, so even if you're only
slightly injured, please tell me right away!"
The voices of the companions were encouraging each other. Han Sooyoung
ran while listening to them. A bright-white field of snow stretched before
her eyes. Letters piling up like snow could be seen here and there on this
field. She stepped on those letters and leapt up.

Did the 1863rd turn's her write this story in the revised version?

Did she think about Kim Dokja's story, and the epilogue to come after?

…She couldn't tell.

No matter what she tried, she simply couldn't remember that portion.

It was then, something fell and settled on her eyelashes. She reflexively
wiped it away, only for snowflake-like things to stain her hand.

⸢…This girl, you told me that you were a penniless book lover, didn't you?⸥

The white snowflakes of letters were scattering in the air. Sentences that
definitely existed there, but couldn't be seen because how pure-white their
colour was.

⸢Han Sooyoung.⸥

Han Sooyoung dazedly stared at that 'sentence' falling into her hand.

⸢Your story, it…⸥

This was Kim Dokja's sentence. Not just anyone, but Kim Dokja himself
had written this earnest impression. She gripped the sentence tightly. Just
like the starlight being pushed away by the breaking of dawn, the sentences
crumbled away within her hand.

⸢Don't worry. I will read it. Even if it's over 3000 chapters.⸥

These sentences, they were something she so desperately wanted to have.
Unfortunately, they weren't hers.
Memories were rushing in. Emotions that her other self had experienced.

Han Sooyoung could vividly feel them even now. The resentment that
didn't know which way to go was spreading within her mind.

⸢Beyond this field of snow was where Kim Dokja could be found.⸥

Kim Dokja, who made Kim Dokja who he was. Kim Dokja, who
remembered the 'Ways of Survival'. Kim Dokja, who chose the memories
of the book he had written over the memories of happier days…

"Goddammit… goddammit!!"

The novel that was written by her, who was also not her. That very novel
saved Kim Dokja, and also at the same time, it doomed him. And she now
needed to take responsibility for the conclusion to the tragedy her other self
had created.

It was around then that a faint flicker of light revealed itself from afar.

Ku-gugugugu…

She saw something busy rushing forward beyond this vast field of snow.
The companions looked at each other all at once. Not a single person here
didn't know what that thing was.

⸢It was the subway.⸥

"Chimera Dragon!"

The Chimera Dragon loudly howled out as it got summoned, and took flight
after the companions got on its back. The creature scythed through the air
and reached the rear of the subway in an instant. Only a little bit remained
now. As long as they could bridge this gap, they…!

[Gyahhhhhhh!]
Suddenly, the Chimera Dragon screamed and lost its balance. The stunned
Shin Yoosung quickly took a look behind only to discover some 'things'
were biting onto the Dragon's tail.

【Grrrrrr…!】

Large wild dogs resembling pitch-black shadows began biting into the
Dragon's tail and its wings. These creatures were appearing from a portal
opening up in the air. The Chimera Dragon's torn-off flesh got scattered
away within the white snowfield.

"Hounds Chasing After the Abyss??"

They had seen these creatures before. These hounds from another
dimension attacked the 'Secretive Plotter' and the characters from the 999th
turn. They were terrifying monsters that supposedly hunted down the
wanderers of the world-lines that violated the Probability.

But, why were these hounds attacking them now?

Yoo Joonghyuk gasped and spoke. "…It seems that they judged the 'Group
Regression' to be a danger to the world-line."

"Goddammit…"

The number of the hounds rushing outside the portal increased
exponentially.

They even saw hounds with massive physiques, too. This level of attacking
force was truly unprecedented. And accompanied by the loud howl that
reverberated throughout the snowfield, the hounds kicked the air and
pounced on them simultaneously.

The moment the black clouds of hounds landed on the companions…

The heavens seemed to shatter along with the loud "RUMBLE!!"
The golden-coloured lightning crashed down and hounds were viciously
cast away. Yoo Sangah was the first to figure out who was behind the
attack.

"Great Sage!"

The golden rims were glowing gloriously. The master of the Ruyi Jingu
Bang was grinning confidently. [Leave this to me.]

[Constellation, 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband', is unleashing his Status!]

It wasn't just the Great Sage alone.

Some had followed the companions into the passageway of the [Final Wall]
left wide open.

[This is my opportunity to show everyone what will happen if this great one
uses both of his hands!]

[Constellation, 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon', has removed all the seals on
himself!]

The noble flames of an Archangel were added to the mix and burned away
at the hounds. [I may not be as strong as the 999th turn's me, but… there's
no problem buying you more time.]

[Constellation, 'Demon-like Judge of Fire', is rousing up the flames of hell!]

The flames of [Hellfire] brilliantly danced upwards as pure-white wings
spread out. With a faint smile, Uriel spoke. [I'll leave Kim Dokja in your
hands, Heewon-ah.]

Using that fleeting opening the Constellations had created, the Chimera
Dragon finally managed to bite onto the rear of the subway. However, the
vehicle's hardy exterior didn't break even when the Dragon's fangs clamped
down on it.

"Master! With me!"
Lee Jihye holding swords in both of her hands kicked off the Dragon's back
and leapt up.

Two swords were held in her grip – the [Twin Dragon Sword] of the
Maritime War God, and the [Invincible Warrior's Sword] from Goryeo's
First Sword.

[Constellation, 'Goryeo's First Swordsman', is bestowing his blessing!]

[Constellation, 'Maritime War God', is cheering on his Incarnation!]

The Fourth Law.

Fourth Sword that Beheads the Emptiness.

It was the skill Cheok Jungyeong used while fighting against the
'Indescribable Distance'. Although still incomplete, Lee Jihye could use this
sword strike to some degree now. This miracle only came about due to the
hellish training she went through in the 'Isle of Reincarnators' as well as her
stunning innate talent.

Kwa-kwakwakwakwa!

The subway's exterior that withstood a Dragon's fangs began to bend bit by
bit from her continuous sword strikes. Not missing that opening, Yoo
Joonghyuk's [Black Heavenly Demon Sword] also made a move.

The Breaking the Sky Swordsmanship.

Secret Technique: Inner Mystery Transmission.

Shooting Star Slash.

The trajectory of destruction the [Black Heavenly Demon Sword] drew
slammed into the rear of the subway.

Once the choking dust cleared out of their view, a small hole had appeared
on the train's rear.
"It's done! Everyone, get in!"

The companions rapidly infiltrated the subway's interior. More
correctly, with the exception of two people. "Yoo Joonghyuk! Behind
you!!"

【Grrrrrr!!】

The hounds that the Constellations failed to block were flooding in from
behind them. Yoo Joonghyuk unleashed all of his strength as a
Transcendent to face them head-on. He shouted out while smacking the
hounds away with the storm-like barrage of sword strikes. "Go on ahead! I
shall catch up to you soon!" Han Sooyoung bit her lip.
It wasn't just anyone but Yoo Joonghyuk, the strongest among their group.
As he was a man who could fight evenly against a Myth-grade
Constellation, he wouldn't get done in by the hounds of the abyss that
easily.

"…Don't get killed, okay?"

Han Sooyoung left those words behind and hurriedly entered the subway's
interior. It was as exactly the same as the interior of the third line train they
all remembered.

⸢It was none other than that very same train, where they left Kim Dokja
behind.⸥
Han Sooyoung quickly checked for the train cabin's information. Along
with the 'Tsu-chuchut' noise, the cabin's number floated up.

She reflexively shouted out. "Kim Dokja is in the cabin number 3807!
Everyone, get to the front!"

This was a similar situation to back when they earned the Giant Story,
'Demon Realm's Spring'. It seemed that the rest of the companions also
realized this.

"This does resemble that time when we fought against Surya. I shall pry
open the door in front of us!" Lee Hyunsung quickly rushed forward, and
while expanding every muscle on his body, he let out a mighty shout.
"Haaaaaaahp!"

The [Great Mountain Push] that had exceeded the skill proficiency was
activated, and the thick subway's door creaked loudly while being pushed
open.

[Giant Story, 'Demon Realm's Spring', has begun its storytelling!]

['Stage Transformation' has been triggered!]
This Giant Story could only be completed because everyone worked
together. And the blessing of this Story was now aiding them.

When Lee Hyunsung couldn't open a door, Yoo Sangah found the button to
operate it, and when a door even she couldn't do anything about appeared,
Lee Gilyoung summoned his insects and wore out the internal parts to make
way.

And so, they continued to open one, open two, and then, opened yet another
door. As the number of doors they managed to open grew higher, the
expressions of the companions were gradually getting heated up, too.

⸢Kim Dokja was definitely beyond there.⸥

Everyone in the group could feel it. The pitch-black door before them, it
had to be the [Final Door].

"…Urgh. It's impossible with my Stigma."

Unfortunately, this door didn't want to open unlike before.

"I can't find the button, either."

"Even the bugs say they can't figure out its structure."

"Should I use my skill to break it?"

They resorted to Lee Jihye's sword strikes as well as Lee Hyunsung's [Great
Mountain Destruction], but the door didn't budge an inch. The companions
could only look at each other. How come only this door refused to open up?

It was then that Yoo Sangah opened her mouth. "Everyone, wait. I think
this door is the same as the one Yoo Joonghyuk-ssi broke back in the past."

"Yoo Joonghyuk did that?"

"Yes. Back in the third regression turn, Joonghyuk-ssi broke this door and
entered…"
Han Sooyoung reflexively looked behind her. But Yoo Joonghyuk didn't
come with them. He was probably still fighting against the 'Hounds
Chasing After the Abyss' even now at the rear of the train.

It was right then that Shin Yoosung cried out. "Hounds are here!"

Even before they had realized it, the hounds were already trying to sneak in
through the gaps they had destroyed.

Han Sooyoung's mind began racing. What happened to Yoo Joonghyuk?
Could it be that he got…?

"Block the rear!"

"Eonni! Hurry up!"

There was no more time to think. Lee Hyunsung ran forward like a true
tanker, and started enduring against the hounds' fangs by entering [Steel
Transformation], while Lee Jihye and Jung Heewon unsheathed their
swords to smack away the creatures.

Jang Hayoung shouted out. "Han Sooyoung! Do something!"

Han Sooyoung approached the black door. When she placed her hand on it,
faint sparks began exploding. She slowly closed her eyes.

All of the sentences were, in actual reality, written by her hands. Even if
that was the 'other Han Sooyoung', that version was still undoubtedly Han
Sooyoung. So, this hand should be able to open this door, too.

Tsu-chuchuchuchuchu-!

As if she was now re-writing the sentences, Han Sooyoung started messing
with the wall's Story.

⸢"I'm Yoo Joonghyuk."⸥
The regressor Yoo Joonghyuk was her creation. That was why she should
be able to open this door, as well.

⸢Unfortunately, Han Sooyoung didn't know.⸥

Tsu-chuchuchut!

⸢A story that had already left the author's hands was no longer under its
creator's control.⸥
The universe of the 'Ways of Survival' flooded into Han Sooyoung's head.
The things she did write, and those she didn't. Stories that she imagined and
those she couldn't even have, crashed and churned in opposite directions
inside her mind all at the same time.

"Keuk…!"

Blood trickled out from her eyes and mouth. The blood flow reversed,
causing her blood to pour out onto the subway's floor.

As her vision was dyed in crimson, Han Sooyoung turned to look back at
her companions. They were gradually spreading apart while fighting. And
their running footsteps imprinted on the subway's corridor remained there
like Stories.

[You don't have the 'Overwrite' authority!]

⸢An already-completed world was right before her eyes.⸥

The voices of her companions calling out to her seemed so distant.

⸢The world where the result devours the cause, and the cause devours the
result. The world where all possibilities exist, and the individual possibility
supports and maintains each other. A perfect, immortal epic where a story
manufactures a story all on its own.⸥
She looked back, and the space before her began distorting along with a
shower of sparks. The subway's four-sided door slowly started spinning and
drew a circle. The door, now spinning viciously, became a pitch-black
circle.

A perfect, complete circle that didn't permit any and all types of external
intrusions.

She tottered and reached out to this circle, but Han Sooyoung couldn't even
touch it. This circle now resembled a single full stop. A full stop
announcing that the story was truly complete, just like this.

⸢t l s 1 2 3⸥
And this full stop was now addressing her.

⸢Y o u ca nn ot cha nge th is sto ry⸥
 Chapter 538: Epilogue 4 - The Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint,
                              III


The sentence floated up to the air. When she heard the voice that utterly
ignored spelling rules or word spacing, Han Sooyoung grew deeply
flustered.

"Y-you are…?"

She did hear some things about this voice from Kim Dokja in the past.

– Right, that guy can also speak.

– … A skill can talk??

– Well, I admit it kinda talks in a funny way, but you can still more or
lessunderstand it.

She had no idea that one day she'd get to hear that voice herself.

"The Fourth Wall??"
When called out, the spinning circle began to cackle.

⸢Y o u lot ca nn ot pa ss he re the great one do es n't wa nt it⸥

…'The great one'?

She had heard of that title somewhere before.

Tsu-chuchuchuchuchut!

The Probability's sparks wildly exploded and the companions all screamed
out. The vicious storm of aftermath even managed to blow away the
'Hounds Chasing After the Abyss' outside the subway.

['The Final Wall' is not permitting your group's entry.]

[Your group does not have the qualifications to meet the 'Oldest Dream'.]

The pain akin to their bodies being shredded apart into tiny bits slammed
into them. This was no doubt a ploy to push the companions outside the
subway.

⸢T his is t h e fi nal stop⸥

One of Han Sooyoung's knees was bent in an abnormal direction. However,
she didn't even scream once and simply glared at the pitch-black circle right
before her eyes.

"I'll decide when and where I get off."

⸢The 1865th turn's Han Sooyoung didn't select the 'Abyssal Black Flame
Dragon'.⸥

An unbelievable level of forceful aura flooded out from her entire figure.

⸢Han Sooyoung became a Constellation on her own.⸥

[Constellation, 'Architect of the False Last Act', is revealing her Status!]
It was the same Modifier that the 1863rd turn's Han Sooyoung had
acquired.

She unleashed every bit of Story she had been saving up until now.

Brilliantly-pure blue rays of light swirled violently from one of her irises.

[Exclusive skill, 'Eye of Truth', has been activated!]

Back during the 1863rd turn, this skill failed to penetrate past that wall.
However, Han Sooyoung of this regression turn was a different being
altogether.

[Story, 'Revision Specialist', has begun its storytelling!]

In this turn, she had been diligently acquiring a lot more Stories related to
'writing' than before.

Tsu-chuchuchuchu…!

Just like how the foundations of other characters were a collection of
sentences, it should be the same story for [The Fourth Wall], as well. As
long as this world was a novel, this wall must've been made up of words
and sentences.

Even if she failed to decipher its foundation, there should still be sentences
left behind somewhere that helped her make a guess.

[The Fourth Wall] cottoned on to what Han Sooyoung was planning to do
and ballooned up its overall thickness.

⸢U s e le ss⸥

['The Fourth Wall' is increasing its thickness even more!]

The spinning black circle grew even more robust.
The Fourth Wall. The mind defense skill that couldn't be penetrated by the
existences found within the 'Ways of Survival'.

Han Sooyoung didn't try to forcibly penetrate the wall. Instead, she quietly
stared at it.

[Story, 'Guide of the Line Spacing', has begun its storytelling!]

⸢Some things would grow even more obvious the more you try to hide
them.⸥

Han Sooyoung scanned the outer appearance of the wall. There were plenty
of scratches and cracks visible on it. Its past history of not sparing itself
when trying to protect Kim Dokja was left behind as fully-visible traces all
over the wall.

⸢That great one must be protected.⸥

Why did this wall hide that sentence in the most secretive place of all?

⸢That is the last favour the god asked of me.⸥

In that very moment, Han Sooyoung's lips began trembling.

As pulsing migraine assaulted her, sentences above the wall flashed past her
brain.

⸢"Hey."

"Yes?"

"If, by chance, something happens to me, then you…"

"Please don't say things like that."

"If you really see me as your 'god', then…"⸥
A middle-aged man wearing a fedora was looking up at her with a
committed, loyal look on his face.

⸢"Protect that guy, no matter what."⸥

The existence that knew the 'Ways of Survival' just as well as the original
author, herself.

The existence that remained even more indifferent to the tragedies of this
world than her, and…

And, the existence that lived for the sole purpose of 'completing the story'.

⸢The existence that opened the 'scenario' in this world, and the one who
connected the two world-lines as one.⸥
[The Fourth Wall] spoke up instead of Han Sooyoung's trembling lips.

⸢D on t be so su rpri sed ev en I rea lis ed it ju st now⸥

"What did you say?"

⸢I al so di dn't kn ow who I w as⸥

There were some existences without a fleshed-out past that had to simply
'exist' until belatedly, they were permitted to acquire their histories. Beings
that didn't 'exist' until the author decided to give them a backstory.

⸢I be ca me com ple te be cau se of y o u⸥

The scenes from the moments when the 'paid service' got underway brushed
past her mind. The moment when the two world-lines of reality and fiction
became one, and the 1863rd turn's Dokkaebi King standing right in the
middle.

⸢W h y I ha d to bec ome a w a l l di vid ing the wo rld⸥
The Dokkaebi King became the wall that divided the world.

⸢W h y I ha d to pro tec t Kim Dok ja⸥

And then, it carried out the last favour its 'god' had asked of it.

⸢Y o u di dn't re mem ber m e⸥

The existence that repeated one single story for a long, long time, and the
one who became addicted to that story, constantly lusting after it.

The existence that had read the 'Ways of Survival' even before Kim Dokja
did, was right before her eyes.

This world's most ancient reader.

⸢I too di dn't re mem ber y o u⸥

The Dokkaebi King filled the void left behind by Han Sooyoung and
became this world's chronicler.

⸢T hi s st ory is n o w mine⸥

And eventually, it succeeded in completing the story.

"It was I who asked you in the first place. So, stop this right now."

The existence that continued to uphold an order for a very long time had
eventually become the order itself.

⸢Y o u are not my g o d any mo re⸥

She who had lost her position as the original author was no longer the
creator, as well.
Han Sooyoung stared at her own fingertips. The 'Ways of Survival' her
other self had written went on to become a novel spanning 3149 chapters.
That novel left her hands and reached its reader.

"You're right, this world's god is no longer me, but the reader."

That would be Kim Dokja beyond this spinning circle, slumbering and
dreaming away in eternity.

"So, let's ask that god, then. Let's ask if he really wishes to remain in this
place, or…!"

Han Sooyoung swallowed a Life and Death Pill and righted her broken
knee. And then, she walked forward step by step before extending her
hands.

"…Or, if he wants to get out of here with us."

Blinding sparks of flames exploded on the tips of her hands.

As if to reject her approach, the spinning circle's speed grew faster and
faster. Blood splattered from both of her hands. Not even Stories could
protect her. However, even while suffering from the cruel pain akin to her
hands being grounded into fine dust, Han Sooyoung didn't stop.

"Kim Dokja! Say something!"

There were some people who, despite wishing to be saved, couldn't bring
themselves to ask others to save them.

Han Sooyoung always wanted to write certain sentences for people like
that. To write sentences for those people who couldn't say or write
anything.

Just like how it always had been for her, all she could do was to write
'sentences'.

But, as long as she could cross over to the other side of this circle…
As long as she could get rid of this full stop, then…

⸢The idiot that unquestioningly took the lemon candy offered as a joke and
sucked on it.⸥
"Kim Dokja!"

Unfortunately, it wasn't enough.

She couldn't reach the other side of the wall with only the sentences she
possessed.

It was then, yet another hand was laid on top of Han Sooyoung's.

It was Yoo Sangah.

Mandalas were unfurled on both sides of her as she began loading her
Story. While wiping away the blood trickling down her nose, she smiled
weakly.

"Dokja-ssi."

⸢The man who hid in the cabinet alone to read the 'Ways of Survival'.⸥

Yoo Sangah's sentences were now calling out to Kim Dokja.

As if they were grabbing at a door knob, their hands reached out and
grabbed the spinning circle. However, the circle's speed didn't decrease in
the slightest. They were still short on the sentences. But then, hands from
two more people were laid on top of the two women's.

"I shall hold onto the inside!"

"I'm on the left!"

Jung Heewon and Lee Hyunsung letting out a loud, spirited yell began
clinging onto the circle as well.
⸢The man who silently listened to the boring stories from the military.⸥

Lee Hyunsung yelling out unleashed his Story, and Jung Heewon next to
him matched his timing.

⸢Stinking stubborn mull of a damned troublemaker.⸥

"Dokja-ssi! Answer us! You can hear us, right??"

And now, Lee Seolhwa and Gong Pildu added their hands next.

⸢The man who searched for medicinal herbs throughout the night for the
sake of his companions.⸥

⸢The bastard who stole all of my lands.⸥

"Ahjussi!"

"Hyung!"

The two kids also rushed in. The small hands of Shin Yoosung and Lee
Gilyoung were placed on Han Sooyoung's one at a time.

⸢The man who always lied to reassure someone else.⸥

⸢However, the man who wasn't very good at lying.⸥

Right behind them was Lee Jihye wielding her sword. She used her fists to
slam into the circle. She hit it, then hit it again and again.

"I can't say something that cringy, anyway! So, just come out already!!"

⸢Squid ahjussi.⸥

Different memories of everyone from different time and place – all those
sentences of every single moment gathered together and wished for one
Kim Dokja.
However, the full stop still didn't want to budge even after the companions
called out. No, only their hands ended up as a bloody mess.

Their Stories were being extinguished now. And then, a sentence floated up
above the full stop.

⸢Maybe it's just our greed, wanting to save him?⸥

"Shut up!"

⸢Maybe, he's not an existence needing to be saved?⸥

The companions also knew it – knew that this action of theirs could be a
meaningless one.

That was why they wanted to know.

To ask.

To reach out, and confirm.

"Kim Dokja! I know you're in there!" Jang Hayoung shouted out. "We
talked about this, didn't we?! Even if we can't reach each other, even if we
can't meet, we gotta keep pounding on the wall until the end, right?? Even
if the wall would never open up, we agreed to keep writing something on it,
didn't we?!"

Even if we can't reach each other, even if we can't meet each other, we
should continue to pound away on each other's walls.

Even if that wall would never open up, keep writing something on that wall,
anyway.

"When we do that, then maybe, someone might end up seeing our words
someday…!"

Then maybe, just maybe, you might finally want to come out of that place.
"Please! Say something! Anything! Please-!"

And so, Jang Hayoung's palm slammed into the full stop. And in the very
next moment…

['Wall of Impossible Communication' is revealing its power!]

The full stop began to shake little by little. For the first time ever, [The
Fourth Wall]'s aura changed.

⸢Y o u da re⸥

Yoo Sangah didn't miss this opening and shouted out. "Dokja-ssi! We
promised to meet during the next life, didn't we?!"

['Wall That Decides Samsara' is revealing its capability!]

Lee Gilyoung also shouted out as if he didn't want to lose. "Hyung, you
always think you are at fault for everything!"

Jung Heewon carried on where the boy's words ended. "I don't care whether
you're good or evil, Dokja-ssi! I don't plan on judging you according to the
standards of this world. That's why…!"

['Wall That Divides Good and Evil' is revealing its theme!]

"…So, please open this door!"

Right next moment, a powerful rebound coming out from the door blew
away the companions.

The cacophony of loud exploding noises utterly deafened them. Once the
ringing in their ears went away, only the cold silence remained in the
surroundings.

The injured companions got up one by one. Before Lee Hyunsung could
say something, though, Han Sooyoung hurriedly placed a finger on her lips.
Just like the way faint, soft drizzle moistened the parched ground, a quiet
little noise could be heard.

Knock.

That noise, it was coming from beyond the full stop.

A place beyond the completion of the story.

Han Sooyoung was the first to hear that sound.

Knock, knock…

The sound so small and so weak, yet still undoubtedly letting others know
of his presence there. ⸢There he was.⸥

Shin Yoosung broke down in tears.

⸢Someone was knocking on the door from beyond it.⸥

Han Sooyoung rushed forward, followed right after by Yoo Sangah. Lee
Hyunsung and Jung Heewon laid their hands on top of the two women's,
again. Lee Seolhwa quickly healed the companions' wounded hands, while
Gong Pildu threw his own weight behind them. To fight against the
rebound,
Lee Jihye stabbed her sword on the floor, while Jang Hayoung supported
Han Sooyoung's body. Stories from Shin Yoosung and Lee Gilyoung then
began protecting Han Sooyoung's hands.

"Focus all of your powers in one spot!"

Along with the loud 'Kwa-gagagagak!' noise, their hands were grounded to
bloody dust again.

The full stop's spinning speed was slowing down. Bit by agonising bit, the
worn-down surface of the full stop began developing cracks.
⸢Their Story was not enough.⸥

The full stop's size was gradually shrinking down. It continued to get
smaller, as if to never permit their entry in this place. It was then, some
people suddenly intruded into the subway.

[Constellation, 'Queen of the Darkest Spring', is incarnating!]

They were two members of <Kim Dokja's Company> who had not revealed
themselves up until now.

[My apologies for showing up late.]

One of them was the queen of the Underworld, Persephone. And the other
was…

"…Dokja-yah."

Rather than looking at the full stop, Lee Sookyung was now looking at at
the other Kim Dokja plopped down on the floor. He looked back at her in a
daze, but then, bit down hard on his lip and grabbed onto her hand.

Stories then began flooding out from both Lee Sookyung and Persephone.

Two Kim Dokjas existed for them.

⸢Kim Dokja before the start of the scenario, and Kim Dokja after the
scenario got underway.⸥
Two beings that had observed 'Kim Dokja' longer than anyone else
supported his Avatar and approached the full stop. Han Sooyoung nodded
her head.

⸢The one who imprisoned Kim Dokja inside the wall was himself.⸥

"Kim Dokja."
Han Sooyoung realized something as she witnessed his eyelashes tremble
weakly. No matter how deeply her novel had influenced Kim Dokja, he was
not the 'Ways of Survival'. No matter how well she understood the 'Ways of
Survival', it didn't automatically mean she understood Kim Dokja.

She might be able to write sentences for someone else, but she certainly
couldn't read those words in their stead. No, the role of reading was left up
to the god of the new world, the reader.

"…Help us."

Kim Dokja's hand touched the full stop.

Tsu-chuchuchuchu…!

['The Fourth Wall' is increasing its thickness even more!]

Hands were laid on top of hands. [The Fourth Wall] was shouting out at
them.

⸢Y o u lot mu st fa il h ere⸥

⸢T hi s sto ry h as b een com ple ted th is way al rea dy⸥

Was it forbidden to change a complete story?

Was it forbidden for a single universe to even dare think about being saved
just because the rest of the universes were completed in unhappiness?

Han Sooyoung wrapped Kim Dokja's hand laid on top of hers tightly and
began crying. The memories from the 1863rd turn were going on a
rampage.

⸢This story will cycle itself.⸥

Yet another Han Sooyoung would repeat the 1863rd turn inside this cycle.
Kim Dokja and Han Sooyoung wouldn't recognise each other and start
fighting again.

Yoo Joonghyuk would continue with his regressions.

And to save them all, Kim Dokja would become the 'Oldest Dream' many,
many times.

The vast, indescribable time would cycle over and over again, leading them
to reach and meet one another, only to part ways again.

Enduring the innumerable lengths of time to meet, then meet again, and
create stories.

And with that, this story might become truly complete.

However, if that was the case, just when would they ever be able to taste
happiness?

⸢It's fine if the story is imperfect.⸥

Han Sooyoung's hands powerfully gripped onto the circle's crack.

The surface of the gripped wall began tearing apart.

⸢If that story can make someone happy, then…⸥

The companions' stories crumbled as an incredible storm exploded. Kim
Dokja's coat was ripped apart, and their weapons shattered to bits and
pieces. The blindingly-pure rays of light blanketed their view. Within this
incredible explosion of light, Han Sooyoung thought to herself. [The Fourth
Wall] was right, the 'Ways of Survival' was indeed now over. With his own
hands, he brought it to its conclusion.

However, that didn't mean Kim Dokja's story had come to an end there,
either.

Ku-gugugugu…
Eventually, the storm died down, revealing the messed-up hands of the
companions. Hands, laid on top of each other as if they had fused into one.
And these hands had destroyed the 'completed' full stop. The crack ran
down on the circle's edge like a tear.

⸢It now resembled a comma.⸥

The door was open.
 Chapter 539: Epilogue 4 - The Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint,
                              IV


An explosion rang out on the field of snow.

Yoo Joonghyuk swung the [Black Heavenly Demon Sword] and smacked
away the 'Hounds Chasing After the Abyss', before climbing on the roof of
the subway train.

That explosion just now, it sounded suspicious. Did something happen
inside the train?

[Dammit! There are just too many!]

The Abyssal Black Flame Dragon fighting off the Hounds blew his top in
anger. There didn't seem to be an end to these black hounds rushing in at
them from all sides.

The Great Sage continuously throwing down lightning bolts to scorch the
hounds could only mutter on in an exhausted voice. […I don't want to
admit this, but I'm still ways off from comparing against the people from
999th turn.]

Yet another explosion noise went off from inside the subway. Yoo
Joonghyuk reflexively turned his head in that direction. What could those
be? From the front car of the train, bits and pieces of what resembled
Stories began leaking out.

It was also right then that some things were spat out of the hole on the train
along with the loud 'Ku-gugugu!' noise.

Uriel freaked out and shouted at him. [Yoo Joonghyuk! Dodge it!]

Right next second, hounds being ejected from the train blanketed Yoo
Joonghyuk like a black cloud.




Pah-susu…

Black bits scattered about. With the comma-shaped hole as the center, the
door before their eyes was disappearing.

Han Sooyoung pushed herself off the floor and looked to the front. Letters
were strewn about near the cabin door leading to the 3807 train car.

⸢I also⸥

⸢With you all⸥

The moment she saw those words that couldn't yet become sentences, Han
Sooyoung realized just what knocked on the door from the other side. They
were Stories – very small fragments of Kim Dokja. Her eyes chased after
the line of fallen fragments. The closer she got to the center of the cabin,
the greater the number of Story fragments fallen on the floor.
⸢Kim Dokja was there.⸥

Kim Dokja's body, now as small as a young child, was floating up in the
middle of the cabin. His eyes were closed, and he seemed unconscious.
Rays of entrancing light were being emitted by his figure that continued to
shed blinding Story fragments. These fragments went through the subway's
windows and drifted off to the destination unknown.

"Ah…?"

Kim Dokja's Avatar next to Han Sooyoung gasped out. His eyes were
trembling as if he was shocked. Then, he began approaching the young Kim
Dokja.

"Ah… Ah, I'm…"

The moment he said that, a powerful suction force began pulling him in.
Some kind of power was summoning him back. The Avatar's body began
breaking down bit by bit. Those broken bits were then sucked into the main
body.

His gaze looking back met Han Sooyoung's. She reached out unbeknownst
even to herself.

"Grab him!"

However, her hand couldn't touch him. The rate of the Avatar breaking
down and getting sucked in grew faster. The bits of fragments from the
Avatar brushed past her hand – some words were caught in Han Sooyoung's
fingers.

⸢I'm sorry⸥

Just what was he sorry about? Kim Dokja's Avatar scattering away like an
apparition emitted bright light as he got sucked into the main body.
However, despite it absorbing all of the Avatar's Stories, Kim Dokja's body
didn't grow back up again. No, the amount of Stories flooding out from him
increased, instead.

"Kim Dokja!!"

Han Sooyoung instinctively realized it. They needed to stop that.
Otherwise, they would lose him forever.

Her muscles tightly wound up released like a spring. And so, just as Han
Sooyoung tried to approach Kim Dokja floating in the air… Kwa-
aaaaaaah!

⸢Y o u c ant go fu rth er⸥

Accompanied by a loud explosion noise, powerful gusts of wind suddenly
blew in and something exploded out from Kim Dokja's body. His Stories
were overflowing wildly. Sentences flooding out like black tides blanketed
the entirety of the cabin and swallowed Han Sooyoung up.

"Everyone, be careful!"

She was forced back mercilessly along with sensations of her skin being
swept away. Kim Dokja was getting further away. She urgently looked
around, but there was not a thing she could grab onto. Even though she
unleashed the Status of a Constellation and borrowed the powers of Giant
Stories, she had no method to defend against this surging torrent.

"Kim Dokja! Sto…!"

Sentences escaping from Kim Dokja's body scratched past her entire figure.
Sentences a man used to endure his life – the despair created by one
person's life. The tidal waves of letters completely blanketing every
direction resembled the darkest of the darkest night.

The 'Kim Dokja' she understood was merely just the tip of an iceberg. Han
Sooyoung was overwhelmed in an instant and was helplessly shoved back,
unable to say anything.
It was Yoo Sangah who supported her back, though. "Get yourself

together!" Kim Dokja's figure could be spied among the gaps of the letters.

Lee Jihye shouted out. "…He's a kid?! Why did ahjussi become like that?!"
"Hyung!"

"Everyone, gather around!"

To fight against the tidal wave, the companions hurdled together.
Unfortunately, even that was not enough. They were kept pushed back
again and again. At this rate, not only would they be forced outside the
cabin, but get ejected from the train itself sooner rather than later.

It was then, someone spread open his entire figure and stood to block the
exit.

"Hu-aaaaahp! I shall support you all!"

It was Lee Hyunsung.

Accompanied by "Kwa-dududuk!" noise, he activated the [Steel
Transformation]. His arms and legs assimilated with the metal of the exit
and caught the companions like a net. With a pained face, Lee Hyunsung
watched Kim Dokja's Story brushing past his body.

⸢To Lee Hyunsung, Kim Dokja was too difficult.⸥

The act of understanding someone started off with admitting that you didn't
know anything about that person. Lee Hyunsung bit down on his lip hard
enough to draw blood and shouted out. "I can only hold on for a little
while! Hurry!"

Gong Pildu quickly summoned his Armed Fortress and supported Lee
Hyunsung from behind. He then shouted out. "If I help, we can endure for
a bit longer! So, hurry up and rescue that fool!" The companions looked at
each other.
"Hold each other's hands, everyone!" Jung Heewon grabbed onto Lee
Hyunsung with one hand, and extended the other. "Unleash your Stories all
at once!"

That outstretched hand was held by Lee Seolhwa, then Shin Yoosung and
Lee Gilyoung held on to her other hand. The hands of two children were
then connected to Lee Jihye. Persephone, as well as Lee Sookyung,
followed them right after.

"Kim Dokja! Wake up!!"

Jang Hayoung grabbed Lee Sookyung's hand and cried out, while Yoo
Sangah caught her extended hand next.

"Sooyoung-ssi!"

The last person to grab the outstretched hand was Han Sooyoung.

"…I got you."

[Giant Story, 'One Who Rebels Against Fate', is continuing on with its
storytelling!]

The Giant Story that connected the companions as one began resisting
against the vicious storm.

Like a buoy in the stormy sea, Han Sooyoung's body helplessly rocked
from side to side. She could hold on only because of her companions
behind her.

The companions tightly held each other's hands within the crashing waves
of the letters, as if they were trying to save a drowning man.

Jung Heewon shouted towards Kim Dokja, ever so faintly visible to her.
"Dokja-ssi! We're here! Just hold on for a little bit longer!"
The companions holding onto each other's hands were like sturdy sentences
connected as one. Han Sooyoung felt the warmth transmitted in her hand
and gradually realized something.

Words existed to describe the depths of the darkness. And to console such
darkness, the thing called 'story' was created.

"Kim Dokja!"

The tightly-held hands, supported by the sentences shoring up other
sentences. While entrusting herself to that hand, Han Sooyoung approached
Kim Dokja one step at a time. Only his face could barely be seen as the rest
was covered by the darkness of the letters.

⸢Wh at y o u are do ing is me aning l ess⸥

The waves grew more and more vicious as [The Fourth Wall]'s voice
resounded out.

⸢Th ere is o n e Kim Dok ja⸥

Han Sooyoung knew the reason – the reason why that Kim Dokja was
getting smaller. The younger face of him right now resembled the 'Oldest
Dream' they saw some time ago.

He'd lose the memories of the days he spent with his companions, and…

…And, he'd even lose the memories of when he read the 'Ways of
Survival'.

Then, he'd become the purest child after returning to the universe's great
cycle.

Later on, he'd get rescued by the 'Secretive Plotter'.

If that was the case, what would happen to the 'Kim Dokja' they
remembered?
"We've managed to come this far, so this…!!"

Han Sooyoung reached out as pain of her hand burning away assaulted her.

Kim Dokja was right before her eyes.

⸢The one and only reader who could understand this story.⸥

That Kim Dokja was right over there.

There were less than four meters between them, yet to Han Sooyoung, this
distance came across as an infinite margin that nothing could fill. As if an
invisible wall was standing before her and Kim Dokja.

"You son of a bitch! You promised to read my novel, didn't you?!"

She wanted to tell him. Tell him that there was a world that didn't need his
sacrifice to be saved. She thought that, if it was her, she should be able to
do it.

Because she was most proficient at lying than anyone alive, after all.

"What the hell is this 'Ways of Survival', anyway?! I can easily create
dozens, hundreds of worlds of illusions!"

Her shouting voice was gradually losing its strength.

She had written so many sentences until now, yet she was still unable to
save a single person.

Within the world growing dizzier, Kim Dokja's figure was getting blurrier.

What would it have been like if only she was just a little bit stronger?
Maybe, they didn't plan this out properly. Maybe, she should've learned an
even stronger attribute. Maybe, she should've earned a much, much harsher
Story.
She shouldn't have abandoned Kim Dokja from the get-go. She should've
cottoned onto Kim Dokja's plan sooner. No, maybe…

…She shouldn't have written the 'Ways of Survival' in the first place.

She shouldn't have become an author of such a story.

…An author?

Han Sooyoung abruptly raised her head.

⸢Could she do it?⸥

It was uncertain.

⸢No, I can do it.⸥

Someone else was saying that in her stead.

Memories of the 1863rd turn became a Story and began to violently writhe
around. Han Sooyoung looked down at her own fingertips. Her fingers,
scorched black like charcoal.

She was not a protagonist, but a writer.

Han Sooyoung's hand, looking as if gripping a pen, began to slowly move.
They created trajectories in the air; these trajectories went to become letters,
and those letters soon became words.

[Your attribute is being pushed to its absolute limit!]

[Warning! You do not have the authority of 'Overwrite'!]

Han Sooyoung vomited out a mouthful of blood, but didn't stop.

From the very onset, an author really had only one way to reach her reader.
⸢Han Sooyoung imagined. Just like how the other her did once upon a
time.⸥

With the most vigorous, carefully worded sentences, she began drawing out
a man's hands, his arms, and his legs.

An individual created solely for the sake of one reader. An entity tougher in
body and nobler in heart than any creature in this world. The man who
managed to bring down all the stars in the skies to end his truly lengthy
regression turns, and eventually, even succeeding in destroying the system
of the world.

Tsu-chuchuchuchuchu-!!

Every character was, as a matter of fact, an incarnation of the author.

However, that didn't mean the incarnation was the author itself. The
characters that left her hands wouldn't listen to her, after all.

And that was why Han Sooyoung was trying to get the help from the
individual she had created.

[Constellation, 'Architect of the False Last Act', is unleashing all of her
Stories!]

[Your new Stigma is blooming!]

That one term that could fill up that empty margin.

Han Sooyoung shouted out as if she was screaming. "Yoo Joonghyuk-!!"

And right next second, the letters before her eyes split apart.

The Breaking the Sky Swordsmanship.

Secret Technique: Inner Mystery Transmission.

Split the Dark Ocean.
A single sword split apart the pitch-black night ocean. The fighting spirit of
a Transcendent bursting out from the entirety of his body illuminated the
darkness of the letters.

[Stigma, 'Character Summon', is activating!]

The individual she had written, but she didn't know of.

[Character, 'Yoo Joonghyuk', is answering the call!]

"Hold on tight."

A man descended with the rays of light. Yoo Joonghyuk's powerful hand
grabbed hers. Han Sooyoung endured against her eyes tearing up and
shouted back at him.

"You hold on tight, instead!"

From Lee Hyunsung to Yoo Joonghyuk, the companions' Story began to
glow brightly.

To get this far, they had lost many things.

"Joonghyuk-ssi! We leave it in your hands!"

"Master! Hurry!"

However, it wasn't as if they had been losing things only.

Yoo Joonghyuk extended his hand out.

The distance of just one person. The distance that couldn't have been
bridged without the presence of just one person was finally being closed in.

Yoo Joonghyuk's hand reached out while breaking past the letters. The
sentences protecting Kim Dokja fell away one by one.
The hand that experienced thousands of regressions tightly grabbed hold
onto Kim Dokja's collars – as if to yank out the oldest memories from
within.

"It's time to go back, Kim Dokja."

Right next second – as if the lights were turned off, the whole world was
suddenly plunged in darkness.
 Chapter 540: Epilogue 4 - The Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint,


                                     V


Within the space of darkness, as if the curtains had come down on the last
act.

Han Sooyoung opened her eyes within this darkness. The [Eye of Truth]
expanded and began emitting faint rays of light, and gradually, she could
see her surroundings better.

…Just what happened?

[You have misaligned and broke the world-line's deciding Probability!]

[Your actions have affected the 'Oldest Dream's' ■■!]

[The 'Oldest Dream's' ■■ is changing!]

Then, indecipherable messages floated up next.
But none of that mattered. What's important was rescuing Kim Dokja.

Han Sooyoung focused her sight to the presence she picked up in front of
her. When she did, something sooty, darkish could be spotted.

"Yoo Joonghyuk, is that you?"

"Yes."

Han Sooyoung felt around like a blind and approached him, only to freak
out and shout loudly. "Hey, you moron! What the hell are you doing,
choking a little kid?!"

"This is not a little kid. It's Kim Dokja."

"It's kid-ified Kim Dokja!"

She hurriedly snatched Kim Dokja away from him and brought her finger
closer to the small nose. She felt a very faint, shallow breathing.

But why was this? Something about his current state felt wrong. Just what
was up with this feeling that he might shatter into pieces at any second…?

"What's wrong with him?"

"His Story has been damaged too extensively. I've already fed him the Life
and Death Pill, but… It's not working."

They needed Lee Seolhwa. However, none of the presences of their
companions could be felt nearby. It seemed that only Yoo Joonghyuk, Kim
Dokja, and herself were trapped within this separate space.

With hostile eyes, Han Sooyoung glared at her surroundings. There was
only one culprit capable of doing something like this.

"The Fourth Wall! Stop this and let us leave!"
Along with 'Tsu-chuchut' noise, a faint, blurry silhouette appeared within
the darkness. A boy Dokkaebi wearing a fedora was standing there. Its face
was filled with indescribable sadness and purity.

Han Sooyoung studied [The Fourth Wall] for a little while, before asking it.
"…Is that your real appearance?"

⸢T hat s ri ght⸥

It no longer resembled the figure she had spied within her memories. Not a
sign of a middle-aged Dokkaebi could be seen on that face. [The Fourth
Wall] addressed her.

⸢A rea lly l o n g ti me ha s pas sed by⸥

Han Sooyoung thought about something. Maybe [The Fourth Wall] was in
the same boat as Kim Dokja. It too could have forgotten everything and
gradually turned into a child while enduring the untold length of time.

While fixing Kim Dokja's clothing, Han Sooyoung asked. "You were
protecting Kim Dokja because of my order, weren't you?"

⸢I th ink I w as⸥

"You gave Kim Dokja the 'Ways of Survival' text files, right? You kept
helping him out afterwards, too."

[The Fourth Wall] didn't reply. No, it just stared at Kim Dokja with vague
eyes of someone digging through very old memories.

Han Sooyoung's voice now took on the subtle hint of anger. "But, why did
you let Kim Dokja end up in this state?"

⸢…⸥

"Say something! What were you even thinking to let…"
⸢You don't know what the reader really wants.⸥

[The Fourth Wall] no longer stammered its words.

⸢You all truly, truly do not know anything.⸥

"…We'll be taking Kim Dokja with us. We can't sit back and watch this guy
live his life as the 'Oldest Dream'."

At her attitude of willing to start a fight, [The Fourth Wall]'s brows
quivered. But rather than Han Sooyoung clenching her fist in nervousness,
Yoo Joonghyuk stepped forward, instead.

"If we take him with us, will the position of the 'Oldest Dream' be left
vacant?"

Han Sooyoung's shoulders flinched.

It wasn't as if she had never thought about that problem.

The problem of 'after Kim Dokja is rescued, who will take over the position
of the Oldest Dream?'

This world was maintained solely because the 'Oldest Dream' dreamed. In a
universe operated only through someone's sacrifice, someone had to
become the existence who dreamed.

Yoo Joonghyuk opened his mouth. "I shall take over."

"What the?! Hey! What bullshit are you spewing now?!"

"I'm trying to say that I will become the new 'Oldest Dream'."

"How can you pull that off when you don't even have an iota of
imagination?! No, let me do it. I can do it so much better than this Kim
Dokja here. That's why…"
Han Sooyoung yapped on and on, even though she didn't really understand
what her mouth was saying. She simply blurted out only with the aim of
stopping this crazy idiot. And fortunately enough, [The Fourth Wall] wasn't
Yoo Joonghyuk's ally in this case, either.

⸢Puppet of the 'Oldest Dream', you can't become the dream. Because you
don't love this story.⸥

"In that case, I must-"

⸢It's the same story for you, Han Sooyoung.⸥

"Then who's going to take over this guy's role? I'm telling you this right
now, but we're definitely taking him with us, you hear? Even if it's you, you
can't stop us."

[The Fourth Wall] stared at Han Sooyoung and Yoo Joonghyuk for a little
while.

⸢Take him.⸥

"What's that?"

⸢You can just take him. Even if you take away 'that Kim Dokja', this
universe won't be destroyed anymore.⸥
As she didn't expect to hear such a reply, Han Sooyoung could only blink
her eyes like an idiot. She glanced to her side, and even Yoo Joonghyuk
was making a similar face.

Just what was the Dokkaebi saying here? She had never thought of such an
ending. Was it really okay to welcome a conclusion of this nature?

…No, that simply wasn't possible.
This <Star Stream> was never considerate towards any of them before, not
even once.

Han Sooyoung's face gradually hardened and she asked back. "Why won't
the universe be destroyed even after we take him away?"

⸢The 'Kim Dokja' you know has scattered to the rest of the universe
already.⸥

"What was that??"

She dazedly stared at Kim Dokja currently embraced in her arms – at his
frail figure, small enough for only one of her arms to wrap around.

It felt like a hammer had struck her on the back of her head. It couldn't be,
the reason why Kim Dokja ended up in this state was…

"You… Just what the hell did you do?"

⸢This wasn't my doing. It's what he himself wanted. After all, he knew your
group would do something like this.⸥
A subtle chill began running down her skin.

In order to save this world, someone must become the 'Oldest Dream'. If
Kim Dokja was saved, then someone else must replace him.

Wouldn't he… Would someone like Kim Dokja really not know that?

⸢You all have done something terribly stupid. The conclusion the reader
wanted was the only conclusion. Why did you try to change it?⸥
The expression of [The Fourth Wall] staring at her gave her the creeps. A
negative emotion that was neither hatred or resentment, not even sadness,
was now directed in her and Yoo Joonghyuk's direction.
⸢You shouldn't have been greedy. No, y o u sh oul d've be en con te nt wi th
49% Kim Dok ja⸥
Along with the voice gradually breaking apart, the surrounding time and
space began to distort.

⸢D id y o u re ally thi nk y o ur gro up w as spe cial? D id yo u hon es tly bel
ieve th at a pro per con clusion wo uld wa it for y o u lot wh en y o u de str

Even before she could reply, the surroundings grew brighter.

⸢Y o u lot ha ve me ss ed up y o ur con clu sion, and y o u wi ll no w be com

…

…

…

When Han Sooyoung opened her eyes again, she found herself standing in
Seoul – Gwanghwamun of the 1865th regression turn. The very location
where her group readied for the scenario. Snow was drifting down on this
landmark that had seen the last conclusion of the scenarios. She quietly
looked up at the snowflakes falling one by one.

She slowly lowered her gaze and saw the small Kim Dokja, still nestled
within her embrace. His breathing remained rhythmic.

"Master!"

Lee Jihye ran towards them from a distance. Even Yoo Sangah and Jung
Heewon urgently running next to her could be seen, too. The rest of the
companions were safe.

"Sooyoung-ssi! What about Dokja-ssi?"
Even before Han Sooyoung could say something, Jang Hayoung quickly
snatched away and hugged Kim Dokja. "Kim Dokja! His hand, it's as cold
as ice! Does anyone have gloves??"

The companions quickly surrounded Kim Dokja. Each of them was drunk
in their own emotions.

Jung Heewon holding onto Kim Dokja's pale smooth cheeks were crying,
while Lee Hyunsung and his bear-like bulk were cautiously wrapping Kim
Dokja's naked feet. Even Yoo Sangah couldn't hold back her tears this time.
Both Shin Yoosung and Lee Gilyoung seemed to be moments away from
passing out, too.

The figure of Gong Pildu sitting on a nearby bench could be seen, busy
puffing away at his cigarette as if such a spectacle was too ridiculous to
even participate.

"…Is Dokja sleeping now?"

Lee Sookyung asked that, and Han Sooyoung nodded as her reply. That
small movement was all she could do after squeezing out every dollop of
her remaining energy.

Companions finally managed to rein in their emotions and began to talk in
turns. The first one to step up while rolling up her sleeves was Jung
Heewon.

"I'm really going to dangle him up this time. Right in front of the Industrial
Complex, no less! I'm not joking here, so all of you, do not try to stop me!"

"Even still, the current Dokja-ssi is a child…"

"By the way, will ahjussi remain in this state forever?"

"Hyung, wake up, please! You're pretending to be asleep because of how
embarrassed you are, right?"

"Did he get younger as a side effect of something?"
Lee Jihye hesitating ever so slightly suddenly shouted out in a bright voice.
"Who cares if he got younger? We can just raise him, right?!"

"Does that mean I can go to the same school as hyung?"

"Hey, you think ahjussi really became a little kid like you?!"

And so, for the next couple of minutes, they bickered and bantered like this.
In the meantime, Lee Seolhwa was checking out Kim Dokja's current
condition throughout his body, but as she did, her expression was slowly
hardening.

"When Dokja ahjussi wakes up, he's going to remember us, right? It won't
be like, he's lost most of his memories or anything?"

⸢Han Sooyoung couldn't say a single thing to such companions.⸥

She kept bobbing her lips up and down many, many times.

It wasn't a certainty yet, they couldn't trust everything that stinking wall
said, that's why they…

"…You two. Why have you been keeping quiet until now?"

Han Sooyoung hurriedly avoided meeting the gaze after hearing Yoo
Sangah's question.

"Sooyoung-ssi?"

Soon afterwards, Yoo Sangah's gaze shifted over to Yoo Joonghyuk. And
then, she got to witness a shocking scene.

"…Yoo Joonghyuk-ssi??"

Yoo Joonghyuk's expression was frozen pale-white. And as if he had lost a
protective wall of his mind, he seemed to be muttering something to
himself, too.

Yoo Sangah had seen such a sight before.
⸢Back in the 73rd Demon Realm, when Kim Dokja ceased to exist
alongside the 'Outer God'.⸥
She quickly brushed past the companions and held Kim Dokja's wrist. It
was so frail that it might break at any second. The pulse itself was faint, too.
However, she wasn't a doctor so this didn't tell her much. She asked Lee
Seolhwa next.

"Seolhwa-ssi, the current Dokja-ssi, what's wro…"

"…His soul has been completely damaged." His soul was damaged.

In that moment, a similar type of shadow was cast over the companions'
complexions. However, that didn't last long. Jung Heewon spoke up first.
"I'm sure there is a way, right? I mean, we cured something like that
before." Indeed, they had experienced a similar event to this in the past.

The damage to one's soul meant damage to one's Story – damage to one's
'theme'. Lee Sookyung had survived such an illness before.

Shin Yoosung hurriedly followed that up. "There really is no problem,
right? It's not the same as back then! We can get help from this world's
Aileen. And we also secured a lot of star fluid ahead of time too, didn't
we?!"

Shin Yoosung continued to speak. She brought up all the ways she could
think of without rest, over and over again. And then…

"…That's why, that's why…"

Tears formed on both of her eyes.

Shin Yoosung continued to shake her head in denial, saying this couldn't be
it. Yoo Sangah cautiously wrapped her arm around the girl's shoulders and
spoke.

"Please be honest with us, Seolhwa-ssi."
Lee Seolhwa dropped her head lower, and placed her hand on Kim
Dokja's chest. When she did, a small piece of Story fragment floated up
from his frail-looking chest. That was the last remaining Story of Kim
Dokja.

[Constellation, 'Demon King of Salvation', has reached his new ■■.]

His small Story glimmered like a very tiny phrase.

[Constellation Demon King of Salvation's ■■ is 'Epilogue'.]

⸢And so, they had reached the epilogue no one had written.⸥
 Chapter 541: Epilogue 4 - The Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint,
                              VI


They immediately took Kim Dokja back to their headquarters located in
Gwanghwamun.

Aileen was summoned, and they even requested aid from the Constellations
with expertise in medicine, such as 'Guam Divine Doctor'.

⸢Their plan was perfect. With this plan, they couldn't have failed.⸥

They even called upon every Story expert scattered throughout the world,
too.

⸢This plan was the one where they couldn't afford to fail.⸥

For the period of over a week, dozens of famed doctors were brought in to
treat Kim Dokja. It was to collect the remaining Stories somehow and
restore his soul form.

– There is nothing that can be done currently.
Lee Seolhwa worked throughout the night and as a result, passed out. A
Russian expert subbing for her afterwards said these words.

– We can't say he's dead, but… We also can't say that he's alive, either.
Thischild will never wake up again, that's why.

But, that couldn't be. They worked tirelessly and finally managed to come
this far, so this story simply couldn't end like this. The one to stay as the
pillar of support for the crumbling companions was Yoo Sangah.

"The problem is with Dokja-ssi's soul, yes?"

In that case, they only needed to restore his soul, then.

So, the companions sought out the assistance of the Constellation most well
versed in everything soul-related.

[This child's soul didn't come to the 'Underworld'. No, his soul didn't go to
any of the afterlives found in the other worldviews.]

The queen of the Underworld, Persephone, could only stroke Kim Dokja's
forehead with a sorrowful expression.

[…This was this child's choice.]

"His choice?! Please don't make me laugh. You also saw it too, didn't you?
Back in that subway, we all saw the Stories Dokja-ssi possessed, didn't
we?! He, he wanted to be with us, he wanted to us to save…!"

[There are countless Stories within a person's soul. The words we saw were
simply a small part of that.]

"Don't… Don't say something like that as if it means nothing."

Jung Heewon shouted out. There was no other way for her to endure except
to shout.

It was his choice? This, this was Kim Dokja's choice??
⸢The companions didn't give up.⸥

Even the collecting of Stories, even the recovery of his soul, they were
impossible. In that case, only one method remained.

[I was waiting for you.]

The master of the 'Isle of Reincarnators', Sakyamuni, welcomed them with
a benevolent smile – as if he knew they would come here.

[It's truly lamentable, but he's not someone this one can reincarnate.]

"A portion of his soul still remains. We can divide and share the Stories we
all possess. Just like how I did it back then, if we utilise the powers of
samsara…"

[Ah, my dear arhat. I understand your sorrow. I do. However, he can't be
reincarnated.]

Sakyamuni looked at Yoo Sangah with a regretful expression before letting
a soft sigh escape from his lips.

Soon, a truly countless number of threads began floating up before his eyes
that observed Kim Dokja quietly slumbering away. There were so many of
these red threads that counting them all was impossible. Yoo Sangah too
could see them.

The threads of fate.

The threads stretched out to the night sky and eventually, even pierced
through <Star Stream> itself. Yoo Sangah stared at them, and realized why
Kim Dokja couldn't be reincarnated.

"…I see."

She didn't want to acknowledge it. Even then, the truth didn't change.

"His soul, it… It has already reincarnated in another world-line."
Sakyamuni nodded his head.

[More correctly, we should say his 'souls'.]




In front of everyone, Han Sooyoung passed on the things she'd been told.

"…Kim Dokja's soul has been scattered throughout the whole universe."

The memories from the moments when she faced off against [The Fourth
Wall] inside the darkened room – she didn't leave a single word out and
repeated every part of that conversation to her companions. Someone fell
down, some despaired.

Lee Jihye cried out. "Let's go find that guy again. [The Fourth Wall] might
know a way, right?! We might be able to recover Dokja ahjussi's soul
somehow!"

"If you do that, then what about Kim Dokjas reincarnating in other worlds?
They must be living their own lives, won't they?"

"T-that is…" Lee Jihye panting like a bull gulped down a glass of water on
the table, before carrying on. "There must be some other way. Whatever
that thing was, [The Fourth Wall] or whatever, you said it knows
something."

"…We don't have any methods to meet that guy again. We used up all of
our fragments when opening the wall."

Another four days flew by in an instant. The companions had become
utterly devastated, ravaged – some missed their meals, while some didn't
even bother to sleep. How long passed by like that? Jung Heewon sought
out Yoo Joonghyuk.

"Joonghyuk-ssi."
Yoo Joonghyuk polishing his [Black Heavenly Demon Sword] out of an old
habit raised his head. He frowned slightly as if the sunlight stung, before
shifting his gaze back to the sword. No matter how much he polished it, the
dark stain on the blade didn't want to come off. The stain came from Kim
Dokja's letters that he cut down. He quietly stared at the stain, before finally
opening his mouth.

"Four days is quite fast for making up your mind."

"That's because we don't have any other choice."

Yoo Joonghyuk's emotionless eyes locked on to Jung Heewon. Despite
experiencing so many tragedies until now, her eyes still burned vigorously.
He too used to have such eyes, once upon a time.

"We can do this. We've already done it twice. That's why-!" Jung Heewon
shouted.

Yoo Joonghyuk used to think that.

Their plan was like a well-constructed fantasy.

They believed that they can pull it off this time, that they should be able to
see the conclusion they wanted.

⸢Even if this world ends in tragedy… Don't think that you've all failed.⸥

Did that fool feel this way back then?

Yoo Joonghyuk spoke up. "Right. We did do it."

"Please, let's try it one more time! We can definitely pull it off this time!
We can definitely save Dokja-ssi…!"

"Do not think that things will turn out better than this turn just because you
went back in time."
After spitting out those words reflexively, Yoo Joonghyuk stopped
breathing for a little while.

"…Why are you saying such things? This turn was a definite improvement,
wasn't it? We can definitely do better!"

"It's impossible."

"Why not? When we haven't even tried it…!"

Yoo Joonghyuk didn't reply. Her expression grew deeply incensed. Her
hand then gripped the sword, implying that she'd not hesitate to cut him
down if he didn't cooperate immediately. Even then, even under her intense
threat, he didn't budge an inch. Seeing him act like this, something else
slowly floated up on her expression.

"You… Can it be…?"

Yoo Joonghyuk still didn't reply. Jung Heewon began urging him in sheer
disbelief.

"Is it true? Is it…??"

He finally replied while staring at his own attribute window floating before
his eyes.

"I'm no longer the regressor."

The category of [Regressor] no longer existed among his attributes. His
Stigmata had vanished, too – both [Regression] and [Group Regression].
He didn't possess any Stigma to turn back the clock.

Winds began blowing in from somewhere. While letting the winds hit him,
Yoo Joonghyuk looked up at the clear skies of <Star Stream>.

He couldn't sense the gaze he used to feel all the time. No matter how much
he sharpened his perception, he simply couldn't locate it like before.
⸢He was no longer the protagonist of the story.⸥

His story came to an end when the lone reader went away.

Along with his final regression, too.




"We can cross over to another world-line."

And then, someone said something like that.

"It doesn't really have to be a regression, does it? We cross the world-
line, and enter the location of a different scenario. We then gather the
fragments of 'Final Wall' one more time and meet [The Fourth Wall]." It
was a crazy plan.

What made it even crazier was the fact that the person suggesting it was
none other than the usually-composed Yoo Sangah.

Han Sooyoung replied. "That guy might not even help us."

"Even still, we need to try. It's better than not trying, right?"

They had already done it once before. No reason not to try it again.

But why was this? Han Sooyoung didn't believe that this was the right way
to go.

What would happen to them if they fail this time, too?

Wouldn't they try to skip over the world-line again?

And just like that, they would cross the world-lines again, again, and again.
By continuing that, they might end up no different from the 999th turn's
'Outer Gods'. Their lives might get damaged beyond repair.
The truly wretched thing was, despite knowing the truth she couldn't fight
against the temptation.

"How will you cross the world-line, anyway? We can't regress anymore,
remember? And we don't even have the 'Secretive Plotter' to help us in this
place, either."

"Have you forgotten? This world-line is different from the 1864th turn."

It was at that moment something, a certain thought, brushed past Han
Sooyoung's mind.

⸢There was one more method.⸥

Accompanied by the thunderous "Ku-gugugu!" noise, a gigantic shadow
was cast upon Gwanghwamun right then. It came from a massive flying
object large enough to completely blanket the main street and then some.

[Fufufu. Long time no see, everyone.]

Bihyung was riding on that flying object.

He had become the Dokkaebi King of this world after the Bureau was
completely ruined. And it seemed that this ruined world was exactly to his
liking.

[Right, so you need this thing, is that it?]

That was the item only found in the 'last scenario'.

⸢The Final Ark.⸥

Han Sooyoung slowly approached the ark.

Without a doubt, using this would allow them to jump the world-line. Well,
Dokkaebis and Constellations of the very last scenario were also planning
to escape to another world-line using this vessel, after all.
Yoo Sangah spoke up. "However, if we use this… We'll end up being no
different to Dokkaebis."

"You should've raised such points before we used the group regression, you
know."

Han Sooyoung reached the ark. That prompted Bihyung to issue a warning.

[Let me make this crystal clear. This ark is a lot older than it looks, so it can
be used only once.]

"Doesn't matter."

Being able to travel to another world-line implied that they could use this
ark in a similar capacity as Yoo Joonghyuk's own 'regression'.

What if, they could move to another world-line's specific point in history?
If they could do something like that, then they might be able to change
worldlines in a far more efficient, effective manner than Yoo Joonghyuk's
regression.

Han Sooyoung hurriedly shouted out. "Bihyung. The world-line we want to
go to is…!"

However, even before she could finish, a message came to her first.

[It's impossible to set sail to the applicable world-line.]

Bihyung's expression became confused. [Mm? What's gotten into it? I don't
think it has ever said something like this before?]

"What's wrong? Is it broken?"

[Call out a different world-line.]

Han Sooyoung spoke up again. That resulted in yet another message.

[It's impossible to set sail to the applicable world-line.]
She repeatedly mentioned other world-lines. She spoke, then spoke again.
However, the message floating up remained the same.

[It's impossible to set sail to the applicable world-line.]

[It's impossible to set sail to the applicable world-line.]

…

…

[It's impossible to set sail to the applicable world-line.]

Utterly flustered now, Bihyung began muttering out. [Passageways to all
those world-lines have been closed off. It means the possibilities that used
to be open between the world-lines have completely shut down.]

"We can't go?!"

[Looks that way. Huh, can something like this even happen?]

All the world-lines related to the 'Ways of Survival', the ones she could
remember, were blocked off.

"…Does that mean we can't go anywhere?"

[No, there is one.]

"Really? Which one?"

[But, it's a world-line with all the scenarios already concluded.]

Bihyung displayed the entered route.

Surprisingly enough, the destination was a location they all knew quite
intimately.

Yoo Joonghyuk's 1864th regression turn.
The planetary system number 8612, where all the scenarios had already
ended.

It was Earth. The one they left from.
 Chapter 542: Epilogue 4 - The Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint,
                              VII


The ending to the 1865th regression turn was more perfect than any other
world-lines.

A month flew by after the conclusion of the 'Final Scenario'. The damages
suffered from the scenarios were quickly repaired, and through the help of
the regressors, various nations regained their law and order quite quickly.

Schools opened their doors again, and workers started going back to their
old jobs. The streets were filled to the brim with slogans welcoming the
brand new world.

Lee Jihye standing on this alien-feeling street stared at an athletics field
across the fence.

"That's your friend, isn't she?"

Jung Heewon asked, and Lee Jihye nodded her head.
The latter's friend was currently running on the track. Her name was Na
BoRi. A friend that she had to kill with her own hands, and that very person
was alive and well in this world-line. She was alive, she was breathing, and
her legs were moving.

"Jihye-yah. You don't have to go back."

Lee Jihye's eyes continued to chase after Bo-Ri's back. The friend she
missed so much. The friend that appeared in the nightmares she always
suffered from.

She thought that rescuing Bo-Ri would bring her nightmares to an end.

Unfortunately, memories couldn't be so easily exorcised like that. No, her
nightmare returned with vengeance in a far more vivid form. Within it,
she'd live the same scenario many, many times over and murder the dream
version of Bo-Ri. Every time that happened, she'd come to realize
something – over and over again.

The one she rescued this time wasn't the dead Bo-Ri.

That the one she saved was simply another Bo-Ri from another world-line,
that was all.

"Jihye-yah."

Lee Jihye stared at the athletics field for a long time before making her
reply.
"We made a promise with Biyoo, after all."

"…"

"We did promise that we will definitely cross the world-lines again and
return home."

Jung Heewon quietly studied Lee Jihye's face while the girl said that, then
placed her hand on the latter's shoulder.
"I'm sure it will get lonely once we return. Things that exist here don't on
the other side, after all."

Lee Jihye smiled. She used the hand that wiped away at her eyes and
pointed to her head. "I won't be lonely. Because they are all in here." Her
voice trembled as she said that.

Was it fine to say something like that?

If she could really say something like that, then why did they even bother to
come to this place, to begin with?

"Let's go. This eonni will treat you to something tasty today."




"Orabeoni."

Whenever Yoo Mia used that term, there would be something she wanted to
ask him for.

Yoo Joonghyuk knew that after going through many regressions. She
quietly stared her hyung, before opening her mouth.

"Orabeoni, you did your very best. No one can do more or better than what
you have already done."

His eyelids were solemnly lowered. Yoo Mia climbed up on a chair and
placed her hand on the crown of his head.

"Let's stop and go back home."
– The scenario of tragedy they had to live through.

– The world was enveloped in the acrid smoke of the apocalypse's
cannons,and they had lost their precious ones…

The lyrics of a song coming from somewhere caused Han Sooyoung to
frown quite heavily.

"Is this a funeral dirge or something?"

[No, it's actually a trending song these days. A story that exalts you and
your group.]

The cackling Bihyung opened the door to the ark.

The vessel, with its Story energy fully recharged, greeted them.

One by one, regressors who chose to return home climbed aboard the
vessel. Not everyone chose to do so, however – some decided to remain.

Such as, Gong Pildu unable to say anything while sweating profusely.
Behind him, young children could be seen. Han Sooyoung knew why he
regressed in the first place.

"You should remain here. Someone needs to stay and protect this place,
after all," said Han Sooyoung.

Gong Pildu didn't reply to her.

"Anyone else wanting to stay behind?" Han Sooyoung calmly raised her
voice. "You should give it some serious thought, okay? If you leave, then
your parents, lovers, friends, etc… You will never get to see them ever
again. Will you be fine with that? So, think it over…"

Shin Yoosung then grabbed Han Sooyoung's hand tightly. "This isn't our
world-line, you know? Dokja ahjussi will probably think that way, too."
The majority of <Kim Dokja's Company>'s Incarnations and Constellations
chose to return. In the middle of them all was young Kim Dokja lying on
the stretcher, unmoving.

[Oh, my dear Persephone, are you really planning to leave me?]

Han Sooyoung could only smile wryly after witnessing Hades, unable to
mop around any longer, started his desperate song-and-dance to appeal to
his dearly beloved. Was Hades's personality originally like that?

Persephone directed her troubled smile at such Hades. [I'm truly sorry,
Hades. But, I'm not the 'Persephone' you used to know.]

[You're undoubtedly Persephone. The queen of the darkest spring and the
Underworld.]

Persephone softly shook her head.

[If you insist on doing this, I shall go with you.]

[This is your world-line, dear. And you're also the king of the Underworld,
too. Please, don't forget your dignity.]

[But my world is you, Persephone!]

Bihyung shook his head helplessly. And then, asked Han Sooyoung. [I'm
sure there's no point in me asking, but… Hey, are you really leaving? If you
stay, you know you will be treated like a king for the rest of your life.]

"I didn't come to this world-line for that purpose."

Han Sooyoung looked at the young Kim Dokja lying on the stretcher.

For the last few months, Han Sooyoung and her colleagues immersed
themselves in scouring the entirety of <Star Stream> to find a way to revive
Kim Dokja. However, they couldn't locate anything like that. The best they
could do was to keep his life going like this, not dead but not alive, either.
"Bihyung. As a goodbye present, why don't you share a bit of the Bureau's
Story with us?"

[…The Bureau's Story?]

"The system in our world-line is destroyed. We don't know what might
happen, so give us a little bit, okay?"

Bihyung pouted with a very unhappy face, but eventually, handed down a
portion of the Story to Han Sooyoung.

It was then, a man dashed towards them from afar while kicking up a storm
of dust clouds. A big man with unkempt bushy beard on his face, as a
matter of fact. It was Lee Hyunsung.

"Hurry and start the engines!!" He shouted out.

When they took a closer look, military vehicles could be seen angrily
chasing after him.

"…Now that I think about it, he's still a wanted man, isn't he?"

Han Sooyoung wryly chuckled and gave her signal.

That prompted Yoo Joonghyuk to open his mouth. "We're departing."

At last, the ⸢Final Ark⸥ was taking to the skies.

 –        The heroes of <Kim Dokja's Company> are now setting off on
 theirjourney!

People were looking up at them. Helicopters from TV stations gathered
around and broadcast their departure. Reporters shouted as the cameras
zoomed in closer to the companions' faces.

 –         Why are you all crying? You have managed to save this world-
 line!
The view of the ground progressively grew further away. Someone among
them muttered out.

"What did we come here for, I wonder."

Like an episode of a horrible nightmare, the world below was growing
distant. It was becoming memories, a past that couldn't be turned back.

Han Sooyoung muttered out. "What do you mean, why…"

As the ark accelerated, the surrounding view changed. The galaxies of the
world-lines streamed past them quickly. And Kim Dokja, having
reincarnated, must've been living his life in a distant world-line somewhere.

When Han Sooyoung thought like that, she felt this really powerful urge.
What if she tried to forcibly change the route, even if it was now? What
would happen if they embarked on a journey to meet Kim Dokja's
reincarnated form somewhere within those distant stars? If she did, if they
could do it, then…

⸢However, was that what Kim Dokja really wanted?⸥

The ark's window reflected the faces of Yoo Joonghyuk and Yoo Sangah
walking up next to her almost at the same time. They too carried the exact
same expression as hers, staring at the exact same view as her. The moment
she saw their faces, she realized something. She realized that they were
thinking the same thing as her. And that was why that plan could never
come to reality.

It was then, the ark started thumping and clonking next.

[The vessel has entered a new world-line!]

"Already? Isn't this way too…?!"

As if it was entering the atmosphere, the ark began to suddenly nosedive.
It felt as if gravity itself had disappeared for a second there, but then, the
vessel's hull slammed into something with a loud explosive noise. The light
within the interior went out from a moment before coming back on.

[The vessel has reached the destination.]

Han Sooyoung held her pulsing head and scanned her companions.

"Dammit, never mind being old, it's a bloody antique, this thing. Is
everyone alright?"

"I'm fine! What about the others…?"

Thankfully, no one was hurt. Han Sooyoung manipulated the hull and
opened up an exit. The door slowly opened, and a flight of stairs extended
below it.

She cautiously walked down the steps and the moment her feet touched the
ground, someone's voice resounded out.

"Who are you people?!"

What was going on here? Fully-armed soldiers were pointing their guns at
her and the group. Lee Hyunsung jumping up in fright hurriedly hid behind
her.

"Sooyoung-ssi! What's going on here?! Even here, they can't be trying to
arrest me…?!"

"Of course, that's not possible. This is our home, after all," said Han
Sooyoung. She shoved Lee Hyunsung back, and then addressed the
soldiers. "Hey, don't you think your welcoming party to celebrate our return
is a bit too rough? Don't you know who I am?"

The guns hurriedly took aim at her as she strode forward like a
neighbourhood thug.

"I'm warning you. You pull the trigger on that thing, then all of you will…"
It was then, Han Sooyoung's eyes caught the face of a certain someone. It
was a middle-aged woman's face, setting off this vague deja vu as if she
could just about recognise it. The blonde locks were tumbling down to the
woman's shoulders, and her crimson eye was swirling in a red vortex. The
owner of that eye addressed her.

"…Han Sooyoung??"

Han Sooyoung dazedly stared at the blonde woman. That voice… Some
time had passed by, but she could never forget it. The middle-aged woman
issued the order to stand down with the flick of her hand.

"Han Sooyoung… Is it really you?"

When she heard that voice again, Han Sooyoung felt something welling up
inside her.

While slowly descending to the ground, she kept staring back at Anna
Croft. She didn't know where to start asking her questions, so she asked
whatever jumped out of her mouth first.

"How many years has it been since we left?"

"…It's been 20 years."

Han Sooyoung's trembling lips swallowed those years down. She felt dizzy.
Who would've believed now that the horrifying scenarios had ever taken
place in this world?

The city of Seoul was no longer the place she remembered. No, this city
was as complete as the one from the 1865th turn, the one she thought was
pretty much perfect. The deep greenery of the trees lining the streets, and
children dribbling balls around in the distant playground far away.

Twenty years.

So, that's what it was. In a world where we don't exist, you have managed
to carry on.
And that's how you got to change the world to this extent.

"Han Sooyoung?"

The startled Anna Croft quickly offered support as Han Sooyoung wobbled
unsteadily. This was an embrace from a person she didn't even like, yet Han
Sooyoung clung onto those shoulders and broke down in tears.

At last, they had returned to the 1864th turn.

The world where they completed the scenarios for the first time.

Some managed to return, while some, couldn't.

Some things had to remain as the past that nothing could change.

She saw the sight of the [Industrial Complex] spreading out in the far
distance.

Kim Dokja's fading bronze statue stood before it. Next to his figure
assuming a slightly awkward pose was a massive statue of a squid.

⸢To commemorate Kim Dokja's return⸥

While looking at that bizarre monstrosity of a squid, Han Sooyoung
alternated between breathless sobbing and hysterical laughter. She didn't
want to admit it. If she insisted on it, then she felt that something
somewhere might change, somehow. But right now, right in this moment,
she simply had to admit to it.

Their plan was a failure.

And this place, it was the conclusion to the world they had found.
Two years went by since the companions' return.

Two years were a longer stretch of time than one might imagine, and
perhaps fittingly, several incidents happened during then.

Such as, Lee Hyunsung and Jung Heewon leaving the Complex. Or, Shin
Yoosung and Lee Gilyoung entering high school. Lee Jihye getting slapped
with an 'F' during the first midterms. Etc, etc…

When all these many, many incidents were to be summarised, it'd be like
the following:

<Kim Dokja's Company> had been disbanded.
 Chapter 543: Epilogue 4 - The Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint,
                             VIII


As if fulfilling a promise, the companions went on their separate ways to
find their purpose.

Some set up a security agency, while someone joined the government.

Han Sooyoung didn't join anyone. Instead, she became someone who taught
things.

⸢⸢Reading modern philosophy through webnovels⸥⸥

Han Sooyoung did her lectures featuring such a title from the center.

After the last scenario ended, reality and fantasy were separated once more.

"And so, if you apply Roland Barthes' 'Mourning Diary' to this novel…"

Most of the attendees carried the look of puzzlement asking what kind of a
"dipping croissant in a 'ssamjang' sauce" rubbish this was, but a few
students seemed to be rather interested by the idea.
One of them raised up his hand and asked her. "Your viewpoint is quite
intriguing, Professor. But I do have some objections."

Han Sooyoung nodded her head as consent to go ahead. The student
continued on with a triumphant look. "Did the author really intend for such
a reaction? Is applying such a grandiose theory to a novel full of poor
grammar and contradictory sentences a correct way to read it? To be
honest, I don't think that's what the author was aiming for. Just from
looking at the overabundance of onomatopoeia and mimetic words, it…"

Han Sooyoung glanced at the novel she brought along as her teaching
material. For sure, it was a work filled with far too many mistakes. The
student was carrying a satisfied smile as if he had finally landed a solid
body blow to her.

She pondered for a little while. She could've just explained to that student,
step by step. However, she chose not to do so. She instead began saying
these following words.

"You're right. Only the author will know the truth."

"But, if you say that, isn't that too irrespon…"

"What would it be like if someone starts judging you?"

"Pardon?"

"That someone might notice your not-very-well washed face, which might
be a result of you rushing to get to the lectures on time. Or maybe, they
notice your toenails sticking out of your slippers first. And then, they will
start thinking like this. Ah, that guy, the way he looks, he must be pretty
lazy. And there's no way a lazy person can be smart. So, no need to listen to
the opinions of someone like that."

"W-what are you even…"

"Or maybe, that student must've studied the contents of today's lecture
throughout last night. You can tell by looking at how enthusiastically he's
questioning the professor like that. Sure, his outer appearance is a bit
shabby, but he might not care about such things, to begin with. Yes, they
could potentially think that way."

Han Sooyoung looked into the student's trembling eyes and continued on.

"Just like what you said earlier, the author of the novel probably didn't think
about stuff like this. However, it is up to you to decide on what you'll get
out of reading the novel. If you only find trash within, then it'll simply end
as trash. But if it can impart just a tiny little bit of deeper meaning to you,
then that alone will improve this work in your eyes. Again, it is up to you to
decide which one it will be. But I'd really like you to choose the option
where you get to 'appreciate' your time a little bit better. If you don't,
enduring my lectures will become a pretty arduous slog for you."

The student closed his mouth shut and looked back at Han Sooyoung. It
was unknown whether he understood her or not – however, she thought that
there was no helping it even if he couldn't.

The student's eyes slowly moved this way and that, then he suddenly said
something unexpected. "…By the way, Professor? Are you going to write a
new novel?"

"Mm?"

"You said this before, didn't you? You're an author because you write. If
you don't write, then you're not an author."

There was a subtle undertone of "I don't have to listen to someone like you
who's no longer an author" in his words. Han Sooyoung didn't reply for a
second or two – her unclear, murky eyes seemed to be peering into the
distant space.

She then disinterestedly muttered out. "Right. I'm not an author anymore."

"Excuse me?"

"I don't have a reader who'll read my work."
Before she could finish the rest of her words, though, the clock's bell went
off first. Han Sooyoung grinned and shrugged her shoulders. "Alright, then.
The novel you need to read for the next class is…"

She stayed behind on the podium and bade farewell to the students leaving
the lecture hall. Her eyes caught a certain text file visible on the screen of
the notebook PC currently flipped open. It was a novel she began writing
not too long ago as a sort of test. She accessed the file and quietly stared at
the sentences she had written so far.

⸢It was then she sensed a presence from behind her.⸥

"That was an interesting lecture. It'd been nice if that person also attended
it, though."

Han Sooyoung quickly turned the screen off and looked back only to
discover a familiar face. The 'intruder' was using her elegantly slender
fingers to carefully sift through the lecture material scattered around the
lecture desk.

"Ah, this lecture sounds like fun, too. Reading modern fantasy literature
starting with Pierre Bourdieu, dissection of romance fantasies with
Butler…"

"Did you come here to look down on a webnovel author?"

Yoo Sangah, slightly tilting her head, smiled brightly. Her smile didn't
seem to have changed a bit in the last two years. She deeply peered at Han
Sooyoung, before asking a question. "Why are you wearing glasses all of a
sudden? Did your eyesight get worse?"

"None of your business."

"Aha, I think I understand. You looked too young and your students were
ignoring you, right?"
Han Sooyoung scowled and angrily yanked the black-rimmed glasses off.
Yoo Sangah teasingly followed that up.

"Shall we go? Let me buy you a drink."




Two of them walked on the street, one sipping on the iced Americano,
while the other, sucking on the peach smoothie. They maintained this
awkward distance and focused only on walking forward.

Han Sooyoung asked in passing. "How's your work with the government?
Is it fun?"

"I'm not doing it for fun, you know."

"Who promised to come today?"

"Hyunsung-ssi is currently in the States so it might be difficult for him, but
it looks like Heewon-ssi will make it. And as you know, Seolhwa-ssi is…"

"What about the kids?"

"They are coming. They never missed it before, after all."

Not too long afterwards, the familiar street of Gwanghwamun greeted them.
They entered a side street, walked for a bit longer, and eventually, found the
diner they were looking for. Its name was <<Mark & Selena>>. Han
Sooyoung unhesitantly pushed the door open.

"Welcome to… Wow, look who it is!"

The one welcoming them with fluent Korean was Selena Kim. Mark
expertly spinning pizza dough in the kitchen whistled loudly. She spoke
while guiding them inside. "Please wait for a little bit. Your order will
arrive very soon."
"What about the others who arrived before us?"

Selena Kim pointed to the corner of the bar as if to say, see for yourself.

Three familiar backs of the heads were gathered there. Han Sooyoung did
her best to hold back this certain impatient streak and cautiously sneaked
behind the trio. And when she was right behind them, swiftly wielded her
hands and pounded on the three heads in a row.

"Ouuuch?! Which dumb asshole…?!"

"Hey, our dear shorties, you've all grown a lot, haven't you?"

"Ah, Sooyoung eonni! Sangah eonni!"

Since this was their first reunion in almost a year, they shared short
impressions on how each other looked. And it really didn't take long before
their food arrived, too.

"What did you order, exactly? What's the name of this dish?"

"The Desolate Cabin's Demonic Intestines Stir-fry."

Mark bringing out the dish grinned. Han Sooyoung formed a suspicious
expression, before stabbing at the dish shaped like the Korean squid
sausage with a fork.

"What the hell? It tastes great."

As expected of its name, the dish was amazing. Her other companions
loosened up and began enjoying the food. How long had it been since they
got to sit around and enjoy their meal in leisure like this? Even though two
years had passed since they crossed the world-line and returned home,
everything still felt like a lie to Han Sooyoung.

– Oh, ohhh. Wuh-woo wuh-woo, wuh…!
A TV panel installed above the bar was broadcasting scenes from a live
concert. A pretty popular idol group was currently performing there. One of
them was a monkey, the other was a dragon, and the last one was an
Archangel. The Great Sage wielding the mic delivered an impassioned
vibrato-filled roar, which was promptly followed up by the shower of
colourful spotlights focusing on the rear of the stage as Uriel made her
entrance.

Yoo Sangah elegantly chewing on the intestines muttered out. "They are
really popular these days."

"I joined their fan club yesterday. The Uriel Force is seriously…!"

When Lee Jihye piped up, Lee Gilyoung sent in a quick tackle.

"I can't bear to look at their performance anymore after seeing the one
Dionysus has put on, you know? Especially the dude over there…"

"You mean, Abyssal Black Flame Dragon? What's wrong? Isn't he cute?"

Shin Yoosung asked, and Lee Gilyoung narrowed his eyes before replying
while chewing on his fork.

"That's cute to you??"

The panel was now playing the Constellations' new track. Abyssal Black
Flame Dragon sporting an eye patch performed a breakdance routine before
exploding into a fiery rapid-fire rap monologue.

– This is the oldest Story! Myth sung by the scenario! One man's evolution,
fading with time!

"…What the hell is he even singing about?"

While the Black Flame Dragon's rapid rap bars continued to land, a couple
more people opened the diner's door and entered inside. Their faces seemed
a bit flushed as if they had already knocked back a few cold ones
somewhere else. They were Jang Hayoung and Jung Heewon.
"What's this? Everyone was here already?"

Jang Hayoung quickly rushed in and caught Han Sooyoung in a headlock.

"How have you been?"

Jung Heewon lightly high-fived Yoo Sangah's offered hand before shifting
her gaze over to the panel to say something. "Argh, that rapping is really
getting on my nerves."

"It's good to see everyone after such a long time."

"Is this everyone for today?"

"Looks that way."

Jung Heewon began boasting about the new house she recently moved into.
Her story generally involved how inconvenient the new place could
sometimes be as it was not within the area of train stations, and also how
easy it was to get some exercise since a park was nearby, etc.

She no longer lived in Gwanghwamun. She didn't even live anywhere near
the third subway line, too.

Han Sooyoung asked her. "Okay, so. You two still together?"

Those words caused the companions' attention to gather here. Jung Heewon
smiled bitterly and shook around her alcohol cup. "No, not anymore."

"How come?"

"If we're together, we get reminded of things."

"…What things?"

Lee Jihye and her sparkling eyes were urging Jung Heewon on. However,
the latter didn't seem to be in much of a mirthful mood. She simply shook
around her drink in silence. Lee Jihye eventually closed her wide-open
mouth.
The panel began playing the prelude to the next song.

– The Nameless Salvation (feat. Bald General of Justice) – JUS

Han Sooyoung listened to the song coming from the panel and murmured
something as a follow-up a little bit later. "I see. I guess you're right."

With that, they stopped chatting altogether. The silence wrapped around
their ankles like a quagmire.

This was the reason why they didn't meet often.

– This was the story no one remembered. However, this story definitely
didexist.

Was two years enough time for that 'time period' to become a story?

Han Sooyoung wanted to know.

"Still no news about Biyoo?"

"I asked Miss Anna, but she says there hasn't been any communication so
far."

Before the companions made their way back, Biyoo went to the [Dark
Stratum] to train. Because of that, they hadn't heard any news regarding her
whereabouts for the past two years.

"What about Gong Pildu?"

"Probably drinking alone in Chungmuro. Again. I think the shock of
separating from his family was too great."

"That guy, I definitely told him to stay behind in the 1865th turn, so why
did he stubbornly come back with us…"

"How about Myungoh ahjussi? He's living in the Complex, so you must be
clued up on his news, right? Han Sooyoung?"
"That guy? He's the same as always."

"What about the sooty bastard, though? I heard that he tried to get back to
the pro gaming scene before quitting recently."

No one replied.

Jang Hayoung abruptly raised her cocktail glass. "Eiii, I don't know
anymore. Let's just get drunk!"

"But, you look pretty drunk already?"

"Don't stooop me! I'm gonna go all out today!"

"Me too. Please give me a shot, too."

"Yoosung-ah, you're still underage."

"If you count my age from before the regression, I'm definitely an adult
now, you know?"

While the pouting Shin Yoosung started pestering the adults, Lee Jihye
poured herself a stiff shot of soju and without any side snacks, emptied it in
one go.

"Sooyoung eonni, can you write my report for me? Please?" She then asked
desperately.

"If you ask me that again, Imma kill you."

Two years. Around 730 days, if divided daily.

Their current conversations could only take place because they had been
desperately living their lives during these past 730 days. They went to
school, they went to work, they moved house; to get away from that day,
one step at a time, the companions tried to live their lives to the fullest.

However, someone actually got closer to that day, in order to get away from
it.
⸢Kim Dokja survived through a story called 'Ways of Survival'. In that case,
which story allowed us to survive?⸥

Jung Heewon watched Han Sooyoung jotting down something on her
memo pad, before asking the latter. "What are you busy jotting down
there?"

"Just a force of old habit."

"Are you still writing these days?"

Her fingers writing down on the memo came to a stop. Yoo Sangah replied
in her stead.

"I thought you were? Judging from what I saw earlier."

"Really? What are you writing? Is it a novel?"

Lee Jihye chewing on a mouthful of newly-brought out snacks quickly
asked.

"…Nah, I'm just writing to get back in the groove."

"Really? Are you planning to publish a new novel?"

Just as Han Sooyoung began pondering how she should reply, she heard a
rustling noise coming from her side.

"Maybe it's in here?"

Lee Gilyoung had left the meal saying he needed to use the john, but even
before anyone had noticed it, he was already back and holding Han
Sooyoung's notebook PC while giggling away. He had prior form of
playing computer games on her device without permission, so he naturally
knew the password and could log in without any issues. Shin Yoosung shot
him an angry glare, telling him to stop this rude act right now.

"Lee Gilyoung."
"Argh, what now?"

His cheeks were flushed red as if he had been sneaking in a couple of sips
of the booze. Shin Yoosung grew nervous and cautiously studied Han
Sooyoung's moods, but what was going on here? Now normally, the latter
would have blown her top by now and smacked the back of Lee Gilyoung's
head. But now, she was wordlessly sipping on her cocktail. As if, she didn't
care if he read it or not.

Lee Gilyoung took that as a sign of consent so he quickly opened the file. A
short while later, Han Sooyoung put her glass down and asked him.

"Hey, kid."

"…"

"You sure you have the guts to read it?"

Lee Gilyoung's complexion grew paler and paler. Even then, he didn't tear
his eyes away from the screen. He continued to read, as if he'd get sucked
into the screen at any moment now. Despite furrowing his brows in
obvious torment, he continued to read and read. And a few minutes later,
he raised his head, tears just about ready to flood out from his eyes.
"…How many chapters have you written so far, noona?"

"Not that many. It's about, say, less than two books' worth."

"Can I… read a bit more?"

"Sure."

Realizing that Lee Gilyoung's status was somewhat strange, the
companions stood up from their chairs.

"What's going on? What is its content about to make you react like this?"

"I'm also kind of curious, since it's Sooyoung-ssi's latest work…"
"I'll pass. I'm gonna wait until it comes out as a book."

With the exception of Lee Jihye saying that while pouring herself another
drink, everyone else gathered behind Lee Gilyoung.

Han Sooyoung quietly stared at them.

One by one, their gazes were being sucked into the notebook's screen.

It shouldn't simply be because the story was too entertaining. No, it was that
kind of a story, to begin with. Because this story was…

"Han Sooyoung, you…"

While listening to Jung Heewon's trembling voice, Han Sooyoung recalled
the sentences she had already recorded.

⸢"Nothing can be changed through regression. It took me a very long time
to realize that."⸥
That's right. Not a single thing could be changed through the act of
regressing. Just like how it was with them back on that day.

"But, why, such a story…"

Even if that was true, however – that didn't mean their regression didn't
leave anything behind, either.

⸢Kim Dokja survived through a story called 'Ways of Survival'. In that case,
which story allowed us to survive?⸥
Actually, Han Sooyoung already knew the answer to that question.

"It's a story I wanted to show to that idiot."

A story still remained for them.

A story of a person they all loved.
 Chapter 544: Epilogue 4 - The Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint,
                              IX


"…I just wrote something, hoping to leave it as records of our past. Kim
Dokja might wake up someday, you know. When that happens, he'd
most likely have forgotten everything about us, anyway." The
companions read Han Sooyoung's novel.

Shin Yoosung, her eyes reddened from tears, angrily rebuked Lee
Gilyoung, telling him to slow down with the scrolling, while the boy
sniffling away continued to click on the mouse. Yoo Sangah, Jung Heewon,
and Jang Hayoung copied the file and read the novel on their own phones.

Yoo Sangah read the scene where she was making an appearance and
smiled faintly. "…I did say something like that, didn't I?"

Perhaps she was missing those days, because she stroked the sentences on
the phone's display. As if doing that might let her really touch Kim Dokja.

Lee Jihye sucking out the last drops from the booze bottle unsteadily got up
from her seat. "What the hell. Is it really that fun?"
"Ah?! Noona!"

Lee Jihye going on a drunken rant shoved Lee Gilyoung off the chair and
took over the notebook PC. She then slapped her cheeks and tried to focus
her blurry, half-closed eyes on the screen.

How long went by like that?

"Sob, sooob, waaah! This novel is too sad, you know?!"

"…You've only read the first chapter, so what the…"

Lee Jihye blew her nose noisily and chucked the soiled tissue in Lee
Gilyoung's direction. She remained utterly unperturbed regardless of
whether the angry boy was yelling at her or not. Even more so when she
scrolled down and read the scene where she made her appearance in
Chungmuro – her excitement seemed to reach its peak.

"A girl wielding a lengthy sword stood in the exit as the faint rays of light
shone through. While looking at Lee Jihye's hair dancing in the winds
intermittently blowing in… Keuh-euuh, I'm sooo uber-cool, aren't I??"

"Argh, seriously now?! Go back up already!"

Despite Lee Gilyoung scolding her, Lee Jihye continued on yap on.

"Like, what happens afterwards? What happens to Kim Dokja…"

In the end, she couldn't win against the booze in her system and before
long, her nose kissed the tabletop. Shin Yoosung snatched the notebook PC
away, and asked a question while taking over the scrolling duty. "…Do I
make an entrance later on, too?"

"Everyone makes their appearance. Although, each person's specific
importance will be a bit different," said Han Sooyoung.

"B-but, I really did my best, you know."
"Yes, I know. Don't worry, your story will show up lots of time later on."
They already knew the ending to this story. What would happen to Kim
Dokja, and what experiences the companions would go through as the
result. How the dream they dreamed crumbled away. They all knew too
well.

Despite knowing, however, Shin Yoosung continued to read the story.

They strode forward one sentence at a time towards the predetermined end.
The story they couldn't change was right here. Shin Yoosung used every
ounce of her energy to read it as if each and every sentence disappearing
behind was too lamentable, too sad, to her.

"…How wonderful would it have been if Dokja ahjussi was able to read
this."

"Should we go to hyung and read it for him?"

Han Sooyoung thought about the slumbering Kim Dokja inside Lee
Seolhwa's hospital. This novel was written for that guy, yet she didn't think
he'd be reading it anytime soon.

⸢Could it be that, just maybe, this was this story's completion?⸥

The completed ending of those who had lost something – could that be this
novel's true purpose? Could these people be the true readers of this story?
"Do you think that ahjussi in the other world-line will like reading, too?"

The companions wouldn't be saved with just this measly little story. But at
the very least, they should be able to endure their lives while reading and
thinking about it. Just like how Kim Dokja reading the 'Ways of Survival'
did.

"I wonder. Maybe."

"Ahjussi is probably ahjussi in that place, too. Definitely."
"Who knows, he might have ended up as a bug."

"Keep talking like that if you want to die, Lee Gilyoung."

"I'd have raised him up if he was reborn as an insect, you know? And read
books to him every day, too."

A couple of adults heard the boy's mindless babble and broke out into
chuckles.

Yoo Sangah spoke up next. "Regardless of where he's born and what's he
born as, Dokja-ssi will always be Dokja-ssi."

Han Sooyoung nodded her head. Kim Dokja should be living a new life in a
world out there somewhere. Kim Dokja living his life while reading a story
written by someone else and feeling happy or sad, or even moved.

The people of this world would reminisce about such Kim Dokja's tale and
live their lives.

Praying that Kim Dokja of that world would not be miserable.

Praying that he'd get to live in as much happiness as his companions were
remembering him in this world.

Shin Yoosung repeatedly reading the early parts spoke up, her voice
sounding like a soft sigh. "I can't read it anymore, because I'm scared it'll
end too soon."

"It won't end that soon," replied Han Sooyoung.

"Are you going to write the next chapter, too?"

"Yeah."

"It would've been so wonderful if we could send this novel to the
other world, too. It's a shame that only we get to read it." …The other
world?
Han Sooyoung became momentarily dazed at that unexpected idea.

She had never even thought about it. It wasn't a possibility to start with, too.
She pondered this for a bit longer, but before she could say something, a
piece of breaking news came out of the TV screen.

– Breaking news just in. A terrorist has attacked the 'Scenario
Museum'located in Gwanghwanmun…

"Terrorists? In this day and age?"

Jang Hayoung shook her head. Most of the system's influence had already
disappeared from this world, so possessing Star Relics didn't automatically
mean you'd be able to do something with them. It was right then that Jung
Heewon's phone started ringing.

"Hello, this is Jung Heewon, the representative of Iron Caps, the trusted
security organisation protecting your… Excuse me? Where? Who showed
up??"

The clearly-flustered Jung Heewon raised her head and looked at the TV
panel. The news broadcast's ticker-tape continued to move along.

– Identity of the terrorist is now known to be a Transcendent formerly
known as the 'Supreme King'… …The 'Supreme King'?

A short while later, the terrorist's face showed up on the screen.

– The terrorist, Supreme King Yoo Joonghyuk. (33, unemployed)




"Stop him!"

The riot police arriving on the scene blocked off the museum's access and
stood before the approaching man. However, he used fleet-footed
movements to evade their truncheons. The jet-black coat danced in the air
as the man's hands went to work, and the riot police rushing in were
scattered away like the breaking waves.

"Uwaaahk!"

"He's using the system's powers! Hurry up and call the security company!
And get the government-affiliated Constellations, too-!"

Yoo Joonghyuk's [Red Phoenix Shunpo] spat out reddish-yellow licks of
flames as he dashed forward. Each step taken emitted truly stupendous
heatwave and the members of riot police had to back away in fear. Before
long, he had reached the front of the [Scenario Museum]'s doorstep.

The place where Star Relics from the age of apocalypse were stored. This
was where the important artefacts not open to public had been gathered.
The riot police chasing after Yoo Joonghyuk shouted out.

"He's just a Transcendent from the old generation! The battle array
formation the Constellation-nims of the North Stars worked together to
create near the museum will…"

['North Star Five March Formation' has been triggered!]

Yoo Joonghyuk analysed the inner workings of the array formation
blocking him. It was a Murim-style battle array formation that followed the
laws of the North Star and five elements of the universe to create a
remarkable unison of the 'life gate' and 'death gate'. His eyes emitted golden
rays of light as his [Black Heavenly Demon Sword] accurately stabbed into
seven separate points.

Kuu-rurururung!

"Crazy son of a… How could he…?!"

These young riot police members who didn't know much about the age of
apocalypse could only look on with their jaws hitting the floor. Even they
had heard of the stories, of course.
 –         Twenty years ago, a man who dared to stare arrogantly at the
 stars of theheavens existed.

It was only a story to them, however. A man who could evenly match up to
the Constellations? They believed that no such man could have ever
existed. Too bad for them, the living proof was now standing before their
eyes.

Yoo Joonghyuk stepped within the crumbling array formation. No one
could stop him now.

It was also then someone appeared among the rising dust clouds.

 –       Supreme King, what do you think you're doing? Surely,
 someone like youdon't have a reason to steal items such as the Star
 Relics?

It was Han Donghoon, an Incarnation affiliated with the government. He
was famed for sending messages to the opposition's eyes rather than
addressing them directly.

Yoo Joonghyuk quietly stared at the message, before pointing at the steeple
of the museum. A small ship hung up there like some kind of a symbol. "I
need that ship."

 –         That's just a replica. It can't even fly.

"We'll see once I activate it."

 –        I know that you've been roaming the world without reporting
 periodicallyto the world government. Despite knowing that, the world
 government decided to turn a blind eye. Because they respect your
 achievements from the age of apocalypse.

"…"

 –       However, that ends today. If you insist on behaving like this,
 then we won'thave any choice but to use force.
Almost at the same time as those words arrived, powerful fighting spirit
exploded out from Han Donghoon's entire body.

He, too, was a survivor from the era of scenarios, a powerful figure who
came to be known as the 'King of Shadows' by the time scenarios were
drawing to a close.

"You wish to stop me?"

Yoo Joonghyuk took a single step forward. At the same time, humans of the
surroundings knelt down simultaneously. Han Donghoon's expression
stiffened, and he quickly performed hand signs.

 –        All personnel, get ready to…!

Even before the message could be finished, shadows hiding on the
museum's rooftop began falling like dead cicadas.

Tumble, drop…

The fallen agents writhed around like worms. Traces of their pressure-
points being depressed could be seen throughout their bodies. Surprisingly,
over thirty Incarnations were dispatched to this place together with Han
Donghoon, yet all these elite warriors were taken care of even before
anyone had noticed it.

"Get out of my way."

Han Donghoon's shoulders trembled imperceptibly. For the past 20 years
after the scenarios ended, the strongest Incarnation he knew of was the
prophet Anna Croft, the only surviving Incarnation that could compare to
the Constellations. However, even if she came, could she stop this monster?

– Han Donghoon, respond… Han Donghoon?

If he didn't escape from here, he'd get killed. Han Donghoon knew this, yet
he couldn't even lift his feet. An incredible amount of killing intent had
tightened around him like a noose. Just who would be able to stop this
Transcendent? The Murim world's Transcendents residing on another
planet? Or, Constellations currently on a world tour? No, even they might
find it too much.

The monster before his eyes was an existence that had reached the highest
realm even among the Transcendents. Post-destruction of <Star Stream>,
Constellations could no longer exercise the power levels of their past
selves. That's why…

"Captain Han Donghoon! Evade it!!"

Yoo Joonghyuk's sword moving, and Han Donghoon squeezing his eyes
shut, as well as an ear-splitting noise exploding, all happened at the same
time. Scary waves of magical force shoved Han Donghoon's body away. It
had been really long time since he last saw a clash heavy enough to cause
the storm of Probability's aftermath.

Tsu-chuchuchuchu…

He held onto the crack on the ground and endured the storm of aftermath,
only to be greeted by an unbelievable spectacle.

"F*ck, man. Trying to use my powers in such a long time is killing me."

Someone was blocking the Supreme King's sword.

[Constellation, 'Architect of the False Last Act', is unleashing her power!]

[Story fragments of the 'Bureau' is supporting the 'Architect of the False
Last Act'!]

She was one of only a handful of the truly strong who could stop that
monster, Yoo Joonghyuk.

The purple-hued magical energy oozing out from her entire figure was
dyeing the surroundings in a foreboding manner.
"Yoo Joonghyuk, what kinda stupidity is this?" said the Empress of Black
Flames, Han Sooyoung.

"This isn't a matter you should concern yourself with."

"Why shouldn't I?? Our former Regressor friend suddenly decided to
become a terrorist for free, so how can I not?"

"…"

"The companion of the past has lost his way and became corrupted, so it's
the duty of the superhero to take up on the responsibility of rehabi…"
Kwaaa-boooom!

"Goddammit, what gives?? Why are you going mental here, man??"

"Get out of the way. I don't plan to exchange sophistries with you."

"No, you better start talking. That's always been your damn problem.
You've been behaving nicely for the past two years, so why the hell…"
Swiiiiiish-!

She pulled out a dagger from her inner pocket, gritted her teeth, and
defended against Yoo Joonghyuk's attack. The overabundant bombardment
of the sword energy began forcing her body back bit by bit. Han Sooyoung
glanced in the direction she was being pushed back.

…The Scenario Museum.

No matter how hard she thought about it, it made no sense. Yoo Joonghyuk
had no reason to target that place. He wouldn't get any stronger than he
already was by possessing a couple more Star Relics at this point. Besides,
a Star Relic someone like him might find desirable wouldn't even be in this
pla…

It was then, her eyes caught the sight of a certain something.
"Hey, you. It can't be…"

Her hair strands slowly began floating up. Creeping, ominous waves of
energy spread out everywhere. Cold rage was filling up Han Sooyoung's
voice.

"…Is it because of that?"

Yoo Joonghyuk's eyes were seething, and his irises were reflecting the hull
of the replica [Final Ark] located on top of the steeple.
 Chapter 545: Epilogue 4 - The Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint,
                               X


Han Sooyoung yelled out.

"You stupid bastard! Did you forget already?? This world-line's ark has
already-!"

Yoo Joonghyuk's sword thrust dug into her opening. The moment she
gasped out, her dagger was already flying away. Blood spluttered from the
cut wound.

His sword was now pointing straight at her neck.

"Joonghyuk-ssi! Please stop!"

"H-hold on, master! Are you mad!! What's gotten into you!?"

The companions arriving belatedly approached them to stop the fighting.

However, Yoo Joonghyuk didn't even look behind at them as he swung his
sword. The gob-smacking level of magical energy wave shot out from the
[Black Heavenly Demon Sword] and drew a line of roiling flames one step
in front of the companions.

"No one crosses that line. If you do, I will cut y…"

Smack!

Han Sooyoung's left foot rising up in the blink of an eye accurately kicked
his wrist. The [Black Heavenly Demon Sword] gripped in his hand flung
away, drew circles in the air, before stabbing into the ground.

Han Sooyoung growled at him. "Yoo Joonghyuk. I'm sure you already
know this, but… I really, really hate to see a rotten apple spoiling the whole
barrel."

"…"

"You know, I was feeling pretty good up until a few minutes ago.
Specifically, before you started doing this crap, that is… I guess the peace
of the past two years have been too sweet for me, seeing how I've
completely forgotten about what kind of a bastard you are."

It was hard to tell just who her boiling rage was directed at.

Han Sooyoung recalled the faces of her companions reading her novel. The
faces that grew at ease as they read the story.

The companions, everyone else, even herself… they were about to feel
brave enough to finally take that one step forward, away from 'that day'.
Yet…

Han Sooyoung stopped both Jung Heewon and Yoo Sangah about to cross
the burning line. "You two, stay back. Looks like today is finally the day I
pound some sense into this guy."

As soon as those words ended, both the figures of Han Sooyoung and Yoo
Joonghyuk vanished. The place they met again was in the air dozens of
meters off the ground. The thunderclap-like explosions rang out and their
fists collided against one another.

Ruuuumble, kurururung!!

The blade of Han Sooyoung's hand slammed hard into Yoo Joonghyuk's
waist, while his right kick landed on her solar plexus. The exchange of
attacks and defenses that even Constellations' eyesights found hard to keep
up continued on. Blood trickled down her lips, while large, bloody bruises
formed on his arms raised up to guard him.

Lee Jihye watching the fight unfold couldn't hold back and reached for her
own sword. It was Yoo Sangah who stopped her.

"Eonni? But why?"

"Let them be for the time being."

Perhaps she had predicted something, because while stopping the
companions, she spread out her lotus pedestals, as well. She was planning
to protect the civilians from the storm of aftermaths soon to visit them.

Right next second, the atmosphere up in the sky began to change.

[Giant Story, 'Torch that Swallowed the Myth', has started its stammered
attempt at storytelling.]

[Giant Story, 'Liberator of the Forgotten Ones', is waking up from the
darkness.]

The clash of these two managed to awaken the old Stories. Han Sooyoung
summoned all of her strength to broke through Yoo Joonghyuk's fist and
shouted out.

"Speak up! Why today, of all days? Why have you been staying quiet for
the last two years only to start this crap today?!"

"None of your business."
"Aha, is that so."

She didn't plan on going this far. However, looking at the expressionless
face of Yoo Joonghyuk acting like a damn stubborn mule, she simply
couldn't rein in her boiling anger anymore.

"I always hated you. And regretted it, too. Why did I write the story of
someone like you with my own hands?"

She'd never have said these words in any other times. Even then, she
continued to spit out everything anyway.

"I cursed my other self. If this story didn't exist, none of these things
would've happened. No one would've died. And Kim Dokja might have…!"

Yoo Joonghyuk's fist finding that brief window of opening cut her words
short. He kept his mouth resolutely shut and continued to fight. Though she
hadn't heard a proper answer yet, Han Sooyoung knew why he was trying
to get a hold of the [Final Ark].

"We already failed. Since we came home with our tails between our legs,
you should've quietly accepted it and moved on. Have you really forgotten
everything [The Fourth Wall] said to us?"

She knew the truth, and that was why she just couldn't stand it anymore.

⸢You shouldn't have been greedy. No, y o u sh oul d've be en con te nt wi th
49% Kim Dok ja⸥
[The Fourth Wall]'s voice from that day, the one she had never forgotten
until now.

Yoo Joonghyuk finally opened his mouth. "Spoken like a true loser. You
simply gave up, that's all."

Every time their fists collided, the worn-out Stories scattered in the air. The
fragments emitting faint rays of light settled down on his cheeks.
It was only then did she spot his messed-up appearance. The unkempt,
stiffened hair, and his rather unsightly-looking unwashed face.

Han Sooyoung sucked in her breath and took a step back in that instant.
Some memories brushed past her head just then – Yoo Mia, showing up
one day while crying her eyes out and saying that her oppa had just
disappeared, and Yoo Joonghyuk, walking away from the pro gamer job he
barely managed to earn back, and vanishing into thin air.

⸢Should I have started off with how he had been doing all this time?⸥

Golden aura was focusing on his right hand. That was the beginning of the
[Breaking the Sky Force Punch]. He was being deadly serious here. Han
Sooyoung hurriedly unfurled her right hand.

[Stigma, 'Character Summon', is activating!]

At the bare minimum, if she used this skill to fling him far away, then…

[Applicable individual is no longer a 'Character'.]

She belatedly realized it – the 'Yoo Joonghyuk' standing before her eyes
was not the character from the 'Ways of Survival' she had written.

After Kim Dokja's final act had arrived, and after the 'Ways of Survival's
story came to an end, Yoo Joonghyuk had completely broken free of the
position of the 'Character'.

A punch wrapped in pure golden light scythed the air and flew in. She
activated every single evasion skill she could.

The attack brushed past her shoulder with the thinnest margin imaginable.
The storm of aftermath from that improbably powerful punch pricked her
painfully.

Yoo Joonghyuk muttered out. "…Your skills have barely lost any of their
original powers. Is this due to the system's grace?"
The only reason why Han Sooyoung's skills could still exhibit such power
was because she received the Bureau's Story from the 1865th turn's
Bihyung.

Yoo Joonghyuk asked her with an emotionless voice. "This world no longer
needs the system. Yet, why did you receive that Story from him?"

"Obviously to maintain Kim Dokja's life."

They went through with the [Group Regression] because Kim Dokja's
Avatar was increasingly getting weaker. And she received the Bureau's
Story just in case something similar happens to Kim Dokja.

"Why did you do something like that? You should know this. That fool
cannot wake up again," said Yoo Joonghyuk.

"Kim Dokja isn't dead y-!"

"If you really believe that, then why are you stopping me?"

For a moment there, she became speechless.

Yoo Joonghyuk then flashed right behind her, and slammed down on her
back. Han Sooyoung crash-landed on the ground. She coughed out thick
dust and stood back up, then shouted at him while tottering unsteadily.

"…Yoo Joonghyuk, wake the hell up! You think this is what Kim Dokja
really wants? He told you, didn't he? He told you not to abandon this world.
And you also agreed!"

"That's right. I agreed not to regress."

"Don't make me laugh! You can't regress anymore, that's what. If you still
could do it, you'd probably have gone back!!"

"I may have."
Yoo Joonghyuk's golden eye began to glow brightly within the thick dust
cloud. And that eye was now questioning Han Sooyoung.

"Are you any different?"

She couldn't answer back. But in her stead, Kim Dokja's Stories still
remaining within her grasp replied.

[Story, 'One Who Opposes Miracles', is lamenting in sorrow.]

These were words that she just couldn't let go. She wrote them down
somewhere sometimes to endure her life. Telling herself not to regress, to
live in the present. She continued to reflect on those obvious-sounding
words of the past, and continued to endure moment by every moment. That
was her past two years.

"It seems that you too couldn't forget anything."

"Shut up."

Han Sooyoung dashed forward in an instant and punched him squarely in
the face. Every time their fists flew out, the Stories they shared and
compiled together writhed violently.

[Story, 'King of Kaizenix', is being agitated.]

She believed that she worked hard to endure. She believed that a lot of time
had passed by now, as much as all the sentences she had written down. She
breathed, she ate, and she slumbered – Han Sooyoung survived in that
manner.

⸢You are not a regressor because you regress.⸥

However, could she really say she had been living a life that way?

⸢Some people would live their entire lives inside the already-ended past.⸥
Every time bones in her fists were crushed, Stories scattered away little by
little – Stories, the raw memories preserved as was without any revisions.
Han Sooyoung reflexively began retrieving these scattering Stories.

She didn't want to let go of any one of them. She didn't want to forget about
a single thing.

⸢For the past two years, she hadn't been able to take a single step forward.⸥

Han Sooyoung panted breathlessly and spoke up. "What do you think will
change if you do this now?"

"…"

"Even if you leave, you won't find Kim Dokja. And you can't even go
anywhere."

"…"

"Besides, this world-line's [Ark] is already destroyed. Did you forget what
happened back during the final battle? That isn't an ark. And we can't leave
this world-line even if we wanted to!"

The powers of the two people collided once more. Accompanied by the
loud "Ku-dududu!!" noise, the storm was generated from their magical
energy. Yoo Joonghyuk standing in the center of the storm then replied.

"I've compiled so many Stories up until now, but I still do not know what
my ■■ is."

The vigorous, ferocious Story exploded within the air. He didn't pay any
heed to the precious Stories being damaged and simply swung his fists.

"You wrote my story. In that case, you should also know where my story is
supposed to end."

At that moment, sentences began streaming past Han Sooyoung's head.
⸢Did Yoo Joonghyuk really come here to acquire the [Final Ark]?⸥

The belated realization flooded in.

The regressor weary of the scenarios could only carry on because the
scenarios existed.

Yoo Joonghyuk then began gathering all of his remaining Stories. All these
Stories belonging to a man who had finally escaped from the curse of
regression bared their collective fangs at Han Sooyoung.

"Hit me with everything you've got, Han Sooyoung."

⸢This was Yoo Joonghyuk's last stand.⸥ Every

cell in her body was ringing alarm bells.

The regressor who had repeated lengthy lifetimes.

A certain emotion floated upon those eyes that had been described dozens,
hundreds of times before. Han Sooyoung knew very well what that emotion
was.

Yoo Joonghyuk wished to die in this place.

Not by the hands of anyone, but by the existence who had written his very
first sentence.

"Screw you!! You've never, ever done what I wanted from you, so what the
hell!!"

Kwa-aaaaaaah-!!

Yoo Joonghyuk unleashing all of his might swung his fist again – one
attack that focused all of his great Stories. The climax of the fight was
about to be reached. Han Sooyoung too unleashed all of her Stories. And
then… An explosion akin to a star blowing up rocked the world.
Everything hurt as if her entire body had been pounded on. Every bone in
her right fist thrust forward was broken. Her companions cried out, while
other spectators screamed. Han Sooyoung endured the force of impact
while stuck in this ringing pain harsh enough to tear out her eardrums. Her
whole body was now left in tatters.

Yoo Joonghyuk was collapsed on the ground, unmoving.

Her heart began pounding away.

"Yoo Joonghyuk?"

The tips of his hand trembled ever so faintly. He slowly opened his eyes
and looked up at her. She panted heavily and barely managed to force out
some words.

"…This is a little different from back then in the Dark Castle, right?"

The moment she finished saying that, both of her legs gave way. When did
she get hit? All the bones in her knees had been completely crushed.

"Doesn't look that way," muttered Yoo Joonghyuk.

"You son of a…"

Two of them collapsed face-first into the ground. Han Sooyoung crawled
towards Yoo Joonghyuk. Her anger didn't seem like it'd abate soon unless
she smacked him just one more time, somehow.

Her hand shaking precariously was about to slap him in the back of his
head, but unfortunately, his own right hand shaking pitifully grabbed onto
her wrist first. And so, the arms of two people started a contest of what little
strengths they had left in mid-air, only for them miss each other and sag
down weakly. They truly had not one drop of energy left to continue.

The torn scars left behind in the skies by the collision of their Stories could
be seen. And the view of the distant <Star Stream> could be spied within
the horribly-torn sky. The few remaining stars of the night sky sparkled and
sent their faint rays of light on the two people.

Yoo Joonghyuk staring at that spectacle for a long while spoke in passing.
"…Kim Dokja is supposed to be scattered to the rest of the universe."

Kim Dokja's soul, scattered away into fine little pieces. How much of him
truly remained within those tiny fragments? Even Han Sooyoung couldn't
be sure.

Except that, she was sure of the tiny 'Kim Dokjas' being born as some
things in the mouths of the worlds she hadn't even thought of. He might be
reborn as a human. Maybe the place was similar to Earth. Maybe this time,
he'd be born in another continent, not in the Korean Peninsula.

"Do you think that that fool has become happier now?"

The moment she heard him, Han Sooyoung felt that something had finally
come to an end.

The mouth of her heart ached really painfully. She could clearly hear the
sounds of something breaking – the sounds of a story coming to an end.
The sounds of their truly long mourning finally drawing to a close. That
was the sound of someone only living in their past finally letting go of that
very past. Right at that moment, Han Sooyoung was overcome by the
bizarre guilt of corruption, of betrayal.

"Kim Dokja, he…"

⸢Was it possible that he didn't want us to give up?⸥

Could it be that even if everyone else let go of their long, agonising sorrow,
he wished for just one person to continue on with the acts of sheer stupidity
at the cost of ruining their life?

She heard Yoo Joonghyuk coughing away painfully and muttered out what
she needed to say. "I'm sure he's doing well. He's a tough guy, after all."
"…"

"He's probably living a life of his own out there, and living it happily, too.
Who knows, he might be reading some other weird book in the meantime,
too."

"Even if we find him, the fool probably won't remember anything."

This was the end of their mourning.


There was no meaning in crossing the world-line anymore. Even if they did
find that 'Kim Dokja', what could they possibly do? They couldn't certainly
impose the past on someone who didn't remember. The reincarnated Kim
Dokja wasn't the 'Kim Dokja'. The one they knew no longer existed in this
universe, no matter where they looked.

Even then, Han Sooyoung still blurted out something strange.

"We don't know that. If the 'Ways of Survival' also exists in the place where
he's reincarnated into, then…"

Right away, she felt puzzled by why she said something like that.

"As I said, the Ways of Survival…"

Her mouth continued to mutter out, perhaps to reject her own will.

⸢Kim Dokja, the 'Oldest Dream', has been scattered throughout the
universe.⸥

Her mind began spitting out disorienting sentences one after the other.

⸢This universe is maintained by the imagination of the 'Oldest Dream'.⸥

⸢In that case, what is the 'Oldest Dream' dreaming about right now?⸥
Creeping goosebumps crawled up her arms. She didn't even want to think
about it, yet…

⸢"Ahjussi from another world-line probably likes books, too. Right?"⸥

This was truly a nonsensical delusion.

Even then, despite knowing that, Han Sooyoung couldn't stop her thought
process.

Kim Dokja, reading someone's novel while carrying an expression she
couldn't imagine on the other side of the distant universe.

"That guy, he… Is he still curious about the conclusion to this story, I
wonder?" Han Sooyoung asked.

"…What are you talking about?"

"What if… What if the countless 'Kim Dokjas' scattered to the rest of
universe read a certain story all at the same time…"

⸢Why did Constellations try to spread their own stories as far and as wide as
possible?⸥

⸢How come the foundation of this world was 'stories'?⸥

"What if all those Kim Dokjas who had forgotten that he is the 'Oldest
Dream', dreams of the same story?"

The way to rediscover Kim Dokja, without ruining the lives of the
reincarnated Kim Dokjas living in other world-lines.

Han Sooyoung's hazy, indistinct sounding voice continued on.

"What if the story he's dreaming of… is the same as the story we all wish
for…?"
Her chain of thought was broken only after a pitch-black shadow was cast
over her head.

"This area was earmarked to be renovated as a public park, but thanks to
you two, it's complete chaos here."

Since when was it? Anna Croft was standing there.

"Are you planning to cross the world-line again?"

Han Sooyoung belatedly regained her wits after seeing that woman's face.
She then remembered the delusion she'd been cooking up just now and felt
ashamed by it.

From the get-go, that idea was nonsense. To make Kim Dokjas of other
world-lines dream of the novel she had written. What a crazy and empty
talk that was.

More importantly, there was no way to cross to other world-lines in this
world, anyway.

But then, Anna Croft's expression was somewhat strange. "I thought that a
day like this might come sooner or later."

Her eye was emitting the crimson glow. Her gaze was now directed at the
steeple of the museum.

At the replica of the [Final Ark].

Han Sooyoung's heart began beating faster and faster. Such a thing was not
possible. It shouldn't be possible, but… How?

Ku-gugugu…

Slowly, so very slowly, the so-called replica began floating up from the top
of the museum.
Yoo Joonghyuk and his brows shot up high was already sitting up as he
stared at the airborne object.

The ark – its size might have been very small, but without a doubt, it was
still an ark.

"I collected some parts and had it fixed for the past 20 years, just in case. If
none of you had returned, then I was planning to go and visit you. Although
not many parts could be salvaged and the vessel has not been repaired
completely…"

The ark slowly floating up opened like a capsule and revealed its interior.
This was a very small [Final Ark] where only one person could barely fit
inside.

"It can be used. Except, only one person can ride it."
     Chapter 546: Epilogue 5 - The Eternity and Epilogue, I


Han Sooyoung and Yoo Joonghyuk were taken away in stretchers to the
hospital where Kim Dokja was staying.

While listening to the round of Lee Seolhwa's non-stop nagging, Han
Sooyoung calmly organised the plan of action she came up with. And
exactly one hour later, she told the companions of her idea by using the
most concise words she could think of, while leaving nothing out in the
process.

However, you speaking concisely and precisely didn't automatically mean
your audience would concisely and precisely understand you. The
companions' reactions were like this:

"…What do you want to do, again??"

Jung Heewon asked back, while both Shin Yoosung and Lee Gilyoung
dropped the jaws ever so slightly.

Han Sooyoung replied. "Okay, so, if I put it in a simpler perspective…"
"You are aware of what you've been saying until now, right?"

"…Uh? So you did understand me?"

"We can't do that thing again. Did you already forget about the memories
from two years ago? What happened to us after the group regression…?"

"I'm not saying we should regress."

"This and that are the same! If we cross the world-lines again…!"

"I'm also not saying we should distort the other world-line's future, either.
You did hear what I said, right? I just want to send a single novel to that
side, that's all."

Lee Jihye silently listening to the conversation finally opened her mouth.
"Okay, what you're saying is, you want to show the novel written on this
side to Dokja ahjussi in the other world-line. Did I hear you right?"

"You did."

"What meaning doing that will have?"

Han Sooyoung started her explanation in a composed voice. "The 'Oldest
Dream' is Kim Dokja. And that Kim Dokja was broken down into many
pieces and scattered around to the rest of the world-lines before
reincarnating into different existences. You with me so far?"

"…You think I'm a dummy because I got an F last time?? Okay, so what's
next?"

"The important part starts from there. The newly-reincarnated Kim Dokja
might not be 'Kim Dokja' anymore. However, that doesn't mean he isn't the
'Oldest Dream', either. They themselves might not be aware of it, but all
those souls are the 'Oldest Dream' that maintains this universe."
Back when they escaped from the [Final Wall] for the last time, no one was
left behind in the subway. Yet the universe's time didn't stop. Meaning, the
'Oldest Dream' hadn't disappeared.

The souls that used to be Kim Dokja had scattered to the rest of the
universe and reincarnated, and unbeknownst to even themselves, they were
dreaming of the different universes.

Yoo Sangah nodded her head as if she understood it. "So, you meant to use
their power of imaginations."

"The imagination of the Oldest Dream is reality, after all."

"Making the reincarnated Dokja-ssi dream of the conclusion we all want…"

"That's right. It'll be like we're presenting him with the source of
imagination. So that they can dream about this world's conclusion." Han
Sooyoung studied the faces of her companions one at a time and continued
on. "No one will get hurt this way. No one born in other world-lines will get
harmed. All we have to do is to make those guys read a certain story, that's
it."

Countless Kim Dokjas scattered throughout many world-lines would all be
imagining it. Those born with various appearances, living in various
environments.

There was no meaning in meeting them or bringing them here. The only
thing the companions could hope for in this situation was a miracle.

A miracle that could bring back Kim Dokja they all remembered.

It was fine even if it was all a delusion, a lie – if only he could imagine their
happiness…

If only all those countless 'Kim Dokjas' imagined the one single universe…

A short bout of silence descended on the room. A similar sort of expression
was floating up on the faces of everyone.
They knew full well such a plan had zero chance of becoming reality. In
order to make this plan work, several impossible hurdles had to be cleared
first.

The one who spoke up as the representative of the companions was Lee
Hyunsung, who returned to the country only about 30 minutes ago.

"Sooyoung-ssi."

He had returned in a hurry after hearing about Yoo Joonghyuk and Han
Sooyoung's news. His eyes always burning with righteousness and will to
fight were now obscured by heavy shadows.

"We're all too tired. We're too afraid of hoping."

What made a person truly exhausted was not despair. No, it was 'hope' that
seemingly was on the cusp of coming true but would never become reality.

Han Sooyoung also knew that. She slowly squeezed her fist tightly. "I know
that. That's why I'm asking all of you for a favour."

Lee Hyunsung's eyes trembled the moment he heard the word 'favour'.

Han Sooyoung had never, ever used that sort of expression before.

"I'm aware that it has a very low chance of becoming true. That's why this
is merely… a type of ceremony, if you will. Something that must be done,
to put the finishing touch on the past and to live the remainder of my life
properly."

Jung Heewon asked her. "…What can we help you with?"

Rather than a verbal reply, Han Sooyoung placed her notebook PC on the
hospital room's desk and accessed a certain text file, one that they were
intimately familiar with.

A novel with its title still left as "no subject".
Han Sooyoung slowly, so very slowly, began typing the title of the novel.



From that day on, Han Sooyoung poured her entire being on writing the
novel along with assistance from her companions. Even if it was her, she
didn't retain every bit of memories in perfect order, so to complete the
story, she had to borrow her companions' own memories.

"So, we'll make Dokja ahjussi read this novel… But, how will we do that?"

"We somehow need to make him come across it naturally, without him
feeling any disharmony. To the extent that he doesn't even realize he's
currently imagining this world."

"Meaning, we gotta write a seriously entertaining story."

"Dokja hyung read a boring novel till its end, so won't he read it even if we
write it like, whatever?"

Han Sooyoung looked at the glib-sounding Lee Gilyoung and shook her
head. "We don't know what might happen, so we gotta do our best. Kim
Dokja of other world-line might not be as patient as ours, after all."

"Let me help!"

"Me too! Noona, you don't know the lingo the teens use nowadays, right?"

The novel was compiled in Kim Dokja's hospital room most of the time.
After ending her lectures, Han Sooyoung would come to visit him in his
ward. Other companions also took turns to pay him a visit.

"Sorry, I'm late. I had an announcement to make tomorrow, so…" said Lee
Jihye.

"It would've been still fine to come after you were finished," replied Han
Sooyoung.
"No can do. Today's the scene of my awakening, right?" Lee Jihye's voice
was filled with so much excitement. She scanned the manuscript Han
Sooyoung had written and continued to yap on. "Wow. This place… Hah, I
really almost died back then."

"…"

"Keuh-heuh. Reading this part again still gives me the goosebumps. Eonni,
you don't mind me asking you when I'm supposed to show up ag…"

"If you're planning to bother me, just get out."

"Ah? Why are you being so cold? I even found a mistake in the setting, you
know."

"A mistake? Where?"

"I never said anything like this!"

Lee Jihye pointed at the screen. Han Sooyoung glanced at the younger girl's
phone, and spoke up. A closer look revealed that the scene in question came
from when Lee Jihye was saying her piece during the theatre dungeon.

Han Sooyoung explained. "Some creative licence is unavoidable, so some
parts might be a little different from what happened in reality. But that
part…"

⸢"Why do you think you're alone? We're here together, aren't we! No, hang
on a sec… I'm always by your side, aren't I?! So, don't lose hope! Think
about our kid…!⸥

"…I wrote that according to what Uriel told me, though?"

One day. Two days. Three. Sentences were diligently compiled.

When she couldn't recall the past properly, she'd even start pinching the
sleeping Kim Dokja's cheeks. And when her resentment flared up for no
reason whatsoever, she'd even write some weird things in the novel, as well.
⸢"Find the ugly king!"⸥

Well, it probably didn't matter, anyway. He'd not even realize that this was
his own story, after all.

The companions came to visit the hospital room in alternating turns as if
they were entering confessional booths.

"Actually, Dokja-ssi was cursing a little bit during here…"

"Ah, don't write what I just said. Understand? …Hey, I told you to omit the
part, so why?"

They all seemed quite surprised by the fact that they still remembered so
much of the story, and…

"N-no, wait! Noona! I do respect hyung, but… But, what are you doing,
portraying me as some sort of a religious fanatic??"

…And, they seemed to be finding peace with the fact that they still
remembered this story, too.

They sometimes cried, or read the memos containing story beats that would
soon form the part of the story in the future.

Shin Yoosung asked. "By the way, why did you portray regression so
negatively like this?"

"Well, even in that world, Kim Dokja should only have one life, that's why.
He might get badly influenced by reading this, right? I mean, he could still
be a young kid there."

At her reply, a shadow drew upon Shin Yoosung's complexion. "But, we
regressed, didn't we? In that case, will it be fine to write this part differently
from reality?"

"Nah. I'm just going to write it as is."
"Pardon? But why?"

"Doesn't matter who, every human is a regressor."

There was a certain sentence she thought of while fighting against Yoo
Joonghyuk. In all honesty, she didn't expect Shin Yoosung to get what she
was saying, anyway.

The younger girl stared at the sentences for a little while, before shifting her
gaze to the outside of the window. "Our regression couldn't influence this
world-line at all. When I think about it sometimes, it feels like the last
night's passing dream. What is the difference between the past that couldn't
change the present, and a delusion that can't change anything?"

Han Sooyoung was somewhat taken aback from that, and her lips bobbed
up and down in a pout, only for Shin Yoosung to shrug her shoulders and
smile back at her. "What if we write it too hard to understand and Dokja
ahjussi doesn't get it?"

"…Kim Dokja will definitely get it."

"You really do believe in him, don't you?"

"If you're going to bother me like this, just get out."

"No, wait! I've organised everything that happened in the past, you know!
Even the 'Disaster of Flood' you asked me about, I have…"

Not everyone was as helpful as Shin Yoosung, though. No, actually, the
majority of them simply interfered with her writing, instead. For instance,
in Jang Hayoung's case:

"Hey, you!! You said I'm the second part's protagonist! What are you
basing that on?! You making fun of me??"

"That's just a figure of speech. You're not the real protagonist, right?" Han
Sooyoung replied.
"Even then!"

"I'll write side stories about you. In huge chapters, no less."

"Cool."

Lee Seolhwa passing by while pushing a stretcher past the room also said
something. "Normally, healers in a story like this are portrayed as heal
shuttles, aren't they?"

"…Fine. Lee Seolhwa, you get a side story, too."

On top of this, Lee Gilyoung completely skipping his school to come to the
hospital, and Lee Hyunsung, throwing a big tantrum as if he had been
wronged by something.

"You just omitted all the events I had to go through after signing the
contract with Abaddon! And also, I've lots of skills so why is it always
cockroaches this and cockroaches that?!"

"You've completely revised my military life! But, haven't I earnestly
described everything that happened since my days as a private…!"

"Both of you, will you just put a lid on it?! Kim Dokja is the main character
of this story! I'm telling you, this isn't your story!" Han Sooyoung yelled at
them.

Even Constellations came to visit one by one after hearing about the news.

For instance, Uriel carrying huge piles of unidentifiable documents while
kitted out in a disguise of sunglasses and a face mask.

[You should've called me right away if you were planning to write
something like this! And I have this much extensive data on the subject
matter, too!]

"…Can any of this data even be trusted? I mean, what you said differed
quite a lot from what Lee Jihye told me, you know?"
[N-no, well, it can be a tiiiiny bit different, but, but! This universe is truly
vast and countless Kim Dokjas are living out there in countless world-lines,
so…]

After that, the Great Sage, Heaven's Equal.

[If you're going to write about my Story, you should've at least read the
fully translated Journey to the West. Have you?]

"I read it as manga."

[In that case, you should know by now who the real protagonist of the
Journey to the West is.]

"I thought it was Tang Sanzang?"

Then, the Abyssal Black Flame Dragon.

[How disappointing. Have you really forgotten about my true name? It's
already the second part, so how come my true name hasn't been-]

"You never told me in the first place. And you know what, you don't have
to tell me, either."

And so – around the time the first draft of the manuscript with about 250
chapters was completed, Han Sooyoung became almost completed wasted
from all the fatigue building up inside her. It'd be her first time writing a
novel so arduously like this. So many parts of it weren't to her liking, and
too many portions needed lots of revising. But right now, the 'quantity' was
her priority. Because…

– Han Sooyoung. It'll be this week, Saturday.

…Because there wasn't a lot of time left, that's why.
     Chapter 547: Epilogue 5 - The Eternity and Epilogue, II


Now normally, you'd need around two years at most to complete the first
draft of a manuscript. However, there was no such leeway in this world-
line.

– The system is losing its powers too quickly. If we miss this week, then I
fear that we won't have enough persuasive power to launch the ark.

In the end, Han Sooyoung decided to start the first wave of transmission
after finishing up the second part of the manuscript.

The companions grew excited after hearing about the news of the
manuscript's dispatch.

Yoo Sangah asked. "How will you transport the file? In a USB?"

"We'll prepare for various contingencies, but… Fundamentally, it needs to
be taken in the form of a Story," replied Han Sooyoung.

"Who will deliver it, though?"
"Obviously me."

"No can do. If Sooyoung-ssi leaves, who will look after Dokja-ssi of this
place if something happens to him?"

Even if he was only a shell, he was still Kim Dokja. If something strange
happened to him and Han Sooyoung possessing the Bureau's Story wasn't
around, his main body might crumble away.

Yoo Sangah continued on. "Let me go. I know the exact coordinates of the
world-line where Dokja-ssi has reincarnated."

But that only prompted Jung Heewon to try to dissuade her. "Sangah-ssi,
you need to defend this world, you know! Let me go. Give me the
coordinates."

"No way! I'll go and meet hyung!"

"I'm ahjussi's Incarnation, so obviously I should go!"

"That's not right. I'm the foremost expert on all things related to the 'Demon
King of Salvation', so it should be me…!"

Lee Gilyoung, Shin Yoosung and even Jang Hayoung joined the fray,
turning the inside of the hall into pure chaos. Constellations and
Incarnations were arguing with each other, saying they should be the one to
make the trip.

Yoo Sangah sighed while looking at them. "It's not as easy as you all think.
Everyone here is aware of how dangerous it is to cross a world-line, yes?"

"Well, yeah…"

"If the coordinate I traced is correct, then the world-line in question is right
at the outer-most edge of the universe."

"Outer-most edge?"
"Meaning, it's a world where 'scenarios' might not even exist."

No one knew what the world Kim Dokja had reincarnated into was like. It
could be fundamentally different from their Earth.

"The system's grace could get much weaker when you reach there. Which
means, the powers of both skills and Stigmata will naturally weaken, as
well. The length of the voyage will be quite an ask, too."

Anna Croft listening to the explanation nodded her head in agreement. She
then looked up at the ark currently performing a test flight up in the sky.
"As the vessel has been cobbled together as a single-seater, the equipment
installed on board isn't the greatest. Especially when you're crossing the
Dark Stratum, enduring the storm of aftermath will prove to be a massive
challenge. Only the person possessing a very powerful mind is qualified.
One mistake, and you may even end up as an 'Outer God', that's why."

The 'Outer God' – that term cast a dark shadow on the expressions of a
handful of the companions. They had recalled the sight of 'Hounds Chasing
After the Abyss' doggedly pursuing them, that's why.

Unfortunately, Anna Croft wasn't done with her explanation. "And there are
far too many world-lines where his soul has scattered to, as well. At the
bare minimum, you'll have to cross hundreds of thousands, maybe even
millions, of world-lines… Are you prepared for that eventuality?"

Hundreds of thousands. Even if you were to cross one world-line per day,
the trip might end up lasting for hundreds of years with that estimate. Even
if it was for Kim Dokja, could anyone be able to last that lengthy period of
time without losing their sanity?

"None of you are capable."

The man who could survive even when receiving the absolute minimum
grace of the system.

The man who would not lose himself even when swimming against the
boundless torrents of time.
And that's why, the man with the highest odds of succeeding in this mission
among the companions.

"I'll be the one to head out."

The ark's passenger had already been decided.




Eventually, the ark's date of departure had arrived.

Han Sooyoung observed Yoo Joonghyuk currently getting ready to
disembark from some distance away.

"I'm not putting on that thing."

"Supreme King, you must wear it. Don't forget that you're no longer the
same as your past self."

Now, this was a spectacle she would've liked to show to Kim Dokja of five
years ago. If he heard about how the prophet was trying to ensure the safety
of the regressor, just what would be the thoughts entering his mind?

"You're really becoming a bother."

"You might be saying that now, but this will definitely come in handy later
on. Being a Transcendent does not mean you're completely free from the
system's influences. Transcendents are existences validated only through
their opposition to the system. If the latter disappears, then the former's
powers will, of course, grow progressively weaker in turn."

Yoo Joonghyuk glared at Anna Croft with disapproving eyes, before
putting on the offered equipment one by one.

"This is a cumbersome attire for combat."
"You are not going there to fight, so it'll be fine."

Yoo Joonghyuk's new bloated appearance after putting on the spacesuit was
truly a sight to behold. Han Sooyoung began teasing him.

"That look really suits you."

"…You're being noisy."

"You should think this over. You really wanna do this?"

Even as the departure time crept ever closer, Han Sooyoung still didn't feel
confident at all.

⸢Honestly speaking, maybe there was no reason to go this far.⸥

The voyage about to take place this time was completely different from the
regression or jumping between the world-lines. They weren't trying to
change the past, nor were they trying to steal the right 'materials' to open the
[Final Wall] of the other world-line.

This voyage, in some ways, was much closer to a pilgrimage. One where he
was trying to commemorate that one person they had been searching for all
this time.

"Hand over the manuscript."

"Your manner of speech hasn't changed even though you stopped being a
regressor."

Han Sooyoung sighed and opened her right hand. The power of a Stigma
she had been developing until now was circling around the tip of her hand.

[Stigma, 'Cloud System', is on stand-by.]

This was a similar method to how [The Fourth Wall] handed the text files
over to Kim Dokja in the past.
The Stigma itself was evolved from her [Predictive Plagiarism] capable of
sending obtuse messages across the world-lines.

"It's possible for those possessing this Stigma to share the manuscript.
Coming back to Earth several times for the new versions will be too
difficult even for you, so I'll just keep sending you the manuscripts through
the cloud."

"Are you telling me to learn your unique Stigma? We don't have the time
to…"

"Right, we don't have the time. But there is a way to learn it super fast. You
don't have a Constellation backer anymore, do you?"

Right away, Yoo Joonghyuk realized what Han Sooyoung was saying.
"You fool, are you really…"

"You think I'm enjoying the idea myself?"

While furrowing his brows, he accessed his attribute window. When his
Stigma [Regression] vanished, his Constellation sponsor had disappeared as
well.


  Sponsor: None


He was a completely free man.

"Are you suggesting that I take on someone weaker than me as my backer?"

"But I won against you the last time."

"I don't understand the rubbish you're spewing."

"What, you wanna have another go?"
Even though they didn't concede an inch and continued to bicker, they still
finished signing the [Sponsor Contract]. Both of them knew this was the
most optimum method available, that's why.

[Constellation, 'Architect of the False Last Act', has become Incarnation
'Yoo Joonghyuk's Constellation backer!]

[Incarnation, 'Yoo Joonghyuk', has inherited the Stigma, 'Cloud System'.]

[Two beings' imaginary cloud network have been connected!]

"I've never imagined that I'd live long enough to see the day like this one. I
wish I could tell that idiot Kim Dokja about this somehow," muttered Han
Sooyoung.

"Once I make my way back, I'll kill you first and cancel this ridiculous
contract."

"Try it if you can."

After their exchange came to an end there, they stared at each other for a
little while.

"Don't forget. You must not destroy the other world-line. You just have to
spread this story there. So that Kim Dokja of that world will get to read it,"
said Han Sooyoung.

"I know."

"Don't die."

"I'll be back soon."

He might never come back. Both of them knew that, but no one deliberately
tried to bring that point up. With the exception of one person, that was.

"Oppa." The tearful Yoo Mia held onto Yoo Joonghyuk's spacesuit. "You're
lying! You aren't going to come back! You can't, even if you wanted to!"
"I won't abandon you and die."

As Yoo Mia continued to shed her tears, Han Sooyoung tightly held her
shoulders. Yoo Joonghyuk slowly lowered himself and matched his little
sister's eye line, then spoke in a gentle, loving tone of voice.

"I give you my word. I will definitely return."

As he turned around to leave, he sent Han Sooyoung a message.

– Look after Mia for me.

He didn't look behind once and climbed aboard the [Final Ark]. And when
Anna Croft gave her signal, the vessel's ignition was turned on.

The companions belatedly hearing about the news soon arrived and
watched everything unfold.

The ark slowly rose up to the sky. The voices of the companions wouldn't
have been able to enter the vessel's tightly-enclosed cockpit.

Lee Jihye breathlessly running over here looked up at the departing ark.

"Aren't you going to say goodbye?" Han Sooyoung asked her.

"If I do, I feel like it's going to be the last time I see him."

Despite saying that, Lee Jihye's eyes were brimming full of tears. Other
companions also looked up at the ark without saying anything.

Yoo Sangah broke the silence first. "Everything we wanted to say are in the
novel, anyway. I'm sure Joonghyuk-ssi will read it later on."

"What's the point of him reading it? Hyung reading it, that's all that
matters."

Lee Gilyoung, Shin Yoosung, Jung Heewon, Lee Hyunsung, Jang
Hayoung, Yoo Sangah, Lee Seolhwa, Lee Sookyung, Gong Pildu. And
then, the Constellations, too. Everyone stood there and watched the ark
leave.

Shin Yoosung asked. "Will Dokja ahjussi really read our story?"

That was uncertain. No one in existence would know that. This mission had
high odds of failure, and the odds of Yoo Joonghyuk coming back home
empty-handed were also very high.

And their story could disappear as mere cosmic dust in some distant
universe.

The departing Yoo Joonghyuk should know about that, as well. Even then,
he chose to leave. He left, for his own sake. Maybe, also for other
companions, too.

"If it's Kim Dokja, he'll read it," replied Han Sooyoung.

At the very least, the people of this world would be able to carry on with
their lives while waiting for his news – waiting for Yoo Joonghyuk's return.

"He made a promise with me."

The ark's flames lit up as it reached towards the distant galaxy. The
companions endlessly looked on at the ark getting further away as if it was
an expedition ship sailing towards another world. A story written through
their lives was disappearing to a place forever out of their reach.




[The 'Ark' is entering the atmosphere.]

[Waiting for the user Yoo Joonghyuk's destination input.]
Yoo Joonghyuk inputted the coordinates of the world-line Yoo Sangah told
him. Even the coordinates of the next nearest world-line to it was incredibly
far away. Just as she said, that place might not have <Star Stream> there.

[The dimensional acceleration will commence.]

[Portion of necessary energy will be substituted by the Coins.]

Coins amassed in the other world-line were injected as the energy source
of the vessel. They had lost their value with the weakening of the system,
but still, they used to be the strongest Story in the world once upon a time.
Before long, the planet Earth could no longer be seen. [Entering the Dark
Stratum to escape from the world-line.] Yoo Joonghyuk recalled what
Yoo Sangah said.

 –         The world-line Dokja-ssi has reincarnated into is located very far
 away.
Meaning, I don't know how long it will take to get there if you leave the
world-line through the conventional means.

The world Kim Dokja had reincarnated into existed outside the 'Ways of
Survival' – a place that had completely escaped from this world-line's
influence.

 –       More than likely, you'll have to go through the 'doorway' that
 allows you toleave this world-line.

How long passed by like this? Things resembling bubbles began appearing
far ahead of him. These bubbles of various hues expanded and contracted
repeatedly within the ominous currents. He even sensed this faint feeling of
foreboding, too. Yoo Joonghyuk knew what caused this feeling.

Tsu-chuchuchu…

The 'vice-king' of the 'Outer Gods', as well as the master of the dimensional
doorway between the world-lines. And the existence that opened the path to
the 1863rd turn for Kim Dokja once upon a time. Yoo Joonghyuk
unknowingly swallowed back his own saliva. This thing before him
possessed more than enough power to make him nervous, the man who
managed to clear the scenarios.

【Y o u a r e… n o t t h e P l o t t e r.】

A massive eye could be seen within the sea of foams. Yoo Joonghyuk
increased the speed of the ark, not even trying to dodge that eye. In order to
get to the world-line at the furthest edge of the universe, he simply had to
go through this path.

【T h a t i s outside t h e story】

"Doesn't matter. Step away, or I'll cut you down."

Yoo Joonghyuk aroused every bit of his Stories and pushed the ark forward.
The vice-king didn't try to stop him. However, it only spoke in a pitying,
empty-sounding tone of voice.

【Oh, t h e o n e dreaming o f t h e dream's outside, y o u r dream c a n n o t
b e f u l f i l l e d.】

The moment he collided with the doorway, the view before his eyes
completely distorted. He gritted his teeth and fought back against the storm
pouncing on him.

A violent storm of sparks began ravaging and devouring his entire body. He
endured the urge to scream as horrifying pain akin to his whole body
breaking apart took him over.

 –         There's one last thing I wanted to ask you about.

Han Sooyoung's voice trickled past inside his disoriented head.

 –      Why are you going so far to save Kim Dokja? You've lost
 manycompanions by now already.
 –      Having lost many companions before doesn't mean you
 becomeaccustomed to the pain of loss. And also…

Explosions began going off inside the ark. Debris from the broken
instruments began floating away in the universe.

 –         …I have something I need to ask that fool.

Yet another explosion resounded out, and an object pierced into Yoo
Joonghyuk's torso.

[Failed to read the world-line's coordinates!]

[Warning! An error has occurred in the coordinate recognition device!]

[An error has occurred in the interior temperature modulation device!]

…

…

[An error has occurred in the ship's navigation system!]

Sparks exploding abruptly dominated Yoo Joonghyuk's entire body. His
vision was dyed in pure white, and his consciousness faded away.

By the time he managed to open his eyes, he was already lost in space.
     Chapter 548: Epilogue 5 - The Eternity and Epilogue, III


⸢4th day of drifting.⸥

Yoo Joonghyuk barely managed to regain his consciousness and discovered
a sharp piece of debris stabbing him in his abdomen. He calmly got rid of
the debris and checked the status of the vessel's hull.

⸢6th day of drifting.⸥

He realized that the ark had completely lost all its functions. The navigation
system was unresponsive, and he couldn't see a single thing nearby. As a
matter of fact, he couldn't even see a single planet nearby.

⸢11th day of drifting.⸥

With several of the safety systems installed within the ark destroyed,
abnormality began manifesting in Yoo Joonghyuk's body.

[System's homeostasis is currently broken!]
[Power of chaos is eroding your entire body.]

[Your Story is crumbling away little by little.]

Some kind of a problem must've occurred somewhere, because all the
abilities realized through the system had become completely paralysed. Yoo
Joonghyuk remained calm as he inspected the Stories currently with him.
Thankfully, his Stories were all safe.

[Story, 'Hell of Eternity', is enveloping you.]

The flames of hell protected him from the bitter coldness.

⸢21st day of drifting.⸥

The spacesuit Anna Croft made him wear really did come in handy. If it
weren't for the built-in protective functionality of the suit, the rate of his
body crumbling away would've been so much faster.

Yoo Joonghyuk did whatever he could to repair the ark's power source.
Although the job performed wasn't of professional quality, the vessel still
started moving again. Unfortunately, the collision caused the fuel tank
reserved for a rainy day to blow up, and the ark needed his Story energy to
operate.

He failed to repair the self-navigation system and the auto-pilot, though.
Meaning, he had to pilot the craft personally.

⸢34th day of drifting.⸥

He needed to somehow find his original route.

⸢42nd day of drifting.⸥

As the days of his Story needing to be exhausted increased, fatigue began
accumulating in his body. Instances of him briefly losing his consciousness
happened more and more frequently. The darkness was eating away at his
mind.

…Why did I come this far?

There were moments when his purpose would become blurry, uncertain. He
came this far to carry out his mission. To deliver a 'story' to the reincarnated
Kim Dokja. To revive the 'Kim Dokja' his companions remembered.

Why, though? He still had something he simply had to ask Kim Dokja,
that's why.

…But what was the question?

⸢58th day of drifting.⸥

The moment he saw a wane face reflected on the ark's window, Yoo
Joonghyuk recalled the forgotten question.

– In a world where the scenarios have come to an end, what should he do to
continue living on?

That's right. That's what he wanted to ask Kim Dokja. Because that guy
knew everything.

Kim Dokja, always thinking about the end. The man who planned for
everything, and didn't hesitate to sacrifice his own life to see the conclusion
of a certain story.

A fool like that should know, he thought.

If it was Kim Dokja, then he should know more about Yoo Joonghyuk than
Yoo Joonghyuk knew about himself. That's what the latter thought.

The regressor who stopped regressing – just what would become of him?

Lee Jihye said that she suffered from nightmares every night.
But for him, his life had been a constant nightmare for the longest time. The
only reason why he managed to endure until now was because he still had a
goal, an aim, which he hadn't achieved yet. However, that goal was now no
more, and the scenario had ended, as well.

The regressor Yoo Joonghyuk was free.

But as he stood before the hard-earned freedom, he couldn't figure out what
exactly he had finally earned.

⸢83rd day of drifting.⸥

As his directionless drifting went on and on, the Stories covering his skin
decreased precipitously. The amount of Story scattering into space
gradually increased.

His voyage continued on, but he didn't even know where he was heading to.

⸢102rd day of drifting.⸥

Yoo Joonghyuk began reading Han Sooyoung's novel.

He thought that by reading it, he'd be able to endure against time, somehow.

⸢111th day of drifting.⸥

While reading about Kim Dokja's story, he began to harbour this faint hint
of anticipation.

He thought that the Kim Dokja from this story should be able to answer his
question.

From the first episode onwards, he studiously read about Kim Dokja's life.

Some events he already knew, while some others were unfamiliar to him.
He'd stop reading when he reached certain sentences, too.
⸢That feeling of being left alone past the full stop of the story, right after the
protagonist and the side characters all stepped into the sentence of
'Everyone lived happily ever after'. Struck by the sense of emptiness and
betrayal, the young me couldn't fight against the loneliness and writhed
around in pain.⸥

What was 'happiness'? That term felt so very alien to Yoo Joonghyuk. He
thought he might have felt such an emotion from somewhere within the
memories of the 0th turn that he managed to steal a glance earlier.
However, that was no longer his life.

⸢128th day of drifting.⸥

To him, the figure of Kim Dokja relying on nothing else besides the 'Ways
of Survival' to survive came across as alien. He read many times, yet he just
couldn't understand it very well.

How could a mere story like this be able to support a life?

⸢154th day of drifting.⸥

Little by little, Yoo Joonghyuk grew accustomed to reading the novel.

He even found some passages that he liked reading over and over again. ⸢I
grabbed the hind leg rich in the perfect amount of fat and bit into the flesh.
The gravy gently oozing out from the meat… I closed my eyes, having even
forgotten to chew. As I thought, reading about it and actually tasting it are
two different things.⸥

It was a scene that happened early on, when Kim Dokja and the
companions had recently entered the scenarios – when they roasted the
meat from the mole rats. Yoo Joonghyuk pulled out a slice of dried meat
from inside his coat underneath the spacesuit and began chewing on it while
reading that passage again. He slowly closed his eyes and chewed, and it
almost felt as if he was with the companions within the damp darkness of
the subway.

⸢155th day of drifting.⸥

But when he opened his eyes, he was still all alone.

Yoo Joonghyuk dazedly sitting there began reading the novel again.

⸢211th day of drifting.⸥

He continued to read this story all by himself, and…

⸢258th day of drifting.⸥

…And, read the story again.

⸢279th day of drifting.⸥

He finally understood Kim Dokja just a little.

⸢316th day of drifting.⸥

[Your Stories have absorbed your emotions.]

Every time he read Han Sooyoung's novel, the consumed Stories would
regain their vitality for fleeting moments. Although it couldn't match the
speed of consumption, he wouldn't have been able to hold on until now if
he didn't read the story.

However, he couldn't simply hold on forever.

Kim Dokja within the novel was saying this.

⸢"That's why you should've read it until the end, you know."⸥

What did it mean to read a story to its end?
Although he couldn't fully understand it, Yoo Joonghyuk still chose to heed
that advice.

⸢333th day of drifting.⸥

Abruptly, he realized the reason why his failure was inevitable.

⸢"Even if you manage to save the world, you still won't be saved. The
moment you save the world, the worlds you have cast away would pounce
on you. Even if you do save one world, every other world you have
forsaken will drag you down to hell."⸥

Yoo Joonghyuk stared at the distant universe and thought to himself.

What could've it been like if this was the first, or the second, regression
turn? What if he had completely forgotten about the memories from his
previous lives? If he had no clue whatsoever of the lives from his previous
regressions, then maybe, just maybe, couldn't he have found his answer
already, instead of wandering aimlessly like this? Maybe, he wouldn't have
to suffer like this?

Could he have finally understood what the 'happy ending' of other stories
was like?

Could he have moved forward, in order to not die?

Ku-gugugugu…

The ark's hull began vibrating. Wondering what was going on, he enhanced
his perception to sweep over the surroundings, only to discover a huge
horde dyeing the universe ash-grey. They were existences he was quite
familiar with.

【OhOhOhOhOhOhOh…!】

Existences that were discarded from the world-lines, and ejected from the
scenarios.
The enormous waves of 'Outer Gods' were flooding in his direction. A faint
scent of fear could be picked up coming from them. They were being
chased by some things.

Kwa-du-duk!

One of the 'Nameless Ones' escaping at the rear of the pack was pierced by
something. Soon, he spotted the 'Hounds Chasing After the Abyss' easily
numbering thousands chasing down the 'Outer Gods' like wolves corralling
the flock of sheep.

Every time a 'Nameless One' was hunted down, an incredible explosion of
sparks occurred in between the flood. The storm of energy was gradually
growing larger and larger. At this rate, his vessel would get swept up much
sooner than later.

【SavemeSavemeSavemeSaveme】

Eventually, the front pack of the flood overtook the ark. The 'Nameless
Ones' desperately ran. The eyes of the creatures resembling cephalopods
glanced in Yoo Joonghyuk's direction.

Craaack!

A monster's body was pierced through without resistance by the hound's
fangs. The pitch-black lump of Story spewing out by the dying monster
splattered onto the cockpit's window like paint. The cephalopod monster
was staring at him in resentment as it fell.

Yoo Joonghyuk had seen those eyes before, once upon a time.

⸢"If so, what about the people who are different from me? What about Jihye
eonni, Hyunsung oppa, and Seolhwa eonni? Those who fought only for
your sake, just who were they to you??"⸥

Right at that moment, Yoo Joonghyuk thought he could finally understand
what his ■■ was.
He understood how a regressor finished with his regressions should carry
on living.

He understood the true conclusion he was supposed to reach.

From the very beginning, such a thing could never be determined by his
own will alone.

[The Ark's cockpit is opening.]

The moment he opened the cockpit, the hounds began rushing in his
direction.

Yoo Joonghyuk gripped the [Black Heavenly Demon Sword] in reverse and
cut the head off of a hound. The waves from the other world splitting apart,
brushed past while clawing at him.

【WhatWhatWhatWhatWhat】

【YouareYouareYouareYouareYouare】

He watched the 'Nameless Ones' flood past him and recalled the story he
had been reading not too long ago.

Maybe, Han Sooyoung knew about it already.

⸢"You wrote my story. In that case, you should also know where my story is
supposed to end."⸥
She probably knew the truth that this story would never reach the
reincarnated Kim Dokjas.

That was why, he must never return to Earth.

He must never let his companions know of his survival.

His absence must become their eternal hope.
And maybe that was the fitting final verse to the regressor who had
destroyed countless worlds.

【Grrrrrr…!】

As he continued to smack away the pouncing hounds, Yoo Joonghyuk
thought about the disappearing story.

"Be gone!!"

His lion-like roar using magical energy as the foundation caused the hounds
hiding in between the 'Outer Gods' to raise their heads. These hounds then
formed lines and attacked Yoo Joonghyuk simultaneously. His arms were
punctured, and the protective equipment worn over his legs were torn off
from him. Stories began leaking out from the ripped-open gaps of the
tattered spacesuit. Bit by bit, he was losing his strength.

His lengthy regression journey.

Yoo Joonghyuk instinctively realized that this was his conclusion.

'This is the end I wished to see'.

It could've been a slightly more excellent conclusion.

If he had made a different choice back then, or maybe, if he chose to go
down the better direction, then… Yoo Joonghyuk smiled bitterly.

In the end, he remained a regressor even until his final moment.

He knew it. He knew there was no better conclusion than this. He knew
that, regardless of what choices he might have made in different moments
of his life, he'd still end up regretting something about them.

Even then, he'd regret and eventually, repeat the result of all his regretting.

【YouYouYouYouYouYou】
【WhoWhoWhoWhoWho】

That was the summary of his life.

"I'm Yoo Joonghyuk."

At least a handful of people would be saved by his life.

Kwa-aaaaaah-!

Thousands upon thousands of hounds pounced in his direction. As if he was
atoning for his sins, Yoo Joonghyuk wielded his sword and wielded it some
more. With each and every one of his attacks, those 'Nameless Ones' with
forgotten names received their salvation.

Coldness began circulating in his entire body. The amount of Story leaking
out from the tattered spacesuit continued to increase. He felt dizzy and his
vision flickered. Yoo Joonghyuk squeezed out every last drop of magical
energy.

Breaking the Sky Swordsmanship.

Destruction Technique.

Breaking the Sky Meteor Strike.

The vicious, violent fragments of the sword fell like a meteor shower and
penetrated the hounds. However, some hounds managed to evade the sword
strike and continued to run towards him.

【Krrrrrng!!】

Right next second, something collided with his head and the helmet
protecting his face broke into pieces.

[Warning! Your Story is scattering away. Return to the ark immediately!]

[Your Story is…]
Adrift droplets of blood were freezing up. Hounds were tearing into his
entire body. And the story Han Sooyoung had written were breaking apart
among the torn, ripped Story fragments scattering away.

'…Mia-yah'.

Stories kept scattering away like stardust. Yoo Joonghyuk watched that
spectacle and quietly thought about the lonely space no one would ever
imagine. The 'Nameless Ones' were witnessing his final moments with their
empty eyes.

This story they had compiled would be forgotten sooner or later.

It'd become a story no one would read.

Yoo Joonghyuk summoned the last vestiges of his strength and gripped the
hilt of the sword tightly. He stabbed the neck of the hound biting his thigh,
and cut apart its body.

A regressor might only know how to regret, but he'd never give up.
⸢"Maybe this regression turn you are about to abandon could be the 'one
single turn' where you might get to witness the end of this world as a
'human being', you know."⸥

The one and only way for him to live on as a human being.

And that was to never give up on this story.

Kwa-duduk!

Something bit his neck, and his vision was dyed crimson in colour.

His eyes slowly closed. This really was his final moments.

Tsu-chuchu…

However, he saw the darkness before his eyes distort as his vision gradually
blurred.
Was he hallucinating? Something was standing over there. The ends of the
black coat were seemingly dancing within the pure-white Story fragments.

【What a pitiful sight this is, the third turn.】

Someone was talking to him from there.

【This will be my last time helping you.】
