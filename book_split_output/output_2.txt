51: Ep. 11 – Night of the Prophets, II


"A prophet like us?"

"Yes. At first, I didn't realize he was a prophet. Now it looks like he is. He
knew the future like you."

"…Then?"

"It seems like he knows a lot more than you do. He killed the Delusional
Demon and gobbled up the hidden scenarios in the beginning. Thanks to
that, my plan became twisted."

"T-There is a guy like that…?"

Of course there was. The person was right in front of you.

"He even seems to be impersonating me. When I encountered him last time,
he was on the verge of death but he is still likely to be active near
Chungmuro."
[The constellation 'Secretive Plotter' admires your impudence.]
"…Chungmuro? Don't tell me?"

Jung Minseob was surprised and opened his smartphone, tapping the
keyboard like Lee Sungkook. Maybe he was informing the other prophets.

Jung Minseob asked me a few more questions and I answered them briefly.

"It is like this! Ah… then the third regression changed… You really are
Yoo Joonghyuk."

Jung Minseob was deeply impressed.

"That's why you got that girl instead of the Delusional Demon. She seems
enough to replace Kim Namwoon. She overpowered me in one blow…"
The most important thing was their misunderstanding.

Jung Minseob thought for a while before saying, "But when listening to
Yoo
Joonghyuk's story, I seem to know who killed the Delusional Demon."

"…You know?"

"Yes. I said this before… let me tell you this in advance, not all prophets
are on the same side."

I expected to hear this conversation. If there were 48 who knew the future,
there would be some people who thought wrongly.

"There are those who call themselves the Twelve Apostles. They believe
they are the only ones who have read the real revelation and that they can
change this world."

12 people. It was an exact match to the number of people who read up to
chapter 50 of Ways of Survival.
"Why are they different from you?"

"They… they have read more of the revelation than us."

I was right.

"Right now, there are 11 known apostles. I'm guessing that the prophet that
Yoo Joonghyuk-nim met is the last unknown apostle."

As they were creative people, they adapted when thrown into the scenario.
This was a convenient misunderstanding. No, wait a minute… a
misunderstanding?

If I thought about it, one of the 12 people who read up to chapter 50 would
be me.

"You don't have any good feelings towards the apostles?"

"To tell the truth… that's right. Unlike us, they are planning to use the
Book of Revelation to conquer this world." …Why was my conscience
pricked?

"They are the ones who pursue their own interests and sincerity rather than
stop the destruction of the world by helping Yoo Joonghyuk. They are like
the 10 Evils."

"10 Evils…"

"That's why I would like to ask Yoo Joonghyuk-nim. Please lead us. Stop
them."

I see. This was their real purpose. To be honest, it was a bit surprising. I
never thought they would need me because of infighting between the
prophets. I thought for a moment before opening my mouth.

"Okay. I accept. I will form an alliance."
"R-Really?"

"However, I have one condition."

Lee Sungkook and Jung Minseob's faces were tense as they waited for the
conditions.

"First, give me Changsin Station."

"Huh? Changsin Station…"

"It is the station right above Dongmyo. Haven't you eaten it already?"

"Ah, then Chungmuro's target station…"

Jung Minseob seemed to know something. In fact, this was the most major
part of this alliance.

In Struggle for the Flag, the target that I must occupy was Changsin Station.
If I couldn't take it, I wouldn't be able to finish the fourth scenario even if I
walked the King's Road to the end. If I didn't complete the fourth scenario,
both me and my group would automatically die.

By the way, Lee Sungkook's expression was strange.

"Excuse me, Yoo Joonghyuk-nim. I'm really sorry… this is a bit difficult."

"Why?"

"The owner of Changsin Station isn't a member of our group."

"It isn't yours?"
It was strange. It was because Dongmyo Station was right before it.

Lee Sungkook said with a sigh, "The 'Tyrant King' has occupied it."

The Tyrant King. My blood ran cold.

"…He has already become a king?"

One of Seoul's Seven Kings, the Tyrant King. He was one of the few people
who could be compared to Yoo Joonghyuk at this point.

Shouldn't it take a few days until he blossomed as a king? The guy who
started at Dobong Station had already come down this far? It didn't make
sense no matter how I thought about it.

Lee Sungkook received my gaze and looked down.

"Actually… some of the prophets made a few mistakes and his power
suddenly rose. In the midst of taking some prophets, he took the station…
at the time, Prophets had 53 members."

Suddenly, their credibility declined sharply. When I thought about it, I
didn't know the beginning of the novel well without help. Why did I think
these people would do well?

"D-Don't worry too much about it. We are preparing a powerful weapon to
eliminate the Tyrant King. It isn't just the Tyrant King. It is a weapon to
deal with the Twelve Apostles." Jung Minseob agreed.

"Maybe Yoo Joonghyuk-nim doesn't know it well. We worked very hard to
figure out the revelations…"

No, I knew. These guys shouldn't be alone. I had to end it before these
people could ruin the story.
"Ah, this is good. Sooner or later, you will have a chance to see the
weapon."

"A chance to see the weapon?"

"Tomorrow, with the exception of the Twelve Apostles, the Night of
the Prophets will be held. I-If you don't mind…" Jung Minseob's eager
eyes turned to me.

"Yoo Joonghyuk-nim, I want you to come with us."




After the talk, Jung Heewon, Lee Hyunsung and I gathered in the
accommodations provided by Lee Sungkook. I looked at the flag of
Chungmuro Station.

Throughout the afternoon, my flag was changed to 'navy' due to the transfer
of Dongdaemun Station and Cheonggu Station.

[You have used the benefits of the navy flag.]

[From now on, you can use the 'group chat' with the group members.]

From now on, we didn't have to worry about conversations. The group chat
couldn't be intercepted unless another group member was in the same area.

I briefly explained to them about what happened today. Jung Heewon
vaguely noticed but Lee Hyunsung was surprised.

–Oh my god, it is unbelievable. They know part of the future… that's why
Dokja-ssi is acting as Yoo Joonghyuk?

–Yes.
–Sigh… Then we should stay here for the moment. We need to find out
more information about them… –Nope.

–Huh?

–Today I will take care of them.

I looked at Jung Heewon and said.

–I'm sorry Jung Heewon-ssi.

–Its okay… I am just a bit hurt.

–…

–I'm just joking. Isn't Dokja-ssi playing a gangster right now? If you are
sorry, let me deal with that jerk from before.

Jung Heewon smiled and continued.

–Then tonight will be a hot night?

–H-Hot…?

Lee Hyunsung was freaked out by Jung Heewon's joke. I shook my head.

–I have something to do first.

–Something to do?

–Now all of them are moving. It will be difficult.

I took out a small cloak as I finished speaking. My figure suddenly
disappeared and Lee Hyunsung spoke with confusion.

–Eh? Dokja-ssi?
–I will give you a signal. Then you will move.

It was a gold member's privilege item, 'Recluse's Cloak' which was
purchased for 3,000 coins.

It was a five time consumable item but it could maintain 'absolute stealth'
for 20 minutes once the ability was activated.

I melted into the darkness. It was useless against opponents with Absolute
Senses Lv. 6 or higher but no one had such skills here.

I passed by the drowsy guards and arrived at Han Donghoon's tent. There
was Sound Wave Blocking around the tent so I wasn't worried about
anyone overhearing once I entered.

He carefully opened the tent and saw a boy sitting at the keyboard alone.
The dark circles were thicker than they were in the daytime.

A solitary boy commenting alone. The Prophets had turned this boy into a
worn-out machine. A propaganda machine that manipulated the future by
scattering information that mixed fiction with truth. It didn't have much
effect right now but the value of this boy would grow over time.

I quietly approached from behind and blocked his mouth. Han Donghoon
gasped and struggled, but it was impossible to resist me with a level 10
strength.

I put my hand in my pocket and pulled out the Mental Awakening medicine
that I bought along with the Recluse's Cloak. It was a huge 3,000 coins.

It would be a lie if I said it wasn't regrettable, but if I could get the Hermit
King of Shadows with 3,000 coins, it would be a profitable transaction.

Some time after being fed the stimulant, Han Donghoon's eyes changed.
The Hypnosis effect was loosened and the boy's sense of reason started to
return.
"U-Uhh, you…"

Hypnosis didn't mean that he forgot everything. In this little boy's head, all
types of trauma would be running through them. Once the Hypnosis
slipped, his sponsor would start to intervene to some extent.

[The sponsor behind character 'Han Donghoon' has revealed himself.]

[The constellation 'Shadow behind the Curtain' has thanked you.]

[500 coins have been sponsored.]

Han Donghoon stepped back while holding the flag in his hand. I watched
the flag closely and deliberately stepped away.

"Don't worry. I'm not here to snatch the flag."

"Uh-Uwah, ah…"

"You're smart so you should understand right away. If I wanted to harm
you, I wouldn't have released Hypnosis."

"T-T-Then."

"I want to be friends."

Han Donghoon's eyes shook. I waited for a moment. It was until the
turbulence in his head calmed down. But Han Donghoon wasn't able to
speak easily. That reminded me, this guy had a problem.

"Is it hard to speak directly? If you don't mind, I'd like to talk through this."

Han Donghoon looked at the smartphone held in his hands and started
muttering something.

[The character 'Han Donghoon' used 'Wide-area Internet Lv. 5' on your
smartphone.]
[You can use the Internet anywhere in 'Seoul Dome' unless the
consciousness of 'Han Donghoon' is interrupted.]

After a while, Han Donghoon's name appeared in the smartphone
messenger.

–Who are you?

–I've been looking for you.

–Lee Sungkook also said that.

–I suppose so.

–I…

The boy's trembling fingers couldn't produce any more sentences. I
instinctively realized. It was impossible to persuade this boy right now.

For more than 10 days, the boy's wounds had festered to the point where it
couldn't be easily restored.

–I understand you. It is scary and confusing.

[The character 'Han Donghoon' is greatly disturbed.]

–Don't be ridiculous.

–I am different from those people.

–I can't believe you.

–Don't you hate the Prophets?

Han Donghoon's eyes shook. Deep rooted resentment filled the boy's eyes
due to the hypnosis.
–If you allow me to, I can get rid of them.

–…Why? You are a prophet…

–They shouldn't exist. They are interfering with the 'epilogue'.

Han Donghoon stared at me with eyes that couldn't understand and tapped
on his keyboard.

–To me… What do you want? You will just use my abilities anyway.

I looked up and slowly opened my mouth.

–No, it is just the opposite.

I stared into Han Donghoon's eyes as I spoke aloud.

"You don't have to do anything."




"Now those jerks time is over. It will all end tomorrow."

"Sigh… when this is over, I will have a bottle of soju."

"Yes. Did you see that bastard's eyes before? The Sage's Eye glared at me
and I almost had a heart attack."

"Haha, how did a guy who got off at the prologue know about the Sage's
Eye?"

Cheerful voices. It was so exciting that I wanted to keep listening.

"Hey, the other prophets are still suspicious… how do I convince them?
They've been nagging me to go to Chungmuro…"
"Give me your phone and I will speak to them. At any rate… huh?" Jung
Minseob's face stiffened as he fiddled with the keyboard. "Why is the
Internet not working all of a sudden?"

"Is that brat sleeping again? Go check it out."

Jung Minseob was about to leave the tent when his body hit something. The
moment he stretched out a hand.

"W-What is this…?"

Chiiiiiing!

"Aaaagh!"

Jung Minseob fell onto the ground with a scream. I took off the Recluse's
Cloak and held the Blade of Faith.

"Y-Yoo Joonghyuk? How come?"

The confused Lee Sungkook stumbled while Jung Heewon poked her head
in from outside the tent.

"I took care of some of them. But there are too many people… I won't last
long."

Jung Heewon disappeared and the sound of fighting was heard from
outside. Now the guards will flock.

"D-Don't you know what will happen if you do this? Yoo Joonghyuk, you
won't be able to deal with all of us!"

"All? I don't have to deal with everyone. I just need to handle you."

This remark made Lee Sungkook's lips twitch.
"I'm sorry Yoo Joonghyuk but I can't let―"

Kudududuk!

I lightly swept the ether blade towards the fallen Jung Minseob and cut the
armour he was wearing. Jung Minseob screamed.

"Aack!"

His flesh was torn and a piece of cloth fell out. I picked up the piece of
cloth that had fallen out.

[You have won the flag of the 'Dongmyo Group'.]

[Your navy flag has absorbed the cumulative achievements of the navy
flag.]

[Your navy flag has evolved into a brown flag.]

[A strong flag protects you.]

"You are the real representative of Dongmyo."

"H-How…?"

"No matter how stupid you guys are, you wouldn't show the flag so
proudly."

In the first place, it was strange for them to give the representative position
to Han Donghoon. They knew the future and wouldn't give the
representative position to a character in the novel.

However, Lee Sungkook wasn't the representative. There was only one
answer.

[The remaining members of the Dongmyo Group are waiting for your
decision.]
Now the guards were meaningless. The hopeless Jung Minseob stuttered.
"Y-Yoo Joonghyuk! The other prophets will know this…"

"How will you let them know when the Internet doesn't work?"

Lee Sungkook cried out as he realized that all their plans were broken.

"Why… why are you doing this to us?"

"Let's see.? This question is meaningless. Even if I was the 'real Yoo
Joonghyuk', I wouldn't form an alliance with guys like you."

"W-What… don't tell me…?"

I grinned at the pale-looking duo and laughed.

"You should've read to the end."
           Chapter 52: Ep. 11 – Night of the Prophets, III


I was in a deep sleep. It was a long-awaited good night's sleep.

[The effect of the deep sleep has completely restored mental power.]

[Some of your exclusive skills have been updated.]

I checked my clock and saw that it was already 4 p.m.

Once Dongmyo Station and the surroundings areas were occupied last
night, the accumulated fatigue settled firmly on me.

[Currently Occupied: Chungmuro (Main Base), Myeongdong,
Dongdaemun
History and Culture Park, Dongdaemun, Dongmyo, Sindang Station,
Cheonggu Station, Yaksu Station, Sinseol-dong Station ]

Thanks to eating the Dongmyo Group, I now had nine stations. Now I just
needed one more and the King's Road scenario would be over.
Just a bit more and I could achieve one of the key goals of the beginning
scenarios, King of No Killing.

Once I came out, Jung Heewon and Lee Hyunsung were waiting for me.

"We are ready. When will we go?"

"Please wait a moment."

I looked towards the men who were heading towards me.

"Did you sleep well?"

Last night, I decided to have all members of Dongmyo join my group. The
two men in front of me was the result of that decision.

Jung Minseob bowed to me and opened his mouth.

"…Please keep me alive."

"Me too, me too. Sob!"

Originally I planned to kill Lee Sungkook and Jung Minseob, but I changed
my mind. These two were useful until I completely wiped out the prophets.

I put them in the Chungmuro Group and evolved the colour of the flag to
'brown'.

From the brown flag, it became possible to restrict the actions of the group
members.

[You have exercised the right of the representative.]

[Group members Lee Sungkook and Jung Minseob have restrictions on
their behaviour.]
Lee Sungkook and Jung Minseob's expression changed at the emerging
system messages.

"One, from now on, you can't tell others about my identity."

"Yes, yep!"

"Two, you must unconditionally submit to my commands and you aren't
allowed to act individually without my permission."

"…Of course."

[Group members Lee Sungkook and Jung Minseob are willing to accept
their limitations.]

[This restriction is a 'life' restriction.]

[If they break the restrictions, group members Lee Sungkook and
Jung Minseob will die.] I nodded and said.

"Well… okay. I don't know when my heart will change, but everyone work
hard. I will decide while watching you."

The two of them gulped and made hilarious faces. I didn't know what they
were thinking. In any case, they wouldn't have been able to stick to Yoo
Joonghyuk so it was better to stick to me.

"By the way, Representative-nim. What should we call you in the
future…?"

"Call me like you are now. But call me Yoo Joonghyuk in front of the other
prophets. Ah, Jung Minseob."

"Yep."

"Give me the Fugitive's Mask."
Jung Minseob was upset but eventually gave it to me. Anyway, I had to
pretend to be Yoo Joonghyuk if I wanted to go to the Night of the Prophets.
This 'mask' would be a preventive measure for a situation I didn't know.

After a moment, the muscles on my face moved in a bizarre manner as my
appearance started changing. It felt a bit weird but I soon got used to it.

"Huh, this is the real appearance of Yoo Joonghyuk."

"Very handsome… The revelation wasn't wrong."

These bastards…

I wanted to snap out but I closed my mouth. I didn't need to be angry over
something like this.

That reminded me, it would be better to know the details of these guys just
in case.

"Jung Minseob, what is your attribute…"

At this moment, a system message flashed in my head.

[The history of this person has been updated.]

…What?

I tried to use Character List once again as a test.
  [Character Summary]

  Name: Jung Minseob

  Age: 25 years old.

  Sponsor: Cursed Gladiator

  Exclusive Attributes: Light Projection (Rare), 1089th Person to Get Off
  (General)

  Exclusive Skills: Sword Training Lv. 2, Powerful Blow Lv. 2, Berserk
  Lv. 3, Memory Enhancement Lv. 5]…

  Stigma: Repay Grudges Lv. 1

  Overall Stats: Physique Lv. 18, Strength Lv. 16, Agility Lv. 12, Magic
  Power Lv. 10.

  Overall Evaluation: An incarnation that possesses good comprehensive
  skills and attributes. His sponsor is a bit lacking but his ability as a
  warrior is considerable. He would've been one of the 12 apostles if he
  had been a bit more patient. He is very regretful.


…What did it mean that the Character List was updated?

A person I wasn't able to see the attributes window of, yesterday, suddenly
became a character.

He was a prophet. In other words, a character outside the novel. Why did he
suddenly change into a character?

"Oh, my attribute is…"
"No need."

"Yes."

I also confirmed the attributes of Lee Sungkook.

Fortunately, his attributes were the same. Hypnotist and 9th Person to Get
Off… The latter was garbage but the former was a pretty good attribute.

"Give me your smartphone."

"Yep! Here it is."

I received a smartphone from one of them and connected to the chat room.

Ah… the Internet didn't work. Yesterday it was disconnected…

[The character 'Han Donghoon' used 'Wide-area Internet Lv. 5' on your
smartphone.]

[The device's Internet is now available.]

As soon as I thought it, the Internet was connected. I glanced towards the
tent where Han Donghoon was located. There was a vibration from the
smartphone, indicating that a message had arrived.

–I'm going to believe in you just once.

Maybe something changed with Han Donghoon after what happened last
night. I had been really worried about it so I was glad.

I sent a reply to Han Donghoon.

–Thank you.

Sooner or later, I would have a chance to talk to him. I once again opened
Lee Sungkook's smartphone to the Prophets chat room.
[Chat Room]

[List of participants: No. 9, 15 I feel like Dying, 124 Let's Drop Off, No.
763, 887 Get Off, No. 645… a total of 36 people.]

I looked at the numbers in their names and got a sense of who they were.
But something was strange.

"…36 people?"

Jung Minseob answered my question.

"All the prophets in the room stopped reading early. There are no

apostles." I see.

"By the way, Representative-nim. Didn't you say it yesterday? 'You
should've read to the end'… then do you know all of the Book of
Revelation?"

I looked at the expectant Jung Minseob and laughed.

I knew. Do you know?

"You won't regret taking my line instead of Yoo Joonghyuk's."




After a while, we headed to Anguk Station while avoiding the surrounding
conflict areas.

It was because the Night of the Prophets was scheduled to be held.

I spied on these guys through Lee Sungkook's smartphone.
—–

No. 519: Really? Yoo Joonghyuk is coming this evening?

No. 67: There is no doubt. No. 9 and No. 1089 said it yesterday.

887 Get Off: The 9th is a newcomer but I can believe it if it is the 1089th…

124 Let's Drop Off: This time they will all be behind us.

887 Get Off: No. 124, you are in Seoul ㅋㅋ How can those jerks fall
behind you?

124 Let's Drop Off: Ah, except for me of course. Local residents, victory ^
^v

887 Get Off: I would like to be a regressor… If I had read the novel at that
time… No, if I had only read up to 50… I'm jealous of those apostles
scum…

15 I feel like Dying: But don't you think the people who read over 50
chapters are abnormal?? I don't know how they read over 50. ㅋㅋㅋ

124 Let's Drop Off: Real psychos ㅋㅋㅋㅋ
—–

As expected, humans who hid behind anonymity would reveal the truth.
Perhaps the number before the nickname was the position that they got off
at.

—–

No. 888: But are you sure there is no txt version of this novel?
No. 124: A few days ago, I searched the Internet and there was really
nothing left… Ahh… A novel without a txt… (tears)

No. 763: Even if you had a copy, you wouldn't share such a fraudulent
thing. If I could really sell my soul, I would buy it.

—–

The idea of trying to read Ways of Survival popped up. These guys, they
should've read it with me at that time. Now they didn't know the days
ahead.

We've arrived."

I was about to say, "What, already?" when I saw the platform of Anguk
Station in front of me. The prophets who arrived in advance could also be
seen.

But something was strange.

"Nobody has occupied this place?"

"Yes, it is a promise between the prophets. It could be dangerous to meet
at an occupied station. It is sort of like the DMZ." Then a prophet
approached and waved.

"Hey, No. 1089!"

"Oh, it is No. 763 hyung."

Jung Minseob waved and welcomed the person.

"How have you been? You face doesn't look good?"

"Well spotted. The Tyrant King is giving me hell."
"I told you not to advance towards the Dobong side. Why didn't you
listen…"

No. 763 glanced towards me and his face suddenly stiffened.

"P-Perhaps… he is…?"

Jung Minseob nodded.

No. 763's eyes showed astonishment.

"I-It is really an honour. Yoo Joonghyuk-nim!"

The uproar caused the scattered prophets to gather one by one.

"Is that…?"

The prophets ran together and pushed in front of me. There were also a few
female prophets.

"He looks better than I imagined! I am No. 998!"

"It is great to meet you, Yoo Joonghyuk-nim! I'm No. 1055!"

This… I felt like a real king. Their shining eyes wanted to win my favour
somehow. I wondered what they would all look like when they realized I
wasn't really Yoo Joonghyuk.

Most of them weren't worth paying attention to. Their knowledge of the
future was dim and their abilities were poor.

Yet there were some prominent people.

"It was very impressive when you fought against Demon King Asmodeus
in the second regression."

Hoh?
"It was mentioned briefly in the Book of Revelations… now that I've met
Yoo Joonghyuk-nim, I feel like hearing about it from you."

Ways of Survival started with Yoo Joonghyuk's 'third' regression and all the
stories from the second regression were treated as recollections.

Yet this guy knew about Asmodeus? Why was he so impressed when he
didn't read until the end?

"Who are you?"

"I am No. 1168."

Then he almost read to the 50th chapter. Perhaps he was the one who read
the most out of those present.

No. 1168 asked me, "Excuse me, is it Yoo Joonghyuk-nim's third turn right
now?"

"That's right."

"Ah, as expected…"

Some prophets had dark expressions.

Yes, I knew.

Ways of Survival was an infinite loop so those who discovered that it was
early on in Yoo Joonghyuk's regressions would be quite disappointed.

These jerks, they only got the cute side of Yoo Joonghyuk in the
beginning… in any case, those who didn't read until the end weren't
satisfied.

Then there was a disturbance behind me.

"Lee Hyunsung-nim!"
"Steel Sword Lee Hyunsung?"

Lee Hyunsung blushed as he was surrounded by people.

"W-What are you doing? I'm not the Steel… I'm not that!"

"Wow, just like a real revelation. Look at those biceps!"

"Ohhh! So taut!"

Lee Hyunsung had a good-looking face and was quite popular among the
female prophets. At that time, one passing prophet showed interest in Jung
Heewon.

"Excuse, perhaps… are you Maritime Admiral Lee Jihye?"

"No."

"Then are you…"

"I am Jung Heewon. Why?"

"Ah, I see."

The disappointed prophet moved past Jung Heewon towards Lee
Hyunsung. Jung Heewon looked at the situation and spoke to me in Group
Chat.

–Why… isn't anyone interested in me?

–Heewon-ssi isn't famous in the future.

–Tsk.

–So do well from now on.
I turned away from the miserable Jung Heewon. I came to the Night of the
Prophets for a reason. I couldn't waste time talking like this.

"Where is the weapon?"

"Huh?"

"The weapon you have hidden. I will check it first."

"Ah, here it is."

The 763th prophet excitedly moved to the center of the platform and
removed the cloth covering something. There was a big stone present.

I remembered the moment I saw the meteor shower on the roof of the
theatre. No, wait a minute.

"Is that a meteorite?"

"Haha, that's right. At this point, Yoo Joonghyuk-nim might not know…
according to the Book of Revelation, it contained a powerful weapon."

"A weapon?"

"Yes! That's correct. Maybe it is a weapon like a top ranking star relic."

"Doesn't the meteorite need hatching time and can't be used now?"

"Haha, we have a rotation that will provide magic power. It will
hatch tonight at the latest. We have been working on it for a few
days…" I became colder as I looked at this proud bastard.

A red pattern. It was nonsense. This thing shouldn't be known until at least
the fourth regression?

"Which bastard gave you the information?"
"Huh?"

"That person who brought the meteorite to you."

"Oh, that… No. 1124, he was the first one…"

No. 1124? A person who stopped reading early on knew this information?
"Where is he?"

Jung Minseob looked around the place and muttered.

"Uh… I guess he hasn't come yet."

The informant didn't come. I thought for a moment before opening my
mouth.

"We have to get out of here."

It was a trap.

"Huh?"

"Right now."

This was the first time I got a cold sweat since Ways of Survival became a
reality and since meeting Yoo Joonghyuk the first time.

This was a weapon? Who was stupid enough to think like this…

I glanced around at the prophets staring at me with naive eyes. Then the
platform started vibrating.

Kukukung…!

I looked at the trembling 'meteorite' and stepped back. I had come here to
sweep away the prophets, only to be the one swept away.
"W-What is this?"

Jung Minseob made a stupid noise.

Dammit. The fourth scenario hadn't even ended and the 'disaster' of the fifth
scenario was about to appear.

I shouted toward Jung Heewon and Lee Hyunsung.

"Run away!"

This was why I couldn't trust those who didn't read to the end. Due to these
damn people who got off early, today became all wrong.
           Chapter 53: Ep. 11 – Night of the Prophets, IV


A red aura appeared around the meteorite and glowing lights shined all over
the platform.

"Ohh! Finally!"

A prophet screamed.

Jung Heewon and Lee Hyunsung quickly approached me.

"Run away? What…"

It was too late. The red aura spread across the platform and a faint veil
surrounded the station. Now none of the prophets would be able to leave
Anguk Station.

[Constellations protest against the excessive filtering.]

[Many constellations' eyes are shining at the 'omen'.]
[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' is watching the
situation with curious eyes.]

[The constellation 'Secretive Plotter' is expecting your brilliant strategy.]

The constellations were excited and sent me indirect messages.

The most dangerous situation in the world of Ways of Survival was one
where the constellations were partying.

I asked the nervous Jung Minseob, "Was No. 1124 the one who suggested
that you gather here today?"

"Huh? I don't know. We all agreed together…"

I felt clogged up, like someone had fed me ten sweet potatoes. I couldn't
believe things had gone this far.

–Everybody move behind me.

I paid attention the meteorite while protecting them.

–Aren't we running away?

–We can't go. If you look behind, you can see a ward.

–Huh? What ward?

I didn't answer as I stared at the meteorite in the center of the platform.

[Meteorite] was the main event in the fifth scenario. The danger sleeping
inside the meteorite would differ depending on the colour, brightness, size
and type. However, the meteorite I was looking at now was one that should
never hatch.

They seemed confused because the meteorite that gave the star relic in the
third regression was 'bright red'…
"I wonder what star relic will appear?"

"That…"

Some prophets hadn't noticed yet and touched the meteorite.

[An omen of the fifth main scenario has appeared.]

Then the message popped up.

"Eh? What is this?"

"Why suddenly the main scenario…"

The surface of the meteorite cracked and a red light poured out. The first
thing the light touched was the prophet staring at the meteorite with
wonder.

The body of the prophet who lost his head slowly fell to the ground like a
broken doll.

"What is going on?!"

The prophets screamed and retreated, but they were already unable to
escape the crisis.

I took the party with me as I retreated to the edge and observed the
situation. I remembered seeing this type of meteorite in Ways of Survival
but it was tricky to know what would come out.

Please, don't let it be that 'disaster'. The meteorite cracked and red lava
poured out.

The surrounding platform burned and released a bad smell. Then the
temperature of the air rose rapidly and breathing became painful.
The surrounding environment was changing. This… a lava zone? It
meant…

[The 5th grade fire dragon species, 'Lesser Dragon Igneel' has appeared!]

"Fuck! What? The star relic…?"

Several confused prophets belatedly used skills. However, the meteorite
stretched out a long tail and caught a few escaping prophets.

"Kuaaack!"

The body of the prophet that caught by the tail suddenly burned up. Some
prophets used skills to attack the tail but their weapons started to melt.

"T-This monster…"

The meteorite was at most two meters in length, but the monster crawling
out from the gap was over five meters long.

Jung Heewon asked.

–What the hell is this?

–It is a disaster.

–Disaster?

The remainder of the meteorite split apart and a dragon species entered this
dimension.

Kuoooooh!

A violent dragon that was just born. Despite being a deteriorated version of
a hatchling, a dragon still reigned at the apex of all monsters.
A 6th grade monster could wipe out all the prophets here and this was a 5th
grade fire dragon.

"Yoo Joonghyuk-nim!"

Some of the prophets called out to me and all attention was still focused
this way.

I frowned. The incident was caused by them yet they wanted me to solve it?

"Get back to the edges."

Like an obedient puppy, everyone moved to a corner of the platform. The
guys who were quick were already running upstairs from the platform. But.

"Shit, there's a ward!"

The lesser dragon was a 'disaster'. In a situation where a disaster appeared,
the size of the despair was different. At least, this was the pattern I knew.

Among Yoo Joonghyuk's numerous regressions, he had definitely faced this
guy.

I looked at the party members.

–A hidden scenario will soon start.

–Hidden scenario?

–This is a guy who shouldn't have come out in the fourth scenario. It has an
unusual difficulty so there will soon be an intervention.

In order to respond to this disaster, various benefits were needed in the fifth
scenario. For example, if the blue meteorite came out…

But now we had nothing. Yes, something had to be given to balance us.
[Some constellations are complaining about the unusual scenario
difficulty.]

Indeed. The next moment, sparks flew in the air and a small child-like
presence appearance.

It wasn't a low grade dokkaebi like Bihyung. He wore a tidy suit with two
little horns on his head. He was an impressive guy with a small lump
protruding from his side pocket.

I didn't know his name but I knew what he was. He was an intermediate
dokkaebi.

[Hrmm. This is difficult. How did you guys get this 'root'? It was only
installed recently…]

Once his voice rang out, the movements of the lesser dragon stopped.
Indeed, it was possible for an intermediate dokkaebi to intervene in the
scenario to this level.

[A disaster woke up in the fourth scenario?]

The emergence of an intermediate dokkaebi meant that the 'early scenarios'
had almost come to an end.

As long as he took notice of this place, I would barely be able to see the
contract benefits with Bihyung.

[Some constellations are poisonous so I can't spare you… it is also hard
to downgrade the difficulty…] His gaze focused on me.

"But this isn't right! We haven't cleared the fourth scenario!" One prophet
shouted.

I could see the prophets around him quickly covering his mouth. There was
nothing good about yelling at a dokkaebi right now.
[I have decided. I won't downgrade the difficulty.]

The prophets glared at the dokkaebi. There was only the sound of
breathing. They had read Ways of Survival so they would know.

The dokkaebi couldn't overturn the laws. But they also knew this.

[Still… it won't be interesting if you all die this way. I will use my
discretion to change the scenario content.]

The dokkaebi was more talkative than I thought.

[The hidden scenario has arrived!]

The lesser dragon started moving again. The red leather-covered paws hit
the floor of the platform. I avoided the scattered debris and looked at the

scenario that arrived.


  [Hidden Scenario – United You Die, Scattered You Die]

  Category: Hidden

  Difficulty: A

  Clear Conditions: Within the time limit, hunt down the 'lesser dragon
  Igneel' or survive his attacks.

  Time Limit: 20 minutes.

  Compensation: 3,000 coins

  Failure: Death

  Hidden pieces are hidden in this mission.
A 20 minute survival mission. From the title to the contents, it was
ridiculous.

Lee Hyunsung asked.

–Do we have to hunt him?

–No, don't even dream about it.

This disaster is a disaster for a reason. Even the real Yoo Joonghyuk
couldn't catch a 5th grade fire dragon. I looked at the situation on the
platform. Flowing flames started pouring out.

Kwa kwa kwa kwa!

"Kuaaack!"

The prophets caught in the flames turned to ashes. The walls burned by the
flames melted and distorted terribly. He was slowly moving to this side.

"Everyone run counterclockwise!"

I opened my mouth and ran ahead of the rotation direction.

Fortunately, Jung Heewon and Lee Hyunsung followed me well. Jung
Minseob and Lee Sungkook were a bit behind but they still seemed okay.

This time, we avoided it because I knew the pattern. The problem was that
this type of attack wouldn't always occur.

[The 5th grade fire dragon species, 'Lesser Dragon Igneel' is preparing the
'Flames of Destruction'.]

…It had started. We somehow avoided the general attack but the crisis
came now.

"Look for a foothold."
"Yes?"

"Number 5… or 2 and 3! Anyway, just quickly find something that adds up
to 5!"

[A hidden piece is activated.]

[Numerical footholds are activated.]

[Once the appropriate number of people enters the foothold, 'Absolute
Shield' can be activated in 10 seconds.]

[Absolute Shield won't activate when the number on the foothold is
exceeded.]

The prophets all heard this system message. At the same time, footholds the
size of two pyeong appeared all over the station.

"Footholds? Ah, right!"

"There is a hidden piece!"

I looked at the moving prophets and bit my lips. The giggling constellations
reflected in my eyes. Why did many constellations protest against the
difficulty of the scenario?

It was simple. There was no fun in a story with 'only death'. They didn't
want ants being trampled by a giant. These guys wanted the ants to fight
back to survive. In order to live, the ants would even bit at their kin. [Many
constellations are watching the situation with excited eyes.] Damn
constellation scum.

"Shit, go!"

"Kuheeok!"
The prophets, who had called each other's numbers in a friendly manner,
now wielded their weapons against each other to fight over the footholds
with the number '1'. Some prophets collapsed bleeding as they approached a
foothold.

The swift prophets were already stepping on the footholds, strengthening
their alertness.

I kept an eye on them. Someone had clearly planned this trap. Maybe they
were the apostles.

They knew the prophets would gather here and decided to use this
opportunity to wipe out those who stopped reading early.

It was a good idea. No matter how trivial the information, the fewer who
knew the future, the better.

Usually, the apostles would be laughing at the prophets from far away. If
they were 'ordinary' people.

Those who read more than 50 chapters of a boring novel weren't normal.
They called themselves apostles and were greedy enough to control
information.

'If they were intelligent enough to use the red meteor as a trap, wouldn't
they know how to overcome the disaster?

If I was like this…

–Representative-nim! There is no foothold.

–There is nothing here!

Jung Heewon and Jung Minseob cried out urgently. There were no
footholds in the place where out party was located.

–Oh, there is one here! But…
The foothold that was barely found had an ominous number. Four. In other
words, only four people could survive on that foothold. But our party had
five people.

[The 5th grade fire dragon species, 'Lesser Dragon Igneel' is using the
'Flames of Destruction'.]

A huge spark started from the center of the platform and started to spread
throughout the station.

It was a lesser dragon's full attack skill. The heat was enough to burn my
skin despite being so far away. If the shield wasn't activated now, my party
would be destroyed.

"R-Representative-nim?"

Lee Sungkook and Jung Minseob trembled as they met my gaze. I grasped
the handle of Unbroken Faith.

At that moment.

"Yoo Joonghyuk-nim!"

I looked back and saw one prophet. The number '2' was written on his
foothold. Despite the urgent situation, this man still looked relaxed.

"Come this way!"

This guy…? A few memories passed by quickly. I ran towards him
while shouting at the people behind him. "Activate the shield!"
[Absolute Shield is activated!] Kuoooooh!

Then the flames burned everything on the platform. If it had touched me
just a little bit then I would've melted.
"Sigh… I'm glad."

The man who triggered the shield at breathtaking timing sighed with relief.
I asked him, "Who are you?"

The man laughed lightly. "I'm disappointed. Have you already forgotten? I
am No. 1168. About Asmodeus…"

I remembered. He was the one who spoke to me about Demon King
Asmodeus.

"That isn't my question."

The eyes of No. 1168 shook.

I hadn't thought about it before.

The scene of the confrontation between Demon King Asmodeus and Yoo
Joonghyuk. To be precise, the second regression Yoo Joonghyuk was
onesidedly beaten by the demon king.

It was a scene I remembered because I really liked it. However… this
recollection didn't appear before chapter 50. I could say it with certainty as
the full reader of Ways of Survival.

I pulled out my blade and opened my mouth.

"I will ask you again. Who are you?"

[Due to the effect of your exclusive attribute, your memories of some
scenes became stronger.]

The story of Demon King Asmodeus appeared exactly in chapter 57 of
Ways of Survival.

A crack started to spread in this man's relaxed expression.
            Chapter 54: Ep. 11 – Night of the Prophets, V


The self-styled No. 1168 looked at the flames beyond the shield and asked,

"My identity? What are you talking about suddenly…?"

"Have you forgotten? I have Sage's Eye."

In fact, this guy's information wasn't available to me.

[The exclusive skill, Character List is activated.]

[The information of this person can't be read in 'Character List'.]

[This person isn't registered in 'Character List'.]

What was the difference between an updated person and a non-updated
person? I still didn't know the exact reason why.

But whatever the reason was, deceiving this person wasn't difficult. It was
because he believed I was Yoo Joonghyuk.
"…I didn't think Yoo Joonghyuk-nim would notice."

"You are an apostle. Right?"

"That's right. You already knew it."

The fact that he said it so easily meant there were ulterior motives.

"This is a trap. Is it because of the Butterfly Effect?"

"Haha, that's right."

I wondered if my words were funny as No. 1168 smiled and looked at the
other people around.

"If there are a lot of flying butterflies, unnecessary storms will happy."

The prophets who couldn't find a foothold were melting like moths in the
midst of the flames. The terrible screams and the information they knew
disappeared into dust. It was the price they paid for trying to obtain a star
relic without the proper information.

"You are killing the larvae before they become butterflies."

"The larvae that are about to become pupa are the easiest to kill."

The fierce heat died down and the chemical reactions in the surrounding
area were subsiding. The Absolute Shield was soon turned off.

[After one minute, the positions of the footholds will be recreated.]

The hidden scenario would end when footholds appeared 10 times and they
survived the attacks. We had just passed one so there were nine left.

I tried pressing against the shield with my feet. The heat was high but it was
enough to endure.
–Representative-nim!

I waved my hand to stop those running from afar.

Now wasn't the time to take care of them.

–The attack patterns are familiar so please learn them and avoid them on
your own. I can't take care of you right now.

The party members noticed something strange and stopped moving.

In a situation where the power of the apostles wasn't clear, it was dangerous
to drag them with me.

No. 1168 looked at me and said, "This isn't like what I saw in the Book of
Revelations. Is this really your third regression?"

"Shut up. Where did you get off?"

"Hrmm? You would know if you checked it yourself."

"I like a person who is the same on the outside. I can't make a deal with a
person who has two different sides."

The apostles' eyes widened. "How interesting."

"There must be a reason why you would so easily identify yourself."

The tail of the lesser dragon flew through the air and struck the spot where
we were. It was easy for me to avoid it with my over level 30 agility.
However, No. 1168's astute movements were amazing.

I triggered Calm Observation that I got from Theatre Dungeon. It was a
skill I saved for those who Character List didn't work on.
His perspiration, speed, breathing interval… The sum of his physical body
stats was around 49~50. It was a significant level among the prophets I had
seen.

I moved behind him and he opened his mouth. "I'll formally greet you. I'm
No. 1195. Among the apostles, I am the 5th Apostle."

The number of views for Ways of Survival's first chapter was 1,200. If he
was 1,195, he was among the top five of the latest people to stop reading.
Then he knew about the 'red meteorite'.

"What is your purpose? "Do you also need my help?"

"Huhu. To save Yoo Joonghyuk-nim… what would you say to that?"

"It is more plausible than the lie about mosquitos becoming butterflies."

"Indeed, you have Lie Detection."

He licked his dry lips. Should I do it now?

…No. A little bit more. Just listen a bit more.

"However, I'm not lying about my desire to save Yoo Joonghyuk-nim.
Things would be difficult if you die here. The revelations will be greatly
ruined."

"You knew I was coming."

"We discovered it a few hours ago. Therefore, we hurriedly revised the
plan."

There were sparks and a few more prophets near us died. There were still
those who were hanging on. It was like they knew the patterns of the lesser
dragon. I kept an eye on those people.
"Originally, we had no plans to participate. If only you Yoo Joonghyuk-nim
wasn't here."

"So?"

"Don't you already know the answer?"

[The positions of the footholds will be created!]

[The 5th grade fire dragon species, 'Lesser Dragon Igneel' is preparing the
'Flames of Destruction'.]

My party members successful found footholds this time. The apostle and I
also found a foothold that fit two people.

To be precise, the apostle tossed the person already occupying it out with
force. The drops of blood landed on the brutal apostle. He wiped it off
and said, "We have to slay the lesser dragon." Ku ku ku ku!

[The 5th grade fire dragon species, 'Lesser Dragon Igneel' is using the
'Flames of Destruction'.]

The Absolute Shield activated and once again blocked the flames.

Kuooooh!

Only two stages had occurred but there were less than a quarter prophets
remaining. The party members had been keeping pace but it was uncertain
how long they would last.

[A hidden piece penalty has occurred.]

[The number of footholds created in the next turn will be reduced.]

I spoke with narrowed eyes, "With your power alone?"

"It is possible. I have prepared enough."
I felt uneasy as I heard his confident voice. That reminded me, he was
shedding a single drop of sweat in this heat. A bluish chill spread over his
skin.

This was… I see. Their preparations were outstanding.

"It is the ice pill."

"That's right."

A pill that had a certain probability of appearing when a 7th grade
elemental species was hunted in the Gangseo-gu area stations. They already
managed to get their hands on this pill. It would release a powerful ice
attribute for at least 30 minutes.

In other words, they had a foundation to hurt the lesser dragon. The
problem was the attack power.

"It is impossible with you alone."

"Who said I was alone?"

I looked at the survivors. There were a few people I was particularly
keeping an eye on. I looked closer and saw that their bodies were covered
with a bluish chill.

"Huhu, how can I come here alone?"

I counted and there were five of them. They had committed half their power
for this operation. The five apostles must have confidence after eating the
five ice pills.

But.

"A few more people won't make a big difference."
"That's why I am seeking help. I will give an ice pill to Yoo Joonghyuk-nim
if you decide to help us."

"If I refuse?"

"All of Yoo Joonghyuk-nim's party members here will die."

"Do you think you will be safe like that?"

"Even if we can't take care of the lesser dragon, we can at least take care of
our bodies."

He was brimming with confidence. They would've already lost their heads
if I was the real Yoo Joonghyuk.

"Do you think I am worried about my party members? People die anyway. I
can gather other people."

I raised Unbroken Faith to his neck. Then he shook his head.

"Huhu, you are truly like the revelations. But you better think carefully."

"What do you mean?"

"By now, Yoo Joonghyuk-nim's main base would've entered our hands."

"…What?"

"Maritime Admiral Lee Jihye, a child who uses strange abilities. And one
of the 10 Evils. It is different from the original revelation but you have
made a fairly good party. If they all die, won't Yoo Joonghyuk-nim face
problems starting again?"

They had already investigated up to here. These bastards…

"Won't it be worse if we take away Chungmuro Station? Right now, it is
just a proposal. But don't think this proposal will last forever. Our group has
already completed the King's Road scenario by taking over 10 stations. You
should know the gap between a group with a 'king' and a group without a
king."

"…"

"Perhaps the situation would already be over by now. The king will
be waiting for Yoo Joonghyuk-nim's choice in front of Chungmuro's
flag holder." …I see.

I knew their plan. These guys, they planned to hit Chungmuro from the
moment they received information I was coming to the Night of the
Prophets.

"If you pledge to join us, we will promise the safety of your party as well as
our full support in the future. This is a promise on the king's honour."

My heart was pounding from the precise threat. They were actually this
bold against Yoo Joonghyuk. It was rare to find this in someone who read
Ways of Survival.

"Who is your king? Where did they get off?"

"Hmm… the king dislikes being called someone who 'got off'."

"So what do you call them?"

"Even if you are Yoo Joonghyuk-nim, please refrain from speaking about
him like that. He is the only one among the prophets who has read all the
revelations. He knows both Yoo Joonghyuk's past and future."

…What? I was surprised for a moment but didn't greatly panic. This was
interesting. There was another reader who read all of the novel?

Laughter emerged. It was a ridiculing laugh. It was because there absolutely
couldn't be such a thing.
Kuooooh!

Finally, the third attack of the fire dragon was about to begin. I looked at
the apostle and quietly stepped out of the foothold.

The bewildered apostle asked as I walked forward. "Yoo Joonghyuk-nim?
What are you doing?"

The party members far away were also surprised. I waved my hands.

–Don't worry. No matter what happens, you absolutely can't move from
there. Understood?

I walked in the direction of the lesser dragon. It was with slow but sure
steps. The fire dragon stared ferociously at me as it prepared the Flames of
Destruction.

"What are you doing?! Come back!"

The apostle behind me hastily exclaimed. I turned around and smiled at
him.

"Did the king tell you about this future?"

As I listened to him, I kept thinking. These guys shouldn't be alive. But they
had a 'strategy' and I couldn't kill them all by myself. If so… I laughed and
continued talking.

"You guys, have you forgotten what my stigma is?"

If I was them. What would they 'fear' the most right now?

"I'm not afraid of death. I can just start over again."

The answer was simple. They believed I was Yoo Joonghyuk. If that was
the case…
"I wonder. What will the effect be on you? You are unusual presences in
this turn." The most 'fearful' thing to them was what I feared most. "If I die
here, will you exist in the next turn? Or will you end with this world?"
They didn't want Yoo Joonghyuk to die.

"If you really read the revelations, you should know the answer right?"

The apostles' faces paled. There were times when it was easier to handle
those who used their heads.

"Yoo Joonghyuk!"

The five apostles moved from the footholds and started to run towards me. I
knew it. No matter how unconcerned they pretended to be, they were
people who 'got off' and were caught up in this scenario.

What would happen to them in a world where the protagonist was dead?
They didn't know.

"Catch him quickly!"

Just like me.

[The 5th grade fire dragon species, 'Lesser Dragon Igneel' is using the
'Flames of Destruction'.]

The moment that flames burst out from the center of the platform, I
exploded all the strength in my muscles and ran towards the legs of the
dragon. Then I put my flag into the flag holder of Anguk Station located
there.

[You have occupied Anguk Station.]

[Currently Occupied: Chungmuro (Main Base), Myeongdong,
Dongdaemun
History and Culture Park, Dongdaemun, Dongmyo, Sindang Station,
Cheonggu Station, Yaksu Station, Sinseol-dong Station, Anguk Station]

[The achievement points of the brown flag are rising.]

[You have occupied 10 stations!]

[The hidden scenario – 'King's Road' has been achieved.]

[Depending on the path you walk, you will receive a new 'king' attribute].

   1.      King of Arrogance and Hypocrisy

   2.      King of Solitude and Taste

   3.      King of No Killing

·····.

I replied without reading the rising options.

"King of No Killing."

[The new attribute, King of No Killing has been obtained!]

This was enough. I hadn't wanted to do this but it was necessary to get rid
of the people here.

The apostles discovered the flames and hurried back to the footholds.
However, it was already too late.

"You should've been careful. You only have one life."

The wave of flames covered them. It was an attack that couldn't be endured
even if they ate the ice pill.

[The durability of the External Enhanced Suit has decreased dramatically.]

[The durability of the External Enhanced Suit has run out.]
My vision soon became dim. There was the feeling of flesh being burnt and
I lost consciousness.

[You have died.]

.

.

A moment later, a system message was heard.

[The privilege of the King of No Killing is activated.]
 Chapter 55: Ep. 12 – First Person Protagonist's Point of View, I


One of the most painful deaths in the world was burning to death and I had
just experienced it. The neurons in my brain seemed to emit light at once.
[The exclusive skill 'Fourth Wall' has attenuated the mental pain.]

The pain was slowly reduced. It was once again the Fourth Wall. I always
felt strange when I escaped from trouble with the help of this skill.

Ways of Survival had become a reality and I was living in it. Then… what
was this 'wall' that I felt every time?

·····.

No, these thoughts were futile. I was safe thanks to the attribute 'King of No
Killing' and had to move again.
It was an attribute that could be gained only when the conditions of King of
No Killing was met. Unlike its name, the privilege of the attribute was more
like 'immortality' than 'no death'. It was conditional but…

In any case, I would soon return to my flesh. At least that was what I
thought.

[Due to a conflict error with your exclusive skill, the privilege of King of
No Killing would be delayed.]

Huh? A skill conflict error?

[Thanks to your death, your consciousness has been completely liberated
from the constraints of your body.]

[Exclusive skill, Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint stage 3 has been
activated!]

I was overcome with a dizzy feeling. No, wait a minute. What was
happening this time?

「 "Damn, if only it wasn't him." 」

The dizziness flooded in and my vision brightened. Then I was watching a
'scene'.

「 Gong Pildu licked his lips as he observed the people around the
platform. Now he couldn't run away. He thought about it but he knew better
than anyone that he didn't have the courage to do so.

"Um… Dokja hyung."

There was a weight pressing against his knee and Gong Pildu looked down.
It was a boy around 10 years or so. There was a boy sleeping on his thigh.

"Why am I like this…?"
Gong Pildu wondered as he looked down at the sleepy Lee Gilyoung. His
old memories surfaced. A young child. Lee Gilyoung was his daughter's
age.

He shook his head and sighed.

–Pildu-ssi, we should stop now…

–Daddy. How long are you going to keep talking about land?

There was a time when he was the breadwinner of the family.

He earned money to feed his family and buy land. If he was lucky, he
would become a landlord and then get tenants…

Finally, he became a 'big investor' in Chungmuro but it didn't take long to
find out that he couldn't keep his small family.

"Isn't this surprisingly okay? You get along well with people."

He looked up to see a beauty with a nice face. Yoo Sangah. Two days ago,
this woman had become the deputy of Chungmuro.

"Quickly stop talking nonsense."

"You were smiling just now…"

Gong Pildu made a look of distaste. Yoo Sangah sat down hesitantly next to
Gong Pildu.

"Ahjusssi, how many times did you buy land?"

"What?"

"When I look at the people in the Landlord Alliance, only you are the one
with the 'Land Owner' attribute."
"…It isn't good to have a lot of land. It needs to be good land. You are
naive."

"Then what is good land?"

"Expensive land is good land."

"What type of land is expensive?"

"It is land that many people want."

"Was your land like that?"

"Yes."

It wasn't land that he wanted.

Gong Pildu looked into Yoo Sangah's eyes. This woman's curiosity had an
oddly sharp corner. She was smiling on the outside but he couldn't help
feeling uncomfortable.

Duduk. Duk. Duk.

Then a sound was heard in the distance. Yoo Sangah's expression hardened
while Lee Gilyoung woke up in a flash from where he was sleeping on
Gong Pildu's knees. The antennae of the cockroach on his back shook.

Ku ku ku ku!

Line 4, the tunnel from Hoehyeong. Something was coming this way. Yoo
Sangah stood up while Gong Pildu used a skill.

[The character 'Gong Pildu' has activated 'Armed Zone Lv. 8!]

Gong Pildu bit his lips. This might be an intuition only rich land owners
got. There was something like that.
"Hey! Huddle up!"

It was the feeling of someone trying to take away his land.

Dududududu!

Gong Pildu turrets fired all at once into the darkness and something fell.
They were ground rats.

"The enemy! Gather around Gong Pildu-ssi! We will go with the large-
scale exercise we practiced in the morning!"

Yoo Sangah called out and the people scattered on the platform ran.

"Group A is near the turrets, group B will be at the center of the gunfire and
group C will be protecting Gong Pildu-ssi!"

The people moved in the orderly ranks that they had practiced in advance.
The ground rats collapsed due to the people's quick response. It was much
easier than when Emergency Defense was taking place.

As the dozens of ground rats collapsed on the ground, the same thought
entered the minds of the Chungmuro members. It was easy. Everyone
cooperating was trully worth it.

Then they heard a voice from the tunnel.

"As expected, Hamelin's Flute wasn't enough."

"How can the 9th grade species compare to a place eaten by Yoo
Joonghyuk?"

A group of people appeared from the darkness. Four men and one woman.

Gong Pildu's expression hardened. He didn't know the reason. However,
one thing was for certain. These guys were different from the ones they had
dealt with so far.
"Dammit… quickly call the samurai girl!"

"I am already here." There was a cold feeling as Lee Jihye came down from
where she had been. "And don't call me a samurai. If you don't want to get
beaten up."

Despite the grumpy answer, Gong Pildu felt a bit calmer. Lee Jihye was a
great power. Yet Gong Pildu still felt uneasy. He was anxious and growled
like a frightened beast.

"Who are you? Where did you come from?"

"It is real. The Maritime Admiral and Armed Fortress Master has become a
team."

It wasn't an answer that came back but words that were close to mocking.

Gong Pildu asked, "What nonsense are you saying? Quickly go back.
Otherwise I will shoot to kill!"

However, the five men and women didn't look at Gong Pildu. They just
continued talking to each other.

"Who is on the dragon side?"

"Numbers 5, 6, 8 and 9. They aren't apostles but they are pretty good.

"With the exception of the one outside Seoul, there are five of us left."

"The five of us are enough. Quickly sweep them away."

The first one who came forward was a man in his 30s with a bulging belly.

He was a man with the number '7' on his shoulders. He had thick eyebrows
and looked at Lee Jihye's white legs like they were to his taste.

"I will take the Maritime Admiral. She isn't a big deal without the sea."
"What are you bastards saying?"

Lee Jihye cried out sharply and rushed forward. Gong Pildu realized it
couldn't be helped and infused magic power into the turrets.

"Damn, just go to hell!"

Dududududu!

The man with a '4' on his cloak laughed.

"As expected from one of the Ten Evils. If we came a bit later, we would've
been swept away."

"Numbers 3 and 4. You two take Gong Pildu. Be vigilant and attack the
turrets one by one."

The man with a '3' on his forehead nodded.

"Yes… I understand. One of the 10 Evils can be handled by both of us."

"Number 2, you handle the rest."

The woman with a '2' on her cheek frowned. She was holding a small flute
in her hand.

"Why do I have to handle such petty reason?"

"It is the most appropriate for you."

"What are you going to do?"

Then the man with a '1' on the dark cloak opened his mouth.

"I will be taking the flag holder." 」
The moment of immersion was broken and consciousness returned. Now it
all made sense.

Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint. I had a similar experience the last time I
was in the ichthyosaur's stomach. At that time, I saw Yoo Joonghyuk.

By the way, it was amazing. I thought I had prepared for the apostles but it
wasn't enough. I was able to guess their thoroughness just from the items
they brought.

There was Hamelin's Flute that could control the ground rats and the Magic
Power Bullet Shield that could defend against Gong Pildu's attack.

They really wanted to capture Chungmuro, obtain Yoo Joonghyuk and
devour this world.

But it wouldn't be so easy.

「 "W-What? Was the Maritime Admiral this strong in the beginning? Hey,
isn't something wrong?"

It was the 7th Apostle who cried out first.

Lee Jihye's sharp sword pushed the 7th Apostle back little by little. It was
natural. The current Lee Jihye was much stronger than the Lee Jihye in the
original 'third turn'.

"Damn, why are these two turrets so hard?"

Number 3 and 4 were in trouble.

The 2nd Apostle playing Hamelin's Flute was also struggling due to Yoo
Sangah's Binding Thread and Lee Gilyoung's Mjolnir's Thunder.
In the end, it was the 1st Apostle who came forward. He frowned before
pulling something out and lighting it. Then he threw it at the Chungmuro
party.

Kwaaaaang―! 」

There was a loud roar and Chungmuro's platform was covered with
explosions. I was startled.

…This son of a bitch?

[Mass Destruction Magic Bullet]

It was hard to deal huge damage to top monsters but against humans, it was
the most powerful weapon of mass destruction.

It was a weapon that could be made with some items that appeared in the
Gangseo and Gangnam areas, as well as some items bought from the
Dokkaebi Bag.

Then he was the 'king' of the apostles. The purple flag on his back proved
it.

The dust settled down, revealing the Chungmuro platform. My chest was
becoming stuffy. If the apostles had this then the situation was
unfavourable.

The dust cleared and the fallen Chungmuro group members were seen.
People were coughing up blood.

Yoo Sangah and Lee Gilyoung were lying on their floor. Even Gong Pildu
couldn't completely avoid getting injured despite using Protective Wall.

「 "Phew, now it looks good. Right?"

The 7th Apostle grabbed Lee Jihye's head while her uniform was torn. She
was in the front and received the biggest blow from the explosion.
"Aren't you just a supporting actor, huh?"

"Bastards…cough!" Lee Jihye screamed as she was punched in the
stomach.

"Can I have this gurl?"

"What will you do with her? There is no time."

"What will I do? Looking back, isn't she destined to follow the main
character and be miserable? Then I would rather…" 」

Lee Jihye's small body shook in the air like a rag doll. Her lips were
trembling. She was staring at me.

「 He…lp…me. 」

Impulsive anger filled my head. It was unlike me. Lee Jihye was clearly just
a 'character'.

[The exclusive skill, 'Fourth Wall' is activated!]

[Excessive immersion has restricted some of the features of Fourth

Wall.] I was too immersed. I became dizzy and nauseous.

[Excessive immersion lads to a profound increase in the proficiency of
Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint.]

[Changing your viewpoint to first person.]

My consciousness narrowed and stretched like a rubber band. Then I
opened my eyes. I was really in Chungmuro.

…How? Lee Jihye was looking at me with shaky eyes. It wasn't just her. At
this moment, everyone on the platform was watching me.
My field of view moved slowly. I walked towards Lee Jihye. To be exact,
my body was moving regardless of my will.

One step, another step. Slowly but steadily, I was closing the distance to
her.

The 7th Apostle frowned and asked, "You are…?"

I was uncomfortable, like I was wearing clothes that didn't fit my body. The
height of my gaze was different from usual as well as my five senses.

At this moment, I realized who 'I' was. I couldn't help laughing.

I disliked it. I really disliked it.

Lee Jihye's lips moved a little bit.

"Ah…"

My hand gripped the hilt of the sword like it was something I had done
millions of times.

The grip of my fingers was strange. It was natural and beautiful. I was
thrilled with the fantastic feeling that I felt for the first time in my life.

The blade moved silently. No one could see anything.

Just. It went through something. Something was cut off. Something fell to
the ground.

Some people were shocked while other people's mouths dropped open.

The 7th Apostle holding onto Lee Jihye slowly sank down. Blood gushed
from his neck. My hands moved and I caught the falling body of Lee Jihye.
"Ah, ah…"
I lightly placed Lee Jihye down on the platform. I raised my eyes and saw
the apostles looking this way. The first one to speak was the 3rd Apostle.

"You… who are you?"

How funny. It was a stupid question. I slowly opened my mouth. It was like
I was this guy from the start.

"I am Yoo Joonghyuk."

The coldest and loneliest voice in the world. The sleeping prince had finally
woken up from his deep sleep.

"And you shall die here." Now

Chungmuro would be safe.

.

.

My consciousness escaped from Yoo Joonghyuk's body and slowly
returned to its original body.

[Exclusive skill, Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint stage 3 has been turned
off.]

[The skill conflict error is normalized.]

[The delayed privilege of the King of No Killing has reappeared.]

[Your body is resurrected from death.]
Chapter 56: Ep. 12 – First Person Protagonist's Point of View, II


[The recreation of your flesh has begun.]

Just like falling paint spread out, my vision slowly cleared. The surrounding
contrast and saturation were unclear. By bones, capillaries, digestive and
respiratory tract and my whole eyes regenerated. My senses were confused
because they still hadn't found their place.

In any case, I could rest assured about Chungmuro.

No matter how strong the apostles were, they wouldn't be able to defeat
Yoo Joonghyuk who was stronger than the original.

By the way… it was a truly unique experience. I shared a first person point
of view with Yoo Joonghyuk. If possible, I didn't want to do it again.

[The exclusive skill 'Fourth Wall' offsets the mental shock caused by your
death.]
[Compensation is being prepared for the Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint
stage 3.]

…Usage compensation?

I could see Jung Heewon shouting from afar. Her face was astounded as
Lee Hyunsung held onto her. Jung Minseob and Lee Sungkook were in
shock when they looked over here.

Fortunately, they were all safe. I wasn't too late.

"Dokja-ssi!"

Jung Heewon forgot and cried out my name.

Kyaooooh!

In fact, there was no need to hide it anymore. Air flowed into my newly
created lungs. There was still the merciless lesser dragon in the vicinity.

"As expected from Yoo Joonghyuk-nim!"

"Did he use a divine restoration pill?"

These cries came from the few prophets who had survived. Of course, I
didn't have a divine recovery.

Reviving from death was completely different to recovering from a serious
wound.

[The benefits of the King of No Killing has been completed.]

[100 karma points have been consumed.]

[The wastes of your flesh have been completely removed and the
performance of your body has increased.]
[Physique and magic power has increased by 1 each.]

There was even a resurrection bonus. This was why 'King of No Killing'
was a scam. In all of Ways of Survival, Selena Kim of the United States
was the only one who obtained this attribute.

[Current karma points: 0/100]

[Fill up the points for your next resurrection.]

[One karma point will be obtained every time you save someone's life.]

The privilege of the King of No Killing was 'resurrection'. Of course, it
wasn't unconditionally resurrection. Karma points were necessary. It was
fortunate that the first resurrection started with 100 points.

Kyaooooh!

[The 5th grade fire dragon species, 'Lesser Dragon Igneel' is using the
'Flames of Destruction'.]

I couldn't die as soon as I revived. Since my points had fallen to 0, the
resurrection privilege couldn't be used for a while.

I looked around and saw the number '2' written on a foothold. The other
people were already standing on a foothold.

"Hyunsung-ssi, go over there! We'll go to the next one!"

Lee Hyunsung rushed towards me at Jung Heewon's quick judgement. Lee
Hyunsung arrived and opened his mouth while sweating.

"Dokja-ssi, are you okay?"

"Just take a look."

"…I thought my eyes were mistaken for a while."
I didn't have time to explain in detail how it was possible.

[Absolute Shield is activated!]

The Flames of Destruction burned in front of my eyes. I spoke to Lee
Hyunsung, who was looking at me like I was Jesus.

"Hyunsung-ssi, do you have anything for me to wear? A poncho or…"

"I might be a soldier but… ah."

Lee Hyunsung belatedly recognized the situation and looked at my body.
The resurrection was good except for one thing. The external suit had
melted and most of the items I picked up were destroyed.

In other words, I was now naked.

"…No, that's okay." I muttered.

Lee Hyunsung had raised his hand to his waist and now he returned it to his
original position.

No matter how strong a person, this sense of sacrifice was too much. In any
case, I didn't need clothes but the items that fell.

Even the Flames of Destruction couldn't dissolve star relics or scenario
items. In fact, Unbroken Faith was rolling around the lesser dragon's legs
and the brown flag was also on the ground. It was a location where other
people couldn't easily pick them up.

As soon as the shield was lifted, people started to run from far away. The
one who ran first was Jung Heewon.

"Dokja-ssi!"

Jung Heewon's expression gradually stiffened as she ran towards me.
[The constellation 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' is looking at the black
flame dragon.]

I felt her gaze covering my shoulders and back before she looked away.

"I didn't see anything so don't worry. Is now the time to care about

that?"

I reflexively shrank back at the words. Then a poncho covered my body.
Looking closer, it was a big one.

[Samyeongdang's Straw Mat]

Jung Heewon handed it over to me.

"Thank you, Jung Heewon-ssi."

I was very thankful to her right now.

[The constellation 'Bald General of Justice' is a little sad.]

"Let's move."

Kyaooooh!

The lesser dragon Igneel's physical movement stage had begun. We once
again moved counterclockwise and avoided the attack.

Jung Heewon and Lee Hyunsung ran ahead of me. They seemed to care
about the 'black flame dragon' dangling from my lower body. The straw
mat was more uneven than I thought and didn't cover the front.

Jung Minseob ran without noticing and asked, "What now representative?
All the apostles have died…"

As Jung Minseob said, I didn't see any remaining apostles.
The proof was that their ice pills were rolling around the areas where they
died. They were items with a long digestion time and didn't melt in the
flames.

A dragon's paw flew through the air.

"Kyaaak!"

Two prophets running behind the party were crushed.

I ran to the center of the platform and grabbed Unbroken Faith and the
brown flag.

[You have recovered the brown flag.]

[You can use the flag's abilities.]

I looked around and it was only my party members remaining. As I was
thinking, the time for the footholds to be activated had already come.

[Numerical footholds are activated.]

"Gather!"

Fortunately, a foothold with the number '5' was activated. The problem was
that there was only one active foothold this time.

The intermediate dokkaebi's voice could be heard in the air.

[Huhu, you are still holding up well. But will that luck continue?]

Next time, the number on the foothold might be three or four. If so,
someone in the party would surely die. If it was six…

[The 5th grade fire dragon species, 'Lesser Dragon Igneel' is using the
'Flames of Destruction'.]
[Absolute Shield is activated.]

We barely made it with 10 seconds to spare. I had to think of this as the last
time.

"Phew… this bastard. Dokja-ssi, what do we do?"

Lee Hyunsung and Jung Heewon were exhausted. It was natural since they
had ran dozens of times in an environment where it was hard to breathe.

"I think we should fight."

"Can we catch it?"

"It isn't impossible."

I pointed to the ice pills rolling around on the floor. The number was
exactly a match for the members of our party. If we ate the items that the
apostles prepared, it wasn't impossible to damage the lesser dragon. The
question was if we could kill it before the next full attack began.

[Absolute Shield will be released.]

"Run! Pick up the pills that have dropped on the ground!"

The party members popped out as I yelled.

[4,100 coins have been invested in magic power.]

[Magic Power Lv. 16 -> Magic Power Lv. 25]

[Your soul is attuned to the world!]

In order to get rid of the lesser dragon as quickly as possible, I needed to
raise my magic power instead of my strength.

I picked up an ice pill and swallowed it.
[The ice property has temporarily opened.]

[40% ice damage is added.]

Now the only thing left was to inflict damage. What should I do? There was
a limit to charging recklessly.

Lee Hyunsung had Great Mountain Smash but he lacked agility. Jung
Heewon had excellent agility but she lacked a powerful finishing blow.

It would be good if we attacked a weak spot. Was it something that
Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint could point out? Ah, that reminded me…

[Exclusive skill, Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint is already in use.]

[The compensation for the exclusive skill, Omniscient Reader's
Viewpoint stage 3 is available.] I used the reward.

[You have experienced the first person protoganist's point of view.]

[You can take one of the protagonist's skills.]

…What?

I was too puzzled to see the flying paw of the lesser dragon. Jung Heewon's
body pushed against mine and the paw landed where I used to be.

Kwaang!

"Why are you freezing?"

Jung Heewon cried out but I couldn't easily answer. I could take one of the
protagonist's skills. This meant I could get one of Yoo Joonghyuk's skills.
[Presenting the list of available skills.]

Oho, I got a choice?

Now that I had eaten the ice pill, what if I could get one of Yoo
Joonghyuk's skills?

If I could obtain something like Strong Self-Defense or Breaking the Sky
Sword…!

[Please select a skill to acquire.]

Cold Resistance

Fire Resistance

Lie Detection.

…Shit, it was like this.

Things couldn't be resolved so easily. I liked Lie Detection the most among
the available skills, but it was useless for me right now.

The most useful thing for this situation was Fire Resistance…

Kuoooooh!

The lesser dragon roared and breathed out fire. Once this action was over,
the Flames of Destruction phase would being.

Let me think. I was a 'reader'. There would be an answer in what I had read.

[Due to the effect of your exclusive attribute, memories from the books you
have read will become stronger.]
The pages flashed in my head. The lesser dragon's attacls. There was some
information in the 12th, 14th and 17th regressions. Now these things were
given to me.

"Dokja-ssi, quickly…!"

I slowly closed my

eyes.

Then.

"Cold Resistance."

I decided.

[The skill Cold Resistance is now available to be used.]

I turned to the others and shouted.

"Jung Heewon-ssi, Lee Hyunsung-ssi! Have you eaten your ice pills yet?
Give all of them to me."

"Huh?"

"Lee Sungkook, Jung Minseob! You too!"

Jung Minseob's eyes widened just as he was about to put the ice pill in his
mouth.

"Quickly!"

"Ah, yes!"

I quickly received the four ice pills. I avoided the flames and poured all of
the pills into my mouth. I was certain. This was for the best.
[You have taken an ice pill.]

[The attribute overlay effect of the ice pill will increase the attribute
damage.]

[200% ice damage is added.]

[The chill of your heart engulfs your entire body.]

I would've never done this in a normal situation. The ice pill was actually a
type of poison. Eating just one would make you feel like you were standing
naked in the middle of winter.

It meant that I should usually only take one.

[The exclusive skill 'Cold Resistance Lv. 5' has protected you.]

The skill I gained from Yoo Joonghyuk started at level 5.

"Everyone come behind me!"

I shouted as I held the handle of my sword. Perhaps it was due to the
memories when I was Yoo Joonghyuk. The feeling I got when I grasped
the sword subtly changed. [Blade of Faith is activated!] Kiiing!

[The special option of Unbroken Faith is activated.]

[The ether property is converted to 'darkness'.]

[The effect of the ice pill will add 'frost' to the ether property.]

The ether blade became a dark blue. It was due to the overlay of ice and
darkness.

Chwaaaaak!
The dark blue ether blade started to hit the flames. I exploded all my muscle
strength and ran to the lesser dragon.

Now it was an all out battle.

[The stigma 'Song of the Sword' has been used.]

[Your sword is filled with the words left by the Duke of Loyalty and
Warfare.]

The buff ability varied according to the verse of the Song of the Sword.
Please don't let it be a strange verse.

「 In the night, a god appeared in his dream and said, "You will win big if
you do this. Otherwise, you will lose." 」

I wanted a different verse when different colours appeared on the lesser
dragon's body. Most of them were green but there were parts that looked a
toxic red.

[The constellation 'Maritime War God' is supporting your battle.]

I realized the meaning of the Duke of Loyalty and Warfare. I see. These
were the weak points.

I ran through the fire and swung my sword at the lesser dragon's head. The
first point was pale red.

Kyaaaah!

It floundered while I cut the Achilles tendon of its hind legs. The second
was dark red.

Kyaaaak!

I jumped to avoid the tail and its paw swung towards me.
Peeeeok!

[The shield effect of the brown flag is activated.]

The flames couldn't be blocked but the shield could endure a few ordinary
attacks.

I ran as it roared and stabbed my blade.

Puok!

It was at a red light on its chest.

Kyaaaack!

The lesser dragon started to wince.

The shield of the brown flag was instantly destroyed and flames started to
gather at its mouth.

[The 5th grade fire dragon species, 'Lesser Dragon Igneel' is preparing the
'Flames of Destruction'.]

The attack phase was finally starting. Now I had no shield. I used all my
magic power and the elongated ether blade struck its chest. I swung and
swung again.

The explosive ice damage hit its chest. But it still didn't fall.

Kuaaaaaah!

Just a bit more.

Kyaaaak!

A bit more…
[The 5th grade fire dragon species, 'Lesser Dragon Igneel' is using the
'Flames of Destruction'.]

The flames burned in front of me. I would die once they struck me. I could
hear the calls of the party members in the distance. I listened to the calls
and swung my sword without backing down.

I could do it. My calculations weren't wrong. I was a 'reader'. If I had been
Yoo Joonghyuk…

A sharp sense of emotion came as I wielded the sword in a trance. Yoo
Joonghyuk's sword was invisible and silent. The sensation was strongly
embedded in me.

I grabbed the hilt with all my strength. I recalled the feeling of that moment
with my senses.

At least once. If I could iminate even a bit of that 'one sword'.

Kuooooh!

The sword moved and I heard something burst. It was the sound of flesh
exploding.

The blood of the lesser dragon soaked my eyes and its body parts flew
through the air.

After rolling around in the high-temperature dust, I vomited up all the
congested parts.

I shook my head to regain my vision. I staggered as I barely got up. I was
staring into the lesser dragon's eyes. I was taken aback and shook. It seemed
that the burning Flames of Destruction had quietly turned off. The huge
eyelids blinked once before it slowly backed away.

Kuuong!
The Blade of Faith was crying out silently from what it was stabbed into the
dragon's heart.

[You are the first to kill the disaster 'Lesser Dragon Igneel'.]

[You are the first to contribute to clearing the fifth main scenario.]

[An impossible feat has been accomplished.]

The power slowly went out of my body. There was no power in my
clenched fists. I gaped for breath as I sat down.

It was a reckless challenge. This time I really almost died.

[The compensation settlement will take some time due to the impossible
achievement.]

[Some low-grade dokkaebi have requested a 'probability' request from the
Administration Bureau.]

The intermediate dokkaebi was staring down at me quietly.

Anyway, now was the time for sweet rewards.
  Chapter 57: Ep. 12 – First Person Protagonist's Point of View,
                               III


[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' applauds your spirit!]

[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' praises your courage!]

[The constellation 'Secretive Plotter' is curious about your tactics.]

····.

[Some constellations are greatly impressed by your performance.]

[20,000 coins have been sponsored.]

I frowned as the indirect messages poured in without a filter. No one
disliked praise. However, dozens of praises pouring in at once was too
much.
Where did Bihyung go and why didn't he manage the messages? Ah… he
would've been called by the Administrator Bureau right now.

There was no compensation for the hidden scenario and the intermediate
dokkaebi disappeared without saying something.

By the way, the total number of sponsored coins was 20,000 coins… The
'minority channels' were different from the 'large channels.

I quickly looked at the fire dragon's body and pulled out the core.

[5th grade Fire Dragon's Core]

A core surrounded by a soft red light. The quality of the core that came out
from the disaster was unusual.

It was deteriorated but it was still a dragon. There were many beneficial
parts. For example, the bones and leather. It could be processed by a good
blacksmith or exchanged.

I looked down at the body of the fire dragon. I had caught a disaster but to
only obtain this much…

Then there was a sudden pain from my back as well as a cheerful voice.

"Dokja-ssi, what game character are you?"

I turned around and saw Jung Heewon standing behind me.

A cough came out.

"…My physical state is so bad right now that I will die from one hit from
you."

"You will live even if you are killed."

"That isn't necessarily the case."
I expected Jung Heewon to ask but she was somewhat quiet. I realized that
she was greatly shocked when I died.

She seemed to have cried… no, Jung Heewon wasn't crying. She lowered
her voice like she was conscious of the other party members.

"…Did you know this and acted?"

"Not everything…"

"I really thought you were dead!"

"But I survived."

Once again, her strong palm slapped against my back. Lee Hyunsung came
running out late.

"Dokja-ssi! Are you okay?"

"Yes, I'm fine."

Lee Sungkook and Jung Minseob were far away and came together. In fact,
I wanted these guys to die here but they were really lucky. Well, they were
in my group now so I could control them at any time. But…

Silence fell as everyone stared at me. I sighed and said, "…You can ask
one by one. What are your questions?" A sudden hearing began.




"Resurrection is a new privilege I have gained. It isn't due to my sponsor."

I moderately avoided the difficult information and only told them what I
thought they needed to know. Jung Heewon muttered with a dumbfounded
expression.
"Resurrection every time you save someone… isn't this a scam?"

"It is one resurrection per one hundred people but a scam is a scam."

I honestly admitted it. However, the King of No Killing also had a fatal
weakness.

As long as I had this attribute, I couldn't 'directly' take the life of another
person.

It wasn't a problem to injure, oppress or make them unable to fight, but he
couldn't kill them. The King of No Killing would be deprived of his throne
when he killed a person.

Of course, I didn't talk about these things. No good would come from it
being known.

"You have to work hard to save people in the future."

"In some cases, people need to be killed…"

"Don't worry. I'll kill them for you."

Jung Heewon stated in a confident voice.

In fact, I was able to choose the King of No Killing with ease because of
Jung Heewon. It was the reason why I raised the Judge of Destruction in the
first place.

It wasn't a big problem to keep the King of No Killing until the middle
scenarios, although there might be frustrating moments when playing solo.

As time went by, there would be more fraudulent attributes. I got a good
attribute in the beginning so it would be hard to miss the timing to change
it.
"But this is really like a fantasy novel. Now you have all types of
abilities…"

Lee Sungkook, Jung Minseob and Lee Hyunsung were watching. I
intentionally stared at them. It was a warning to Jung Heewon not to say
anything.

She accepted it and Lee Sungkook opened his mouth.

"What did it feel like when you died?"

"…It was terrible of course."

I wanted to ask why he asked this but Lee Sungkook spoke again in a
serious voice. "Honestly, I was a bit scared when I saw you rising alive
again."

"You are scared?"

"Yes. Strictly speaking, your entire body disappeared and was restored.
Common sense says that such a thing can't happened. I don't know what the
principle of this world is but if your existence can be duplicated in the
entirety… you might not have been 'resurrected' but 'cloned'."

He spoke a creepy story in a calm voice. It was something I never thought
about…

It reminded me that this guy's attribute was 'Hypnotist'.

…Wasn't he interesting?

Jung Heewon started scolding him, "Have you been watching too many
movies?"

"This is an important matter. If there is no continuity between your death
and resurrection, there is no guarantee that pre-death Representative-nim is
the same person as post-resurrection Representative-nim."
They were difficult words. Several memories crossed my mind. This brat,
was he the one who got offended by the pedantic prologue?

"You have a very quaint idea but… there is no need to worry. I was still
conscious after my death. Strictly speaking, it wasn't a real death."

"Did you experience a soul state?"

"I don't know if it can be called a soul but…"

I felt a bit of unease as I talked. Ways of Survival was a world created by
the author.

This world became a reality. A world in which the soul wasn't proven now
became a world in which the soul was taken for granted.

In such a world, what was 'my' existence? Me, my soul. Did it exist from
the beginning? Or was I party of the story that the author made?

I shook my head. Now wasn't the time to be thinking about this.

"In any case, are the useless questions over?"

"Ah, can I ask one more question?"

"What?"

"Why are you suddenly using honorifics with me and Minseob…"

"My Yoo Joonghyuk concept is over."

Lee Sungkook made a surprised expression as he belatedly realized.

"Eh, come to think about it…"

I didn't need to hear his words. The concept of over but their treatment
wouldn't dramatically change. I reached out a hand towards Lee Sungkook.
"Give me your smartphone."

"Yes?"

"I want a phone."

Lee Sungkook stuck out his phone. It was a good model. It was better than
what I used.

"Can I have this?"

"…Wasn't the Yoo Joonghyuk concept finished?"

"This is my original concept."

Lee Sungkook was on the verge of tears.

"Everybody rest. I have to look at something for a while. We will move in
10 minutes. You can also collect the items."

The party members gathered the items scattered all over the place while I
used the smartphone to access the Internet.

I pretended to be unconcerned but I was actually a little nervous.

[The hidden scenario compensation settlement will be delayed.]

[The 'probability' request is currently underway at the Administration
Bureau.]

It was due to these messages.

The probability judgment. This was why the coins compensation from the
hidden scenario weren't received.

I wanted to check the relevant parts in Ways of Survival but my smartphone
was burned.
It was a mistake that wasn't like me. This was ominous. What if the mail
sent by the author was erased…?

At this moment, a message appeared on the screen of my smartphone.

[Synching to a new device is available.] [Do

you still want to proceed with the sync?]

…What is this?

I pressed OK, the download of the file proceeded and a new file was
created on the background screen.

[Three Ways to Survive in a Ruined World.TXT]

I see. There was this. Indeed, a file that couldn't be read by the dokkaebis or
constellations couldn't disappear so easily.

I looked at Lee Sungkook and Jung Minseob collecting the items. I
suddenly wondered. Would they be able to read this? Still… I should be
careful as possible.

I opened up Ways of Survival and started to read.

[Your reading speed has increased due to the effect of the exclusive
attribute.]

I found the 'probability' request that took place during Yoo Joonghyuk's 6th
regression.

「 The intermediate dokkaebi of the Seoul Bureau 'Baram' frowned upon
reading the scenario in front of him. 」

The top of the document had the name 'Regressor Yoo Joonghyuk'.

'A regressor… damn. The dokkaebis and constellations noticed quickly…'
Baram looked over at the dokkaebis. No senior dokkaebis or great
dokkaebis could be seen.

It was natural. This was a 'probability request' that occurred at the level of a
local dome. The principle was that the world of the district should be solved
in the district. Baram asked the nervous looking dokkaebis.

"Who petitioned the bureau?"

"Aooni of Japan."

"Why is he worrying about a foreigner instead of his own country? Doesn't
he have any business?"

"There is a lot of fierce fighting between the low grade dokkaebis these
days…"

Baram frowned.

Certainly, according to the report, it was worth doing a probability request
for 'Yoo Joonghyuk'.

There was also a lot of important information that was automatically
filtered from the beginning.

In addition, the skill Sage's Eye meant that some items couldn't be accessed
by the system. The data survey required the help of a higher level
administration.

Baram sighed and covered up the report.

"It's okay. This guy is someone who has received permission from my
superiors. Leave him alone."

"Is it okay? The aftermath…"

"He has a sponsor that we can't afford to go against."
"We can't go against a single constellation? What if the constellation
alliance…"

Baram laughed.

"How can you lecture me? Do you know who his sponsor is?"

"T-That's not it."

"It will soon be the fifth scenario so take care of it. The probabilities will be
gradually offset as the scenario progresses."

The atmosphere suddenly became cold and he said to the intermediate
dokkaebi.

"Don't you have work to do these days?"

"Uh…!"

"Why do sales in the United States and India look like this? Isn't there the
prophet in the US and the constellation alliance in India? Why are the sales
like this when they are so many rich targets? Are you not making the
products well?"

"T-That…"

"Shit, don't give excuses! Quickly sell the coin goods!" 」

A laugh emerged. I was reminded of Mino Soft when looking at the
dokkaebis working. The planning division wasn't a joke.

In any case, I was now in a situation similar to Yoo Joonghyuk in Ways of
Survival. I thought that this would happen someday but… this was why it
wasn't good to be noticed.

This… what if the judgment caused me damages?
At that moment, a trembling voice was heard in the air.

[How many times do I have to be called to the Bureau because of you…]

Bihyung. I opened the dokkaebi communication.

"How did it go?"
 Chapter 58: Ep. 12 – First Person Protagonist's Point of View,
                               IV


[What is happening? Things have turned completely upside down. What
skills do you have? Why can't I access the information even when I ask the
Supervisory Bureau?]

I was curious as well. I also wanted to see my attributes window.

'So what happened? Am I going to be penalized?'

[Where did you hear that? Hey, do you know how hard I defended you?
Administrator, please listen to me. Kim Dokja isn't a scammer or a
strange person! He is just a very hard worker!] He speak in a convincing
manner.

[Fortunately, my earnest appeal was taken into consideration. I've analyzed
the entire scenario and found that you only used a few skills. It isn't enough
to destroy the ecology of the scenarios.]
It was as I expected. I didn't learn passive skills for no reason. The more
good skills I used, the easier it was to attract the attention of the Bureau.

[Besides, there are some loud guys in other areas… the Bureau is busy right
now.]

'Then it worked out well?'

[In fact, there are a few jerks… but instructions came down from the upper
management and the 'great dokkaebi' said to dismiss it.]

I was amazed by the unexpected words. The great dokkaebi interfered?

[Sigh… listen to the intermediate dokkaebi. I shouldn't be here. There are
suddenly more eyes on me. You should be careful. This is the jurisdiction
of the intermediate dokkaebi and he has a firm grudge against you.]

'Grudge?'

[Don't you know. The probability meeting is like a tax investigation. In any
case… you will have a hard time for a while.]

Bihyung disappeared. Then there was a huge spark in the air and the
intermediate dokkaebi showed up in a formal suit. He looked around for a
while before speaking in a gruff voice.

[…I'm sorry everyone. There was a bit of friction and the compensation
was late. It is late but I will now reward you.]

[3,000 coins have been acquired for clearing the hidden scenario.]

[You have earned 15,000 coins as compensation for killing the 5th grade
fire dragon.]

[You have obtained the 'Protection Symbol of the Imyuntar' for being the
first to prevent a disaster.]
[In the future, you will get the favour of the Imyuntar people.]

Fortunately, the compensation was paid normally. In addition, the
Protection Symbol of the Imyuntar. Now that I got this, the upcoming fifth
scenario wouldn't be so bad.

It wasn't as much as what I got but the faces of the other party members
were hilarious once they received a clear reward.

By the way… stingy bastards. I caught a disaster and these were the only
rewards?

Then the intermediate dokkaebi started talking.

[By the way, you worked so hard that there was a bit of a problem with the
scenario.]

There was something sarcastic and ominous about his tone.

[As a result of discussions with the Bureau, it was reported that the average
skill of the local incarnations doesn't match the difficulty of the scenario.
Therefore, I have arbitrarily adjusted the difficulty level in my area using
my own judgment.]

…What? A random adjustment?

[The time limit of the fourth scenario has been significantly reduced.]

The mouth of the intermediate dokkaebi curved up strangely as he looked at
me.

…No, this bastard?

[There are 48 hours left until the end of the fourth scenario.]

[All group representatives and members who haven't taken over the target
within the next 48 hours will die.]
Yes… this was what he was planning? Jung Minseob stared at me from
where he was picking up the fallen items. Everyone had probably heard the
message.

"Who has Changsin Station now?"

"T-The Tyrant King."

One of the seven kings of Seoul, the Tyrant King…

I said with a sigh, "Then let's return to Chungmuro."

By the way, I didn't know if Yoo Joonghyuk was doing well or not. Let's
wrap up the fourth scenario.




The distance from Anguk Station to Chungmuro was further than I thought.
During the journey, we exchanged a few stories.

Jung Heewon and Lee Hyunsung walked ahead, while I walked in the rear
with Lee Sungkook and Jung Minseob.

I couldn't take the entire body of the fire dragon so I put half of it on the
exchange. The other half was also placed on the exchange, but I
deliberately put it at a ridiculously high price. It wasn't for sale but a trick to
use the exchange as a warehouse substitute. Bihyung grumbled but I
ignored it. Jung Minseob opened his mouth.

"By the way, Representative-nim."

It felt strange because I really felt like a big company's president when I
kept being called 'Representative-nim'.

"Is your name Kim Dokja?"
"Yes."

"Ah… it really is your name…"

"Is it unusual?"

"…Yes. Honestly, you are more like a prophet than we are."

His voice was rather subdued.

"Sigh… if only I hadn't stopped reading…"

It was a belated regret. At this moment, I had a moment of doubt. There
was something I wanted to ask but I had forgotten.

"Jung Minseob-ssi, I want to ask you something."

"Yes."

"How did the prophets gather so quickly?"

This was a point that I always found strange. It hadn't been more than a
month since the initial scenario started. However, these guys had already
been working as a group.

Furthermore, the apostles were even worse. Based on the first person
protagonist's point of view, they had a fairly high armed force that couldn't
be obtained without occupying a large number of stations.

It was a growth that couldn't be understood with my common sense.

"There was someone who called us together."

"Called you together?"

"Yes. Soon after the first scenario ended, he came to the station where I
was."
Interesting. How was this possible? At that point, there would still be a
barrier between stations.

"He introduced himself as an apostle and said that he had read the great
Book of Revelations. He recruited prophets to follow him. The odd thing
was that it happened simultaneously in different stations. It is hard to
believe it was done by one person…"

"In any case, we gathered because of that apostle. He pulled us into the
group."

"Yes, we call that apostle the 1st Apostle."

"Is he the king of the prophets? The person who hates being called someone
who 'got off'?"

"Ah… you already know. Yes. He likes to be called another name."

Another name?

"He claims to be a 'true reader'."

…What?

"There was a lot of talk about why he would call himself such a name. We
couldn't come to a conclusion. He claimed to have read all of the Book of
Revelations but…"

As the story continued, this person's identity became more and more
doubtful. When I thought about the information he took advantage of, he
didn't seem like a 'reader'…

I was busy thinking when Chungmuro approached. It hadn't been long since
I left but I felt like I had returned to my hometown as I took in the air of
Chungmuro Station.

I restrained my companions from entering the station.
"Wait a minute."

Thinking about it, I was still naked. Why hadn't anyone said anything?

I spoke to Lee Sungkook. "Lee Sungkook-ssi, please take off your pants."

I took the lead to enter Chungmuro Station, while Lee Sungkook was
forced to walk behind me in his underwear.

I could see Yoo Sangah welcoming me in the distance. I looked into her
moist eyes and could see how hard it had been.

Something ran into me and I saw Lee Gilyoung attached to my right leg.

"Have you been well?"

The dusty Lee Gilyoung nodded.

Lee Jihye had a serious injury and hadn't woken up yet. Gong Pildu scoffed
and turned his head as soon as he saw me.

[The constellation 'Defense Master' reproaches you on your late return.]

It was a reaction I could understand since his incarnation nearly died.

"Yoo Sangah-ssi!"

Lee Hyunsung and Jung Heewon didn't know what happened in
Chungmuro and ran towards the people with an aghast expression. People
around the platform were bleeding. In fact, Yoo Sangah had a cloth bound
tightly to her shoulder.

Some of the railroad tracks were covered with blood. They were traces of a
fierce fight. Jung Minseob stuttered, "T-The apostles?"
The heads of number 2, 3, 4 and 7 were lined up side by side on the railroad
tracks. Their expressions seemed like they didn't realize their own death. I
knew who was this skillful.

I asked Lee Gilyoung.

"Where is Yoo Joonghyuk?"

As I spoke, I felt an ominous presence from the Hoehyeong tunnel side. I
knew despite the distance. Our arrogant and dignified hero practiced the
Alone Under Heaven and Earth scripture.

"Yoo Joonghyuk?"

He looked at me with no change in his expression. I thought he would say
something about what happened in the Theatre Dungeon… but what was
this?

The cut off head of a person was still being held in his hands. Someone
screamed while Yoo Joonghyuk threw the head this way.

The head rolling like a toy was covered with a cloak with '1' on it. It was
the 1st Apostle.

Yoo Joonghyuk was really great. He chased this guy to the end and killed
him.

I was half relieved and half anxious. I still had questions but if the apostle
died like this…

At this moment, something ridiculous happened.

"It is you! You screwed up my plan! Right?"

The severed head suddenly started talking to me.

"Waaack! What?" Jung Minseob screamed and fell over.
The eyes looked up at me while he smiled smugly. It was impossible.

The skills that could be used even when the head was cut off was extremely
rare even in Ways of Survival. It was possible if he used the skill Immortal
Delay but even with that skill, he couldn't stay in a state with his head cut
off.

Besides, there was no blood from the cut neck…

Wait. Perhaps?

The information that I received from Lee Sungkook and Jung Minseob
started to run through my head.

A man who revealed himself to all prophets and claimed to be a 'true
reader'. He appeared all over Seoul as soon as the scenario began and
gathered people. In addition, it was possible to pass through the barriers, he
didn't die when his head was cut and there was no blood…

"The Avatar ability…"

I was certain. The guy in front of me was a fake.

The severed head continued to speak.

"Wow, I am really impressed. Pretending to be Yoo Joonghyuk, beating
the apostles and the dragon… What is your identity?" I see. This guy
didn't know my identity?

"What are you?"

As far as I knew, there were very few people who could use the 'Avatar'
ability in Ways of Survival.
The occupation that received such an attribute was normally fixed. They
were occupations engaged in creative work and frequently experienced
dissociative personality disorder due to excessive stress.

I slowly looked him up and down before asking, "You, are you perhaps a
writer?"
Chapter 59: Ep. 12 – First Person Protagonist's Point of View, V


Writer. It was one of the few occupations in Ways of Survival that could
give the Avatar ability.

Some of his strange miracles would be explained if he was a writer.

The lips of the 1st Apostle subtly twisted.

"Writer… do you mean the creator of the Book of Revelations? You have
found out. That's right, I wrote the Book of Revelations."

I didn't mean this but this bastard was suddenly talking nonsense. For me, it
was a truth that wasn't possible. I looked towards Yoo Joonghyuk.

[Exclusive skill, Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint has been activated!]

[The character Yoo Joonghyuk is currently using Lie Detection Lv. 6.]
I knew it. He was a meticulous jerk. I asked once again, "You wrote the
Book of Revelations?"

"Yes. At the same time, I am also the sole owner of the Book of
Revelations."

A confident laugh emerged. Really? Let's challenge it once.

[The character 'Yoo Joonghyuk' has used 'Lie Detection Lv. 6'.]

[The character Yoo Joonghyuk has confirmed that the statement is true.]

…What? This guy was telling the truth? I suddenly panicked and my
circuits got tangled up. It wasn't possible no matter how I thought about it.

I hid my confusion and asked again, "What exactly is the 'revelation' you
are talking about?"

"Why are you asking when you already know? A great epic about the
future."

[The character Yoo Joonghyuk has confirmed that the statement is true.]

…Strange. There was some truth about it?

"Now it is your turn. How did you know about the plan of me and the
apostles? Are you also an apostle?"

"You wrote the Book of Revelations yourself? Then shouldn't you know?"

"It is fun to be an omniscient creator?"

He giggled like a leisurely villain while I regained my composure. No
matter how I looked, he wasn't the author of Ways of Survival.

If he was really the writer of Ways of Survival, there was no way he
wouldn't know that he gave me a text version.
"By the way, it is interesting. I thought the woman in Seodaemun Prison
would be the last apostle but a man like you was hiding…"

"…Seodaemun prison?"

"Hmm, you don't know yet? Let's trade. Reveal your true identity. Then I
will give you some information."

"Let's see? I don't think you have information that I want."

"I might've been overpowered but this isn't my real body. You were a bit
lucky…"

"I know information about the future."

I deliberately interrupted him. Now was the time to sprinkle a bit of spice
for Yoo Joonghyuk.

"In addition, I know much more than you."

[The character Yoo Joonghyuk has confirmed that your words are

true.] The expression of the 1st Apostle stiffened. "You're barking

nonsense. I know more than you…" At this moment, something

flashed in his eyes.

"Wait a minute, perhaps?"

The moment he realized something, I also noticed something. This guy,
was it 'him'? Right now, there were five truths that I knew.

One, he had read Ways of Survival. Two, his occupation was a 'writer'.
Three, he wasn't the writer who wrote Ways of Survival. Four, he wrote a
'text' that told the future. Five, his knowledge was only 'somewhat' accurate.
I read through 3,149 chapters of Ways of Survival.

As far as I knew, Ways of Survival wasn't popular and there was no illegal
text version. But if he was the guy that I thought… it would be
understandable if this guy had a 'text' version and knew a lot about Ways of
Survival.

I opened my mouth.

"Do you like to live while copying others?"

"W-What?"

His eyes were shaken. There was no doubt. The 1st Apostle was him.

"I didn't think you would live like this. The revelation… Do you want to
live like this? My teeth starts grinding together when I think about your
claims of being the creator of the Book of Revelations."

"What…?"

"It is somewhat strange. The information that you have used is meager."

The guy paled.

"Isn't it time to stop acting like this? Are you still doing it despite the world
becoming like this?"

"Yoo Joonghyuk!"

The guy hurriedly looked at Yoo Joonghyuk.

"Yoo Joonghyuk! Work with me!"

He was silly.
"As I said before, I know all of the revelations. Only I can take you to the
end of this road in this world!"

[Exclusive skill, Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint stage 2 has been
activated!]

[Due to high fatigue, you are unable to activate Omniscient
Reader's Viewpoint stage 2.] Damn, right now?

"Think carefully! You can't break through the 46th scenario alone. You
have to hold hands with me to defeat Anna Croft and the Zarathustra!"

This jerk was speaking the same words I did. Yoo Joonghyuk shook his
head.

"I have never heard of the revelations."

"It is like a prophecy! Can't you see my attribute? It even says that I am the
'last'!"

[The character 'Yoo Joonghyuk' has used Sage's Eye Lv.

8!] I also activated the skill.

[The information of this person can't be read in 'Character List'.]

[This person isn't registered in 'Character List'.]

Damn, I couldn't see it. Yoo Joonghyuk verified something with Sage's Eye
and looked at me. The severed head continued to speak.

"Kill him! You should know that he is dangerous. He pretended to be you
and will seriously damage you in the future. If you leave him alone, he will
cause a serious butterfly effect and ruin all your plans!"

I was outraged. Did this jerk want to die together with me?
"…Isn't it the same for you?"

'I am different! Yoo Joonghyuk, hold hands with me. I will give you a vow
or whatever you want! I will never betray you!"

He came out strongly. Yoo Joonghyuk watched the situation and opened his
mouth.

"I see. Joining hands…"

Life started to creep into Yoo Joonghyuk's eyes as he looked at me. I
couldn't inside his mind so I was going crazy. Yoo Joonghyuk slowly
moved his sword towards me. The 1st Apostle's momentum rose as he
shouted.

"Go ahead and kill him! Kill him!"

"One is a prophet and one is a revelator…"

"Kill him!

Peok! Yoo Joonghyuk trampled on the head of the 1st Apostle.

"Kuk… what?"

"If you really know the future then let me ask you one thing."

"What?"

The blade moved to my neck. The 'One Sword' that I experienced through
Yoo Joonghyuk was now heading towards me. I felt a sting and something
warm flowed down my neck.

"Hey! What are you doing?"
The surprised Jung Heewon ran towards this side. I raised my hand and
restrained the party. I was nervous but it wasn't good to stimulate Yoo
Joonghyuk here.

Yoo Joonghyuk asked the 1st Apostle.

"I will ask you. Will I kill this guy now or not?"

"What?"

"If you have really received a revelation of the future, you will know my
choice."

…This bastard had a bad habit. He was doing this again?

The face of the 1st Apostle looked agonized. Maybe I was the same on the
'Even Bridge'. Surprisingly, the answer came quickly.

"Of course you will kill him! You must do it!"

It was a face full of strong convictions. His face was arrogantly assured that
Yoo Joonghyuk would act like this.

"Come on, kill him! And…!"

The sword moved. But what followed wasn't the sound of flesh being cut.

Kwajik!

The head of the 1st Apostle burst as it was stepped on.

The person wouldn't die because it was an avatar, but he would suffer
considerable psychological damage.

Yoo Joonghyuk's sword was soon removed.

"He was a mouthy bastard."
I was a bit stunned. Yoo Joonghyuk chose to spare me? I felt a bit shaken. I
wasn't sure…

Yoo Joonghyuk stared at me for a moment before walking away.

"Hey! Where are you going?"

This jerk, he must think he was so cool.

…Honestly, he was a bit cool.

"Just wait! Are you going to leave with Lee Jihye?"

"Since the future has changed, the plan has also changed."

"Why don't you act together with me? I can help you."

Yoo Joonghyuk turned towards me. I reflexively shrank back at his eyes.

"The debt is paid off. My last favour is not taking away your flag."

This bastard? But I couldn't retreat like this.

"In any case, you can't leave the station unless I remove you from the
group. Do you want to receive the punishment?"

Yoo Joonghyuk slowly moved his hand towards the hilt of his sword. I
quickly added.

"I know what your plan is. Aren't you going towards Jung-gu? It is your
goal to complete the black flag by walking the King's Road. I will help
you."

"I would rather take your flag right now."

"Then try it. Is your sword faster or my tongue faster?"
It was a gamble. Yoo Joonghyuk could stab my neck before the effect of
the punishment appeared.

"You don't need to go towards Jung-gu. Go to the north. The territory of the
Tyrant King will be yours and it will help you make your grand flag.
Getting a flag and removing the enemy, isn't it killing two birds with one
stone?"

"I can do it myself."

"There are 48 hours left until the end of the fourth scenario. Can you
occupy 20 stations and complete the black flag in that time?" Yoo
Joonghyuk's hands hesitated. He was caught.

"Besides…don't you have a reason for going north? Surely you aren't going
to throw away your family member at this time?"

"…You."

"Remain calm. I am speaking in good faith. I really will help."

Yoo Joonghyuk's angry eyes stared at me for a moment. The atmosphere
was strained. The killing intent soon disappeared.

"There is no such thing as anything free in the world. What are your
conditions?"

As expected, the regressor was quick to notice. I said with a smile, "It is
simple. Let me know just one thing. My condition is that simple."

"What is it?"

"That guy you just stepped on, what is his attribute? One would be the 'last
to get off'. What is the other one?"

After a while, Yoo Joonghyuk opened his mouth.
10 minutes afterwards, I called Jung Minseob and Lee Sungkook. It was a
separate matter for the two of them. Before I could open my mouth, Jung
Minseob asked me first.

"In the end, what was that guy?"

I hesitated for a moment before asking.

"Do you know the novel 'SSSSS-grade Infinite Regressor'?"

"Ah, I read it!"

Lee Sungkook raised his hand.

"Wasn't it the number one platinum novel on Textpia? It was really fun…"

"Ah, that's right. I had forgotten but now it rings a bell. How did it finish?"
The two of them started speaking loudly as memories popped up. As
expected, these guys must be interested in web novels if they read Ways of
Survival.

"There were all types of elements but… it was still fun."

In fact, I read that novel. I was reading Ways of Survival and accidently
clicked on it since it was on the 'Today's Best' list. Then I was surprised to
see the development and setting of the novel.

–An infinite regressor psychopath.

–Sponsorship from transcendent beings.

–Streaming system.

–A survival game with absurd missions.
In fact, these were common settings. The problem was the details of the
common settings and the way they were combined. I had left a comment as
soon as I read it.

–Isn't this plagiarizing Ways of Survival?

I remembered. Rather than a plagiarism controversy, I was criticized for
comparing it to a bad novel.

I received terrible messages from the readers of SSSSS-grade Infinite
Regressor.

–Isn't your business over there? Stop causing inconveniences ㅉ ㅉ
I was furious and even sent a note to the writer of Ways of Survival. Then
the author said something. He was in a better mood because the number of
views had increased. I teared up because I thought the author was pitiful.

Lee Sungkook asked, "But why are you talking about this novel?"

"The 1st Apostle is the author of SSSSS-grade Infinite Regressor."

"Huh? It can't be."

That author would know Ways of Survival.

Now that the world had turned into the novel, a writer who plagiarized the
novel could claim copyrights on this world. In addition, he added the
absurd setting of the 'revelation'.

After some explanations, Jung Minseob understood and made an absurd
expression.

"It was a plagiarized novel?"

"Yes."
"Come to think of it, the novel was similar… I can't remember well because
it is old… why didn't that novel pop up first in my mind? I was much more
famous."

"Is it due to the attribute? Only the portion we read popped up. The 'SS' part
is also confusing because there are too many novels with them."

"Is that so? In any case, the 1st Apostle is a plagiarist? Then he will have a
text version…"

I nodded and said.

"Maybe he has a copy of his own plagiarized work. He copied the plot of
the original so he can see the future of this world to a certain extent."

It was painful when thinking that a plagiarist was successful even in this
changed world. It was time to implement justice.

"Then isn't it impossible to win against him? If he copied the original to the
end…"

"It isn't to the end. He only copied the early parts. He would stop early to
prevent a plagiarism controversy later on. After a bit more time, the
information he knows will decrease.

"How do you know this?"

"I just know."

It was natural. In the chapters in the 100s, I was the only reader of Ways of
Survival.

"Excuse me, how far did Representative-nim read in the original work…?"

"Before that, there is something you have to do. To be exact, it is something
we have to do together."
Their shoulders stiffened.

"Didn't you tell me before? The prophets were hit by the Tyrant King."

"Ah… maybe there are still a few people being used by him.

"Really? Then it is better."

"Yes?"

The time remaining until the scenario ended was 48 hours. It was hard to do
it alone if I wanted to hunt the Tyrant King.

"I will disturb the information of these guys."

If the Tyrant King was using the prophets, I could take advantage of it.

"Reveal part of the revelations."

"Huh? How…?"

They still didn't understand what I was talking about so I kindly explained.

"From now on, we will make a text of SSSSS-grade Infinite Regressor and
spread it."

If there were several enemies, the answer was to make them fight against
each other.
                  Chapter 60: Ep. 13 – War of Kings, I


My plan was clear.

The 1st Apostle, the plagiarist, had information about the 'third and fourth
regressions' that were the beginning of Ways of Survival. As was always
the case with informed people, he monopolized information and hid it from
the prophets.

On the other hand, the Tyrant King was one of Seoul's Seven Kings who
used the 'revelations' after knowing about the existence of the prophets.

The guy who wanted to monopolize information and the guy who tried to
dig it out. It was obvious what would happen if the two of them faced each
other.

Lee Sungkook asked, "…Then you are going to make a novel text?"

"That's right."
The plan itself was simple. We would make a text of the plagiarized writer's
novel. Then spread it among the people of each station.

Well, it was roughly this type of feeling.

–Some of the prophets' revelations have been leaked!

The finish was laid out well.

Thanks to Han Donghoon's Internet comments manipulation, information
on the prophets had already spread on the Internet. If the leaking of a txt
version was known, there would be a big ripple.

A few early readers would try to get a hidden piece while the Tyrant King
would naturally move to obtain them.

"But…I have forgotten most of the contents of SSSSS-grade Infinite
Regressor. How will we make the text?"

"Why do we need the contents of the plagiarized novel?"

"Huh?"

"We remember the original."

"Ah…!"

There was a short cry of admiration. However, Jung Minseob's face was
still dark.

"Eh… there is still a problem. The hidden pieces that we know about in
Ways of Survival have been mostly used…"

"I will give you information in hidden pieces. I know a few that are present
in the beginning. I will release information on items of the right level."
Above all, it had to catch the eye of the plagiarist writer and the Tyrant
King.

Lee Sungkook laughed awkwardly. "This is funny. I will make a text
version. I am usually just a reader."

This jerk… was he an illegal downloader?

Jung Minseob also spoke.

"But if we do this, won't we be the same as him? In the end, we are
plagiarizing the original story to make a story…"

It made sense. I thought for a moment before saying.

"There is such a thing. Plagiarism is about not wanting you to know the
original, a parody is more fun if you know the original while a homage
wants you to know the original."

"Oh, this is interesting."

"From now on, we will be making a homage."

It was true. I hoped that many people would come to know SSSSS-grade
Infinite Regressor. That way he would be quickly ruined.

We borrowed a laptop from Gong Pildu and started typing. We didn't have
a lot of experience in writing novels so we had to put our heads together.
Jung Minseob pulled his hair and said,

"Writing is so difficult… writers are great…"

"Just write roughly. We just need information that will attract them. Rather,
an imperfect revelation might be easier to deceive the prophets. Mix the
truth and lies."

I watched what Jung Minseob typed and added some information.
"Let's change the names of the people in the novel. I am a bit anxious."

Lee Hyunsung and Lee Jihye would be shocked about being characters in
the story. Whether I liked it or not, someday they would find out that this
world was a 'novel'. But it didn't have to be right now.

Then Jung Minseob unexpectedly said, "Well, I don't think you need to
worry about that part."

"Huh?"

"In fact, I tried to test some people by saying that this was a novel. But they
didn't understand it at all. It is like a NPC… No matter how serious I am,
they just take it as a joke."

It was an unexpected piece of information.

Jung Minseob and the other apostles had spoken to characters several times
about them being 'supporting actors'. Thinking about the reactions of the
characters at the time… there was definitely something strange.

Jung Minseob continued to speak.

"This was how the 1st Apostle was able to easily find the prophets. The
'characters' were very displeased by the words 'this is a novel' or they didn't
listen. Perhaps this was why the apostles used the term 'revelation'."

I suddenly felt uneasy when I heard this. I opened my mouth. "…What is
the difference between the characters and us?"

"Huh? Um… we are people in reality and characters are people in novels?
Isn't that the difference?"

"Then… when was this world divided into reality and a novel?"

"Hrmmm, well… When the first scenario started?"
My question wasn't resolved with Jung Minseob's answer.

Jung Minseob and Lee Sungkook were obviously outsiders of the novel like
me. It was because I couldn't see their information at first.

But not long after, it was updated and I was able to look at their information
in Character List.

Then were they now 'real people' or were they 'characters?' If everyone
became a character over time…

I looked at Yoo Sangah and Lee Gilyoung for a moment.

[The exclusive skill, Character List is activated.]

[This person isn't registered in 'Character List'.]

[Currently collecting information about the corresponding figure.]

Fortunately, I still couldn't see the information for both of them.

Yoo Sangah suddenly looked back at me and smiled. Lee Gilyoung also
looked at me.

"What is it hyung?"

"It is nothing."

I didn't know why but I felt strangely relieved.




Soon after, we approximately completed the novel.
The quality was so bad that if it was serialized in Textpia, it would've
bombed. But that didn't matter right ow.

"Let's first sprinkle the information that the Book of Revelations has been
leaked."

Lee Sungkook asked.

"Is there enough time to spread the information?"

"Donghun will take care of it. If we take advantage of the Hermit Invalid, it
can be spread in a short amount of time."

"Oh, Donghu… I see. But what if not all stations are capable of the
Internet?"

"Then we will send someone."

I looked behind me. Kang Ilhun nodded as if he had been waiting.

Lee Sungkook agreed. "Ah, that's right. If it is Ilhun-ssi… I had forgotten."

"Kang Ilhun-ssi, are you ready?"

Kang Ilhun, the deputy of Dongdaemun. It was worth intentionally saving
this guy.

Kang Ilhun nervously opened his mouth. "Leave it to me. I am confident
that
I can catch them. I just need to spread rumours?"

[The character 'Kang Ilhun' will follow your will.]

[Your understanding of this person has increased.]

Kang Ilhun. It was finally time to use the attribute of Rumours Expert. The
time remaining until the scenario ended was 44 hours.
The next day, the game would begin.




–Donghun, thank you.

–I am just paying you back so don't worry.

[The character 'Han Donghoon' trusts you a little bit.]

Since last time, 'Hermit King of Shadows' Han Donghoon had moderately
opened up his heart to me. The fact that I saved him from the prophets
seemed to have played a bigger role than expected.

–I feel a strange sense of familiarity with you.

–Familiarity?

–Since a long time ago… are you also a hermit?

–Um, no I wasn't. Although I was a bit timid.

–I see. I feel an unknown wall with hyung. I can't explain it well but I like
the feeling.

–Isn't it usually bad to feel a wall?

–I only believe in people with walls. In order to understand someone, I
think I should face that wall first.

A person who was barely 17 years old was speaking like a wise man.

In any case, the wall. I was sure that he was right. Some walls couldn't be
crossed no matter how desperate the person.
–In any case, the rumour has spread. But how will you sow the revelations?
On the Internet again?

–No, the wrong people will read it if I place it on the Internet. I will sell it.

–Sell it? How?

I started to explain to Han Donghoon.




There were 40 hours remaining until the end of the scenario.

I finally summoned the Chungmuro group members.

"This journey won't be easy. If we can't take Changsin Station in the next
40 hours, our group will be wiped out. However, our current forces aren't
enough."

"Well, since when has it been easy? Who is the opponent?"

I replied to Jung Heewon's question. "He is called the Tyrant King. He is
one of the top seven kings of Seoul and the king with the largest territory."

Lee Hyunsung asked this time. "What type of person is he?"

"He is someone who started from Dobong-gu and built his own kingdom.
He says that any beautiful or handsome man and woman will become
concubines, while any ugly people will be killed or become slaves."

Jung Heewon frowned. "If Dokja-ssi is caught, you will become a slave."

"…Well, I think it will be dangerous for Heewon-ssi."
"Being a concubine is difficult… Why don't we just go ahead and kill
him?"

"It will be hard because his sponsor is quite strong. Now there are two
paths. Take his flag or take over his headquarters, Dobong Station."

Neither was easy, causing everyone to feel tense. I decided to get to the
point.

"We will go to Gwanghwamun."

"Huh? Didn't you say not to fight them?"

"They will come to us."

"Why?"

"I leaked a bit of information. We have to consider the time he moves so we
will leave soon. Everyone should be prepared… eh?"

"…What is it?"

I subtly smiled at Yoo Sangah's question.

"Nothing. It is just happening faster than I expected."

Han Donghoon's message appeared on my smartphone.

–I was able to put it on the exchange. But is it okay?

–Yes, it's fine. Well done.

Then system messages entered my ears one after another.

[The items on the exchange have been sold.]

[The items on the exchange have been sold.]
At that moment, a trembling voice was heard from the air.

[…Are you a scammer?]

'What is the reaction among the constellations?'

[They are really excited. The filtering limit has started to unravel… there
are those who gave it as gifts to their incarnations. But if you do this, you
will receive attention again. Will you be okay? And if you release all the
information you know, won't it go against you?] 'It isn't disadvantageous'.

I still had information remaining. The information I released wasn't
information I needed. Rather, it was information that would be damaging to
someone.

'Give me the coins'.

[Here.]

[16 volumes of SSSSS-grade Infinite Regressors have been sold on the
exchange.]

[You have earned 16,000 coins.]

Of course, I didn't release the information for free.

Anyone who needed the information would have a sponsor, so it was better
to sell it on the 'exchange' than to release it for free on the Internet.

If I released the Book of Revelations for free, it would be more suspicious.
But what if I sold it?

Of course they would buy it. It was because they would mistakenly think
the information had 'value'. The quality of the information was sometimes
determined by value rather than content.

By the way, it was 16,000 coins. This was a profit.
I spoke to the people. "I'm sorry but I will sleep for a while."

"…Aren't you taking it too easy?"

"I also need to sleep."

I lay down. Yoo Sangah covered me with a thin blanket. Jung Heewon still
found it absurd.

Then I fell asleep. After a while, a system message was heard in my blurred
consciousness.

[Exclusive skill, Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint stage 3 has been
activated!]

So far, I figured out that Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint was divided into
three stages.

Stage 1 allowed me to read the simple actions or emotions of characters.

Stage 2 allowed me to see deep inside the character.

Stage 3 allowed me to see the surrounding scenery where the characters
were located or directly immerse myself in the character.

So far, I had entered stage 3 twice. Once was in my dream and the second
time was when I died. In my dream, I saw Yoo Joonghyuk leaving Gumho
Station. When I was dead, I witnessed the scenery of Chungmuro.

These two incidents had similarities. My consciousness was muddled and
unstable. But this wasn't the only condition to trigger stage 3.

There was one important fact. It was…

「 'Representative-nim, are you watching? Damn… is this right?'

Kang Ilhun muttered to himself as he gazed into the air.
'I have spread it to the King of Tyrants. Those guys will move soon. By the
way, you are listening to me right?' 」

The character and I needed to be thinking about each other at the same
time.

After a while, my point of view shifted to Kang Ilhun.

「The man smiled, revealing his white teeth. A man wearing a magnificent
crown and a coat of gold slowly rose from the throne, women surrounding
him.

"A new revelation?"

"It is certain. I bought the information using coins."

"Who released the information?"

"It is probably one of the prophets."

"Is it reliable?"

"I checked some of the hidden pieces in the revelations and they were all
true."

The man laughed, revealing his teeth.

"Let's go to Gwanghwamun. Before the others get there first." 」

Good. The Tyrant King was finally moving. Now the problem was on the
other side.

I thought about Jung Minseob.

「 'Representative-nim! I have arrived'. 」

The timing was good.
Jung Minseob was at Sejong University and heading to Gwanghwamun in
advance. He then looked at the surrounding scenery.

「 I am certain since he is wearing the same hood like a chunni. It is him'.
」

People were in the lower part of the building. As I thought, the plagiarist
was the fastest. Gwanghwamun contained one of the hidden pieces most
useful for the third regression. The plagiarist wouldn't be able to run away
from this place.

「 The problem is that more people are coming. Yeongdeungpo, Yongsan,
Seongdong-gu, the kings on those sides are moving… isn't this becoming
too big?' 」

No, it was what I was hoping for. The people who were hiding started to
emerge one by one. It was better since I didn't need to visit each one
individually.

Finally, the fourth scenario was ending. The real War of Kings would
begin.
                Chapter 61: Ep. 13 – War of Kings, II


My consciousness rose silently and my senses slowly returned to reality.

[Exclusive skill, Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint stage 3 has ended.]

The third stage was more tiring than I thought and I couldn't maintain it for
long.

In addition, I found out one more thing that I regretted.

It was that using Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint stage 3 wouldn't always
result in gaining a skill. It seemed to be a reward that could be obtained by
entering the 1st person protagonist's point of view. Unfortunately, I didn't
know the entry requirements.

It would be great if I could get Yoo Joonghyuk's skills every time I fell
asleep and used 1st person protagonist's point of view.

I opened my eyes and saw Jung Heewon watching me.
"You were talking in your sleep again."

Talking? No way.

"What did I say?"

"It sounded like… Mother."

"…Mother?"

Why was I saying that to myself? It was hard to know if this was the truth
or not.

Jung Heewon just looked at me with a mysterious smile.

I gave a cursory reply.

"Well, I'm not really worried about my mother. Rather, I have a request for
Jung Heewon-ssi."

"What is it?"

"Heewon-ssi, please don't participate in the Gwanghwamun battle this
time."

"…Why?"

"There is something else you need to do. I can only entrust Heewon-ssi
with
it."

Jung Heewon licked her lips like she couldn't believe me.

"I will try. What is it?"
The first thing I did after conversing with Jung Heewon was to decide who
would stay in Chungmuro and who would go to Gwanghwamun.

"Jung Heewon-ssi has a mission and I will decide the rest of the people
remaining in Chungmuro."

The other members gulped. They looked like vassals about to be chosen by
the king.

"First of all, Gong Pildu and Lee Hyunsung will stay behind."

"Bah, I am just your slave."

Gong Pildu scoffed like he already expected it. The problem was Lee
Hyunsung. The slightly pale face was troubled, as if he had somehow
missed out on a promotion.

"Hyunsung-ssi must remain. I need someone to protect this place with
Gong Pildu-ssi. Hyunsung-ssi can protect Chungmuro and lead the people
as well as Yoo Sangah-ssi."

"…Yes. I understand."

His expression was somewhat sad but he had no choice. There was a reason
for leaving the Steel Sword behind.

"Hyunsung-sso already has great skills. The problem is that the skill levels
are too low. While we are gone, Hyunsung-ssi should increase the
proficiency of Great Mountain Smash. Hyunsun-ssi's help will be needed
after the end of this scenario."

Lee Hyunsung's face brightened slightly.

"Yep! Please leave it to me."

Soldiers were the most efficient when following commands and when they
had a routine.
Thus, we embarked on the journey to Gwanghwamun. Apart from Lee
Jihye and Yoo Joonghyuk who were impossible to control, the core
members were Yoo Sangah, Lee Gilyoung and Lee Sungkook.

The Chungmuro group members waved as they watched us leave.

"Deputy-nim! Come back safely!"

"You must be safe!"

For a few days now, Yoo Sangah's popularity had pierced the sky. Yoo
Sangah only led the people for a short amount of time but everyone was
concerned about her. However, Yoo Sangah looked uneasy.

"Dokja-ssi, will I be a help to you?"

Her self-deprecation had returned. I had to say it this time, even if she
would be hurt.

"Yoo Sangah-ssi. You will be disruptive if you keep acting like this."

"Yes…"

"Yoo Sangah-ssi is good enough. Would I take someone with me for no
reason?"

"I believe in Dokja-ssi. But I can't be as helpful to you as Heewon-ssi or
Hyunsung-ssi…"

"The two of them can't do what Yoo Sangah-ssi can do. Yoo Sangah-ssi is
necessary for this plan."

Yoo Sangah's expression slightly relaxed as it was emphasized once again.
Yoo Sangah was an exceptionally talented person. She just needed
confidence.

"Didn't you study Korean history before?"
"Ah, yes."

Yoo Sangah's expression became brighter once mentions of the past
emerged. But it was only for a moment as she quickly became grouchy
again.

"…It is useless now."

"It isn't useless. This is why I brought Yoo Sangah-ssi along."

Originally, I hadn't intended to give this role to Yoo Sangah. There was a
suitable person if I went down to Gwangjin-gu. However, I didn't have time
to look for him so Yoo Sangah would have to be enough.

The Yoo Sangah that I knew was smart enough to memorize the entire
history of South Korea just to get a first grade degree in Korean history.

"Do you remember the statue of Samyeongdang from last time?"

"Yes."

"There will be many similar things on the way to Gwanghwamun. There is
the National Museum and several statues.

Yoo Sangah shouted once she realized what I was saying.

"Ah! I see. That reminds me, the power of the constellations can remain in
relics or remnants of themselves."

"Yes, Yoo Sangah-ssi's mission is to find such keepsakes or relics."

"I understand! I will use my head."

"There are some famous people but the more unknown they are, the better."

Despite being on the same level, a constellation's strength varied according
to their popularity.
It could be seen in the difference between Samyeongdang and Duke of
Loyalty and Warfare.

The items left behind by Samyeongdang were B-grade, while the sword left
by the Duke of Loyalty and Warfare had the quality to be S-grade.

"We need to gather as much items on the way to Gwanghwamun as
possible. Our side has a relatively small number of people."

Perhaps the Tyrant King had come with hundreds of incarnations. The
plagiarist would have his own forces. I also needed to be careful of the
kings who came from Yeongdeungpo, Yongsan and Seongdong-gu.

The latter part of the fourth scenario was just like a proxy war for the
constellations. At the end of this scenario, an event greatly coveted by the
constellations was hiding.

Unlike before, the incarnations would have a high synchronization with
their constellations and the risks would increase accordingly. Since many
constellations were determined by the history of their lives, Yoo Sangah
who knew history would be useful in many ways in this scenario.

Yoo Sangah suddenly clapped.

"Ah, that reminds me of a place."

"Huh?"

"I'm not sure if I'm remembering correctly but… there will probably be
Gwangsengmyo Shrine near here."

"Gwangsengmyo?"

"Yes, it is on the way and the power of a great person might be there. He
isn't South Korean but…"
Not South Korean? I was a reader of Ways of Survival and I had never
heard of Gwangsengmyo.

In any case, we decided to move according to Yoo Sangah. We walked for
a while.

The first one who screamed was Lee Sungkook. "Eh, is that it?"

There really was an old shrine nearby. The Gwangsengmyo shrine. There
was a place like this in the middle of the city?

I read the description and was even more surprised. Huh, it was this person?
It was an unexpected figure.

It was a shrine for one of the best Chinese gods of war.

Yoo Sangah asked with a tense expression.

"Now what…?"

I looked around. An idol couldn't be seen.

"Let's pray."

This was different from Samyeongdang. I wouldn't always be able to get a
good reward for destroying the idol.

We collected water from the shrine and prayed quietly. Some time passed.
Then a system message was heard.

[This shrine has been neglected for a long time.]

[A constellation who loves gaundaos is pleased.]

[A constellation who loves gundaos has revealed his modifier.]
[The constellation 'Lord of the Beautiful Beard, Marquis Zhuangmou' has
blessed you.]

Lord of the Beautiful Beard, Marquis Zhuangmou. He was Chinese but he
was a great person almost everyone in South Korea knew.

It was because this constellation was Guan Yoo¹ from Romance of the
Three Kingdoms.

[The constellation's blessing increases your strength and physique by 5 for
the next 24 hours.]

Lee Sungkook turned rosy like a flower.

"Crazy… Representative-nim, isn't this a complete jackpot?"

"It is a decent start."

I didn't know why there was a shrine for Guan Yoo in Seoul but it shouldn't
be strange when there was a shrine for the Duke of Loyalty and Warfare in
Japan. Guan Yoo was world famous, just like the Duke of Loyalty and
Warfare.

"I guess it is hard to get an item from here."

"It would've been nice to get something like a guandao…"

He was a great person of China. Even if there was an idol, it didn't mean a
good item would appear in South Korea. It was more likely that an
incarnation of China had obtained it…

He couldn't be compared to the Great Sage, Heaven's Equal or Uriel, but he
wouldn't lose when it came to the Chinese constellations.

Lee Gilyoung grabbed my collar.

"Hyung."
The cockroach's antennae was moving wildly. I had a bad hunch and saw a
group walking in the distance. There were approximately 50 people.

I used Calm Observation and saw that their average physical body stats
were around level 40. It was lacking compared to the apostles, but it was
still enough to call them elites.

A warlord with 50 elites.

Lee Sungkook muttered, "That armour, somewhere…"

The historical clothing reminded me of a museum gallery. I looked at the
members and they were all handsome men.

Lee Sungkook muttered, "Isn't that Hwang Sungmin in the first row? He
seems to be an entertainer?"

Anyone who saw it would think it was a historical drama filming but
bloodthirst was coming from them. A man came forward and pointed his
spear towards me.

"Who is blocking the way of the king?"

"Who are you?"

I guessed but I still asked. I thought I would meet this person later but the
timing was faster than expected.

A woman's voice was heard from among the group of men.

"That brown flag… are you also a king?"

"…So what?"

"I didn't think there would be a king in Jung-gu. It is amazing."

Her voice was like petals blowing in the spring breeze. It was a stage voice.
I replied, "Kings are now common in this world."

"A king might be common but not just anyone can become king. Everyone,
open the path!"

The retainers moved in unison and a woman dressed in a royal costume
appeared in the center of the ranks. Her hair was raised in an elegant
manner. She was a stunning beauty that could easily be the heroine of a
historical drama.

"A-Are you Min Jiwon?"

Lee Sungkook stuttered. The woman laughed.

"You recognize me?"

"I am a fan!"

Lee Sungkook stepped forward in a spellbound manner. Fool. The
Hypnotist was being bewitched first?

[The exclusive skill 'Destroy Evil Lv. 2' is activated.]

I used it the moment I met Lee Sungkook's eyes.

"I-I-I'm sorry."

The woman's eyes narrowed.

By the way, it was interesting. Lee Sungkook recognized the name Min
Jiwon like she was a person who actually existed.

…One of the Seven Kings of Seoul, the King of Beauty was a real person?

I felt a bit strange. It was because the real name of the King of Beauty in
Ways of Survival was 'Min Jiwon'.
Was it just a coincidence? I should check it out.

[The exclusive skill, Character List is activated.]

Fortunately, the skill was activated safely.

  her. Her wonderful beauty will shine even more with the backing of
  her sponsor. Her army will only be loyal to her unless her beauty fades.


As expected, she was the King of Beauty in the original Ways of Survival.

Looking at Character List, she didn't seem to be a real person… then how
did Lee Sungkook know her?
Did it have something to do with Lee Sungkook's entry in the Character
List?

I bowed my head once.

"Min Jiwon-ssi, it is an honour to meet you."

"…Are you also my fan?"

Fan…

She had an outstanding beauty but it wasn't my style. Looking objectively,
Yoo Sangah was just as beautiful as her. Lee Sungkook was spellbound due
to the unique skill this woman possessed.

I deliberately spoke like I was in a historical drama. "I'm

not a fan. But do you know him? Seongdong-gu's king."

Min Jiwon's expression hardened.

"You…?"

Slumbering Lady of Fine Brocade.

There was only one constellation with such distinctive features in all of
Ways of Survival.

"It looks like you have a very high degree of synchronization with your
sponsor. Please tell this to your sponsor. It is an honour to meet the last
queen of Silla."

Slumbering Lady of Fine Brocade. This was the title for the last queen of
Silla, Queen Jinseong².

[The sponsor behind 'Min Jiwon' is greatly shaken.]
"Don't panic. Didn't you come to realize Silla's wish?"

It sometimes happened like this. The coordination between sponsor and
incarnation was overturned. The sponsor would force their unfulfilled wish
onto their incarnation.

It was a mistake often made by the senior constellations. There was a
possibility of being destroyed by the posthumous storm.

Min Jiwon narrowed her eyes.

"You…"

Now according to the development of Ways of Survival, the three areas of
Seongdong-gu, Yongsan-gu and Yeongdeungpo-gu were fighting fiercely.

Just like the old days on the Korean peninsula. Then a message popped up.

[A bounty scenario has occurred!]
Huh? Bounty?


  [Bounty Scenario – Unification of the Three Kingdoms]

  Category: Bounty

  Difficulty: ???

  Clear Conditions: The great people of Silla want the incarnation of
  Silla, 'Min Jiwon' to become king of the three regions. Help
  incarnation 'Min Jiwon' and kill the kings who have the backgrounds
  of Later Baekje and Taebong. If this scenario succeeds, you will gain
  the favour of the constellation, Slumbering Lady of Fine Brocade.

  Time Limit: 38 hours
   Compensation: 2,000 coins.

   Failure: ―


I stared at the scenario window blankly while Min Jiwon sent me a
coquettish smile.

"My sponsor wants to see your sincerity. Won't you accept? I won't speak
much longer. Become my subordinate."

She spoke in such a domineering tone despite only offering 2,000 coins. I
couldn't help smiling. This sponsor was completely seeing me as a poor
person.

[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' dislikes the sponsor of
'Min Jiwon'.]

[The constellation 'Secretive Plotter' is laughing at the constellation.]

[2,000 coins have been sponsored.]

[5 volumes of Revelation – SSSSS-grade Infinite Regressor have been sold
on the exchange.]

[You have obtained 5,000 coins as compensation.]

I was curious about what this woman would look like if she heard the
messages that I was hearing right now.

What did she want me to do for 2,000 coins?

[The constellation 'Slumbering Lady of Fine Brocade' is waiting for your
response.]

I shrugged towards the confident Min Jiwon and replied, "I don't want to."

Min Jiwon's eyes shook violently. Some of the men opened their mouths
and even the actress Min Jiwon couldn't control her face. She spoke in a
dumbfounded voice.

"…Huh?" Rather than accepting the given reality, she chose to doubt her
hearing. "I think I heard wrong… can you tell me again?"

"I don't want to be your underling."

It was laughable to become her subordinate for only 2,000 coins. I spoke to
my party members waiting behind me. "Let's go. We have to hurry."
We turned around without hesitation and Min Jiwon shouted in an urgent
voice.

"Wait a minute! I can give more coins if it is lacking. I can talk to my
sponsor―"

"There is no need."

"I said to wait!" She ran urgently and blocked my way. It was a rather quick
movement compared to her agility level. "Don't you know the value of
2,000 coins?"

Didn't she know? I could easily get a few bursts of 2,000 coins.

Min Jiwon spoke with narrowed eyes. "Can you afford to pretend like
this?"

"…Pretending?"

"The war between the three kingdoms will soon begin. I don't know who
your sponsor is but the small and medium groups in the area will be cleaned
up. Honestly, it isn't enough that you didn't accept the 2,000 coins. But is it
possible that you haven't figured it out yet? I am the king of Silla. The king
who will soon unify the three kingdoms!"

She seemed to lose sight of reality as she became immersed in her acting.
Well, Min Jiwon was originally like this.

She was an excellent actress and due to her deep synchronization with
'Queen Jinseong', she would live thinking that she really was the last queen
of Silla.

This was why method acting was scary.

"It seems you are mistaken about something. This isn't the age of the Later
Three Kingdoms¹."
"You are the one who is mistaken about the era. The Republic of South
Korea is over. Are you still waiting for rescue?" She suddenly started
speaking bullshit. "A new era has opened. The beginning of this era will
start with me, Min Jiwon."

I was mistaken. This type of nonsense sounded plausible when placed in
this context. I was worried about how to separate from this woman when
Yoo Sangah handled it for me.

"Q-Queen-nim?"

"What?"

"As far as I know… Silla is the weakest country in the Later Three
Kingdoms… won't it be hard based on the history? The one who unified the
Three Kingdoms…"

Min Jiwon paled from the surprise attack.

"W-What do you know?"

"I… have a 1st grade degree in Korean history."

"1-1st grade Korean history…" The embarrassed Min Jiwon stuttered.
"What is so great about 1st grade Korean history?"

"Let's go Yoo Sangah-ssi. She doesn't know history very well."

Min Jiwon's face became redder at my words.

"Just wait! My proposal isn't over yet. How about 3,000 coins?"

I turned around without saying anything.

"3,500 coins! I'll give you 3,500!"
It was only increased by 500. Now I knew the scale of the queen's capital.
As expected, the constellations had different levels of wealth according to
their popularity.

I ignored her and kept walking.

"3,600, no 3,700…!"

My footsteps stopped. I looked back and saw Min Jiwon making a 'that's
right' expression.

I was also a bad guy. I could just walk away but I wanted to smash it. I
opened my mouth and spoke in a blunt voice. "Rather, I want to make you
an offer."

"What do you mean?"

"10,000, how about it?"

"…10,000?"

"Oh, is it too low? You are a king… then I will make it 20,000."

Min Jiwon's expression hardened. She glared at me.

"Are you joking with me right now? 20,000 coins? I don't think you are
worth that much…"

"No, I mean that I will buy you for 20,000 coins."

"Huh?"

"To be exact, you and all your troops."

Her mouth dropped open in a daze before she barely regained her senses.

"Y-You don't have that many coins."
"I wonder what you will say when I show you this."

I pressed my index finger and thumb together. Then at the end of my index
finger, the part of my coins showed up.

[20,000 coins.]

Min Jiwon's barely maintained poker face finally collapsed.

"T-This is ridiculous!"

"Do you believe me now?"

It didn't take long for distrust to turn to astonishment, astonishment to turn
into greed.

It was natural. 20,000 coins was a truly huge amount. It was an amount that
could affect the dominance of the three forces in the Later Three Kingdoms.

Unfortunately, greed couldn't break her pride.

"Are you trying to buy me with money?"

"Why? Is it impossible? You are the one who made the proposal first."

The leader of her subordinates came forward.

"You dare!"

He had a slender body and was very handsome. He didn't seem to have
much muscles but they were hidden. Yoo Sangah said, "Dokja-ssi, this
man…"

I realized it the moment Yoo Sangah spoke. Yes, Silla had this
constellation.
Silla wasn't at an absolute disadvantage in the war between the three
kingdoms. Looking at the era, there were quite a few competent people.

For example, Kim Yushin or… the problem was that there was no Kim
Yushin in the current Silla period.

"Gwanchang is a good constellation. But he is rash. What if my
constellation
was Gyebaek? I don't think you want to reproduce the battle of
Huangshanbeol²."

The confused man's eyes widened.

"You… are you from Baekje?"

[The constellation 'Hwarang³ Knows No Retreat' is angry at your
comments.]

This person truly was his sponsor.

Hwarang Knows No Retreat, Gwanchang. His stigma wasn't that great but
his loyalty to the fallen kingdom was wonderful.

"I'm not from Baekje. I'm an ordinary South Korean person."

"This guy!"

"I respect your patriotism but you should be more prudent. I don't have only
20,000 coins."

I moved my fingers one more time and the number of coins started to rise.
The man's face started turning pale.

Wealth was an object of desire for the poor. However, overwhelming
wealth caused reverence and fear. Especially for those who were familiar
with the power of 'coins'.
Min Jiwon, who had been frozen for a while, belatedly opened her mouth.
"You… who are you?"

She asked me too soon. I naturally had no intention of answering.

"Min Jiwon-ssi, you can't solve everything in the world with money. I
thought you would know this since you are an actor. I'm disappointed."

I finally turned around and started leaving. The party members followed me
as I heard Min Jiwon's voice.

"W-Wait!"

However, she couldn't follow me anymore. Once we got a certain distance
away from the Silla group, Yoo Sangah spoke in a slightly grouchy voice.

"Dokja-ssi, can I ask you something?"

"Yes."

"Is she a famous person?"

I hesitated for a moment at the unexpected question.

"Huh? Um…maybe?"

"I see. Dokja-ssi and Sungkook-ssi recognizes her… I used to watch a lot
of historical dramas, why don't I remember her at all?" This was why she
was grumpy?

Lee Gilyoung interrupted. "Noona, I also don't know her."

"Ah, haha. I'm glad."

It wasn't a strange story. It was natural for Yoo Sangah and Lee Gilyoung
not to know 'Min Jiwon' if she only appeared in a novel.
The problem was Lee Sungkook.

"Lee Sungkook-ssi."

"Ah, yes."

Lee Sungkook responded from the rear of the group. Min Jiwon's beauty
seemed quite impressive.

"I heard that you are a fan of Min Jiwon…?"

"Huh? Haha. That's correct. Don't you know? She is a famous

actress…eh?" Lee Sungkook's expression became strange.

"Uh… Min Jiwon…ssi? Eh? Why do I know Min Jiwon? No, did I know
her from the beginning…?"

I quietly activated Character List.

It was the second time I saw Lee Sungkook's information. Nothing had
greatly changed, except for one thing. Lee Sungkook's '9th to Get Off'
attribute had disappeared.

"Lee Sungkook-ssi?"

"Uhh… yes?"

"No, it is nothing."
I stopped speaking in order to prevent confusion. In the world of Ways of
Survival, an attribute only disappeared when the qualifications for that
attribute weren't met anymore.

All those who 'got off' knew the 'future' of this world. However, the future
that Lee Sungkook knew was only near the prologue. The evolution of the
current scenario surpassed the information he knew.

Then a hypothesis emerged. Maybe all those who 'got off' would become
simple characters the moment they caught up with the 'future' they knew?

It was still a leap, but it was a possible hypothesis. If this was the case, it
was understandable that Lee Sungkook and Jung Minseob's information
started to be seen.

If it was like this…

Maybe one day I would also…?

[The character 'Min Jiwon' shows a weak liking towards you.]

…All my thoughts collapsed at this absurd message. I reflexively looked
back. Min Jiwon was still standing still and looking this way. I couldn't see
her face but her gestures looked angry.

Then this message… no, wait a minute. Why did I forget that episode?

It suddenly came to mind. On the 11th regression, she had slapped Yoo
Joonghyuk as soon as he met her. Then Min Jiwon supported him
throughout that regression…

I suddenly had an ominous feeling. Perhaps… it couldn't be?

At least I wasn't hit on the cheek.
An hour later, we moved through the forest of buildings near
Gwanghwamun as quickly as possible. I didn't see any humans but it was
clear that the kings who bought my text were hiding near here.

–Pay attention to when they start to move. We will also move in time with
them.

I said to my party members while moving cautiously.

In any case, I knew the kings' goals.

「The moment he reached the entrance of the National Palace Museum, his
heart started pounding. Most of the artifacts sleeping here were garbage.
Only one of them was real.

The Four Yin Demonic Beheading Sword.

The strongest SSSSS-grade item was hidden here in Gwanghwamun! 」

I wrote it but my hands and feet curled up just reading the words.

It was true that the Four Yin Demonic Beheading Sword was at the
National Palace Museum.

Of course, the rating of the item wasn't SSSSS. In the first place, there was
no such rating.

The Four Yin Demonic Beheading Sword boasted a great performance and
in fact, Yoo Joonghyuk of the third regression also favoured this sword at
the beginning.

–Hyung, if there is such an item, shouldn't we get it first?

–There is no need.
Four Yin Demonic Beheading Sword was a good sword but it wasn't a
necessary item right now.

However, the plagiarist and other kings would think differently. They could
get the best combat power at the beginning with the Four Yin Demonic
Beheading Sword. They would surely be looking for the Four Yin Demonic
Beheading Sword.

My plan was simple. Take the other artifacts while they were aiming for the
sword.

The problem was when would those guys move? There was no need to
worry about it in advance.

In this damn world, those guys always appeared when the scenario was
stagnant.

[Huhu, this is really surprising. All the key people are gathered.]

It was as I expected. There were sparks and an intermediate dokkaebi
appeared out of thin air.

[Shouldn't good children be awarded a prize?]

There was the sound of something starting to rise from the center of
Gwanghwamun.

It was a single throne covered with a golden light.

There were gasps everywhere in Gwanghwamun. There wasn't an
explanation yet but all the kings would've realized it at this moment.

Only a single king could take that throne.

[The main scenario has been updated!]

               Chapter 63: Ep. 13 – War of Kings, IV


Lee Sungkook was surprised by the system message and muttered.

"Another new scenario…"

It certainly wasn't good timing. Another scenario appeared before we could
complete the clear conditions of the existing scenario.

I opened up the new scenario as soon as it arrived.
  [Main Scenario # 4 – The King's Qualifications]

  Category: Main

  Difficulty: A

  Clear Conditions: Occupy the 'Absolute Throne' located at
  Gwanghwamun.

  Time Limit: 8 hours.

 Compensation: 10,000 coins
 Failure: ―
 This scenario can only be challenged by those who have completedthe
 hidden scenario 'King's Road'.
 The absolute king has absolute commands over all the other kings.
 There are additional special clear conditions for this scenario.




The situation wasn't good. Our group hadn't been able to take the target of
the Struggle for Flags yet.

The burden had doubled. I had to complete the scenario related to the
throne while taking down the Tyrant King and occupying Changsin Station.

The intermediate dokkaebi said.

[Look at your confused faces. Please don't worry too much. This scenario
will proceed slowly.]
Gwanghwamun was still despite everyone being in a state of agitation. It
was natural. The surviving kings knew how important it was to listen to the
dokkaebi.

[As you have guessed, the fourth main scenario is to be the only king to sit
on the throne. Of course, not every king can sit on that throne. Only a
person who has proved their qualifications can sit there.] The intermediate
dokkaebi said with a bad laugh.

[Then I will reveal the first qualification.]


  [King's Qualification]

  1. 「 The owner of the throne should be braver than anyone else.」
  –The Absolute Throne never wants a 'weak king'. To challenge the
  throne, you must own at least a black flag.

  (Additional qualifications will be released after a while.)


A black flag. It was disgusting from the very beginning.

[Huhu, the motive was given. Now make a fun story!]

The intermediate dokkaebi disappeared and Yoo Sangah made an anxious
expression.

"If it is a black flag… you need to occupy 20 stations?"

"That's right."

Our group had a brown flag. It was a flag that could be obtained after
occupying 10 stations.
"What do we do? In order to create a black flag, we need 10 more stations.
If there are vacant stations nearby…"

"This is a condition that appeared because there are no empty stations."

"Huh?"

As far as I knew, no king had achieved the black flag at this point.

"Did you forget? There isn't only one method to change the colour of a
flag".

The achievement value of the flag went up when taking over a station.
However, there was a way to get achievement values much faster.

"Ah…!"

It was to take the flag of another representative. Right now, there were a
bunch of kings with flags in Gwanghwamun.

I calmed down the party members.

"Don't worry. This wasn't unexpected. We will proceed as planned."

As planned. I said this but it wouldn't be easy.

There were clouds of war hanging over Gwanghwamun. It was a breathless
tension just before the storm blew. The sound of weapons being pulled out
and the organization of battle lines could be heard.

People would soon start moving.

Those competing for a promotion would now kill each other with real
swords. Those who wanted a wider territory would take each other's flags to
occupy more stations.

Kill each other and get better items. It was in order to survive.
Lee Sungkook watched the buildings around them and muttered in a
surreal tone. "It is scary. Is this really South Korea?" "It is South Korea. It
is still South Korea."

"Representative-nim, aren't you scared?"

"I'm afraid."

It wasn't a lie. I was obviously scared. To be honest, I often felt that way.
Even if I read Ways of Survival, I was still a regular office worker. I didn't
express it but I often wondered if I could survive.

Of course, my worries didn't last long. It was because it was useless to think
about it. It was the same in any world.

Kim Dokja who worked at Mino Soft was now Kim Dokja who lived in the
world of Ways of Survival. Death would come whether I wanted it to or
not. The most important thing was…

"At least I feel like I am living right now."

[The exclusive skill, 'Fourth Wall' is activated!]

I suddenly turned around and saw Lee Sungkook looking at me with
reverent eyes.

"When I look at Representative-nim…"

"Attack!"

Someone's shout was heard before Lee Sungkook's words were over. 300
meters away, there was a king who started marching north.

He was a king with a brown flag like me. I couldn't see his face because he
was too far away but he was probably the king of a small district.
At almost the same time, the warlords hiding in Gwanghwamun started to
appear. They were each armed with excellent self-defense equipment.

The most prominent one was a man wearing a kilt in splendid colours. I
could tell who he was without looking.

Our target, the Tyrant King and the rule of Dobong-gu and Seongbuk-gu.

The vibe he gave off was new. The Tyrant King who had the largest forces
among Seoul's Seven Kings. Now that he moved, the 1st apostle and the
kings of the three kingdoms would act.

"Maybe most of them will go after the Four Yin Demonic Beheading
Sword."

In fact, the direction of the kings' march was the northern Palace Museum
where the Four Yin Demonic Beheading Sword was located. I didn't see
him but the plagiarist would also be moving to that side.

Some forces ignored any damage and were running towards the museum. It
was understandable.

Since the qualifications of the absolute king weren't clear yet, they thought
it would be more advantageous to obtain a good item.

If the item was the Four Yin Demonic Beheading Sword, they could fill in
the lacking achievement points of their flag at once.

Lee Sungkook asked anxiously, "Shouldn't we go? The Four Yin Demonic
Beheading Sword is a pretty good item."

"We will just be defeated if we go."

We didn't have a lot of people. Moreover, there were many high level
sponsors among them.

"Go to the west."
I moved while leading the party. All the kings were heading for the
northern Palace Museum so the west was relatively lacking.

It was the historic Gwanghwamun so there were museums all over the
place.
Presseum, Korean Financial History Museum, Korean National Police
Heritage Museum…

Yoo Sangah asked, "We aren't going to these places?"

"We should avoid the modern and contemporary

exhibits." An old relic was better.

Of course, the relic simply being 'old' wasn't enough. The hoe used by
farmers in the Iron Age was also such an item but it was only F-grade. The
important thing was for it to have a relationship with a famous person or a
narrative.

"Let's go here."

The place we stopped at was the Seoul History Museum facing Gyeonghui
Palace.

A light flashed in Yoo Sangah's eyes.

"What are we looking for here?"

"We must find the Ganpyeongui². It is a relic of the Joseon Dynasty that
resembles a disc, but I don't know what floor it is on."

"Okay, I will try and find it!"

"We have to find it quickly so let's scatter. Gilyoung, you move with
Sangah noona. And Lee Sungkook-ssi―"
As I was speaking, something sharp flew from behind me. I reflexively
crouched down, pulling the party members with me.

The exterior wall of the building was pierced by an arrow. There was a
trace of magic power on the shaft.

I got goosebumps.

[Strong Magic Arrow].

This person had learnt the archery skill properly. Who was it? The
unexpected ambush complicated my thoughts. Was there someone who
read the movements of my party? "Everybody go inside! Quickly!"
Several more arrows flew.

[Blade of Faith is activated!]

I swung my sword and struck the flying arrows. Fortunately, the amount of
magic power wasn't high so they weren't difficult to block.

The problem was the number. One arrow flew out and pierced my thigh. I
quickly retreated and hid behind cover.

"Hahaha! Where is the novice king wandering to?"

A voice echoed through the area. A group of men armed with bows and
swords appeared 500 meters away.

Their flag couldn't be seen. In other words, they sent out a detached force.
Some kings were smarter than I thought. Was he going to eat up items
while taking away the flags of the smaller kings? [The exclusive skill,
Character List is activated.] I used a skill on a person in the lead.
  [Character Summary]

  Name: Chu Wangin

  Age: 33 years old.

  Sponsor: The Last Hero of Hwangsanbeol

  Exclusive Attributes: Minor Actor (General)

  Exclusive Skills: Weapons Training Lv. 4, Acting Lv. 1, Weak
  Investigation Lv. 1.

  Stigma: Baekje Kendo Lv. 4, Prepared to Fight to the Death for the
  Country Lv. 2, Detached Force Management Lv. 3.

  Overall Stats: Physique Lv. 19, Strength Lv. 19, Agility Lv. 21, Magic
  Power Lv. 15.

  Overall Evaluation: It is a case where even a nobody can grow if he
  meets an excellent sponsor. Due to the high degree of synchronization
  with the sponsor, the strength of his stigmas is significant.


Damn, a tiger had come. I didn't expect to meet Hwangsanbeol's master
here. Those with actor attributes tended to cling to these types of
constellations.

"If you know honour as a king, surrender your flag. Then your group
members won't lose their lives."

The poor dramatic tone told me why he was only a minor actor. The Last
Hero of Hwangsanbeol was attached to such a person. It seemed that bad
luck with partners applied even to constellations.
But this was difficult. The level of the stigmas Baekje Kendo and Detached
Force Management was too high.

Considering the number of people, it would be hard to handle all of them
without raising my overall stats.

[Coins Possessed: 68,150C]

…Should I use my coins here? However, the difficulty of the last phase of
the fourth scenario would increase sharply if I used coins to raise my
overall stats here.

It would disturb my whole plan.

If I closed my eyes and used around 20,000 coins…

"Isn't it embarrassing for you to persecute the king of a weak nation using
the name of the Three Kingdoms?"

I looked around as I heard a voice and saw a familiar person approaching.
The incarnation of Gyebaek, Chu Wangin made a fierce expression.

"What is the queen doing here?"

"Your crude tone is just as expected for the master of a ruined kingdom."

The woman shot back with a smug expression. King of Beauty Min Jiwon.
Why did this woman appear here?

…Surely she hadn't followed me?

No. There was no way.

Min Jiwon's eyes glanced at me.
[The character 'Min Jiwon' shows a weak liking towards you.]

…Really?

"Shut up! The cowardly Silla blood now claims to be rule of the Three
Kingdoms? I won't recognize a girl like you as a king!"

Chu Wangin's roar of anger burst from his body. He might be a minor actor
without much skills but his voice was very loud.

By the way, it was interesting. Gyebaek and Queen Jinseong were born in
different eras but they could face each other like this after becoming
constellations.

I asked Min Jiwon, "Why are you helping me?"

"Silla doesn't ignore weak countries."

"It is Silla who destroyed Gaya."

"…Did you also have a 1st-grade degree in Korean history?"

"Any high school graduate would know this much."

Min Jiwon's expression became slightly gloomy.

"I don't know because I didn't go to high school."

It was natural. Min Jiwon had been an actor since her teens. She became an
actress at an early age and learned things other than history.

"Your words are correct. I can't obtain people with money. I'm repaying the
debt caused by my rudeness. That's it."

I knew Min Jiwon's history as an actress and could feel the sincerity in her
words. It was still surprising. She was an incarnation with a high pride so I
didn't think she would bow before me like this.
Gyebaek's incarnation laughed at our conversation.

"A king is swayed by personal matters? That's why a chick like you…"

Min Jiwon's captain came forward on behalf of the Hwarang.

"Rude! How can a man like you be the king of a country?"

Gyebaek's eyes were drawn to the Hwarang.

"Hwarang…? Very interesting. Did you sign with that constellation?"

The Hwarang captain turned red at the words. It reminded me that the
Hwarang captain's sponsor was Gwanchang.

"Do you want your neck to be cut like your sponsor?"

In the battle of Hwangsanbeol, Gwanchang died from Gyebaek cutting his
throat.

"Shut up!"

Thank you for coming to help but the relationship between constellations
was the worst. This was particularly bad due to their high level of
sympathy.

There was a hierarchy among the constellations due to the history of their
lives.

A person couldn't go against their king and the enemy was determined
according to historical records.

For example Kurushima Michifusa of Japan could never beat the Duke of
Loyalty and Warfare.

It was just like how Gwanchang couldn't win against Gyebaek.
Min Jiwon also knew this and didn't look happy. I

spoke first. "Just defeat the army. Or we can't win."

Baekje's army had slightly more military force.


Gyebaek was a military commander. The more people he led, the stronger
his power. Gwanchang was no match for him.

Then Yoo Sangah's voice was heard. "Dokja-ssi! I've found it!"

I looked back and found Yoo Sangah running with a small disc. She found
it already?

The Ganpyeongui. The relic resembling a wall clock glowed in Yoo
Sangah's hands.

At this moment, I had an idea. I looked at Ganpyeongui, then Min Jiwon
and the incarnation of Gwanchang. Then I made a decision. Perhaps I could
win this without using coins?

"Attack!"

[The character 'Chu Wangin' has used the stigma Detached Force Lv. 3!]

The Hwarang kept falling under the hands of the Baekje forces. Min Jiwon
looked towards me with a desperate expression and I said, "I think we can
win."

"Huh?"

"We will recreate the battle of Hwangsanbeol."

Many people knew this but Hwangsanbeol was a battle that Silla won¹.
[1] Battle of Hwangsanbeol took place between the forces of Silla and
Baekje in Hwangsanbeol. The Baekje forces were lead by Gyebaek.
Kim Yu-Shin's Silla forces won. Wiki.

[2 ]Ganpyeongui is an astronomical observation device.
                Chapter 64: Ep. 13 – War of Kings, V


Min Jiwon was surprised by my words.

"…Battle of Hwangsanbeol?"

"Yes, Silla originally won the Battle of Hwangsanbeol. This is according to
history."

Chu Wangin's sword ran through a Hwarang member.

Obviously, Silla would win if it was like history. If it was like history. But
before I could speak, the captain of Hwarang came forward and shouted,
"Don't retreat! There is no stepping back in a battle!"

At the same time, the Hwarang pulled out their weapons.

"No!"

"Victory! Loyally serve the king!"
"Serve!"

This bastard?

[All of the Hwarang of Silla are subjected to the effect of Mundane World
Five Commandments Lv. 2!]

"Hahaha, you are pushing them!"

Gyebaek's incarnation, Chu Wangin cried out. Hwarang's captain came
running towards him with a spear. He was following his damn sponsor.

[The character 'Chu Wangin' has used the stigma Baekje Kendo Lv. 3!]

"Keeoook!"

The body of the Hwarang captain flew through the air after being hit by a
big sword.

I shouted towards Min Jiwon. "Tell them to set up the formations!"

"Take your formations! Hurry!"

[Character 'Min Jiwon' has activated Military Command Lv. 2.]

[The army has lost their sense of reason.]

[The skill activation is cancelled.]

"Set up the formation!"

Min Jiwon screamed again but the Hwarang were already inspired by
Mundane World Five Commandments and didn't listen to her order. In the
first place, they were loyal to the beauty of Queen Jinseong, not her
charisma.
I heard a sound. Then Lee Gilyoung landed next to me from where he broke
through the window of the museum's second floor.

"Hyung, should I call Titano?"

Lee Gilyoung's eyes shone as he prepared to use Diverse Communication.
"No, it is okay."

It would be helpful if Lee Gilyoung could call the 6th grade insect king like
last time but then he would be unconscious for two days. High grade
monsters were difficult to control and could also sweep away allies.

In any case, Lee Gilyoung was my hidden card. I had to save him until the
beginning of the war with the kings.

"Kuaaak!"

The Hwarang in front of us were knocked out. On the other hand, there
wasn't a single dead Baekje person.

I reached out to Yoo Sangah who ran to me.

"Yoo Sangah-ssi, the relic…!"

Yoo Sangah handed me the Ganpyeongui.

The Ganpyeongui. Everyone was distracted by the Four Yin Demonic
Beheading Sword but in fact, the Ganpyeongui was an essential item for the
fourth scenario.

The Four Yin Demonic Beheading Sword had no meaning if this item didn't
exist.

"Kuheeok!"

The captain of Hwarang was a wreck as he was hit by Chu Wangin again. It
wouldn't be strange if he died in one more blow.
[The constellation Hwarang Knows No Retreat is in a hurry.]

[The constellation 'Last Hero of Hwangsanbeol' is happy.]

[The constellation 'Slumbering Lady of Fine Brocade' is irritated.]

The momentum of the Baekje army grew while Silla's morale broke down.
It felt like the spirit of Gyebaek was flowing from Chu Wangin's body.

"Destroy the damn Silla!"

The more that the constellations were in a situation similar to the history
that they lived, the greater the synchronization with their incarnation and
the stronger the power of the stigma.

In addition, the encounter with 'related' constellations…

It was time for the 'stage' to be created.

"Uhh?

What?"

People screamed with surprise. Sparks filled the surrounding space and the
scene changed. Seoul's Gwanghwamun was transformed into a rugged
mountain wilderness.

「Stage Transformation. 」

It was a phenomenon that occurred when the coordination was high
between incarnations with historical correlations.

Space Transformation summoned the space-time that the constellations had
fought in. Of course, the space wasn't really changed. It was close to an
augmented reality.
The problem was that this wasn't the case for the people who summoned the
stage.

"Hahahaha… I missed you Hwangsanbeol!"

Chu Wangin achieved a considerable level of synchronization with his
sponsor and shouted. Now he seemed to completely believe he was
Gyebaek.

Gyebaek was in a hurry. If a constellation did something like this in the
early scenarios, it was likely they would receive a sanction from the
Bureau. However, Gyebaek was less likely to be affected than the low level
constellations.

"U-Uwaaah!"

The frightened Hwarang started to step back.

Lee Sungkook muttered, "He isn't one of the Seven Kings but he has such
power… does this make sense?"

"It is possible because Gyebaek is the protagonist of this stage."

Chu Wangin was like a mad monster as he ran around. Once Stage
Transformation occurred and synchronization with the sponsor increased,
the incarnation's strength would multiply.

I looked at the trembling Min Jiwon and opened my mouth.

"I have two ways. One is to let the incarnation of Gwanchang die."

"That…what do you mean?"

Originally, the Battle of Hwangsanbeol was a battlefield that Silla won
thanks to Gwanchang's sacrifice. One half of the battle was complete if he
died.
"As soon as Stage Transformation began, this has become the battlefield
of history. If the incarnation of Gwanchang dies, the morale of the Silla
troops will rise due to their anger. This is recorded in history." I didn't
listen to Min Jiwon's answer.

"The second way is to change history."

I looked down at the Ganpyeongui in my hands. Ganpyeongui, an
astronomical observation device produced by Joseon in the 17th century.

Min Jiwon felt uneasy and asked, "What will happen if it fails?"

"Your country will perish."

"Then of course it will be the first option…!"

This was truly Queen Jinseong. She was considered an incompetent ruler
for a reason.

"I didn't mean to give you a choice. I will do the second method."

"Then why did you mention it?"

"I gave you a chance. You are not what Silla needs right

now." I manipulated the two discs that made up the

Ganpyeongui.

The two discs were called the sky disc and the earth disc respectively. The
top was the earth disc and the bottom was the sky disc.

There was a simple definition for Ganpyeongui in Ways of Survival.

「 The Ganpyeongui is an item that can find the constellations in heaven.」
As I slowly turned the earth disc, the constellations engraved on the sky
disc started to burn brightly.

[Ganpyeongui's special option 'Echo of the Stars' has been activated.]

['Echo of the Stars' allows you to ask for the help of a constellation.]

[The constellation can refuse your request and the number of times
Ganpyeongui can be used is reduced when the constellation responds to the
request.]

There were seven constellations left on the sky disc. In other words, I can
use it seven more times in the future.

It would've been good if there were more constellations left on the relic.
Well, it couldn't be helped.

Lee Sungkook seemed to have noticed something and asked, "Are you
going to get help from a constellation with that?"

"Not all the constellations are available but there are some great people."

Lee Sungkook was filled with admiration at my answer. He belatedly found
out the true value of this item.

"That's it!" Lee Sungkook cried out excitedly, "How about calling Xiang
Yoo or Lu Bu? If you call them, you can easily deal with Gyebaek."

"I have to know the modifier of the constellation."

In the world of Ways of Survival, the modifier was like the constellations'
space-time coordinates. The modifiers were like the the X and Y axis
coordinate system in the Star Stream.

"Ah… then…"
Lee Sungkook made a sad expression. He thought that I didn't know the
modifiers of Lu Bu and Xiang Yoo. But that was an illusion. There was no
one in the world who knew as many constellation modifiers as me.

"I'll call a constellation."

[The great constellations hear your voice flowing through the stars.]

Of course, the constellation I was calling wasn't Lu Bu or Xiang Yoo. There
was no guarantee they would respond to this request and there was
someone more fitting for this battlefield.

I stared at the stars in the sky. I faced the numerous stars and opened my
mouth.

"I want to call Hwarang Leader King Heungmu the Great."

[The star navigation has begun.]

A part of the sky darkened and a shadow fell to the ground. The battle
between Silla and Baekje stopped.

"What nonsense are you saying?"

Chu Wangin sensed something suspicious and started running towards me.

"Representative-nim, we will stop them."

Lee Sungkook pulled out a sword. I didn't know how long the hypnotist
would be able to endure but I should have some time.

After a while, one of the stars in the sky shone brightly. He finally
appeared.

[The constellation 'King Heungmu the Great' is looking at you.]

"General."
[The constellation 'King Heungmu the Great' is listening to you.]

"There are people here who need your help. I am calling you because your
people are dying."

[The constellation 'King Heungmu the Great' is silent at your words.]

King Heungmu the Great. He wasn't royalty but he was the only person
who was given a posthumous name of a king of Silla.

He probably wouldn't reject my request. It was because Hwangsanbeol was
his battlefield.

But something unexpected happened.

[The constellation 'King Heungmu the Great' doesn't want to be involved in
the history of modern life.]

[The constellation 'King Heungmu the Great' will reject your offer.]

…What? The constellation was about to fade away when Yoo Sangah
interrupted.

"General, please listen to my words!"

The smart Yoo Sangah noticed who King Heungmu the Great was.

[The constellation 'King Heungmu the Great' is looking back.]

"I'm well aware of General's story! The Battle of Hwangsanbeol, the
Siege of Pyongyang…! I've read all about it in the records!" Yoo Sangah
took a deep breath before starting to talk.

"I understand that you want to respect the past and history. But General!
Some histories don't end after they are recorded."
Yoo Sangah's voice was clear and straightforward.

"Don't you regret it? The battlefield where the young Hwarang are
sacrificed and countless people are buried…! Have you already forgotten?"

[The constellation 'King Heungmu the Great' is listening to incarnation Yoo
Sangah's story.]

"History won't change. The soldiers on the field won't be comforted and the
lives of the young Hwarang won't return. But General! The history here
hasn't ended yet! If you come here, at least you can change the history in
this place!"

I had forgotten how good a talker Yoo Sangah was. During her early days,
she was the queen of PT at Mino Soft.

"General! Your Battle of Hwangsanbeol is over… but we are still at
Hwangsanbeol."

[The constellation 'King Heungmu the Great' has silently closed his eyes.]

There were such moments in life. I knew what would happen from now on,
even if no one said anything.

[The constellation 'King Heungmu the Great' has responded to your
request.] One of the constellations on Ganpyeongui disappeared and a light
from the star in the sky shone on me.

I smiled at the nervous Yoo Sangah. "Well done Yoo Sangah-ssi."

[You have temporarily received the protection of constellation 'King
Heungmu the Great'.]

The muscles in my body twitched like they were surprised. My heart
pumped and light and darkness crossed several times in my head.
Something was being constructed inside me.
[This is just on old man's reminiscence of the past.]

This was the true voice of the constellation. Just listening made my
existence at stake.

[Please, lend me your voice for a while.]

I nodded while opening my eyes. Everyone on the field of Hwangsanbeol
was looking at me.

The incarnation of Gyebaek, Chu Wangin was astonished. "That
person…?"

The spirit of a constellation was felt despite him not descending directly.
This was the size of the existences called constellations.

"It has been a while, Gyebaek."

There was a strange depth in my voice. In the distance, the incarnation of
Gwanchang staggered.

"Hwarang Gwanchang, there is no need to pay respect to me."

"G-General…!"

King Heungmu the Great was watching the world through me. He looked at
Gwanchang, Gyebaek and the broken Seoul. I was also watching the world
through King Heungmu the Great. The sunlight covered the plains of
Hwangsan.

"It is funny. Why is it that all of you have gathered here again?"

Chu Wangin laughed madly at these words. It was a laugh filled with
deepseated resentment. At this moment, he really was Gyebaek.

"Don't you know? It was to meet you again on this field!"
[The character 'Chu Wangin' has used the stigma Baekje Kendo Lv. 4!]

Chu Wangin's sword filled with power and moved. Originally, it was an
attack that I wouldn't have been able to avoid or block. But I avoided the
attack without much difficulty.

"Gyebaek, why are you doing this to your incarnation? Have you forgotten
the constraints of plausibility? You will destroy your incarnation."

It was as he said. Gyebaek was acting unreasonably. I also wondered this as
a reader of Ways of Survival.

"Kim Yushin… You must've heard nothing about this world."

"What do you mean?"

"It doesn't matter. My wish was achieved the moment I met you. I'll have
no regrets even if I die now!" The incarnation of Gyebaek cried out. "I
carry on Baekje's legacy of Buyeo, Gyebaek of Hwangsanbeol! I will settle
my lifelong regret here!"

King Heungmu the Great watched Gyebaek's incarnation with sad eyes and
opened his mouth through me.

"I am the 15th captain of Hwarang, Kim Yushin."

King Heungmu the Great, Hwarang Leader Kim Yushin.

"I will comfort the soul of the unfortunate constellation and correct the
history of modern humans."

The man who led the Battle of Hwangsanbeol to victory sent me his will. I
moved my right hand. A bluish glow grew from the hilt.

「 The sword of the Hwarang leader is now on the battlefield. 」
[The power of the star relic 'Blue Dragon Sword' is temporarily stored in
Unbroken Faith.]

The blade of the Blue Dragon Sword soared high into the sky of Hwangsan.

All of Hwangsan seemed to scream. Enormous magic power escaped and a
large crack appeared in the earth, centered around me.

「 Dragon Flower Tree unit, come to this place right now. 」

[The stigma 'Gather the Hwarang' is activated!]

Something was happening in the crack.

The forgotten ghosts buried in the eternal history. There were no names left
but they were Hwarang who once lived on this land and who fought only
for honour.

Kuoooooh!

The Dragon Flower Tree, Kim Yushin's elite unit showed up from the pages
of history.
            Chapter 65: Ep. 14 – Master of the Throne, I


Kim Yushin's stigma 'Gather the Hwarang' was a skill that called the elite
Hwarang that died in history, the Dragon Flower Tree.

To put it simply, it was a ground version of the 'Ghost Fleet' that Lee Jihye
used.

It wasn't comparable to the Duke of Loyalty and Warfare's power but it was
still a great stigma used by a constellation.

"Go!"

The buried bones were removed and the Dragon Flower Tree unit rose to
fight with Baekje's army. Some Hwarang had no eyes while others had no
arms or legs.

It was cruel. They would raise their blades as long as Kim Yushin was here.
This was despite their souls being worn down, their anger erased and even
their hearts gone.
They were soldiers who fought to prevent the fall of their kingdom. Now
they were fighting for a fallen kingdom.

"You are still a coward Kim Yushin! Now you are even pushing your dead
men!"

"…"

"Come on! Let's have a one-on-one fight!"

I was still at Gyebaek's provocation. It was because Kim Yushin didn't want
to move. He would crush Gyebaek with the overwhelming force of the
Dragon Flower Tree. The magic power that emerged from his sword
mercilessly filled the air.

"Kim Yushin―!"

The shout filled the air and even the emotionless Dragon Flower Tree
hesitated for a moment.

This was Gyebaek. The last master of Baekje, Gyebaek.

Gyebaek was a constellation that overwhelmed Kim Yushin just in terms of
physical buff abilities. In fact, Gyebaek never fought one-on-one against
Kim Yushin in the Battle of Hwangsanbeol.

To be exact, it was right to say that Kim Yushin avoided the confrontation.

[The character 'Chu Wangin' has used the stigma Prepared to Fight to the
Death for the Country Lv. 2!]

In history, Gyebaek's army fought against Kim Yushin's army that
outnumbered them by several times and won a few impossible battles.

The last winner might be Kim Yushin but Gyebaek wasn't defeated until the
final battle of Hwangsanbeol was held.
He united his soldiers with patriotism and his shouts were close to insane.

I carried Kim Yushin behind me right now but if things were different, I
might've called Gyebaek.

Gwanchang's incarnation shouted, "General!"

"Don't move."

Kim Yushin spoke through my mouth. My expression was unchanged
despite looking at the dying Dragon Flower Tree members.

Kim Yushin's serene image was conveyed.

Gyebaek shouted, "Your cowardice hasn't changed despite you becoming a
constellation!"

That's right. Kim Yushin was a coward. He was afraid of death and afraid
of defeat. That's why he was strong. His emotions were unshakable and he
didn't commit rash acts.

Defeat the enemies in a way that achieved victory. That's how he won the
final battle of Hwangsanbeol, despite being defeated four previous times.

"Kuaaaaak!"

The hundreds of Dragon Flower Tree members clashed fiercely with
Gyebaek. His incarnation was so severely hurt that he could no longer
survive. His whole body was bloody while there were fatal wounds on his
arms, thighs and sides.

However, Gyebaek kept moving through the crowd of Dragon Flower Tree
members towards me.

"Kim…Yoo…shin…!"

[The stigma 'Request for Reinforcements' has been activated!]
Ghost soldiers appeared like shadows from behind Kim Yushin and sprang
towards Gyebaek. Based on the different articles of clothing on the soldiers,
they might not be Silla troops.

Perhaps they were the Tang Dynasty troops called to destroy Goguryeo.

As expected from Kim Yushin. The only thing important to him was
winning. Using foreign forces wasn't an important issue for him.

Numerous spears pierced his chest. Gyebaek's incarnation couldn't
overcome the pain and fell to his knees.

"Kuheok…!"

The incarnation of the strong Gyebaek was now at his limit.

Gyebaek laughed.

"…I am resentful. I can't touch you even on this fake stage. I wanted to
cross swords with you just once."

Gyebaek's red eyes made me feel confused. Gwanchang was alive, history
had changed. But this was one part that didn't change.

Kim Yushin asked, "Gyebaek. Why did you do this?"

"…"

"If you die in this state, you can't choose another incarnation for a while.
Why did you suddenly abandon the scenario?"

Gyebaek had a distant look on his face and then he gave a meaningful
smile. Kim Yushin waited before pulling out a blade.

I hurriedly took back control of my voice.

"He can't be killed with my hands."
[Why?]

"…There are restrictions."

The King of No Killing meant I couldn't carry out direct slaughter. As soon
as I killed one person, I would lose my throne.

Kim Yushin nodded like he understood.

[…I see. I roughly understand. Don't worry. The stars will honour your
commitment. But it is I, Kim Yushin, who will deal with Gyebaek, not
you.]

"But…"

[…There is a lingering attachment, please understand.]

Kim Yushin gestured and one of the Dragon Flower Tree members nodded.
I handed over my voice to Kim Yushin.

"Gyebaek, let's meet in the next world."

Gyebaek's incarnation looked up at us silently. He wanted to say something
but he couldn't open his mouth. At the last moment, his face looked like a
minor actor who completed his scenes rather than Gyebaek.

Then the incarnation's head quietly flew through the air.

[Stage Transformation has ended.]

[You have experienced the Battle of Hwangsanbeol.]

[1,000 coins have been earned as experience compensation.]

I looked around and saw that all of Baekje's army was wiped out.
[The authority of King of No Killing is retained due to the indirect nature of
the killing.]

It was fortunate. King of No Killing was only lost when I killed someone
directly with my own hands. The life that the Dragon Flower Tree member
took wasn't recognized as me killing someone.

"Representative-nim! Are you okay?" Lee Sungkook's voice was heard
from behind me.

Yoo Sangah sighed with relief while Lee Gilyoung was disgruntled that
he couldn't do much. Then Min Jiwon asked, "What the hell was that…?"
She looked like she had completely lost her soul.

I shrugged and said, "You should study history if you want to be a king."

I might've called Kim Yushin but I didn't belong to Silla or Baekje. I called
Kim Yushin because he was the most appropriate one to deal with
Gyebaek.

Anyway, I was glad that the result was better than expected. I was able to
thoroughly check the performance of the Ganpyeongui and I could get
some coins and items from the Baekje members.

[You have earned 5,400 coins.]

[Coins Possessed: 74,950 C]

Now I wasn't afraid of the final phase of the fourth scenario.

"It is time to go to the north."

[The remaining duration of the call is three minutes.]
Kim Yushin's divine blessing still remained. I should take advantage of the
remaining time left on the Ganpyeongui. It could only be used seven times
so I couldn't waste it.

"Rise up Dragon Flower Tree!"

The broken fragments of the Dragon Flower Tree unit rose again and I
pointed north with my sword.

"Advance!"

The consumption of magic power was huge so the operation time of the
Dragon Flower Tree unit was short. The Dragon Flower Tree unit started to
march north, randomly sweeping away the small and medium groups.

It might be possible to wipe out all the forces of the other kings gathered at
the National Palace Museum.

There were screams as forces fought all over the street.

"What are these skeletons? Aacck!"

The incarnations that ran towards me were crushed by the Dragon Flower
Tree unit.

Since I wasn't the one attacking, I didn't get a penalty for killing. Yes, this
was an invigorating taste.

Kim Yushin's holy voice was heard in my head.

[There is something strange about you. Your mind is intact despite hearing
my true voice…]

"I have a strong mentality."

I was a bit surprised by the words. The constellations used the 'indirect
messages' to communicate for a reason.
Kim Yushin was just a low-ranking constellation but most people would
pee their pants or faint hearing his holy voice.

In fact, I was a bit worried about that too…

[Remember, you owe me a big debt. In order to help you, I had to embrace
more possibilities than necessary.]

There was something sinister about his tone. I quickly expressed my
appreciation.

"I am thankful. I won't forget General's help."

[You are a hasty friend. You don't have anyone to pass it onto yet…]
"…Won't it happen one day? If I give birth to a child, I will surely tell them
what happened today."

[Rather, you don't seem to have a sponsor.]

I had an ominous feeling. Damn, this old fox kept talking.

[I like you. If you don't mind, I would like to become your sponsor in this
world.]

His words were nice but it merely meant to be his slave.

"That will be a problem."

[Why? Isn't my strength enough? You can become the strongest of this age
with just my stigma.]

The Gather the Hwarang stigma was good. But that was when applied to
Kim Yushin's saga.

The strongest in this era? He was trying to scam me.
The words were ridiculous for someone who wasn't a narrative-grade. If the
Great Sage, Heaven's Equal heard it, he would've squeezed Kim Yushin's
head tightly.

"Now isn't the age of the Three Kingdoms. You are old and should take a
break."

We had fun together but let's not see each other again.

[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' is laughing at 'King
Heungmu the Great'.]

[300 coins have been sponsored.]

Kim Yunshin was silent for a moment, perhaps because his pride was
pricked. I thought he would back off but a sharp pain suddenly shot through
my head.

[Have you forgotten that my divine blessing still remains?]

Currently, Kim Yushin and I were connected through the Ganpyeongui.
The muscles of my body spasmed in an unusual manner. No matter what,
wasn't he a great person of Korea…? No, maybe he could do this because
he was a great person of Korea.

Dammit.

[It would be better to think again.]

Yoo Sangah looked at me with worry.

"Dokja-ssi?"

"Yoo Sangah-ssi. Get away from me. Quickly!"

My trembling right hand didn't listen as it raised Unbroken Faith and started
pointing it at Yoo Sangah.
Kim Yushin started to exert control over my body.

[Did you say there was a restriction on your actions? I wonder what the
restriction is. What if I kill that woman right now?]

"Kim Yushin, this is your will. It isn't my karma."

[Huhu, I don't know. What if I disengage the moment I stab the blade?
Won't it be recognized as your actions? And this woman seems to be quite
precious to you?]

"…Stop."

[Make a promise. In the next Sponsor Selection, you will choose Kim
Yushin.]

The intent of this old fox was obvious. The second Sponsor Selection
would begin the moment the fourth scenario was over. Kim Yushin wanted
to use this pledge as an opportunity to acquire me.

If I hadn't read Ways of Survival, it might not be a bad choice. Kim Yushin
was a fairly decent constellation and there were a few scenarios in the
middle that could be cleared with Gather the Hwarang alone.

However, if I was going to pick a sponsor, I would've picked the Great
Sage, Heaven's Equal in the beginning. Why should I choose Kim Yushin
now?

"I said no."

In addition, I had the contract with Bihyung that didn't allow me to choose a
sponsor.

Kim Yushin's voice hardened.

[You are a stubborn young man. But it is the wrong choice. How long can
you endure?]
The blade in my hand started moving towards Yoo Sangah.

"Yoo Sangah-ssi, quickly―!"

Why didn't the smart Yoo Sangah move? I looked at my right hand moving
against my will and finally made a decision. Dammit, I respected him as a
great person but he forced me to do this…

I took a deep breath. This was my body. I would never give it to this guy or
any constellation.

[The exclusive skill, 'Fourth Wall' is activated!]
           Chapter 66: Ep. 14 – Master of the Throne, II


The pages of Ways of Survival flashed in my head. A light streamed
through my head and the strings of light started to line up. They were the
text of Ways of Survival.

[Heok…?]

Kim Yushin discovered something was wrong and his presence became
noticeably thinner. The old fox noticed quickly.

[The echo of the constellation connected through Echo of the Stars has
disappeared.]

At the last moment, Kim Yushin's astounded voice was heard.

[What are you…?]

Then Kim Yushin was gone.
I was surprised as well. I expected it to be possible with Fourth Wall, but I
didn't think the Ganpyeongui connection to the constellation could be
broken so easily.

The encounter in the Theater Dungeon was a hint. The Fourth Wall had
destroyed the theatre master the moment he tried to look inside my head.

I was hoping the same thing would happen to the constellation but Kim
Yushin noticed quickly and ran away.

[The constellation 'King Heungmu the Great' has doubts about your
existence.]

[The constellation 'King Heungmu the Great' will be watching you closely
in the future.]

In any case, I was still being followed by the old geezer.

"…Are you okay?"

"Yes. I'm fine. But…"

What was this? I looked up and found that my limbs were tied up with
magic power. It was a chrysalis-like appearance. Yoo Sangah's face was
completely red.

"That… I couldn't run away but I couldn't let you attack me."

I roughly understood what was going on. She used Binding Thread on me
during that short interval. I thought she was frozen with surprise but she
was actually using a skill.

"Your improvisation is amazing."

"…I'm sorry."
"It is a compliment. If I start acting strange in the future, act like you did
now."

"I-I will release you!"

Yoo Sangah looked embarrassed but I was serious. It was my mistake when
I thought of her as an ordinary office worker.

I looked back and saw Min Jiwon looking between me and Yoo Sangah
with curious eyes. "Well…it turned out like this. I came to help only to end
up being helped."

I nodded. "We will be enemies the next time we meet."

"…Why don't you join us now? It is a common proceeding in dramas."

"This isn't a drama."

"My friend! Make friends with faith. It is the banner of our Hwarang." Min
Jiwon said with a smile before moving away.

Could she be a good king? I don't know. Perhaps even the King of Beauty
didn't know.

"We will go as well. Lee Sungkook-ssi! Come on."

Lee Sungkook emerged from behind the building with Lee Gilyoung. This
bastard, when did he hide in such a place?

I took my companions and started to move north.

The place that Kim Yushin's Gather the Hwarang swept through was
devastated.

The armed forces of the small kings were lying all over the place. This was
the dignity of a proper constellation. Kim Yushin was a cowardly but useful
constellation.
I picked up three flags and built up my achievements.

[Your brown flag has absorbed the cumulative achievements of the brown
flag.]

[Your brown flag has evolved into a purple flag.]

[You are able to use the perks of the purple flag.]

Indeed, the best thing was to grow without a fight. I looked around and saw
that most flags had already been collected.

From the purple flag onwards, the achievement values of the flag wouldn't
rise well. In other words, it was useless to grab a small king from now on.

"Jung Minseob-ssi, are you there?"

The next moment, Jung Minseob appeared out of thin air. The Recluse's
Cloak that I handed him in advance was covering his body. Jung Minseob's
mission was to scout the National Palace Museum.

"How many have gone inside so far?"

"A total of nine kings have entered, including the Tyrant King and True
Reader."

Nine. It was a reasonable number.

"What are the flag types?"

"There are seven purple and two brown flags. In particular, there are two
with really a really deep purple colour."

"I guess they are the Tyrant and True Reader."

"That's right."
Jung Minseob, wasn't his talent quite useful?

I opened my mouth. "This time, I will only go with Yoo Sangah-ssi and
Gilyoung. Both of you wait outside. Stay hidden using the cloak."

"…Will it be okay?"

"Yes, I only need three people right now."

"I will enter if you call us."

I appreciated the thought but it would just be a disruption. It was because
the current Seoul Palace Museum was a dungeon.

[A new hidden scenario has arrived!]


  [Hidden Scenario – Artifact Trials]
  Category: Hidden
  Difficulty: F ~ A+
  Clear Conditions: Clear the right 'artifact dungeon' with the proper

A white marble lobby appeared before us as we entered the museum. There
were no signs of anyone else in the lobby.

Yoo Sangah spoke in a soft voice.
"I can't like culture now without feeling scared. There was the previous
theatre and now this museum…"

"Hyung, are we going to get the legendary sword?"

"No, not right now."

Of course, I could find the Four Yin Demonic Beheading Sword in this
dungeon. That's why I sowed the information.

[Please select the type of dungeon you want to enter.]

   •   Five person dungeon – Dongui Bogam (Korean book compiled by a
       royalphysician, considered as one of the classics of Oriental
       medicine)

   •   Seven person dungeon – Dragon Jar

However, the dungeon with the Four Yin Demonic Beheading Sword
couldn't be entered in a normal manner. It was because the dungeon was
only accessible using the Sang Pyong Tong Bo coin which was given as a
reward when clearing a dungeon.

"I will choose the three person dungeon, the Acupuncture Copper Man."

[You have entered the three person dungeon.]

Lee Gilyoung looked a bit disappointed. He had been expecting to get a
great artifact.

"Gilyoung. An artifact isn't about the outward appearance."

"…Huh?"
"There are many impressive looking things that have no substance."

The Four Yin Demonic Beheading Sword was one such item. Rather, the
good things in this dungeon could be obtained from the commonplace
dungeons.

An example was the skill that could be obtained the Acupuncture Copper
Man dungeon.

Yoo Sangah was amazed and surprised as soon as we entered the dungeon.

"…There are other people besides us."

Intermittent screams could be heard from the dungeon.

"Uwaaaaack! Go away!"

It was a monster in human form with a matte colour. The three person
dungeon was filled with these copper people.

It was the 7th grade species, the Acupuncture Copper Man.

After a certain amount of time, these guys would self-proliferate unless the
method to attack them was known. The Acupuncture Copper Man didn't
suffer because they had a strong body, no internal organs and no neural
networks.

"Aaaah! Save me!"

Some of the incarnations' swords cut at copper men but they didn't receive
much damage. Rather, they pulled the incarnations' bodies down.

The body of a man in his 50s was torn to pieces in the hands of the copper
men.

"…Dokja-ssi, how do we deal with these guys? They don't receive damage
at all."
Yoo Sangah and Lee Gilyoung aimed their weapons or skills at the
incoming copper men but there was hardly any effect.

Sometimes Lee Gilyoung's blunt attack would damage them but he didn't
have any idea of what he did.

"Look at their bodies."

The monsters that appeared in the 'artifacts trials' were based on relics kept
in Seoul Palace Museum.

For example, the monsters in the one player dungeon was literally a musical
instrument made of a seashell and as for the Dongui Bogam five person
dungeon… there was no need to explain anything. It was the same for the
Acupuncture Copper Man in the three person dungeon.

Yoo Sangah stared closely at a copper man and opened her mouth.

"Is there something etched on the body?"

"That's right."

In fact, the Acupuncture Copper Man was a relic that displayed 354
acupuncture points on the human body, including the front, back, arms, legs
and head.

It was an artifact used to study acupuncture in the Joseon Dynasty.

[Blade of Faith is activated!]

I stabbed one of the acupuncture points on the copper man. Then I twisted it
and the body scattered into powder. It was a meaningless end for a 7th
grade reproduction species.

[You have hunted the first Acupuncture Copper Man!]
"If you look closely, the colour for each acupuncture point was subtly
different. Some are devoid of blood and some are deadly. Some of the
points… there is a different effect every time an acupuncture point is hit."

"Ah…!"

The important thing was to find the acupuncture point that didn't break the
flow.

I demonstrated a few times and Lee Gilyoung and Yoo Sangah got the
knack for it very quickly.

Lee Gilyoung used Diverse Communication to shock the points with small
insects, while Yoo Sangah applied Binding Thread. I honestly admired
what I saw.

These two people, they really had excellent growth.

[Your party is the first to hunt 100 Acupuncture Copper Men!]

[You have cleared the three person dungeon.]

[Four Sang Pyong Tong Bo coins are obtained as a basic reward.]

[The exclusive skill 'Hit a Pressure Point' has been acquired.]

I got the skill I aimed for.

Hit a Pressure Point. It was a unique technique to use the pressure points to
subdue the enemy. It was an essential skill for me to maintain the 'King of
No Killing'.

Yoo Sangah looked at the Sang Pyong Tong Bo coins curiously and
muttered, "Can we buy something with this?"

"It can be exchanged for coins or a dungeon ticket."
"Then…"

"Of course, we will use it for the dungeon admission ticket. Pay me three
each. I have four so combined, it will be 10 coins."

"10? Wait a minute, Dokja-ssi…?"

"We will enter the hidden dungeon where we can get the Four Yin Demonic
Beheading Sword."

Yoo Sangah asked with surprise.

"But didn't you say we wouldn't get the Four Yin Demonic Beheading
Sword?"

"We aren't going after the Four Yin Demonic Beheading Sword."

We were going to 'hunt' the kings.
           Chapter 67: Ep. 14 – Master of the Throne, III


We were going to enter the dungeon but not to get the Four Yin Demonic
Beheading Sword.

Yoo Sangah and Lee Gilyoung immediately understood what I meant.

"You are going to take their flags."

"Then you will kill them."

They had different interpretations.

Yoo Sangah looked down at Lee Gilyoung with surprised eyes. The
interesting thing was that Lee Gilyoung looked up at Yoo Sangah with
disappointment.

"Hyung, leave the finishing touches to me."
This boy… he already noticed that I couldn't directly kill a person.

[The exclusive skill, Character List is activated.]

[This person isn't registered in 'Character List'.]

[Currently collecting information about the corresponding figure.]

Lee Gilyoung's information still wasn't available.

I turned my head and encountered Yoo Sangah's worried eyes. She looked
between Lee Gilyoung and I before bowing her head. I spoke to Lee
Gilyoung, "Do as you please."

I could see what Yoo Sangah was worried about. Lee Gilyoung wasn't even
in middle school yet. But she should be aware of it. The morals that we
used to have were now useless in this world.

"This isn't a game. Be careful."

"Yes, don't worry."

I listened to Lee Gilyoung's voice and hid the flag on my back.

Until now, the flag was a good bait to attract the small kings. However,
from now on, it would just be bait for predators. There was nothing good
about advertising that I was a king on this battlefield.

The intermediate dokkaebi's voice was heard.

[Huhu, everyone is doing well! So many people are doing hidden scenario
then what is the meaning of 'hidden'?]

It had no nerves. I would find it embarrassing now and again.

[Someone has already fulfilled the requirements for the first qualification.
Once again, this is interesting.]
A king had already achieved the black flag. It was probably one of the
Seven Kings.

[After a while, the requirements of the second qualifications will be
revealed.]

I turned to look at the party members and said, "Quickly. The dokkaebi's
'after a while' might not be long."

I put together the Sang Pyong Tong Bo coins in the lobby one by one.

[You have entered a hidden field using 10 Sang Pyong Tong Bo coins.]

[Do you want to enter the hidden chapter, the Big Dipper?]

Right now, I had the purple flag. The kings with the same purple flags
would flock to the Big Dipper. In other words, my prey were all gathered in
one place.

[You have entered the Big Dipper chapter.]

My vision waved and the lobby soon changed. The white marble lobby was
transformed into a spacious waiting room.

There were seven doors at the end of the waiting room.

"Uh…!"

Yoo Sangah let out a brief groan and took a step back. There were bodies at
Yoo Sangah's feet. They were the bodies of group members who had fought
each other. Lee Gilyoung looked down at the corpses with an
expressionless face.

There were so many bodies that it was hard to walk straight. Hundreds of
bodies were scattered all over the place like graves. There was a wave of
blood already.
I felt a bit strange. If I hadn't spread the plagiarist writer's textbook, they
might not have died. Then didn't they die because of me?

"Hey, there are people."

The center of the waiting room contained a huge bonfire using the bodies of
people as fuel.

I could see the faces of some survivors. I didn't know if they were allies or
held a truce, but they weren't fighting.

I looked at the group of people and spoke to my party members. "Be
careful."

A group stood up. Greed could be seen in their eyes.

"You are a newcomer. Who is your king?"

Some people secretly moved behind out party while others drew our
attention. The encirclement was gradually becoming narrower.

"Is it you? Or maybe the woman next to you? It can't be the kid."

[Many of the constellations are annoyed by the pests.]

[A few constellations want you to take serious action.]

I was already planning on that.

"Hey, why aren't you answering… aack!"

The white light of Unbroken Faith filled the air. The unstoppable trajectory
cut off the limbs of a person. A confused person shouted, "Damn! Just kill
him!"

The people took out their weapons like they had been waiting. But it was
too late.
"W-Why are you so fast?"

There were few people with agility higher than me right now.

They didn't have high level skills so no one other than the Seven Kings
could follow my movements right now.

The Blade of Faith swung in a semicircle and cut five or six people at the
same time.

The attack that followed cut off a hand holding a weapon. I pierced another
wrist.

"Kuaaaak!"

The severed limbs flew unrealistically through the air. I walked behind a
man screaming painfully and used a skill.

[The exclusive skill 'Hit a Pressure Point Lv. 1' is activated.]

I had cut off the man's limbs but there was no need to be cruel.

There was a dark blue dagger hidden in the man's arms. This was the
poisonous dagger that could be obtained at the end of the 5 person dungeon,
the 'Dongui Bogam'. If my response had been even a bit late, this would've
been us.

As soon as the people collapsed, I called to Lee Gilyoung.

"Please."

Lee Gilyoung nodded. Lee Gilyoung's hand stopped the people's breathing
one by one. He moved his hand like he was killing insignificant insects. I
was also a little surprised.

Then Yoo Sangah came forward.
"I'll do it Gilyoung…"

"…Can you do it?"

"I will still do it."

Yoo Sangah's tone was unusually stubborn. She looked grimly at Lee
Gilyoung. She held a knife and turned her back to me. Maybe Yoo Sangah
despised me.

Perhaps it was fortunate that I couldn't read Yoo Sangah's mind.

Yoo Sangah moved even more efficiently than Lee Gilyoung and took the
lives of the remaining people. Her fingertips trembled as the work finished.

"…Will we continue in this fashion?"

"Yes, probably."

"I will do it in the future instead of Gilyoung."

"Can you do it?"

"…There is no problem. It is just like breaking an egg."

Yoo Sangah used an analogy as she pretended to be calm.

"I can do it better." Lee Gilyoung grumbled, making Yoo Sangah place a
hand on his head.

There would be many twists and turns in the future. Sometimes we might
feel like collapsing or want to give up. But we had to overcome it.

Most of the Seven Kings we would soon meet would have higher stats than
us and they would also possess unique skills. There would certainly be
situations where we couldn't win without being hit by the enemies.
We silently picked up the items that the group dropped.

[You have earned 2,300 coins.]

[The item 'Dongui Bogam – Various Diseases (Upper Half of the Body)'
has been acquired.]

As expected, they were people who cleared the five person dungeon. A
total of eight books were available from the five person dungeon, each with
different usages. I was sure there were a few people who cleared the five
person dungeon so the others should be moderately easy to find.

Unfortunately, there was no 'king' in the group I just killed.

Clap clap clap.

Then the sound of clapping was heard.

One of the men watching from the big bonfire approached me with a smile
on his face. He showed no signs of panic despite the other group being
wiped out.

I raised my item and warned them casually.

"What do you want?"

The man took one step back and raised both hands as if he had no intention
of fighting.

"Uhh, calm down. I don't want to fight."

I took a closer look at the man. There was a large spear on his back. The
firm chest muscles were revealed by the clothes and his long hair was tied
back.
"You have great skills. You don't seem to have any passive skills but you
wiped out the Chungjeong group… those bastards, they are one of the
groups that lost their king."

Of course, that's why they came forward so recklessly.

"But you're a little late. The major kings have all entered the dungeon. They
will be busy fighting now. Well, the winner is almost decided but… the last
king who passed through here was incredibly fierce."

"Who is that?"

"Do you know the Tyrant King?" The man continued to speak. "He is
currently the most powerful king in northern Seoul. This is a story between
those who already know. The owner of the Absolute Throne will surely be
the Tyrant King."

A person might think so if they saw the Tyrant King in person. The Tyrant
King's armed force was certainly the top among the Seven Kings.

But it was laughable for him to be the owner of the Absolute Throne. The
Tyrant King was strong but he wasn't the strongest among the Seven Kings.

As if reading my mind, the man opened his mouth.

"But I don't think so. I think that the Tyrant King will never become the
owner of the Absolute Throne."

"…Why do you think that?"

"I saw it myself. He has a strong power but he doesn't know how to
handle people. A king must know the hearts of the people." The hearts of
the people?

"My king is able to do that. It is why many incarnations follow him. I am
sure that my king will become the master of the Absolute Throne."
I followed the man's glance. The Big Dipper chapter consisted of seven
entrances. Perhaps his king was moving in one of the passages.

"What is your point? Do you want us to join you?"

"Haha, that would be nice but you won't follow me just like that, right? I
just want to make an offer. If you don't mind, why don't you ally with us?"

I realized why this man was still in the waiting room. This guy was a bait.

"Why should I?"

"The Tyrant King is very strong. I believe in my king but I don't think he
can defeat the Tyrant King alone."

In contrast to his loyalty, he was a very realistic guy. But he was a 'real'
loyalist.

"Think about it. What will happen if we can't stop him from holding the
legendary sword? What if he gets the Absolute Throne and controls all the
kings in Seoul? Don't you think that you should stop this no matter
what?" I dimly remembered.

It didn't happen in the third regression but the 'Anti-Tyrant King Alliance'
had formed many times in Ways of Survival.

Once again, the future had changed.

"You have a point."

"That is why I'm making this suggestion. Our group will soon be acting
against the Tyrant King. We have already talked with several other kings. I
don't know what group you belong to but you won't lose anything by
joining us. You just need to give us a spoonful."
It was exactly as he said. The problem was that the price of the spoonful
was bigger than he thought…

The man took my silence as my acceptance.

"If you are serious, you can meet our king and think about it. It is almost
time for him to return to the waiting room… Oh, there he is."

In fact, one of the seven doors opened and the group that entered the Big
Dipper returned.

"King…"

The people standing at the door knelt down at once. Then the man in the
center of the crowd approached this side.

He was a clean shaven man. There was a brown club in his hands.

Wait. This guy, was it him?
           Chapter 68: Ep. 14 – Master of the Throne, IV


The one-eyed man approached us. This was my first meeting with one of
Seoul's Seven Kings.

Yoo Sangah talked in the group chat.

–Dokja-ssi, this person is perhaps… –

Yes, you're right.

I nodded to Yoo Sangah. It was impossible not to think of this person when
seeing the appearance.

–By the way, I don't understand. Even if the constellation is 'that person',
why is the incarnation dressed like that?
–His synchronization with the constellation seems to be high. The higher
the synchronization, the more the incarnation is influenced by the lifestyle
of the constellation.

–I should never cough in front of him.

The man with long hair tied back was bowing to the man approaching us.

"Your Majesty. You came."

"Yes."

"What happened?"

"Do I need to say it? Here."

The one-eyed man pointed to his staff. There was a blue jewel available
from the Big Dipper embedded on it.

[Greedy Wolf Star].

The long-haired man admired it.

"Ohh…!"

Wasn't he quite good? Already gaining one star jewel…

The star jewels were the rewards of the Big Dipper chapter.

It was an item that increased overall stats by one level. It had a good effect
on its own but the star jewels were meaningful when seven were collected.

It was because the jewels were the summoning material for the Four Yin
Demonic Beheading Sword.

The one-eyed man looked at me. "Who are these people?"
"They have just entered the Big Dipper chapter. Their abilities are quite
good so I was thinking about getting them to join."

"Really?"

The one-eyed man and I extended our hands to each other at the same time.

"I am Cha Sangkyung."

"I am Kim Dokja."

I shook his hand while activating a skill.

It was regrettable that Jung Heewon wasn't here. If she saw this man in
front of me, she would never speak nonsense about my sponsor again.

Cha Sangkyung said, "I have a burden of seeing things. Can I look at
you once?" "Yes."

Yes, he could try.

[The character 'Cha Sangkyung' has used Law of Interest Lv. 2!]

The stigma 'Law of Interest' was quite interesting among the investigation
techniques in Ways of Survival. It didn't reveal the attributes window of the
opponent but it was a skill that roughly gave information about the
personality of the opponent. In other words, he would see a 'Easily fooled
Demonic Enemy' if the person was 'good', while he would see a
'Backstabbing Demonic Enemy' if the person was 'bad'. For example…

[The character 'Cha Sangkyung' has discovered that you are a
demonic enemy that shouldn't be touched.] It was like this.

"T-This?"

"King, why are you acting like this?"

[The character 'Cha Sangkyung' is greatly disturbed.]

Cha Sangkyung shouted with a pale face.

"D-Demonic enemy!"

"Huh? It can't be…"
At his words, the group members of the Maitreya King simultaneously
looked at me. The atmosphere became tense when Cha Sangkyung urgently
added.

"N-Nothing. I have made a mistake."

"Huh? There's nothing?"

"Yes, it is nothing. Everyone back off."

Indeed. He would be a fool to ignore the warning of the constellation. By
the way, a demonic enemy that shouldn't be touched…

Maybe the One-eyed Maitreya didn't want to fight with me.

"Sigh… it isn't surprising."

The dubious thing was the reaction of the long-haired man. It was
momentary but there was an expression of 'regret' on his face.

"The plan will start in one hour. I'm looking forward to your participation
despite being a bit late."

Cha Sangkyung said before returning to his group members.

The first encounter with Gung Ye ended like this.

The long-haired man said, "Phew, it almost became a major event. I'm
glad."

"It is absurd to say that he is a king who knows the hearts of the people."

"Haha, Gung Ye might be recorded as a tyrant later on but he was a good
and wise king first. You never know what will happen in the future. History
can change."
I looked carefully at the long-haired man and asked, "By the way, who are
you?"

"Oh, I haven't introduced myself yet. I am Han Sooyoung. I am Cha
Sangkyung's assistant."

A man who supported the incarnation of Gung Ye. It was highly likely that
he was attached to Gung Ye's side because of his sponsor.

Who was it? Perhaps it was a king? I immediately used a skill.

[The exclusive skill, Character List is activated.]

[The information of this person can't be read in 'Character List'.]

[This person isn't registered in 'Character List'.]

…What?

"Um? What's wrong?"

I looked at the shamelessly speaking Han Sooyoung and couldn't help
laughing. I see… now I knew who this person was.

"It's nothing. Just… I feel like you are a demonic enemy."

"Haha, what do you mean?"

I could see Han Sooyoung's eyes change strangely. Maybe at this moment,
both of us were thinking the same thing. The question was who would pull
out a sword first.

The doors of the waiting room started to open one by one.

"The kings are coming!"
There was tension in the Maitreya group while several people in the waiting
room started cheering.

I watched the kings walking out the door and asked Han Sooyoung.

"Are they on the same side?"

"Yes, they are all kings who promised to cooperate with us. From left to
right, there is the 'Prudent King' Yoon Kiyoung and 'Fighting King' Kim
Baekho Then the last one who came out is the 'Earth Dragon King' Gu
Daesung."

I remembered something when I heard this nickname.

The Prudent King and Fighting King. They were just like their nicknames.
They had decent skills and stats but they were one step lacking compared to
the Seven Kings.

The only one I needed to pay attention to was the Earth Dragon King Gu
Daesung.

Gu Daesung discovered Cha Sangkyung and asked, "You have already
come out?

Fast."

"You are a rude earthworm."

"…Earthworm? Is that what you are calling my sponsor?"

Yoo Sangah was startled when she heard their words and whispered to me,
"That person, I think he has a good sponsor behind him."

"…How do you know?"

"I heard the story that the king of Baekje was born from an earth dragon."
"Earth dragon?"

"That's what they meant by 'earthworm'. The other kings are calling him the
son of an earth dragon in a mocking manner."

She was really amazing. She figured out the identity of Gu Daesung with
this much information.

Yoo Sangah was right.

Earth Dragon King Gu Daesung. In my memories, he was one of Seoul's
Seven Kings with the late King Gyeon Hwon as his sponsor.

"There are quite a few people who have a king for a sponsor. Then the king
we saw before…"

I nodded. In fact, it wasn't a coincidence that there were so many
incarnations whose sponsors were all kings of some kind.

The situation would be similar in other areas, not just the Seoul Dome.

In Japan, there would be a competition between the three heroes including
Oda Nobunaga. In the UK, there would be a competition between Richard
the Lionheart or Henry VIII.

The world's greatest constellations would be preparing for a war over the
Absolute Throne, raising their synchronization with their incarnation to a
breathtaking level.

[The constellation 'Maritime War God' is expecting the appearance of a
new story class constellation.]

[The constellation 'Bald General of Justice' is watching the situation with
sweaty hands.
The other high-ranking constellations were also interested. It was natural.
As I said before, the fourth scenario was an event for the greatest
constellations of each country.

"Is everyone gathered?"

The kings soon gathered in the middle and gave a speech.

"Our enemy is the Tyrant King who entered the third door! The Tyrant
King has already received two jewels from this dungeon and cowardly
raided innocent kings. Some of the people present would've lost a king to
him." That's why this waiting room was a field of corpses.

Perhaps the Tyrant King killed two kings and took away their star jewels. It
meant he would soon gather all seven star jewels…

"The new Seoul shouldn't be handed over to such a person. If he gets the
Four Yin Demonic Beheading Sword and then takes the Absolute Throne,
there will be endless grief and tragedy in Seoul!"

"Thus, the people have to fight! Get up right now! The kings here are all
wise. The future will be fine no matter which of us becomes the absolute
king. We have to at least stop the worst king!"

"This will be a struggle for a righteous way of living! Take care! You will
be great fighters taking your first step into a new history!"

The speech didn't have much substance but people became excited. Some
people cheered, some sympathized while others were touched to tears. It
was like they were real revolutionaries fighting for justice.

I looked at the scene alone.
Just one month ago, the people here had voted for a president. They did
their duty and agreed to have private property through legitimate economic
activities. All of a sudden, it felt like a dream.

In just one month, Seoul had returned to the kingdom days.

"Depart!"

Hundreds of people entered through the third door. Cha Sangkyung's group
was at the back and we moved in line with them.

Our vision wavered before a giant tunnel appeared. It was a huge tunnel
where the size couldn't be easily measured.

Han Sooyoung walked beside me and opened his mouth. "This is so
exciting. I feel like I'm in a martial arts novel."

"A martial arts novel?"

Han Sooyoung nodded with a meaningful smile. "Why, don't you think it is
like a martial arts novel? It is like a treasure map. The legendary sword is
sleeping in the stone chamber and whoever obtains the sword shall be the
best person in the world!"

Han Sooyoung spoke accompanied by gestures seemed quite plausible. It
wouldn't be unbelievable if he was an actor.

"It is a common cliche in a martial arts novel, the treasure sword."

"Oh, Dokja-ssi, do you read martial arts novels as well?"

It couldn't be missed when talking about genre fiction.

"I read quite a bit. By the way, there is a common development in these
cliche novels."

"Common development? What is it?"
"It turns out that the treasure map is a fake! This type of development."

Han Sooyoung's eyes shook. "This is interesting. What happens next?"

"It is an obvious story. The 'shadow' laughs quietly and kills the people
gathered because of the fake treasure."

"Hoh… is that the current situation? Could someone be a shadow?"

I nodded and stated, "It is a possibility although I don't like such obvious
cliches."

"Um? What does that mean?"

"To be honest, there are too many cliches like the treasure sword.

"Hmm… there are too many stories, making it bad?"

"For writers, I think it is a story that lacks distress."

Han Sooyoung's expression slightly hardened. "Then what would Dokja-ssi
do if you were the writer? What if you had to write about the treasure
sword?"

"I'm not sure. I am a 'reader' as my name suggests."

"I think that a reader would do the same. Writing familiar cliches will give
satisfaction to the readers."

Yes, I thought he would say something like this. I smiled and asked, "Who
said this? You are speaking as a writer. I'm not saying that cliches are bad.
At the very least, a plagiarist shouldn't use it."

"Pla…giarist?"

"Yes, a plagiarist."
It was funny to see Han Sooyoung's face change colours.

"Well, every story is similar. It is the details that are a bit different… Can it
really be called plagiarism? Perhaps if Dokja-ssi is the writer―"

"Nope, I would do it differently."

Han Sooyoung's eyebrows twitched. "…You would write it differently?
How?"

"For example, like this."

I raised Unbroken Faith and cut his neck. No blood was visible as his head
fell down.

I added, "Why are you hiding when it will be revealed anyway?"

Then Han Sooyoung's head spoke from where it was lying on the ground.
"How interesting. Kim Dokja."
           Chapter 69: Ep. 14 – Master of the Throne, V


I picked up his severed head and asked, "As expected, this is also an avatar.
Han Sooyoung is your real name?"

"Yes."

Han Sooyoung was the First Apostle as I thought. That damn plagiarist was
always hiding like a coward.

"W-W-What is this guy?" People shouted with alarm from all sides. There
were confused voices and voices filled with betrayal. I stepped to one side
with Yoo Sangah and Lee Gilyoung. Of course, Han Sooyoung's talking
head was still held in one hand.

"I was right. It is you who spread out the 'text novel'. Right?"

"That's right, I scattered the text version of your plagiarized novel."

"…The revelation isn't plagiarized."
"It is plagiarism. Did you write the original setting?"

"Don't compare my work to that rubbish."

"You understand what I am saying and don't deny reading the original."

Han Sooyoung glared at me.

"Everyone, kill him! What are you doing?"

"A-A head is talking!"

Han Sooyoung's expression distorted. People were alarmed by the turmoil
but showed no signs of acting. In addition, they would soon have no room
to worry about us. I smiled at Han Sooyoung.

"The cliche that you said will start soon."

I waited and there was a burst of light. The rings of light moved, drawing
lines of blood on the bodies of some people.

"What…?"

A person screamed as blood spurted from a body cut to pieces. The people
in the back screamed and moved.

"Damn these guys!"

It was black magic power that came from a strong presence approaching in
front of me.

"Raise the palanquin."

The neutral voice came from the large palanquin. There was the shadow of
someone inside the palanquin. I reflexively shouted.
"Yoo Sangah-ssi, Gilyoung! Move back!"

A voice flowed from the palanquin.

"Move."

The palanquin started to approach the group of people. The three rings of
light mercilessly swept over the battlefield. Dozens of people died at once.

People stared with disbelief as their limbs disappeared and blood spurted.
The start of the battle lines instantly became bare.

"Uwah…"

The terrified group members retreated. In the seething silence, everyone
shut their mouths like dead mice.

The Tyrant King walked out of the palanquin.

"They really aren't very good. The kings of the previous age…"

He held the Three Ring Loop in his hand, an item that released condensed
magic power. It was a hidden item available in northern Seoul but it wasn't
something the original Tyrant King had.

It must be true that he had some prophets.

     • The New Scenarios package is currently applied.



The attributes window made sense. He was so strong because he used three
packages. He also had a constellation who liked to walk dangerously on a
tightrope.
An aura covered his entire body.

The Tyrant King was raising his synchronization with his sponsor to the
limit. Several dokkaebis, including Bihyung, were staring at him from the
air. They were prepared to make a 'plausibility request' at any time if he
violated 'plausibility'.

"I certainly was a tyrant. But I am no longer a tyrant."

The Tyrant King, Great King Heoncheon Hongdo Gyungmun Wimu.

"History isn't scary. It is because from today onwards, I will make a new
history for this land."

The top tyrant of the Korean peninsula who wasn't recorded as a 'king' in
history.

"I am Yeonsangun¹, born Lee Yung!"

A tremendous magic power emerged from the Tyrant King as
synchronization with the sponsor reached its limit.

The group members in the way exploded. Level 30 magic power was
inserted in the Three Ring Loop. It was very dangerous.

"Don't back down!"

"Everyone fight!"

However, the Anti-Tyrant King Alliance was also unbelievable. Apart from
the other kings, there was also the Maitreya King and the Earth Dragon
King.

Once the kings united, the disadvantages were gradually reduced. The other
kings raised the synchronization with their sponsor close to the limit. It
wasn't just the incarnations, the constellations were also desperate.
I looked down at Han Sooyoung's head and asked, "You aren't going to
fight?"

Han Sooyoung laughed at my words.

"Laughing? I guess you still have room to spare," I said.

"You… do you think it will go as you planned? Yeonsangun and the other
kings have started to fight. Once they are exhausted, you will be able to
take the Four Yin Demonic Beheading Sword. Right?" It was pretty close.

"But it won't work! Your act of spreading the text was quite good but I have
been preparing for today much longer than you."

"What nonsense are you saying?"

"In the end, the cliche will win."

The voice of the intermediate dokkaebi was heard in the air.

[Huhu, everyone is fighting well. Great constellations, are you desperate? I
see. The incarnations and constellations should work hard. Does everyone
want to go up another narrative class?]

The battlefield quieted down at the dokkaebi's voice.

[That's why I've brought good news. From now on, the second qualification
test will begin!]
  [King's Qualification]

     1. 「The owner of the throne should be braver than anyone else. 」

  –The Absolute Throne never wants a 'weak king'. To challenge the
  throne, you must own at least a black flag.

     2. 「 He who dreams of the throne must desire it. 」

  –The number of 'kings' that can challenge the throne is decided. In
  order to gain the right to challenge it, you must remove the other
  kings around you.


The intermediate dokkaebi laughed.

[Please note that only five kings can challenge the final qualification of the
Absolute Throne. The remaining number is… let's see.]

[Number of kings remaining: 14.]

The people started murmuring.

"F-Fourteen?"

"Are there still kings outside?"

[For your reference, there are 12 kings currently inside the hidden
dungeon.]

I was a bit surprised. There were so many kings in this dungeon. Well, I
didn't think I would be the only 'hidden' king.

"Who is it? Who is the king that is hiding?"

The Tyrant King laughed at the confused people.
"Hahaha! It is very funny that you are hitting each other in the back of the
head!"

"Now isn't the time to fight among ourselves! We must pay attention to the
Tyrant King!"

It happened when the kings barely regained their sense of reason.

"Here! This guy is the king!" Han Sooyoung's head shouted to everyone. "I
saw it! He has a flag!"

"What?"

This was really…

I quickly trampled on Han Sooyoung's head. Everyone's attention focused
on me. It was the moment when the death of one of the 'remaining kings'
was decided.

"If we kill him…"

I felt it was cheap. The plagiarist's plot was too shallow. Wait a minute,
perhaps?

…How interesting. Was it like that?

I focused on the people secretly moving behind the kings. They were the
loyal subjects that the kings cherished.

"Cough…!"

The thin knife cut off the head of a king.

[The number of remaining kings has been reduced.]

[Number of kings remaining: 12.]
The Prudent King and Fighting King were exhausted, while the Maitreya
King and Earth Dragon King were hit hard by the surprise attack. Even the
Tyrant King was stabbed in the side and thighs by three men from behind.

"These damn people…!"

I realized who was behind this. The humans who betrayed their kings didn't
bleed when their heads were cut off. The gems of the fallen kings were
quickly taken by someone.

"The jewel! My jewel!!"

The star jewels were moved through the hands of the hidden 'avatars' and
gathered in one person's hands.

"I told you. In the end, the cliche won."

A beautiful girl moved through the air and laughed as she landed on a
niche. Surely this wasn't the main body of the plagiarist writer?

…I hadn't expected a woman.

The seven jewels gathered in her hands emitted light.

[The Fake King Han Sooyoung has gathered all seven star jewels!]

[The seven star jewels are sacrificed to summon a new item.]

[Fake King Han Sooyoung is summoning the Four Yin Demonic Beheading
Sword!]

In the end, the plagiarist writer became the master of the Four Yin Demonic
Beheading Sword.

She was the Fake King. It was an attribute that matched amazingly well.

"Dokja-ssi. What should we do?"
"It is still okay."

Yoo Sangah made a strange face at my blase words.

"Is it okay to be so calm? That is a great item."

That's right. The S+ grade item was great. But Yeonsangun's Three Ring
Loop was also an S-grade item. The performance was a bit different but it
wasn't that bad.

"Hahahaha! Die! Die!"

A dazzling magic power poured out of the Four Yin Demonic Beheading
Sword and swept through the battlefield. However, people didn't die easily.
People thought they were going to explode but they managed to neutralize
her magic power.

Her magic power was weakened because she used a lot of avatars and
above all, the three main kings were still alive.

The confused Han Sooyoung shouted, "W-What is this? Why is it so
weak?"

"Kill her! Kill her and take away that sword!"

"U-Uwaaah! Back off! Back off!"

It turned out like this. Han Sooyoung was pushed back to where my party
was located. I said to her,

"The cliche was subverted. This is what usually happens."

"Shut up!"

"Do you want me to help you?"

"No need!"
Han Sooyoung cried out and waved her sword again. But she seemed to be
getting pushed back. I wanted to say something to this silly girl. The
weapon wasn't famous because it was strong, but because the original
owner was strong.

"I will kill you!"

The Tyrant King recovered his confidence and started attacking, while the
other kings started to fight as well.

The battle soon became a melee with no allies. By the way, it should be
time for him to come…

Was he still wandering? The northern region of Seoul was far but it
was enough time for him to return. [Number of kings remaining: 11.]
The signboard in the air changed. [Number of kings remaining: 10.]
Ah, indeed.

[Number of kings remaining: 9.]

He came.

"W-What?"

"Why is the number dwindling suddenly?"

The surrounding kings were filled with fear. The number of kings started
decreasing for an unknown reason.

[Number of kings remaining: 8.]

The fear of the kings' reached the limit as the number decreased to one
digit.
"There is someone. Someone is killing the kings!"

On the other hand, there was someone rejoicing.

The Tyrant King.

"Hahaha! Who cares? You will also die!"

The Tyrant King was about to fire the Three Ring Loop again when the
ceiling collapsed and the Tyrant King fell.

Kwaaaaang!

A formidable storm of magic power struck and the Tyrant King screamed
painfully. The enormous storm of magic power that disassembled all living
things into particles destroyed the Tyrant King's body.

"Uhh…ahhh…uwaaack!"

Then.

[Number of kings remaining: 7.]

Only the cold appearance of a person remained in front of them. The people
close to the unusual scene trembled and flopped down.

"W-What? What is this?"

A man had killed the Tyrant King in a single blow, like he was a bug. The
explosion cleared and his appearance was gradually revealed. The surviving
kings and dying kings, everyone looked at him with captivation.

Han Sooyoung's legs shook with fear and she retreated.

"Nonsense… this is nonsense!"
The words of her avatar suddenly came to mind. The strongest among the
Seven Kings in Seoul was the Tyrant King. I previously thought so but
these words weren't true.

So far, I had met five out of the Seven Kings, including Han Donghoon
who didn't become a king because of the prophets.

Hermit King of Shadows, Han Donghoon.

King of Beauty, Min Jiwon.

The Maitreya King Cha Sangkyung.

Earth Dragon King Gu Daesung.

Tyrant King Jung Youngho.

Apart from the Neutral King, who hadn't appeared yet, there was still one
person.

Then who was the remaining person? The answer was simple. In fact, I met
him before any other kings.

A furious voice rang through the battlefield.

"Kim Dokja…"

I smiled and waved towards him. A large black flag flew behind the person
heading towards me.

"You came…"

Of the Seven Kings of Seoul, the strongest was naturally the Supreme King,
Yoo Joonghyuk.
[1] Yeonsangun is considered the worst tyrant of the Joseon Dynasty,
perhaps all of Korean history, notorious for launching two bloody purges of
palace officials. Wiki.
           Chapter 70: Ep. 14 – Master of the Throne, VI


Nevertheless, a main character was a main character. I sent him to Gangbuk
Station but he already had a black flag.

If a non-representative took away the flag of a representative, the hidden
scenario 'Revolutionary Road' would open. He knew this and killed a
representative on the way here, making him a king.

Looking at Yoo Joonghyuk's current appearance, it seemed like Lee Jihye
and Jung Heewon did a good job.

I took a few steps back and looked at Han Sooyoung. "Hey, quickly give
me that sword."

"I-I don't want to."

"Do you want to die here?"
Han Sooyoung's eyes were shaken as Yoo Joonghyuk moved. I exclaimed,
"Gilyoung!"

Lee Gilyoung's eyes turned white like he had been waiting. I heard a tearing
sound and something pounding on the dungeon.

Then after a while. The sickle of a praying mantis flew through one wall.

[The 6th grade insect king, Titanoptera has appeared!]

Lee Gilyoung's ability was the best. The whole cave shook with the
enormous power of the giant insect king. As Yoo Joonghyuk looked back, I
struck Han Sooyoung.

"A-Ack…!"

Han Sooyoung groaned and let go of the Four Yin Demonic Beheading
Sword. I picked up the sword as well as the flag hanging from Han
Sooyoung's neck as a bonus.

[You have won the flag of the 'Hongik University' group.]

[Your purple flag has absorbed the cumulative achievements of the black
flag.]

[Your purple flag has evolved into a black flag.]

[You are able to use the perks of the black flag.]

[Congratulations! You have completed the first king's qualification.]

[Number of kings remaining: 6.]

I ran straight towards the Tyrant King. The Tyrant King was lying down
between a pile of stones, his body crushed like dough. It was terrible. He
tried to kill everyone only to die in vain like this.
Han Sooyoung shouted from behind me. "You thief!"

I ignored her and quickly swept up the Tyrant King's items.

[The item 'Three Ring Loop' has been acquired.]

[The item 'Dragon Jar' has been acquired.]

The revival 'Dragon Jar'. The Tyrant King obtained it by clearing the seven
person dungeon.

"…Kim Dokja!"

Yoo Joonghyuk was chasing after me at a scary speed. Despite the fact that
I had 30 agility, he narrowed the distance to me in an instant. I looked
around and hid behind the nearest king.

"W-What?"

It was the king of Later Baekje, Gu Daesung.

"Kuaaaak!"

Yoo Joonghyuk's relentless blow cracked his head while Yoo Joonghyuk
obtained his flag.

[The constellation 'Founder of Hannamgun' is looking at you.]

I felt sorry for Gyeon Hwon but it couldn't be helped. I promised to make it
up to him next time.

At this time, I decided to stop running away.

"Joonghyuk, stop for a minute. Let's talk."

"That note…"
"The note?"

"My sister."

It was only two words but I instantly understood. Fortunately, Lee Jihye
handled things safely. The note was given to Yoo Joonghyuk at the right
time.

"What about your sister?"

"Where did you hide my sister?"

"What are you talking about?"

[The character Yoo Joonghyuk is currently using Lie Detection Lv. 6.]

[The character Yoo Joonghyuk has confirmed that your words are false.]

"If you don't tell me right away, you really will die."

I knew it was true even without Lie Detection. The reason why Yoo
Joonghyuk was like this was entirely due to my plot.

I drove him to go north to save his sister, causing him to waste time
searching the north. Yoo Joonghyuk's less worn-out personality in this third
regression made the plan possible.

It couldn't be helped, even if I was acting cowardly. If Yoo Joonghyuk, who
was much stronger than the original third regression, ignored everything
and engaged in the war of kings, this scenario would've ended at his pace.

Then I would never get the ending that I wanted.

"…Okay. Let's put the sword down and talk. What if I was a real jerk?"

"Are you taking my family hostage?"
"That's going overboard. Isn't that just your words?"

The concept of a hostage didn't exist for him in the first place. This guy
could just die and go back.

"Then why did you do this?"

"Why do you think"

Yoo Joonghyuk noticed that I was buying time and his expression cooled.
"I should've killed you at that time… then die."

The moment that Yoo Joonghyuk raised his sword, a voice was heard from
the air.

[Everyone here, please calm down. Why are you still fighting? Let's see,
you've met the qualifications.]

The intermediate dokkaebi appeared at this moment.

Yoo Joonghyuk also confirmed the number board floating in the air.

[Number of kings remaining: 5.]

[The 'Last King's Qualification' has begun.]

The bodies of the remaining kings, including me and Yoo Joonghyuk,
started to be forcibly moved through space.

"Kim Dok…!"

Yoo Joonghyuk reached out for me but it was too late.

I finally reached the last phase of this scenario.

[The qualified kings will move to the final testing place.]
The landscape started changing. It felt like my body was being sucked
somewhere else. The next moment, tung! There was the sound of me
bumping my head against something. A moment later, I became conscious
again.

[You aren't qualified to take past in the 'Last King's Qualifications.]

…What?

I looked around and saw that I was standing in the center of
Gwanghwamun. I had bumped into a barrier the size of a schoolyard. The
center contained the Absolute Throne, the last reward of this scenario.

Why couldn't I enter?

[Hahaha! This, this! You were only looking at the big picture and missed
something important!]

I looked up at the sound of laughter and saw the ridiculing face of the
intermediate dokkaebi. I thought he was playing tricks on me but then an
unexpected message flashed.

[You have failed to occupy the 'target station' of the fourth scenario.]

[You must first take the target station to be qualified for the 'Last King's
Qualifications'.]

[Your group's target station is Changsin Station.]

Ah… I was only thinking about the kings and forgot. I hadn't occupied it
yet.

[The last phase can't be performed unless the previous phase is cleared
properly. Did you think you could get away with it?]
There was already fighting going on inside the barrier. If this continued,
everything I had done would be in vain. I thought I should run to Changsin
Station before it was too late.

By the way… damn. Wouldn't all the scenarios end if I ran there?

"Dokja-ssi!"

Yoo Sangah was rushing over here while carrying the collapsed Lee
Gilyoung. But there were more people with them. Huh?

"Heewon-ssi?"

Jung Heewon ran to this side while holding the hands of a unknown girl.

"Is my brother really here?" The girl asked.

"Yes. How many times do I have to say it?"

"But I'm hungry."

Jung Heewon wasn't supposed to be here right now. After saving a girl
from the Gangbuk area of Seoul, she should wait at Changshin Station.
That was Jung Heewon's job in this scenario.

"Heewon-ssi, why are you here? I told you to wait at Changsin Station…"

"No, how long was I waiting? Besides, she has been hungry since morning.
Aren't you worried about your sister?"

At Jung Heewon's words, the girl pointed to me and said, "That person isn't
my brother."

"Eh?"

"He is uglier than my brother."
Damn kid. Jung Heewon was surprised as she looked between me and the
girl. "Eh? This isn't Dokja-ssi's sister? I thought that was why you asked me
to save her."

"No."

"Then who is it?"

It was natural for Jung Heewon not to know. Who would think this girl
would be the psychopath's sister?

I heard a growling sound from the girl's stomach. I listened to the sound and
laughter emerged.

…Would my perfect plan collapse here?

"Dokja-ssi, where are you going?"

"I'm going to occupy Changsin Station."

I had to challenge it, even if I was late. I wish there was a long-distance
teleport scroll but the intermediate dokkaebi wouldn't let me open the
Dokkaebi Bag.

Then Jung Heewon looked at me and opened her mouth. "Why would you
go there?"

"Huh?"

"Kid, bring that thing out. Didn't I give it to you before?"

"Yes!"

Yoo Joonghyuk's sister, Yoo Mia put her hand in her mouth. After a
moment, her mouth became abnormally large and an unusual sized stone
emerged. It was Yoo Mia's exclusive skill, Inventory. I moved towards the
chunk of stone.
"What is this?"

"Don't you know?"

I examined the rough surface of the stone. Then I saw a small groove that
could hold something.

…I never thought of this. Was this method possible? No one had tried this
in Ways of Survival.

Jung Heewon shamelessly said, "Don't you need the flagpole to occupy the
station?"

What type of ignorant human would think up an idea like this? Jung
Heewon had cut up the floor that contained the flag holder of Changshin
Station.

[The constellation 'Adventurer who Stands Up an Egg' admires Jung
Heewon's idea.]

I tried to say something but fell silent.

"Why, is something wrong?"

"…No."

"Then what are you doing? Go ahead and insert the flag."

I nodded and pulled out the flag.

[You have occupied Changsin Station.]

[You have earned 2,000 coins as a reward for 'Struggle for the

Flag'.] I really did it.

[Your group has occupied the target station.]
[Your body has moved to the battlefield of the 'Last King's Qualification'.]

My consciousness flickered again. A message popped up as a king's
qualification was added.
  [King's Qualification]

     1. 「 The owner of the throne should be braver than anyone else. 」

  –The Absolute Throne never wants a 'weak king'. To challenge the
  throne, you must own at least a black flag.

     2. 「 He who dreams of the throne must desire it. 」

  –The number of 'kings' that can challenge the throne is decided. In order
  to gain the right to challenge it, you must remove the other kings around
  you.

     3. 「 A single king stands alone without any help. 」

  –The king who can challenge the throne must be able to prove his
  strength was just his body.


[The constellation 'Maritime War God' is calmly watching the situation.]
[The constellation 'Bald General of Justice' is cheering for the
historicalgrade constellations.]

[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' is laughing.]

[The constellation 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' scoffs at the
historicalgrade constellations.]

The constellations had opposite reactions unlike other times. It was because
the constellations had different ranks.

The gap between historical-grade and narrative-grade was like the
difference between a child and an adult.
That's why the reaction of the constellations watching the broadcast
differed. Like adults not paying attention to a child's game of hide-and-
seek, this scenario was meaningless for constellations above narrative-
grade.

But the historical-grade constellations were different.

In this scenario, the triumphant historical-grade constellation would climb
to the absolute throne and build up their 'story'. This was why the
historicalgrade constellations were impatient once the King's Qualification
scenario began.

I opened my eyes and the King's Battlefield began.

[From now on, all kings can't receive the support of their sponsor.

[From now on, the attack and defense of all items will be limited.]

[From now on, all skills, stigmas and special item options will be sealed.]

[From now on, the total stats of all kings will change to 10/10/10/10/10.]

[The Last King's Qualification will continue until one person is left.]
              Chapter 71: Ep. 15 – A Kingless World, I


The last king's test. It was an extreme trial that had to be overcome with
your body only.

The floor of Gwanghwamun was a mess. The Absolute Throne was in the
center while the kings were fighting each other.

King of Beauty, Min Jiwon.

The Maitreya King Cha Sangkyung.

Supreme King Yoo Joonghyuk.

Then the middle-aged man in the corner… He was the Neutral King. The
Neutral King raised his hands as he met my eyes.

[The Neutral King has abstained from fighting for the throne.]
As the name suggested, the Neutral King wasn't greedy for the throne. Only
the remaining three were greedy.

One of the three was Yoo Joonghyuk so the fight should've ended in less
than a minute. At least, if it was the original story.

"Die!"

Maitreya King Cha Sangkyung's leg split apart the air while Yoo
Joonghyuk's kick struck Cha Sangkyung's abdomen.

"Kuk!"

However, Cha Sangkyung wasn't as damaged as expected. It was because
all stats were changed to level 10. The skills were sealed so Yoo Joonghyuk
had to win the battle with just his flesh memories.

Min Jiwon looked behind them and saw me. I nodded slightly at her.

"We meet again."

"…Yes. I didn't want to fight you if possible."

Min Jiwon must've filled the other king's qualifications if she came to this
place. It was great. I honestly didn't think she could survive until the end.

"If you don't abstain, I will attack."

"Try it. Do you think it will be easy?"

We have to fight with all our stats at level 10 with no skills or no stigma. It
was too shabby compared to the kings who broke the city while fighting a
while ago.

There was a loud noise and Cha Sangkyung screamed, "Cough! W-
Why…?"
Cha Sangkyung rolled around painfully on the floor after being struck by
Yoo Joonghyuk's fist. It had been an equal fight until then but something
was changing little by little.

Skills and stigmas couldn't be used but Yoo Joonghyuk's attacks were
getting faster and harder. It wasn't merely Yoo Joonghyuk's combat sense.

Min Jiwon became surprised as she noticed.

"…How?"

If I remembered correctly, Yoo Joonghyuk knew the loophole of the last
phase. Maybe these messages were currently rising in Yoo Joonghyuk's
mind.

[400 coins have been invested in physique.]

[400 coins have been invested in agility.]

[400 coins have been invested in strength.]

The funny thing was that this battlefield controlled everything except for
one factor. It was the use of the coins.

[The constellation 'Slumbering Lady of Fine Brocade' questions the fairness
of the scenario.]

The intermediate dokkaebi laughed.

[Haha, what is your question? It is a natural right to be able to use coins.
The 'coins' are the hard-earned work of the incarnations. They worked so
hard to gather coins that they should have a chance to use it.] Yoo
Joonghyuk was raising his stats using his coins.

[Oh, the stats increased with the coins will be reset after the scenario is
over. So be careful! It is like throwing away coins into the air! Hahaha!]
Min Jiwon and Cha Sangkyung's complexions darkened once they heard
the words of the intermediate dokkaebi. Perhaps they didn't have much
coins remaining. It was natural. They wouldn't be able to save coins in the
battlefield between kings.

But Yoo Joonghyuk was different. Yoo Joonghyuk grew by breaking
through all types of hidden scenarios from the beginning and always carried
an appropriate amount of coins in reserve.

The original third round Yoo Joonghyuk had around 30,000 coins at this
point. Now he had more coins than the original story so… it should be
around 40,000?

There was the loud sound of somebody being hit and Cha Sangkyung's
body flew through the air.

[The Maitreya King Cha Sangkyung is out of combat.]

Yoo Joonghyuk looked at the nearby Min Jiwon. She jumped with surprise
and hurriedly raised both hands.

"…I will abstain."

['King of Beauty' Min Jiwon has abstained from the battle.]

Finally, Yoo Joonghyuk turned towards me. His angry eyes calmed down.
It was understandable. If he took the Absolute Throne, he could control all
kings and it wouldn't be a problem to get his sister back from me.

But would that happen?

"Yoo Joonghyuk."

We aimed out swords at each other. I couldn't use any skills so I had to rely
on my flesh memories and my stats.
For the first time, Yoo Joonghyuk's blade was visible. It must be a fake. He
was estimating my stats and how much coins I had left.

He was truly a prudent person. It was a trick to win by investing the
minimum amount of coins.

However, his pride would cause his defeat this time. It was because there
wasn't any king in Seoul who had more coins than me right now.

[Coins Possessed: 80,850 C]

Who would think that I had 80,000 coins? I laughed at Yoo Joonghyuk who
was running towards me.

"I'll hit you gently so please don't die."

Now was the time to spend big. I invested a large number of coins into
'strength'.

[4,000 coins have been invested in strength.]

[Strength Lv. 10 -> Strength Lv. 20]

[5,000 coins have been invested in strength.]

[Strength Lv. 20 -> Strength Lv. 30]

[6,000 coins have been invested in strength.]

[Strength Lv. 30 -> Strength Lv. 40]

.

.

[11,000 coins have been invested in strength.]
[Strength Lv. 80 -> Strength Lv. 90]

[12,000 coins have been invested in strength.]

[Strength Lv. 90 -> Strength Lv. 100]

[72,000 coins have been consumed.]

[Your 'strength' has broken through the limits of a human.]

[The achievement has been processed! You are the first to achieve a three
digit level in strength.]

[30,000 coins have been acquired as a reward.]

I adjusted the power in my fist. A strike containing 100 strength was
enormous. It would be difficult if I accidentally killed Yoo Joonghyuk.

I felt the space around my fist bend slightly. According to Ways of
Survival, all stats had different destructive power from the moment they
broke through the three digits.

How did it feel? Of course, it felt like I was a killer. It felt like my fist was
holding a check for a billion won.

Yoo Joonghyuk's eyes widened as he hurriedly used coins. However, it was
too late. There was a sound like a sonic boom.

Yoo Joonghyuk shot into the sky like a baseball being hit by a bat.

Unfortunately, it was impossible to hit a home room in this stadium. The
flying Yoo Joonghyuk hit a barrier, bounced in the opposite direction and
hit another barrier and landed on the ground after repeating this ping-pong
action five or six times.

…Surely he wasn't dead? I ran towards Yoo Joonghyuk with a bit of
confusion in my heart.
Damn, why did I do this? I should've used a bit less strength. I carefully
pulled Yoo Joonghyuk off the ground. Then.

Ah, this was a main character. Yoo Joonghyuk was staring at me with wide
open eyes. He was still conscious despite being hit by a punch filled with
100 strength?

"…Yoo Joonghyuk?"

"…"

"Joonghyuk?"

"…"

His eyes didn't move. This bastard, did he faint with his eyes open? Did I
hit him that hard? No, I would have to keep hitting Yoo Joonghyuk in the
future.

"Well, you will be in trouble if you keep acting as usual. How can you say
you'll kill me every time you see me?"

I slapped his swollen face. Somehow, I felt his eyes move whenever I hit
him, causing me to feel nervous…

In any case, he was breathing. The bones in his body were broken and he
was bleeding…

It was a situation where he couldn't use the Recovery skill so his life could
be in danger.

I had to do my work quickly.

[Supreme King Yoo Joonghyuk is out of combat.]
[Congratulations! You have passed all the tests of the Absolute Throne.]

The ward in the air slowly disappeared.

[The temporary stats added by the coins are reset.]

[All constraints on the kings have disappeared.]

[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' has his hair standing
up from excessive carbonic acid.]

[The constellation 'Secretive Plotter' applauds your actions.]

[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' admires your patience.]

[4,500 coins have been sponsored.]

I also heard the messages of the historical-grade constellations.

[The constellation 'Slumbering Lady of Fine Brocade' is regretful.]

[The constellation 'One-eyed Maitreya' has thrown away his eyepatch.]

[The constellation 'Founder of Hannamgun' feels a grudge towards you.]

Of course, the kings of the three kingdoms blamed me. Thanks to me, they
missed an opportunity to jump to the 'narrative' grade.

[…Oh, a surprising winner has appeared.]

The intermediate dokkaebi looked somewhat dissatisfied. He hadn't
expected me to win. Yet I had won.

[Well… good. This is the result. Now, I am informing all incarnations of
Seoul. Just now, a new owner of the Absolute Throne was born!]
I stopped the intermediate dokkaebi who was about to launch the system
messages.

"Wait a minute."

[…What do you want?]

The dokkaebi's eyebrows twitched.

"You are too hasty. I haven't even sat on the throne yet. Shouldn't you ask
me first?"

[You will go up now so does it matter?]

I approached the Absolute Throne. At this moment, I felt all constellations
observing the Seoul Dome focus on me.

The Absolute Throne floating in the sky slowly descended towards me. It
showed off its golden charm like it had been waiting for me for a long time.

I asked the intermediate dokkaebi, "What can I do with this?"

[You can do anything to humans.]

It was short but scary.


[The Absolute Throne is just the name of the item. As long as you sit on the
throne, you can become an omnipotent power. No one on this earth can
stand against you and everyone will bow before you!]

The people looked at me enviously after hearing the dokkaebi's explanation.

It was natural to envy me. Everybody had run to this place for this reason.
[The constellation 'Slumbering Lady of Fine Brocade' is licking her lips.]

Even the constellations…

It was really pitiful and strange. They felt envious despite knowing the real
identity of the item. I really disliked the constellations.

"Is that all?"

[…Huh?]

"It is so good that it's ridiculous. I will enjoy absolute power on the land
that I control."

[Isn't it right to receive a reward in return for suffering? How many times
have you almost died due to the throne…?]

"Ah, so the throne can act beyond the constraints of plausibility?"

[What?]

"You are good at lying. Aren't you a dokkaebi? Won't the Bureau say
something if you scam me like this?"

The expression of the intermediate dokkaebi hardened. On the other side,
Bihyung was looking at me with a pale face. [I am tired of this talk.

I have to finish the scenario. Now sit on the throne. If you talk nonsense
one more time, I will break the Absolute Throne.] "…Ah, you can do that?
Then go ahead."

[Huh?]

I looked at the dokkaebi and the people staring before opening my mouth.

"I will never sit on this Absolute Throne."
A terrible silence swept through Gwanghwamun.
             Chapter 72: Ep. 15 – A Kingless World, II


There was the sound of thunder in the sky and it started to rain. Light rose
from the Absolute Throne to touch the sky. Thick rain clouds swirled
around this light. It was a sign of the fifth scenario, the Great Hole.

The intermediate dokkaebi opened his mouth amidst the rain.

[…What did you say just now?]

"The throne, I won't accept it."

[I don't know why you're doing such a thing. Don't you think it will benefit
you to gain more coins at this time? Didn't you just use a lot of coins? You
should be rewarded. If you don't have the power of the Absolute Throne,
the Seoul Dome will never survive the fifth scenario.]

The people in Gwanghwamun screamed at me once they heard the
dokkaebi's words.
"What? What are you thinking?"

"Don't be stupid and sit down quickly!"

"Damn, I will sit…!"

The dokkaebi kept talking like he thought it was going his own way.

[That throne can give you what you want. Just sitting on the throne will
build up your 'narrative' and the sponsor you have contracted with will rise.
Don't you know what this means?]

In fact, I could hear the outcry of the constellations in my ears.

[The constellation 'Adventurer who Stands Up an Egg' wants to be your
sponsor.]

[The constellation 'Seo Ae Il Pil' wants to be your sponsor.]

·····.

[500 coins have been sponsored.]

The intermediate dokkaebi continued to speak in a cold voice.

[I will warn you in advance. I'm not like the low level dokkaebis. Don't
think that flimsy tricks will work on me.]

I looked at the Absolute Throne. As the dokkaebi said, the fifth scenario
would be difficult to clear without the Absolute Throne.

However, I knew what the dokkaebi wasn't saying. If I used this 'Absolute
Throne' once, I would never be able to reach the end of the scenarios. In the
original work, Yoo Joonghyuk noticed this only at the 14th regression.

The 'Absolute Throne' was such an item.
"Why aren't you becoming king?"

An agitated person appeared among the crowd. The man breathed out and
spat at me like I insulted him.

I turned towards the man. "That is what I want to ask. Why do you want me
to become king?"

"What?"

"What will you do if I kill you after you become king?"

The lips of the man stiffened for a moment. I continued watching the
people around us. "All of you are the same. Have you already forgotten?
We originally didn't live in a kingdom. Why are you acting like citizens of a
kingdom?"

Why didn't I want to be king? It was simple.

"I don't want to be the king of ugly humans like you." I looked up at the sky
while speaking. "In addition, I don't want ugly constellations like you to be
my sponsor."

Then I looked at the throne.

"Thus, I will never sit on the Absolute Throne. But." I pulled out my blade.
"I won't allow other people to sit on the throne."

Once someone sat down, it meant that no one else could sit. The
intermediate dokkaebi's cold eyes flashed.

[You should be careful. I'm not that patient…]

I continued to speak as I stared at the dokkaebi.
"How long will you continue to be drawn helplessly into the dokkaebi's
scenarios? Does anyone know what it means to sit on the Absolute
Throne?"

I knew how much the people who were once 'obedient' would pay to leave
this obedience.

"The constellations of the Korean peninsula. It is the same for you. I know
that not all constellations are the same. Some constellations are low and
some are high."

There was an invisible rank among constellations.

Just as some constellations watched the incarnations, other constellations
watched the constellations. To be precise, the low constellations were the
ones being watched.

"But is it enough now? How long will you turn this land into a playground
for unhappy guests?"

[The constellation 'One-eyed Maitreya' is immersed.]

"Working up to build up history to become a constellation and then
building up narratives to become narrative-grade constellations… then
what? The higher the sky, the brighter the star? How long will you continue
using the descendants of this land for your own sake?"

[The constellation 'Slumbering Lady of Fine Brocade' is silent.]

At this moment, the intermediate dokkaebi acted.

[I can't stand it any longer.]

A system message arrived at the same time.

[A new sub scenario has arrived!]
  [Sub Scenario – Forced Succession]

  Category: Sub

  Difficulty: B

  Clear Conditions: Suppress the incarnation Kim Dokja, who doesn't
  want to sit on the throne and place him on the throne.

  Time Limit: 30 minutes

  Compensation: 6,000 coins

  Failure: ―



Yes, I thought it would turn out like this.

The people who had been shaken by my words were now approaching.

In the end, it was just like the dokkaebi said. The people present and me as
well. No matter what I said, they would sell their conscience for a few
coins.

Of course, this didn't apply to everyone.

"Pass me if you can." A woman appeared in front of me. People faltered at
her growled out words. It was Jung Heewon.

"No matter what the world is like, there is something you shouldn't forget."
Yoo Sangah suddenly approached. Lee Gilyoung was standing behind me
with a hammer like he had been waiting. Jung Minseob and Lee Sungkook
also came forward.

"…Sometimes, Representative-nim is more like the protagonist than Yoo
Joonghyuk."

"Yoo Joonghyuk isn't this crazy…"

There were also surprising people.

"Just this once, I will help you."

"Your words are convincing."

They were King of Beauty Min Jiwon and Maitreya King Cha Sangkyung. I
didn't know which of my words had moved their hearts. However, it was
clear that something had changed. Even so, it was only a handful.

[You are playing well… what are all of you doing? Pull him down now!]

People started running towards the throne. Jung Heewon pushed through
the people around me and asked, "Dokja-ssi, do you have an idea?"

"Yes."

"What should we do?"

"Buy me some time. I have to destroy this throne."

The length of the new scenario was contained in this throne. I pulled out a
sword causing someone to cry out.

"The Four Yin Demonic Beheading Sword!"

The S+ grade Four Yin Demonic Beheading Sword.

However, it was an item that could be changed into a star relic if certain
conditions were satisfied. It was because the Four Yin Demonic Beheading
Sword was an item made with the soul of a constellation.

[Ganpyeongui's special option 'Echo of the Stars' has been activated.]
['Echo of the Stars' allows you to ask for the help of a constellation.]

"I'll call a constellation."

[The great constellations hear your voice flowing through the stars.]

I called out to the constellations like I had memorized a spell.

"I want the first star of the Big Dipper."

The Greedy Wolf star (Dubhe).

"I want the second star of the Big Dipper."

The Great Gate star (Merak).

"I want the third star of the Big Dipper."

The Blessing star (Phecda).

"I want the fourth star of the Big Dipper."

The Literate Turn star (Megrez). "I

want the fifth star of the Big Dipper."

The Clean and Pure star (Alioth). "I

want the sixth star of the Big Dipper."

The Military Turn star (Mizar).

[The star navigation has begun.]

[The six constellations are looking at you.]

The thousands of constellations disappeared and my mind became heavy
like a crowded subway. I felt dizzy while blood flowed from my nose and
ears. It was hard to even think. My brain became overloaded the moment I
contacted six constellations at the same time. The Great Bear stars started
talking.

[What are you thinking?]

[You called all of us.]

[Your mind will be completely destroyed.]

[Why call us?]

[Why don't you go the easy path…]

[Instead of the thorny path?]

However, I didn't stop. Yes, one more constellation needed to be called if I
wanted to use the Four Yin Demonic Beheading Sword. But there were no
constellations left on the Sky Disc.

[You have exhausted the number of times that Ganpyeongui can be used.]

I pulled out the Dragon Jar that I got from the Tyrant King and dissolved
something in it.

The 7 person dungeon, the dissolving jar. I put two items in the jar.

"I will sacrifice the S-grade Three Ring Loop and the S-grade Ganpyeongui
to call one more constellation."

[The 'Dissolve' power of the Dragon Jar has shown its strength.]

[The S-grade Three Ring Loop has disappeared as a sacrifice.]

[The S-grade Ganpyeongui has one more use.]

I once again used Ganpyeongui and called one last constellation.
"I want the seventh star of the Big Dipper."

The Broken Army star (Alkaid).

Seven stars filled the air. The seven stars that made up the Big Dipper were
all gathered. At the same time, the seven stars spoke to me.

[What do you want from us?]

"I want to cut off the signs of the constellations. Lend me your sword."

[…Do you know what this means?]

"I know."

I did this despite being well aware of the risk.

The final reward of the fourth scenario was the Absolute Throne.

The throne was an item that borrowed the power of a 'god of the world'.

It would be very convenient if I got the throne. I would be able to put
restrictions on Yoo Joonghyuk and the enemies threatening me would
disappear.

But Seoul would surely be eliminated. It would be a complete destruction
without any salvation or miracles.

It was the price to be paid for borrowing the power of the throne. In order to
obtain the ending I wanted, no one could take this throne.

[Even the heavenly constellations are afraid of the founder of the throne.]

[But you, a human, wants to challenge the owner of this thing?]

"I can do it with your help. And I'm not fighting against the owner. I just
want to cut the connection between the owner and this thing."
[It is likely that you can't afford it.]

[You will die.]

"It is something that I've decided. Then I will start now."

The seven stars were silent. Some time passed. The Big Dipper shone
brightly and their signs were engraved onto the sword.

[I shall respect your will.]

[Even if you die here.]

[We will remember you.]

A dazzling light wrapped around the Four Yin Demonic Beheading Sword
and it started to burn with bright flames.

[The S+ grade Four Yin Demonic Beheading Sword has evolved into the
star relic 'Four Yin Demonic Beheading Sword'.]

The star relic Four Yin Demonic Beheading Sword was originally a
ceremonial sword. It was a sword to cut off evil energy and prevent
disasters.

I swung the sword towards the Absolute Throne. There was a loud sound
and fire flared.

The Four Yin Demonic Beheading Sword was one of the few items that
could break the link that a constellation had to a star relic.

There was a tearing sound in the air.

As if it started to notice something, an ominous black light floated above
the Absolute Throne. I swung it a few more times and the Four Yin
Demonic Beheading Sword started to collapse. Now I had to believe in the
Big Dipper stars. Yoo Sangah cried out, "Dokja-ssi! Quickly!"
I wielded the sword like a madman. I ignored the breaking blade and
continued to hit the throne. Sparks flashed and the blade broke.

Then finally.

[The constellation linked to the star relic 'Absolute Throne' has
disappeared.]

[The 'Unknown God' has noticed a change in this world.]

The Absolute Throne became an ordinary chair and lost its light. The
intermediate dokkaebi's angry voice was heard.

[You lowlifes can't grasp who you are dealing with…!]

[The sub scenario has ended.]

People stopped moving. The scenario was over so they didn't have to
continue. The Big Dipper stars told me.

[Incarnation, prepare for the flooding of probabilities.]

As soon as I heard the voice, blood poured from my mouth.

It felt like something was pulling at my presence. An enormous power that
seemed to tear at my flesh surrounded me. I struggled to regain my mind. It
was going to be okay.

The 'probability' would become 'plausibility'. I tried my best to make
everything plausible. Thus, I could overcome this.

I barely held onto consciousness. Then a star in the distant night sky shone
quietly.
[The constellation 'Maritime War God' is looking at you.]

It was a calm, lonely but gentle gaze.

[The constellation 'Bald General of Justice' is looking at you.]

Then two.

[The constellation 'Last Hero of Hwangsanbeol' is looking at you.]

Three.

[The constellation 'Slumbering Lady of Fine Brocade' is looking at you.]

·····.

The intermediate dokkaebi called out when he saw the messages from the
constellations.

[Why…?]

Every time a star was added, my pain diminished a little bit. I realized that
the constellations were sharing the 'probabilities' that I had to bear. The
'story that isn't plausible' became a 'plausible story' with the consent of
many stars. Numerous stars were wrapping me in their light. The Big
Dippers also lent me their strength.

[Is this the story that you wanted to show?]

I wanted to answer but I didn't have the power.

[We will watch you, king of the world without kings.]

The chaotic Seoul night sky. I looked at the stars that sent me light.

[The constellation 'King Heungmu the Great' is looking at you.]
[The constellation 'One-eyed Maitreya' is looking at you.]

·····.

All the historical-grade constellations of Seoul were shining towards me.
There were many stars. Still, it wasn't enough to overturn the dark night
sky.

I looked up at the turbulent clouds that filled the Great Hole.

[The fourth scenario is forcibly ended.]

[There was an unscheduled incident so it will take time to settle the
scenario.]

I wiped the blood pouring from my nose and the intermediate dokkaebi
approached.

[You have made the worst choice. You will regret what you did today for
the rest of your life. I will make sure of it.]

I laughed as my vision blurred. The dokkaebi's words meant that I won the
game.

[You have accomplished a non-existence achievement.]

[Your new narrative is created.]

[The narrative 'King of a Kingless World' has been born.]

[You have obtained the possibility of a stigma.]

I didn't have a next 'regression'. I would reach the end of the story in this
world.
             Chapter 73: Ep. 15 – A Kingless World, III


The first narrative was built. With this, the main goal of the fourth scenario
was achieved.

"What the hell is going to happen now?"

"No, why did you break the throne?"

There were people who were bewildered by the situation while others were
scared about what the angry dokkaebi would do.

From the perspective of the people present, I was a sinner who made the
fifth scenario difficult. Some people cried out to the dokkaebi.

"Make the Absolute Throne again! I'll join the scenario again!"

"This time I will be the master of the throne!"

[The scenarios that have already ended can't be changed by anyone.
Anything that happens to you from now on is the fault of that human.]

The intermediate dokkaebi's answer was cold.

The dokkaebi pointed towards me while the wet shoulders of the gathered
people shook.

[A world with no kings? Okay. Let's try it once. I will see how well you can
survive without a focal point.]

The intermediate dokkaebi flicked his finger. Then the people in
Gwanghwamun started to disappear like smoke. People screamed and ran
away.

"What? What's happening?!"

…This was an unscheduled development.

I looked back and saw Jung Heewon, Yoo Sangah, Lee Gilyoung and the
others calling out to me.

"Dokja-ssi!"

The next moment, Yoo Sangah disappeared. Then Lee Gilyoung and Jung
Heewon. Next was Jung Minseob and Lee Sungkook. One minute after the
dokkaebi flicked his finger, I was the only one remaining in
Gwanghwamun. The intermediate dokkaebi looked at me with a creepy
smile.

[Please keep this in mind. If this world is destroyed, it is all because of

you.] The moment I wanted to speak, there was a ringing sound.

My body shook and I was moved elsewhere. It was accompanied by severe
nausea and a headache. I lost consciousness because I had consumed a great
deal of energy.
[10,000 coins have been earned as settlement for the fourth scenario.]


I slept for quite a long time because I was tired from excessive contact with
the constellations.

I even dreamt. It was a dream from before the end began.

–Hey, aren't you awake?

The moment I heard the voice, I realized it was my high school days. They
were the days when I was beaten up by the school gangsters.

…Yes. There were times like this. It was a childish dream but I became
furious when I thought about it again.

–What? Why are you looking at me like that? Do you want to kill

someone? My head fell back from his slap.

Blood flowed from my cracked lips and my tingling cheeks caused a
feeling of shame.

Arms, legs, and shoulders. Pain came from all these places. It might be a
dream but it was more painful than reality. Maybe it was because there was
no Fourth Wall here.

–Why? If it is too much, stab me. Do you want to appear in the same
newspapers as your mother?

My clenched fists trembled but I couldn't hit him. At that time, what had I
been thinking?

'…If only I was Yoo Joonghyuk'.
Yes, that's right. This was what I thought in my misery. It was the time
when I was reading Ways of Survival.

I say the name on the uniform's name badge.

Song Minwoo.

What was he doing now? I remember that he had gone to university and
was working well. That was the first time I thought the world was unfair. I
didn't know if he was still alive.

[The exclusive skill, 'Fourth Wall' is activated!]

My dream collapsed and I was left in the dark again.

[Exclusive skill, Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint stage 3 has been

activated!] Voices started to overlap.

「 Hey, can you hear me? Are you okay? 」

「 Representative-nim? 」

「 Dokja-ssi, where are you? 」

They were the familiar voices of people I knew.

The words were conveyed through the 'third person perspective' of
Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint's third stage. I knew who the voices
belonged to without looking.

「 "Ah…why here? Dokja-ssi? Can you hear me?" 」

There was a bar with various types of wine. Jung Heewon was frowning
and sighing.
「 "A love letter… I will meet that ahjussi again… damn, why did I fall to
the school?" 」

Lee Jihye was touching her cheeks as if she had been hit by someone.

「 How come… why… here…? 」

Lee Hyunsung was trapped in a nearby military base.

…I could roughly guess what happened based on people's reactions.

The people in Gwanghwamun seemed to be moved to places they had an
association with. That's why Lee Jihye was at a school while Lee Hyunsung
was sent to a military base. Lee Hyunsung was the most pathetic one.

Maybe it was the damn intermediate dokkaebi's doing.

He created a situation where the incarnations were scattered all over the
place. No matter how irrelevant it was to the main scenario, the
intermediate dokkaebi would surely be reprimanded.

I looked at the confused people and muttered.

'I'm fine so take care of yourself. I will see you soon'.

They couldn't hear me but I hoped the words would reach them.

[Exclusive skill, Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint stage 3 has ended.]

I slowly returned to consciousness as my eyelids opened. Black clouds
were still swirling over Seoul like a black hole.

I got up and looked around. It was a panoramic view of Seoul. It was a
place where skyscrapers and high-rise buildings could be seen.

That reminded me, I should be moved to a place related to me. At first
glance, it looked like the rooftop of a high-rise building in Seoul…
"This place…?"

Damn, I thought it was possible but I really didn't want to come here.

[A few constellations are looking forward to the words you will say to
yourself.]

"…Mino Soft?"

This was the rooftop of the company I worked for, Mino Soft.

[A few constellations are disappointed.]

[Constellations who don't like to be rushed are pleased.]

When I saw the indirect messages that came to my mind, I felt that the
constellations focusing on me had expanded after I broke the Absolute
Throne.

[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' threatens the newly
appeared constellations.]

[The constellation 'Secretive Plotter' is coughing at the pretentious people.]

Why did I come here? A street in Seoul without any cars. The offices with
the lights turned off.

I felt nostalgia as I saw these familiar buildings. It was the first time I went
to work in a month.

I felt really weird when I remembered coming up to the rooftop with
Deputy Yoon after being scolded by Team Leader Han. When previously I
had been testing new games, now I was cutting people with a blade.

Was Deputy Yoon still alive?

I turned my head and saw messages flashing in the air.
[There are 10 days before the start of the fifth scenario.]

The scenarios were flowing as I expected. If the Absolute Throne was
destroyed, Seoul Dome would get a respite for 10 days.

The fifth scenario, the Great Hole.

During this grace period, I had to find a way to clear the fifth scenario
without the Absolute Throne.

[A sub scenario is in progress to supplement the interlude.]
  [Sub Scenario – Survival Activities]
  Category: Sub

  Difficulty: C+

  Clear Conditions: Survive for 10 days in the ruined city. You should
  eat three meals a day and get at least six hours of sleep a day. Don't
  forget to pay 500 coins per day before going to sleep every night.
  There will be a clear penalty if you violate any of these three rules.

  Duration: 10 days

  Compensation: None

  Failure: Death

  •   This is a scenario where a 'coin event' is applied.
  •   All monsters in the scenario have a certain probability of
      droppingcoins.


I roughly knew how things had gone. The existing scenario was completely
destroyed so they hastily put together a sub scenario.

Furthermore, it overlapped with a coin payment event. I thought they were
going to do it soon but I hadn't expected it to start already.

A survival fee of 500 coins a day… it was a scenario that couldn't be
cleared without a coin event.

Anyway, now I had to move. I couldn't miss out on the chance to replenish
my coins.
Then people's voices were heard from below the roof.

"Drag it! Quickly!"

I looked down and saw armed people entering the building, with others
behind them.

Mino Soft was located near Seocho-gu. But in my memories, there were no
'king' forces in the Seocho area.

…Then who were they? I carefully observed the armed people and realized
something.

Yes, they were the 'wanderers'. Each person had a different way of living in
this destroyed world.

Someone would become 'king' and others would become 'the people'.
Someone else would become a 'wanderer' without any affiliation.

And Seocho was the land of wanderers.

I turned on my smartphone to look up the information on this area.
Unfortunately, I was out of battery. I needed to find a place to recharge the
battery or find a spare battery…

I opened the roof door and went downstairs. I passed through the president's
office, the planning department and the finance department. I walked
through the office of the QA team that I had worked in for a while when I
stopped.

It was fair to say that my memory was quite good. I went into the office and
opened the drawers one by one.

It was because I thought a spare battery might be left behind. At that time,
someone entered with a flashlight.

I reflexively pulled out my sword but there was a strange noise.
"Eh?"

…?

"D-Dokja-ssi? It is Dokja-ssi!"

Then I saw the man's face. "Deputy

Yoon?"


"Ahh, you're alive! You are alive!"

It was Deputy Yoon of the QA team.




"It was really terrible."

I heard from Deputy Yoon about what happened at Mino Soft. To be exact,
it was what happened after I got off from work.

"The first scenario started for all the people on the night shift."

Deputy Yoon spoke while holding his nose.

The corridor of the company was filled with rotting body odor and
maggots. Some of the bodies had faces of people I knew but I didn't see any
mourning or sadness on Deputy Yoon's expression.

"Do you know? That guy over there, Team Manager Kim, I killed him.
Why, that bastard… I stabbed his neck with a ballpoint pen and blood… it
really was like a game."

"…Deputy Yoon."
"S-Sorry. Is it uncomfortable talking about this? Haha."

It was a natural change but I felt bitter seeing Deputy Yoon's changed
appearance. No… maybe this was what Director Yoon was like now.

"Are you alone here?"

"Huh? Ahh, I'm not alone. By the way, where was Dokja-ssi?"

"Ah, I…"

"I didn't see you in the company. What group are you affiliated with?
Where you somewhere else?"

"Yes, well… Something similar. I was originally on the Gwanghwamun
side of the bridge when…"

Deputy Yoon didn't listen to the end as he interrupted.

"Aha, I see. Dokja-ssi, you luck is really bad."

"…Huh?"

"There is no need to pass through all the scenarios. Don't you know? If you
hide well and use moderate tricks, most scenarios will be broken by other
people. There is no need to risk your life. Haha, it is very comfortable
despite the world being like this."

It was true. If you became a 'wanderer' who didn't belong to anyone, you
could get rid of some scenario that must be cleared and have the main
scenarios cleared by someone else. There were many such people in Seoul
Dome.

They problem was that if you lived in hiding and were caught by
surrounding groups, you would die. There was no prey as good as the
'wanderers' moving alone.
"You don't have to worry. Wanderers also have a lot of power. Is there a
need to be a king to build power?"

We exited Mino Soft. People were crowded around the company and there
were a bunch of wanderers gathered. Some of them were seen moving
kidnapped people. At this time, one armed man asked, "Yoon Sangho-ssi,
who is this?"

"Ah, he is one of my coworkers. We met by chance."

"Hrmm… a wanderer? No one from a group is accepted. Do you know?"
Deputy Yoon nodded lightly and the man passed by us. I looked at the man
and asked, "Who is this person?"

"The manager of a 'coin farm'."

"Coin farm?"

"Ah… Dokja-ssi doesn't know."

For a moment, a dismal expression appeared on Deputy Yoon's face.

Coin farm… that reminded me of something. But these guys already started
it?

"Look here."

There were two people trapped in cages placed at regular intervals, like it
was a zoo or police station. The wanderers around them screamed with
excitement.

"Hey! Are you kidding me? Fight harder! Who will give you coins if you
look like this?"

Inside the cage, two people were fighting each other. Blood splashed, eyes
were pulled out and a man with guts hanging out cried out like an animal.
[The constellation who likes the Colosseum is delighted.]

I looked closely and there were several such cages. Not all of the cages
contained fighting.

There was one cage with a naked woman and several men inside, while
another cage contained a lone woman, like the men had already finished
with her. I could hear pained moans and cries from all corners.

Outside the cages, the wanderers holding their penises were laughing.

"Hey, how are you? Good? Come out quickly!"

"Next is my turn you bastard!"

[The constellation who likes excitement is delighted.]

Deputy Yoon opened his mouth.

"In the game industry, consumers were the king. In Mino Soft, the president
was the king. Dokja-ssi, who is the king in this new world?"

"…Are you depending on the sponsorship of the constellations?"

"Yes. Sometimes there are crazy constellations like this. The more
stimulating the sight, the more coins they cough up. It's like Twitch bits.
We get coins from these people and in return, we provide them with food to
survive."

Deputy Yoon threw a chocolate bar into one cage. The woman behind bars
cried out and grabbed for it.

There were those in the world who first identified the system and figured
out how to exploit it. The 'coin farm' was the structure that those who first
understood the world devised in order to take advantage of the system.

"I see people from our company…"
"They were from our company."

I realized for certain after hearing his cold tone. The 'Deputy Yoon' that I
knew from Mino Soft, he didn't exist in this world anymore.

"Hey! There are new slaves! Imprison them!"

"Yes!"

The slaves were moved to the prisons. I was stunned to see a familiar face
among them.

Deputy Yoon smiled.

"Oh, there is a new one? Hey! Strip her and bring her to the cage!"

A petite person with white skin. Fine black hair that fell down to the
shoulders and slightly raised eyebrows.

I rubbed my eyes but there was no doubt. The First Apostle, Plagiarist Han
Sooyoung was here.
             Chapter 74: Ep. 15 – A Kingless World, IV


Han Sooyoung was thrown into a cage.

She was unconscious and probably lacking magic power after I took the
flag from her.

Han Sooyoung must've been moved to the area near here. She was a writer
so she might have a management or publishing company nearby.

"Aren't you quite good looking? Hey, you haven't touched her already have
you?"

"No. I know that the constellations are all gathered here."

[A constellation who likes obscenity is excited.]

[A few constellations have eyes that are shining in a lascivious manner.]
White underwear was revealed by Han Sooyoung's torn jeans. There were
men already playing rock paper scissors.

I stared at Han Sooyoung beyond the bars. No matter how I looked, there
were no signs that anything happened.

·····.

This woman would be a hindrance if she was left alive. She was the one
who knew the most about this world, apart from me.

The story had completely changed from the third or fourth regression from
the first quarter of the story and the knowledge she had might be obsolete,
but…

The moment I thought this, I shuddered with disgust at myself.

…Why was I worrying about this?

Killing someone because they would be dangerous in the future. Who
should I save because they would be useful in the future?

I wasn't Yoo Joonghyuk to be thinking about these things.

"Do you want to do it Dokja-ssi?"

Deputy Yoon laughed as he saw me staring intently. It was a expression
that said 'I can help you'.

"If you promise me one thing, I will let Dokja-ssi do her first. How about
it?"

"…What do you want me to promise?"

"You have a group, right? Please introduce me to Dokja-ssi's group. We
will soon start expanding our forces. Looking at Dokja-ssi's items… it is a
pretty big group?"
I stared at Deputy Yoon and said, "I can introduce you if you like. But I
want you to stop this."

"Huh? Haha, Dokja-ssi. What does that mean?"

"Let that woman go."

Deputy Yoon's eyebrows twitched because he knew it wasn't a joke.

"Hmm…Dokja-ssi. What is wrong with treating people like this? If you
have survived to this point, don't you already know?"

"…"

"I have been watching Dokja-ssi for a long time. I knew that if it was
Dokjassi, you could survive anywhere."

There was a strange ridicule in Deputy Yoon's expression.

"Aren't you always reading web novels alone? You always commute to
work in a gloomy fashion. Sometimes you would talk to me and a few other
colleagues. They were good people like Yoo Sangah-ssi."

"What does that have to do with this?"

"Dokja-ssi is enjoying the situation right now. Isn't that right?"

Enjoying it? It was like aiming a dagger at my heart from a completely
different angle.

Deputy Yoon grabbed my shoulders.

"I am also like Dokja-ssi. We are on the same QA team. I heard the same
nagging every time and lived with their contempt. Do you remember what
the other departments called us? The training dummy team. We are cheap
people who don't have any specs. We just test games."
"…"

"Dokja-ssi. Those people who are trapped right now, don't you know who
they really are? Look carefully. They are the scum who ignored us."

My vision broadened and the screams of people could be heard. Looking
closer, I did recognize them.

Many of the people trapped behind bars were those I knew from Mino Soft.
There were people I didn't know very well, people who didn't know me or
who didn't care.

"It is over now. The finance team, the planning team, none of that matters.
The best ones in the world right now are our QA team. Haha. Dokja-ssi,
shouldn't you know from testing bugs? This world is a game. A game with
bugs. There are too many loopholes that I can take advantage of."
Numerous messages from constellations were heard in my head.

The messages that wanted a more stimulating, more lascivious, more
decadent story quietly overlapped with Deputy Yoon's face.

Sometimes inferiority turned people into monsters.

"There is nothing to be afraid of. This world is a game that exists for us! Do
you know how many coins my group earns a day with this?"

"I don't know."

"It is 5,000 coins a day. 5,000 coins… can you imagine? We don't do the
scenarios and we get 5,000 coins. It is 5,000 coins just from making people
fight and mate. It is the same as the planning team taking cash items. Don't
you know what this means?"

I saw men approaching Han Sooyoung one by one. I slowly breathed out.
So far, I showed courtesy to the colleague who once shared a rooftop with
me by listening to his story.
I removed Deputy Yoon's hand from my shoulder and opened my mouth.
"If you want to make coins, there is a better way."

"What?" Deputy Yoon turned red. "Did Dokja-ssi also find a bug? What is
it?"

"The principle is the same as a coin farm. Stimulate the constellations."

"Oho, there is something more stimulating than this? Is that possible?"

"Yes, it is. Would you like me to let you know?"

"It would be good if you share the know-how!"

"The constellations really like…'

[Blade of Faith is activated!]

"…This."

There was the sound of the bars being cut apart. I swung my blade
indiscriminately towards the wanderers surrounding the cage. I cut the
Achilles tendon of those running away.

The knees of those who weren't prepared for resistance became twisted.

"Aaaaack! What is with this bastard?"

"My leg! My leg!"

I kept swinging my sword amidst the rising blood.

"Something like this."

I cut off the hands harassing a member of the human resources department
then the arms of a man trying to take off Han Sooyoung's shirt.
"This is also good."

Blood splattered onto my cheek. I quietly wiped the blood and continued
cutting at arms and legs. Then Deputy Yoon's voice was heard.

"W-What are you doing? What is this?"

"Thank you for the story."

I turned to look at Deputy Yoon.

"I created a situation that the constellations really like because of you."
With just two knives, none of the men who entered Han Sooyoung's cage
could do anything against me.

[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' is pleased with your
judgment.]

[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' is snorting from the
relentless punishment.]

[Many of the constellations who dislike the atrocities of some constellations
are greatly satisfied with your judgment.]

[8,000 coins have been sponsored.]

Deputy Yoon turned white and flopped to the ground.

I laughed at him.

"Why bother creating something like the coin farm? It is easy to earn
money."

"…Y-You son of a bitch!"

There was a large number of wanderers. In an instant, approximately 20
wanderers surrounded me.
It was an ambiguous number that might make me violate the principle of
'no killing' but I wasn't overly concerned. I just had to get out of here.

I retreated a bit while hugging Han Sooyoung's light body. Suddenly, her
eyes flashed open and she asked, "…Why did you save me?"

"Were you awake? Then get up."

Han Sooyoung's voice was weak.

"If you save me, won't the constellations in your channel run away? Don't
you know what the constellation's hate most?"

"There are some who like it."

[The constellation who has been waiting for a harem carefully puts both
hands together.]

[The constellation who likes 'enemies turning into allies' is delighted.]

Han Sooyoung frowned.

"Now this is a cliche. Right? The moment that the woman is about to be
raped, the hero will rescue her. Why are you acting like this despite saying
that you dislike cliches?"

"You are mistaken about two things."

I started while lightly cutting a wanderer's legs.

"One, I'm not a hero. And two…"

[You have saved a life.]

[Your karma points have increased by one.]

[Current karma points: 14/100]
Karma points were gained when the system determined that a person had
been 'saved'. In other words, if I left it alone, it was likely Han Sooyoung
would've died.

"You're not a woman."

"…Put me down!"

I threw her to the ground without hesitation.

Han Sooyoung shouted, "You really put me down?"

"You fight as well."

"What?"

"We will fight together. Don't you like cliches?"

"No matter how much I like cliches, isn't it really cliche to fight on the
same side as an enemy?"

She grumbled but we were quite well matched. I cut the legs of the
approaching wanderers while Han Sooyoung followed me and stopped their
breathing. We took their lives slowly and carefully until only a few
survivors were left.

The terrified wanderers started to flee the coin farm.

"This is a complete profit."

I looked at the coins that I got from the wanderers while Han Sooyoung
staggered with a smile.

[You have acquired 18,400 coins.]
Her contribution wasn't as high as mine but she would've got a decent
amount of coins. I didn't get as much coins as I would've without Han
Sooyoung present but I decided to think of it as a tip.

I looked in front to where Deputy Yoon was still sitting on the ground.

"Haha… psychopath. I thought you would be like this. I should've known
when I heard the rumour…'

"Sick jerk. You are too talkative."

Han Sooyoung stabbed Deputy Yoon in the neck. Blood spurted from
Deputy Yoon's neck and the light in his eyes died.

Another person who remembered Kim Dokja in reality disappeared.

Han Sooyoung saw me watching and grumbled. "…What is with your
expression? Are you sorry that this jerk is dead?"

"No."

"Then why did you keep listening to him?"

I was a bit surprised because I didn't expect these words to emerge from
Han Sooyoung's mouth.

"You were just listening to this guy's bullshit. Why? The constellations
don't like frustrating things."

I listened blankly to her words before smiling.

What was this?

"You don't seem to know but it is better to listen to this bullshit moderately
in order to get more coins when they are killed. There is no refreshing
feeling without being frustrated first."
"No? Dokja… no, don't the constellations prefer to kill right away? What
do you know when you aren't a writer?"

"I know very well. I am a reader."

"This…!"

I ignored Han Sooyoung and rummaged through the items that had
dropped. Most of it was garbage but there was a suit that I could wear.

[Old Gentleman's Close Combat Suit]

It was a B-grade item and only slightly improved defense but it was better
than not wearing it. I couldn't wear Samyeongdang's Mat forever… come to
think of it, I should start item farming.

The fleeing wanderers seemed to be heading to their lair. It would be better
to pursue and hit the wanderers.

If I remembered currently, Seocho had a few 'meteorite stones' to use in the
fifth scenario. If it fell here then I had to obtain it.

Once I got a secondary battery…

[You have saved a life.]

[Your karma points have increased by one.]

[Current karma points: 25/100]

One or two people approached. They were all those who had been stuck
behind bars.

Colour returned to the faces of some people who remembered my face.

I raised my hand before they could speak.
"I can't help you now. Take care of your own lives."

Faint despair filled their eyes but it wasn't a situation where I could help. It
seemed cold but in the end, I had saved their lives.

"Pick up the items in moderation and then go to Chungmuro if you can
afford it. There might be some people who can help you there."

Before I finished speaking, people started picking up the items that had
fallen. Their eyes were blazing again as they hoped for survival.

Watching them, I understood why the dokkaebi brought me here.

"That is mine! Put it down!"

"I-I saw it first!"

The people who were victims were now looking at each other while holding
weapons. They pointed the weapons at each other without hesitation.

This was a kingless world.

There was no one to control this world.

The dokkaebi was trying to show me this sight.

A world without a king was wild, without the laws and ethics that we had
been guarding, showing how poor our belief in other humans was.

An unexpected voice stopped those who were about to wield their weapons.

"Do all of you want to die?"
             Chapter 75: Ep. 15 – A Kingless World, V


The frightened people looked at Han Sooyoung at the same time.

Han Sooyoung squatted down and spat out.

"Are you all idiots? Wake up. Think properly if you want to live. You don't
know when you will meet other bad people yet you want to cut down the
number of people who can be colleagues?"

"T-That…"

"In this world, the underdogs have to be united. You want to fight over a
few garbage items instead of combining forces?"

The people suddenly came to their senses and reddened.

The intermediate dokkaebi probably didn't know that among the people he
scattered, one of them was a web novelist.
"Don't you have the necessary weapons and supplies? Can't you survive?
Don't you know that the selfish ones are the first to fall? Do you think you
can get stronger just by picking up a few more trash items?"

The complexions of the survivors darkened. Their bloodthirstiness slowly
subsided.

"If you can't become strong enough so that no one can touch you, make
trusted colleagues. Isn't that common sense?"

It was natural for a plagiarist to say such things.

In fact, her words were effective. People started to look awkwardly at one
another. If someone opened their mouths at this moment, the people could
unite. A few words caused their survival rate to rise sharply.

I stared at Han Sooyoung and opened my mouth. "But for you to say
this…"

"Do you understand. Everyone should act correctly!" Han Sooyoung said
quickly before turning and running away. Her stamina was low so she
couldn't run far. "Pant, pant! Why are you chasing me?"

"You even plagiarized the words of the novel?"

「 "If you can't become strong enough so that no one can touch you, make
trusted colleagues." 」

This was the advice that Yoo Joonghyuk gave to survivors in Ways of
Survival. Han Sooyoung shouted, "How is it plagiarism? These lines are
from my novel!"

"Then why are you running away?"

"…No reason! Why are you chasing me?"
She refused to admit that she plagiarized to the end. I grabbed her collar.

"I saved you so you should pay back the value."

"What value?"

I laughed at Han Sooyoung's nervous expression.

"If you have a spare battery, take it out. You must need it for your novel
text."

Han Sooyoung's expression distorted.




I hadn't intended to take Han Sooyoung with me at first.

To be honest, Han Sooyoung was a bad person considering what she had
don so far. However, her 'avatar' ability was quite useful and I had a few
things to figure out. Most of all, she would be useful to clear the current sub
scenario…

"I don't have a spare battery. I lost everything in Gwanghwamun."

"Then give me your novel."

"No. Pay for it if you want to read it."

"How am I supposed to pay when all the platforms are gone?"

I took her smartphone away from her. The upset Han Sooyoung clung to
my shoulders and reached out an arm.

"What? Give it to me!"
The text version was on her desktop. She was relaxed.

[SSSSS-grade Infinite Regressor]

Let's see…

I nervously clicked on the app file. I wondered if her text version would be
invisible to everyone else like mine.

However, that wasn't the case. A page in the middle of the book appeared,
like I had been reading the novel.

「 …Yoo Joonhyun quietly opened his status window. He wanted to check
the Sage's Eye that he just received.

Yoo Joonhyun laughed as he confirmed his status window.

"Huhu, I finally got Sage's Eye. I am lucky this regression." 」

I read up to there and looked at the frozen Han Sooyoung.

"Don't you have a conscience?"

"…What?"

"Didn't you copy the personal information from Ways of Survival? As a
writer, shouldn't you change the composition?"

Han Sooyoung hesitated for a moment before muttering, "Ways of Survival
is a sponsor and mine is a star contract. It is completely different. And there
is no comprehensive evaluation in my novel!"

"…Even so. Isn't the name of the protagonist too much? It is like Joonhyun
was a typo. Shouldn't you change it more? The author of Ways of Survival
would cry if he saw this."

Han Sooyoung's face turned red and she screamed, "It is just… no, so
what?
What are you curious about?"

"How many chapters of the original did you read?"

"99…hey! Can't you give that back to me?"

She read up to chapter 99?

What would the author think if he knew that the person who read Ways of
Survival the most after me was a plagiarist?

Well, he was the one pleased by the views raised during the plagiarism
controversy so he might say, "Thank you for reading up to chapter 99. You
are a true reader."
I sighed and asked, "Chapter 99, then do you know the location of the
meteorite in the fifth scenario?

Didn't it appear in your novel?"

"There is no such thing as a meteorite in my novel!" It was surprising.
I thought she would've copied this as well. "I have a sealing stone!"
As expected.

"Then I am going to get the sealing stone, so be prepared."

"You are going to get the meteorite?"

"Let's unify the terms. Anyway, you know that I saved you?"

"I didn't ask you…"

The meteorite containing the fire dragon was found by Han Sooyoung. I
almost died because of this woman. That reminded me, I put the carcass of
the fire dragon on the Exchange. Had it been sold yet?

I ignored Han Sooyoung for a bit and called out to Bihyung.

'Bihyung'.

There was no answer.

The existing scenarios completely disappeared in an unexpected way.
Perhaps the dokkaebis of the Seoul Dome were in a meeting right now.

They might be saying something like, "This edition is ruined anyway so sell
a lot of coin products…"

The next moment, the 'Exchange' window and 'Dokkaebi Bag' window
opened at the same time.
This brat, he didn't have time to send a message?

[Many constellations are dissatisfied with the sudden advertisements.]

Furthermore, he didn't forget to play the advertisements. I opened up the
sales history on the Exchange first.

[The item 'Fire Dragon's Scales' has been sold for 8,000 coins.]

[The item 'Fire Dragon's Bones' has been sold for 5,000 coins.]

Unexpectedly, there was someone who bought these expensive items.

The items that weren't meant for sale were also sold.

[The item 'Fire Dragon's Bones' has been sold for 22,222 coins.]

…The items that I had stored on the Exchange were sold. Someone must be
desperate for the fire dragon's bones. If I knew this, I would've set the price
as 99,999.

The incarnations that possessed such power at present were Anna Croft,
Ranveer Khan of India and China's Feihu… in any case, that person was
ignorant.

I opened the Dokkaebi Bag and bought some items that I needed. Then Han
Sooyoung spoke to me in a timely manner.

"Why do you want me to go with you? You can go alone."

"It is like what you just said. The most important thing for survival is to
obtain reliable colleagues."

Han Sooyoung looked at me suspiciously.

"Hrmm…"
I pulled out an item I just bought.

"Now, swear here."

[The item Temporary Pledge has been used.]
  [Temporary Pledge]

  1.   Kim Dokja (Gab) will sign a contract with Han Sooyoung (Eul)
       untilthe sub scenario currently in progress is over.

  2.   Kim Dokja (Gap) and Han Sooyoung (Eul) will not harm each
       otheruntil the sub scenario currently in progress is over.

  3.   During the contract period, Kim Dokja (Gap) and Han Sooyoung
       (Eul) will sleep alternately in prepared for the 'sleeping penalty'.

       ·····

  6.   During the contract period, the guidelines for the party will
       prevailover Kim Dokja's (Gap) opinions.

  7.   During the contract period, Han Sooyoung (Eul) will cooperate
       withKim Dokja (Gap) to clear the scenarios. She will follow Kim
       Dokja's orders as long as her life isn't in danger.

  8.   During the contract period, Kim Dokja (Gap) will protect
       HanSooyoung (Eul).

  9.   This contract will expire at the end of the sub scenario. The body
       willbe destroyed if the contract is violated.


Temporary Pledge. It didn't have the effect of a sponsor contract but it was
effective for short-term contracts.

Han Sooyoung looked at me with surprised eyes.

"Do you think I will sign this?"
"Then don't."

"…Why should I sign it? I have never done it before."

"Good. The first experience is important."

Han Sooyoung gritted her teeth. Even so, I knew she would accept. There
was no other choice for a person with exhausted magic power. It was
suicide to wander alone in Seocho-gu and she needed someone to protect
her for a bit.

"…Okay. I accept. But I have one condition."

"What is it?"

"We will share information with each other. How about it? I have a lot to
ask you. You should answer honestly. I have Lie Detection."

She already got something that I couldn't obtain?

[The character 'Han Sooyoung' has used 'Lie Detection Lv. 1'.]

…It was real.

Han Sooyoung got to the point. "What is your attribute?"

"I don't know."

[The character Han Sooyoung has confirmed that your words are true.]

Han Sooyoung made a stupid expression and raised a hand to her temple.

"…Is this broken?"

"No, it is normal. Then ask me the next question quickly. I will only answer
three. For your reference, you have already used one."
"No, what do you mean that you don't know your attribute?"

"I really don't know. Now, what is the next question?"

Han Sooyoung's eyes narrowed and she reluctantly continued to
ask questions. "Why did you give up the Absolute Throne?" I
figured that this question would emerge.

"My plan was ruined because of you. If it wasn't for you… do you know
how hard I prepared those apostles only for them to be eliminated? If I was
sitting on the throne, I would've been prepared for the next scenario by
now…"

"If you sat on the throne, Seoul would've perished."

[The character Han Sooyoung has confirmed that your words are true.]

Han Sooyoung frowned. "Why does the skill keep breaking?"

"It isn't broken. We would've been ruined if anyone, not just you or me, sat
on the throne."

[The character Han Sooyoung has confirmed that your words are true.]

Han Sooyoung's eyes widened.

"How do you know? Where did you get off? Why do you know this when I
don't?"

"I'm not someone who got off."

[The character Han Sooyoung has confirmed that your words are true.]

Han Sooyoung was extremely shocked and managed to squeeze out a
question after a moment.
"You…how far did you read in Ways of Survival?"

"Your three questions are over."

"This is the most important question!" Han Sooyoung's chin trembled. "No
way… right? You… there can't be such a crazy guy… yes, it is unlikely…"
Da da da da!

Then something that sounded like horse hooves were hard in the distance.

I told the muttering Han Sooyoung to be silent and we quickly fled to the
rear of a nearby building. Something was approaching.

It was in the form of a human…? I used Character List on the people
rushing towards me in the cloud of dust.

[The information of this person can't be read in 'Character List'.]

[This person isn't registered in 'Character List'.]

Looking closely, I could see that all the people running had fur sprouting
from their whole body.

Their faces were human but their bodies were monster-like and twice as big
as a human. They seemed like bipedal wolves.

Looking closely, one monster in the lead was holding a man by the neck.
It was the biggest of the monsters. Grrr… "Where is he?"

"T-This area! The coin farm…"

There was a sound and the man's head was blown away. He was one of the
wanderers who had been in front of Mino Soft. The monsters rushed
eagerly and started eating the man's body.

I think I knew what these monsters were.
Han Sooyoung realized something and muttered, "…The outside species?"

Wanderers had their own ways of survival. There were those who still
existed as humans and made coin farms, while others gave up on being
human and walked the path of a new species.

The outside species had limits but because they gave up on their humanity,
they could grow faster than others in the beginning to mid part of the story.

Maybe these guys were the werewolves…

"…They gained the power of the meteorite."

Right now, it was only the fifth scenario. At the current time, the only way
people could evolve into werewolves was by using the power of the
meteorite. The wanderers had already got their hands on the meteorite that
fell in Seochu-gu.

Han Sooyoung opened her mouth. "I know him. That bastard, he is
someone who stopped reading."

"…How do you know?"

"I can see it. It is the privilege as the last person who got off the novel."

"Privilege?"

"I can read the information and attributes of those who stopped reading."
She spoke in a slightly boasting tone.

Speaking of which, I remembered a story that I heard from Jung Minseob.

Shortly after the scenarios began, the First Apostle came to them. This
would be explained if Han Sooyoung had the ability to find those who
stopped reading. Then she used her Avatar ability to appear before them.

Han Sooyoung kept speaking.
"That's why I doubted your identity. A guy who can't be read by my

skill…" Han Sooyoung stared at me before looking back at the outside

species.

"At that time, there were a few people who refused my offer. That wanderer
was one of them. I thought it wasn't a big deal since most of them would die
early…"

"Who is that guy?"

"He is Song Minwoo."

Song Minwoo? It definitely wasn't the name of a character. Yet I had heard
the name somewhere…

[The 6th grade outside species 'Werewolf Song Minwoo' is searching the
surroundings.]

I could see the face of the person in the distance. Ah…perhaps.

A recent memory came to mind. It was the dream I had a few hours ago. I
remembered my days in high school and the gangsters who bullied me.
Many years had passed but his facial expression seemed to fit. No matter
how much time passed, I couldn't forget that name on the name badge.

Song Minwoo… it must be him. But that bastard was someone 'who got
off?' That gangster read a novel?

"Where did he get off?"

"That guy… he was a bit strange. He is a bit different from the usual
readers."

"What is it?"
Han Sooyoung worried for a moment before saying,

"In my eyes, he… 'partially got off at 173'."

At this moment, Song Minwoo sniffed and he turned his head this way. His
yellow eyes seemed to be saying, 'I found you'.

He fell to the ground on all fours and started rushing to this side.
            Chapter 76: Ep. 15 – A Kingless World, VI


By the time I realized, Song Minwoo was immediately in front of me. It
was a tremendous speed. His agility must be at least above level 40 in order
to achieve this speed.

"You?" He asked in a tearful voice. This guy had already finished his
transition to an outside species.

[The 6th grade outside species, Song Minwoo has triggered 'A Predator's
Threat Lv. 5!']

[The character 'Han Sooyoung' has used 'Mental Barrier Lv. 3'.]

[The character 'Han Sooyoung' has alleviated some of the effects of A
Predator's Threat.]

In a moment, his hand shot out and grabbed Han Sooyoung's throat.

"Keok…"
Han Sooyoung might not be in a perfect physical condition but it was too
much for her to be suppressed at once.

The 6th grade outside species. It was the worst enemy to deal with right
now.

It was different compared to the 5th grade fire dragon. At that time, my ice
attribute overwhelmed the fire attribute and I could take advantage of the
dull movements of the big monster.

But now…

Song Minwoo stared at me. "Did you break my coin farm?"

The tone was certain despite it being a question. Han Sooyoung screamed
the moment she saw Song Minwoo's white fangs. "Shit, kill him quickly!"

I used Blade of Faith while Han Sooyoung used Avatar. At almost the same
time, Song Minwoo's powerful kick arrived. The just created Avatar's head
burst while I went flying through the air.

[The 6th grade outside species, Song Minwoo has triggered 'Accelerate Lv.
5!']

Song Minwoo's fist followed at a speed that was almost invisible. Head,
shoulders, belly. The onslaught poured out towards those areas. Air burst
out from me.

Han Sooyoung's voice cried out, "Kim Dokja!"

…No, even if this was an outside species, how could he be so strong? It
was too late to avoid the blow. I hurriedly raised my overall stats.

[16,000 coins have been invested in physique.]

[Physique Lv. 24 -> Physique Lv. 50]
[A giant-like physical fitness fills your body.]

The pain quickly dwindled and it reached the point where I could tolerate it.
But the situation wasn't over.

"Kim Dokja? Where did I hear that name?" I heard Song Minwoo
mumbling.

I could see this face through my defenses and that was the problem. This
guy wasn't strong. The problem was me.

[The effect of A Predator's Threat has reduced your will to fight.]

[A Predator's Threat has slowed down your movements.]

It was ridiculous. I overcame the threat of the 5th grade fire dragon only to
be affected by this guy?

It was impossible. I had the Fourth Wall…

[The exclusive skill, 'Fourth Wall' is shaking.]

This situation had happened once before.

It happened when I fought Yoo Joonghyuk in the Theatre Dungeon and
when I was immersed in Yoo Joonghyuk's first person view… but now Yoo
Joonghyuk wasn't here. So why?

Song Minwoo roared and raised his claws. "…Kinda familiar. Do I know
you?"

–Hey, Kim Dokja. What is this?

A familiar voice overlapped with the same voice.

[The exclusive skill, 'Fourth Wall' is shaking.]
I grabbed his wrist and answered, "I don't know."

"Really? I think I remember."

–Stop reading and go and get me some bread. Yes?

[The 6th grade outside species, Song Minwoo has triggered 'Memory
Enhancement Lv. 3!']

"I know you."

[The exclusive skill, 'Fourth Wall' is shaking.]

…Dammit. I see. Now I knew what the Fourth Wall skill was.

There was a smile on Song Minwoo's face. "Strange. How does a geek like
you survive up to this point? You were reading a novel every day."

"…"

"Haha, you are that person. Aren't you the guy who was beaten up by me
while reading a novel in your spare time? Don't you remember?"

I remembered. Of course I remembered. A late rage filled my head.

"You are Song Minwoo. You should remember the face of your old school
friend right? It is good. I was wondering if you were still alive."

When I was 17, I used to think that if I had the strength, I would tear apart
this guy in front of me.

Song Minwoo kept talking. "The novel you were reading at that time.
Where can I see it?"

The moment I heard this, a scene came to my mind. I had been sitting in my
seat and scrolling through the novel when he hit me.
…Perhaps?

–This otaku, you are reading this? Is this fun? It is laughable.

Of course, the novel I was reading at that time…

Song Minwoo's fist struck my abdomen and my body flew through the air.
The moment I slammed into the outer wall of a building, Han Sooyoung's
avatars attacked Song Minwoo. The exterior wall of the destroyed building
fell on me.

[The exclusive skill, 'Fourth Wall' is shaking.]

The Fourth Wall. It was an exclusive skill that I had from the beginning. I
still didn't know all the functions of this skill but I was confident of at least
one thing.

This skill made me recognize this world as a 'novel'.

In fact, I often felt strange. I made judgments and did actions that weren't
possible in reality. It was like I was calmly watching this world from the
outside.

It was due to the Fourth Wall.

"Shit… What are you doing?"

An angry voice was heard. As I cleared away the pile of stones, the angry
Han Sooyoung blocked my way.

Her dozens of avatars were dealing with Song Minwoo and the werewolves
in the corridors of the building. Blood was flowing from Han Sooyoung's
nose and her blood vessels popped out as she struggled.

It was because Han Sooyoung was squeezing out every drop of her already
low magic power to exert this strength.
"I believed in you but what are you doing now?"

I slowly raised myself while feeling a sharp pain in my bones. This was
truly real pain. I had forgotten since the Fourth Wall acted as a cushion for
this pain.

[Many constellations are confused by the unexpected development.]

I endured the pain and stood up, shaking off the dust. "This is an awakening
event."

"…What?"

"Where is the fun in easily winning all the time? Sometimes I should go
through adversity.

"Oh, is that why you are so beaten up?"

"I was just thinking for a while."

[Many constellations are relieved.]

The Fourth Wall was a skill that made reality like a novel. Then it was
obvious why the wall was shaking. It was because I currently regarded
Song Minwoo as 'reality'. He was the asshole who beat me up and made my
teen years a tragedy.

"…Do you know that bastard?" She was a writer and a really quick female.
I stared at her and the hesitating Han Sooyoung hurriedly added. "I'm sorry.
I didn't want to hear it but the words he said to you…"

I replied honestly to the person who had Lie Detection. "Yes, I know him."

"I can roughly guess…"

"That bastard. He is obviously a trauma."
"…Where is the obvious trauma? A trauma is serious."

Han Sooyoung stated as she spat out blood.

"Then what is the problem? Han Sooyoung, you can help me awaken. If
you tell me a few words from Ways of Survival, won't I awaken?"

"Do you think I'm Lee Hyunsung?"

In the end, I had to solve this problem myself. I would have a hard time
going forward if the Fourth Wall shook every time I met a person who
stimulated my traumas.

Above all, I was 28 years old right now. I wasn't a 17 year old who was
flustered by a bully.

[A constellation who likes revenge has revealed his own modifier.]

[The constellation 'One who Overcomes the Late Trials' is cheering for
you.]

[Some constellations are in agreement.]

[A bounty scenario has occurred!]
  [Bounty Scenario – Overcoming Trauma

  Category: Sub

  Difficulty: C

  Clear Conditions: Some constellations, such as One who Overcomes the
  Late Trials has commissioned a bounty scenario for you. Overcome
  your trauma within the time limit and get rid of the specter of the past.

  Time Limit: 1 hour

  Compensation: ???

  Failure: The contempt of One who Overcomes the Late Trials.



One who Overcomes the Late Trials was a constellation I had seen in Ways
of Survival.

As far as I knew, this guy was a constellation of a different world… well,
more of these constellations would start emerging in the fifth scenario.

In any case, this was a blessing in disguise. I threw Samyeongdang's Straw
Mat to Han Sooyoung.

"Wipe up your nosebleed and stay back."

"What?"

"It is enough."

I jumped over Han Sooyoung's avatars towards the group of werewolves.

[6,000 coins have been invested in agility.]
[Agility Lv. 30 -> Agility Lv. 40]

[An amazing wind lies in your body.]

[15,500 coins have been invested in strength.]

[Strength Lv. 25 -> Strength Lv. 50]

[Your muscles are squirming like they are monsters.]

I should've done this sooner. I had been too wary since being hit by the
'possibilities storm' not long ago.

[The special option of Unbroken Faith is activated.]

[The ether property is converted to 'divine'.]

There was no reason for me to lose this fight. I just had a momentary lapse
in judgment from the Fourth Wall shaking. If I thought about it, I had the
means to overpower these guys. In fact, I had many methods.

The werewolves collapsed before my blade. Werewolves had the dark
attribute, making them vulnerable to the divine attribute.

Moreover, I didn't need to worry about the 'no killing' penalty with them.
As I said, they were an outside species, not human. They weren't my kind
any more.

I found Song Minwoo's face among the werewolves. His eyes slowly grew
larger while Han Sooyoung's voice was heard behind me.

"Hey! Is it okay?"

I didn't answer. In fact, this situation was almost exactly the same.

[The exclusive skill, 'Fourth Wall' is shaking!]
However, it would turn out differently from earlier.

"It's okay. My awakening event is over."

I ran straight towards Song Minwoo.

Grrrrr!

A few thoughts passed through my head. If I used Ganpyeongui and called
the 'Hunter of the Hexagram', this game would end easily. But I wouldn't
overcome my trauma by fighting like that.

This time, I had to fight with my own capabilities.

[The 6th grade outside species, Song Minwoo has triggered 'Accelerate Lv.
5!']

Song Minwoo's body moved at great speed after Acceleration was
triggered. He already had level 40 agility and now his speed was increased
with the effect of Acceleration Lv. 5.

I didn't have any footwork skills so I was forced to use a shortcut.

[7,000 coins have been invested in agility.]

[Agility Lv. 40 -> Agility Lv. 50]

[An amazing storm lies in your body.]

If I didn't have skills, I could use stats. I lightly dodged the flying claws and
raised my blade.

"Kuaaaak!"

His arm flew through the air and I cut off his other arm. The confused Song
Minwoo lost his balance. I didn't miss this opening and cut off his legs.
Song Minwoo roared as his limbs were severed in an instant. Along with
the roar, his severed limbs were growing back.

This was the privilege of a werewolf's 'Physical Regeneration'. However,
normally the speed was lower… this bastard, did he receive a 'protection'?

Yes… this was better.

[The constellation 'One who Overcomes the Late Trials' is focused on your
actions.]

The goal of the bounty scenario was to overcome the trauma. The
constellation wouldn't be satisfied with an easy kill. I turned off the blade
and used my fists instead.

[8,000 coins have been invested in strength.]

[Strength Lv. 50 -> Strength Lv. 60]

[Your power has started to attract the attention of the giants.]

[Your total stats have almost reached the limit of this

scenario.] I grabbed Song Minwoo's neck.

[The exclusive skill, 'Fourth Wall' is shaking.]

Whenever I looked at this guy's face, I felt the '17 year old Kim Dokja'
inside me shrink back.

Poor thing. From now on, I would get revenge for 'him'.

"Minwoo, I didn't greet your properly earlier."

"What…?"

"It is nice to see you."
I hit him in the stomach.

"Kuheeok!"

"By the way, I was in pain a lot back then."

The 17 year old Kim Dokja was watching me in my memories. Feel free to
watch.

"If you have a conscience, shouldn't you apologize first?"

I held him with one hand and continued to punch. The chest, the stomach
and the face.

"What is wrong with reading a novel? Eh? Did I harm you?" On behalf of
the 17 year old Kim Dokja, I hit him again and again. "Bastard, I even used
some money to buy the books."

His teeth were broken, his chest muscles damaged and his bones shattered.
The nearby werewolves growled at the assault but couldn't come close. I
was giving out a Predator's Threat despite not using any skill.

Real fear came from a strength that was on a different dimension. 10
minutes passed before Song Minwoo started begging.

Grrr! "S-Sorry, I'm sorry…!"

"Really? You're sorry?"

"Yes! I'm really really sorry! I-I was young at the time…"

Of course he was. I knew. That degree of malice was understandable in his
immature days. But.

"You must be mistaken… I wasn't trying to get an apology." This was
something that couldn't be understood or forgiven. "In the first place, I'm
not the one you should apologize to."
"What does that…"

"First, I will hit you until all my trauma has disappeared.

I watched the collapsed Song Minwoo and thought of my teen years. I was
helpless, weak and only knew novels.

In fact, Han Sooyoung was right. There was no obvious trauma in this
world.

All trauma was severe for the person involved so I didn't think these actions
would completely eliminate my trauma.

I would often have nightmares as the 17 year old Kim Dokja repeated the
tragedy of that time.

Still, this might be a bit comforting. Just like when I read Ways of Survival
back then.

The 28 year old Kim Dokja might be able to help the 17 year old Kim
Dokja escape from the nightmare for a short time.

"Keok! Cough! S-Stop… stop…"

Just like 'Yoo Joonghyuk' was to me in those days.

"Keoook…"

How long did I hit him? Finally, there was a moment when I looked at
Song Minwoo's face and felt nothing.

[The exclusive skill, 'Fourth Wall's' shaking has subsided.]

[You have met the conditions to clear the bounty scenario!]
             Chapter 77: Ep. 16 – The Fifth Scenario, I


Song Minwoo's blood dripped onto the ground.

The feeling of my blood-soaked fist was dull. Song Minwoo was bleeding
but he didn't open his eyes or talk. The shattered flesh seemed to have given
up on restoration.

Han Sooyoung muttered, "A scary guy… you killed a werewolf with bare
hands?"

The other werewolves had already run away or were taken care of by Han
Sooyoung. I looked down at Song Minwoo and said,

"He hasn't died yet."

Now the Fourth Wall didn't shake when I looked at him. I didn't know if the
trauma was resolved but I could resist it more than in the past.
[The constellation 'One who Overcomes the Late Trials' sends
encouragement to you.]

[The constellation 'One who Overcomes the Late Trials' wants to give you
his own stigma.]

Giving me a stigma? Really? The bounty scenario wasn't a single
constellation request so it was surprising to give a stigma as a reward.

Of course, I appreciated it.

[The stigma Self-rationalization has been acquired.]

[The constellation 'One who Overcomes the Late Trials' smiles with
satisfaction at you who has succeeded his stigma.]

[You will now have a defense mechanism that won't be bothered by any
trauma.]

Thanks… I stared absentmindedly for a bit.

[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' is grabbing his belly
and laughing.]

Self-rationalization? What did this mean? Are you kidding me?

Han Sooyoung asked, "Hey, aren't you going to kill him?"

"Eh?"

"I'm talking about that."

I looked down at Song Minwoo in my hands. Should I kill him? There was
no burden since he was an outside species.

[The backer of Song Minwoo is looking at you.]
The constellations of Bihyung's channel would like it if I killed him.

[Many constellations desire your revenge.]

I looked at Song Mingwoo for a while before putting him down.

"Let's go."

"What? Really?"

"Yes."

[Some constellations are disappointed with your hypocrisy.]

[Many constellations are questioning your judgment.]

[The constellation 'Secretive Plotter' is watching your judgment.]

"You really won't kill him? Won't this bastard have coins?"

"Yes."

"Then can I kill him?"

"Go ahead. But won't you regret it?"

"Regret?"

I shrugged and walked towards her.

To be exact, it was in the direction that the werewolf group had run away.
Perhaps their origin would be at the end of this direction. If my guess was
right, the meteorite was what helped transform them into werewolves. The
meteorites must be collected to prepare for the disaster scenario.

Han Sooyoung looked after me with a suspicious expression.
All of a sudden, the sound of footsteps died up and headed in another
direction. It was in the exact direction of Song Minwoo.

Her avatar…

Yes. I thought Han Sooyoung would do this. I let her do what she want. In
return, she would turn a blind eye to my hypocrisy.

Then after a while.

"Shit! What is this?"

Han Sooyoung gave a terrible scream and shook. I could tell the messages
that were appearing in her head. Perhaps they would be messages like this:

[The 6th grade outside species 'Song Minwoo' has been killed and the
demon king 'Andras' has noticed the murderer's presence.

[The demon king 'Andras' will remember the one who dealt the final blow.]

[The demon king 'Andras' will search for the one who dealt the final blow.]

[Final Blow: Han Sooyoung]

Han Sooyoung looked at me with a pale face and I laughed.

"I told you that you would regret it."

Song Minwoo was a member of the 72nd demon king, Andras' household.




The 72nd demon king.

The constellations weren't the only strong ones among the Star Stream.
There were some strong people who refused to be subscribers to the
heavens and travelled around planets. One of these superpowers were the
'demon kings'.

"You are a really bad jerk."

The demon kings sought their own 'households', just like the constellations
chose incarnations. Corrupted incarnations could choose to join the
household of a demon king.

The werewolf was one of his symbols and was located at the bottom of the
72nd demon king Andras' caste.

It was due to Andras' blessing that Song Minwoo had the Physical
Regeneration ability.

Han Sooyoung stuttered out, "H-How can I…"

"Don't worry. Some people I know were cursed by a demon king like you
but they didn't die right away."

"Why are you saying it now?"

Come to think of it, Han Myungoh who was cursed by the demon king,
Asmodeus… I didn't know what happened to him. Was he still alive?

"I think it is good. Andras isn't a very high ranking demon king. If you are
enemies with a demon king, you will get the favour of the absolute good
constellations and get more donations. It is a good thing."

"Will the archangels care? Besides, I don't get along with sponsors and
angels!"

Why? Was it also a demon king? I couldn't help thinking so when I
suddenly closed my mouth.

…What did she just say?
"You don't get along with sponsors and angels?"

Han Sooyoung noticed my gaze and cursed.

"Damn, my damn mouth…"

"Do you not have a sponsor?"

It wasn't impossible. I also had no sponsor. In fact, in the first scenario,
many of the survivors wouldn't get sponsors. To be precise, they didn't have
any choices.

However, it was unexpected that a strong person like Han Sooyoung had no
sponsor.

"I didn't choose one. Isn't it strange to choose from the beginning? I can
only pick once."

"Well, that's right."

If the Sponsor Selection could be postponed, it was better to postpone it.

There were many good constellations and depending on how the person
acted in a scenario, they could literally go from a 'turd to a Mercedes'.

The Sponsor Selection occurred once after the first scenario and were
regularly implemented before the 'disaster scenarios' occurred.

The fifth scenario was a 'disaster scenario' so Han Sooyoung would be able
to participate in the upcoming second round of the Sponsor Selection.

I raised my hand and asked, "Who will you choose? Is there a constellation
you are thinking about?"

Han Sooyoung made a confident expression at my words. "Won't you be
surprised when you find out? They are already interested in me."
"Who is it?"

Was it perhaps the Great Sage, Heaven's Equal?

"Have you heard of the Abyssal Black Flame

Dragon?" …The black flame dragon?

[The constellation 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' is looking at your
reaction.]

I hesitated for a moment before replying, "Ah, yes. He is a good sponsor."
The Abyssal Black Flame Dragon was the sponsor of the Delusional
Demon Kim Namwoon in the original novel. The Delusional Demon was
one of the best fighters along with the Steel Sword, so it wasn't a bad
choice.

[The constellation 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' is looking at you with a
complicated gaze.]

This guy wasn't interested in me anymore.

Han Sooyoung's eyebrows twitched at my nonchalant tone. "What is with
this sour expression? Who is your sponsor?"

"No, it is nothing. I was just feeling envious."

"Really?"

"Really."

[The character 'Han Sooyoung' has used 'Lie Detection Lv. 1'.]

[The character Han Sooyoung has confirmed that the statement is false]

"Is this real?"
I didn't care about the Abyssal Black Flame Dragon. I just wanted her to get
a sponsor. Han Sooyoung and this thug matched very well.

[The constellation who likes harems is cheering on you and Han
Sooyoung.]

[500 coins have been sponsored.]

Han Sooyoung's expression distorted like she heard the same message as
me.

"What is this again…?"

Unfortunately, the wish of the harem constellation wouldn't come true. Han
Sooyoung and I would only be together for the next 10 days.

There was a moment of cooperation but it didn't change that she was a
threatening enemy.

"It looks like we've arrived."

After a while, we reached the place that was probably the base of the
werewolves.

It was near a broadcasting station. There was a bloody smell coming from
the narrow forest of buildings. I heard the cries of the werewolves and
people in the distance, like a battle was going on. Han Sooyoung said, "It
seems that we are a bit late. Is there a preceding visitor?"

I didn't see any werewolves moving around as guards. Once we entered a
bit further, a coin farm that was even bigger than Director Yoon's came into
view.

The coin farms were the exclusive property of the destroyed world. I was
tired of facing these sights all the time.
It seemed like the coin harvest was over because there were no surviving
people behind bars.

Han Sooyoung was moving ahead when she suddenly grabbed her nose.

"Yuck, what is this?"

As we headed through the imprisonment area to the residence of the
werewolves, a more horrifying sight awaited us. Severed human thighs
were hanging from rubber bands. It was like pork in a butcher's shop,
making the purpose obvious.

[The exclusive skill 'Fourth Wall' has offset your emotional trauma.]

I read these scenes in the text but this was my first time actually seeing
them. There was a fixed way for humans to evolve into an outside species.

Cannibalism. In other words, eating their own people.

Han Sooyoung cursed, "You fucking scum…"

Most outside species evolved accidentally. Those who couldn't clear the
'find food' sub scenario usually walked this path. Once they ate a person,
they couldn't stop. Those who changed species would no longer feel guilty
about killing humans.

I stated, "You look upset when you see this."

"Of course. Who wouldn't be upset?"

"The other prophets said you want to use your information to control the
world."

"Who said that?" Han Sooyoung sneered and added, "It is just as absurd as
you calling me a plagiarist."

"…"
"World domination? It would be good. But my first goal is to prevent the
destruction. Why else did I collect the apostles?"

"The apostles were all trash."

"They were originally trash? Is that my fault?"

Tang! Tang! Tang! Tang!

We reflexively held our breaths. There was a loud sound from in front of
us. I could hear the sound of flesh exploding.

Tatang!

No matter how I thought about it, this was the sound of gunshots. Wasn't
the army already wiped out?

We ran towards the building from which the gunshots were coming from.
Even if the army was still intact, it was ridiculous to deal with a werewolf
with guns. But the sight in front of me changed the story.

Bodies of werewolves were piled up in front of me like a mountain. All of
the bodies had bullet wounds. Han Sooyoung and I talked almost
simultaneously.

"Attribute bullets."

"A bullet with the divine attribute?"

I saw some people pointing guns in the distance. They were armed with
modern rifles and unusually, they were all wearing prison uniforms.

Han Sooyoung nervously grabbed my collar. "Hey, do you remember me
telling you that there was someone like you in Sondaemun Prison?"

"Yes."
"They are her forces."

Han Sooyoung was pointing to a woman wearing a mask. It would be hard
to know the sex if it wasn't for the long hair hanging down, covering most
of the body including the face.

"She is the leader. It is obvious that she is a reader but I don't have any
information on her."

I see. They were from Seodaemun Prison… Then why wasn't this force
visible during the struggle for the throne?

Han Sooyoung opened her mouth while looking at the mountain of
werewolf corpses.

"They are also wanderers. They are quite powerful wanderers… the most
powerful wanderers I know."

A woman with a gun headed straight to this side. It wasn't the leader that
Han Sooyoung pointed out.

I pulled out Unbroken Faith while Han Sooyoung prepared Avatar. The gun
of the woman approaching us moved.

She leaned back and her muzzle pointed to one of the mountains of
werewolf corpses.

Dududududu!

The dead bodies collapsed from the bullets. Then something hidden under
the bodies was revealed.

"This is?"

There was a glowing stone that was 2m in length and height. It was one of
the meteorites I needed to prevent the 'disaster'.
The yellow meteorite was here. This meteorite was also the source of the
werewolves' strength.

The woman gazed at the meteorite before slowly turning to me.

"Are you Kim Dokja?"
             Chapter 78: Ep. 16 – The Fifth Scenario, II


Looking closely, the woman seemed quite old.

Based on the wrinkles, she wasn't in her 40s but she was at least in her mid
to late 30s.

She knew me? How?

I was a bit embarrassed but I maintained my composure as I looked at the
woman.

"You must be mistaken. My name is Yoo Joonghyuk. Kim Dokja is the
name of the guy I hate the most."

"…Yoo Joonghyuk?"

"Yes. So tell your leader not to talk nonsense. Just tell her, even if you're
not sure what I mean."
I looked to the side and saw Han Sooyoung watching me with an absurd
expression. I winked at her. If I knew Han Sooyoung, she would understand
what to do from now on. The woman opened her mouth.

"I already know that you are Kim Dokja. Stop the unnecessary lies."

[The character Han Sooyoung has confirmed that the statement is true.]

Han Sooyoung nodded towards me. This woman came because she knew
for certain who I was.

"The king said that she will entrust this meteorite to you."

It was unexpected. She knew me and now she was giving me the
meteorite…

"Who are you?"

"We are the people of the Wanderer King."

"That woman over there is your king?"

The woman nodded. I looked at the tall masked woman in the distance.
Looking closely, I felt a sense of deja vu. But there was something strange.

"King… You don't seem to have a flag?"

"The king doesn't dwell on such things."

…What was with this answer? The woman continued speaking. "The king
said that we will take care of the disaster in the north. But she will leave the
other four disasters to you."

Before I could ask anything, the woman turned and left like her words were
over.
Han Sooyoung shouted, "Hey! What do you mean? Shouldn't you explain it
before you go?"

Despite the shouts, the woman kept walking away without turning back.
Han
Sooyoung looked at me and asked, "What is this… do you know that
woman?"

"How can that be?"

I quietly activated Character List.

[This person isn't registered in 'Character List'.]

[You can check the information of the person by updating Character List.
Do you want to update it?]

It seemed that the update cycle was back. I nodded.

[The update has been completed.]

[Some people will be added to the dictionary.]

Then a window popped up.

Look at this, the First Sorceror of Joseon?

[The constellation 'First Sorceror of Joseon' is looking at you with wary
eyes.]

I didn't think there would already be a woman with Jeon Woochi¹ as a
sponsor.
In addition, she had the fairly good attribute of Officer of Justice, although
it was less than the 'judge'.

If the subordinate was this good, what was the king like? I immediately
looked at the tall woman.

[The information of this person can't be read in 'Character List'.]

[This person isn't registered in 'Character List'.]

The moment I met the gaze of the woman in the mask, a stinging pain
flashed through my head.

I reflexively looked away from the woman. My heart beat quickly.

The Fourth Wall instinctively shook.

The woman caused an even greater shaking than Song Minwoo. Despite
having Self-rationalization, I didn't want to take the risk because I wasn't
sure of the stigma's performance.

Han Sooyoung asked me anxiously, "Hey, what is it?"

"…Never mind."

The Fourth Wall responded to people who had an important influence on
me in real life.

In other words, that woman was someone I knew. But there was only one
person in this world who gave me a bigger trauma than Song Minwoo.

I see… As expected, she survived. However, I didn't expect her to be in
Seoul.

It was why she was able to make a large force and why they were wearing
prison uniforms. It was convincing if it was that person.
The wanderers soon began to move.

They aligned themselves and headed back the way they came. It was a
march with no hesitation. A loyalty could be felt from the group.

The leader moved at the forefront of the group.

A crown like the Tyrant King, a woman who was different from the King of
Beauty.

I looked at the ruins that they moved through. There were the broken coin
farms and the survivors they spared. They had placed blankets and
necessities beside the survivors. The survivors watched the leaving
wanderers with awe-filled eyes.

I had forgotten.

A person didn't need a flag or to sit on the throne to become king. In this
kingless world, there was still a king.




After a while, I examined the yellow meteorite they left behind.

A yellow meteorite.

The meteorite, also called the moon stone, was usually a star pierce that
hovered in other dimensions.

It was truly the same as I read in the novel.

The exhilarating magic power that I could feel just by touching the
meteorite, the faint light flowing out from the opaque interior, and the white
streaks all over the surface—this yellow meteorite definitely contained one
of the powers that could counter the disaster.
Then a system message was heard.

[The 'moon stone' wants to provide you with a high level strength.]

I refused the meteorite's offer and the power returned to the meteorite.

The moon stone basically had the power of the night and the outside species
would receive this power. Perhaps the cannibals who received the power of
the night were able to evolve into the outside species, the werewolves.

[The 'moon stone' gives off a feeling of familiarity.]

However, the real use of this meteorite wasn't simply to evolve the outside
species. Even a few hundred werewolves couldn't prevent the future
disasters.

Of course, a few thousand would help but then another disaster would come
from the large number of outside species and the power of the demon kings.

"I feel like a volunteer… Hey, did you find something?"

As I was examining the meteorite, Han Sooyoung was taking care of the
survivors lying nearby. It was a little unexpected but she was probably
targeting coins.

[Constellations of the Absolute Good system are touched by Han
Sooyoung's good works.]

In a place filled with the demon king's household, the dominations would
be bigger than usual.

Indeed, a human's double-sidedness was profound.

Among the constellations of the Absolute Good system, there might be the
Abyssal Black Flame Dragon. The second Sponsor Selection was coming
up so Han Sooyoung would be looking at him. I looked around and said,
"The avatars are useful."

Dozens of avatars were quickly organizing the surroundings. The corpses of
the outside species were burned, while the terrible cages and human butcher
stores were also demolished. She earned coins while getting a nosebleed…

Han Sooyoung wiped the blood and asked, "When are you going to tell
me?"

"What?"

"I'm talking about that."

I realized her question wasn't about the meteorite. "Are you still worrying
about that?"

"How can I not care?"

There were two types of 'readers' that she didn't know about. In addition,
there seemed to be a connection between the two. It was natural for Han
Sooyoung who was the 'last to get off' to pay attention.

"Who knows?"

"…Don't you know?"

"I only know the woman, the leader of the group."

"The Wanderer King?"

I nodded and said, "That person isn't someone who got off. To be precise,
she never read the original."

"What? Then how does she know the contents of the plot?"

"By talking directly to me."
Han Sooyoung looked like she had been hit in the back of the head with a
hammer. "You told others about the story? Why?"

"I needed something to tell her when I met her." I gave her a moment
before continuing. "Because I had nothing else to say to her."

Maybe she sensed my dark mood, making Han Sooyoung hesitate as she
was about to question me. She probably had a lot that she wanted to ask me.
Who was the woman and what was her relationship with me?

Han Sooyoung was silent for a while before speaking again. "I don't know
what your relationship with that woman is but is it okay to leave her alone?
If there are more people besides us who knows the future…"

I understood her concerns but it should be fine. At the very least, that
woman was a person with principles and she couldn't carelessly use the
future information.

I knocked on the moon stone and opened my mouth.

"Rather, there is something more important. From now on, we will wake
this up."

"What? This thing?" Han Sooyoung watched me like I was insane. "You
want to wake up the disaster?"

"Why are you so startled? Didn't you do it before?"

Han Sooyoung had incited the Night of the Prophets and awakened the fire
dragon, Lesser Igneel.

"Hey! I picked a small disaster. This one…"

"It isn't a disaster."

"…Then what is it?"
"It looks like you were negligent in your plagiarism. Don't you remember?
Do you really not know what will appear here when the scenario starts?"

Han Sooyoung stared at me before turning on her phone and reading her
own novel.

"Ah… This, perhaps…"

"Have you realized? You copied it well."

"Shut up. But the main scenario hasn't opened yet. Is it okay to do this?
Moreover, what if a plausibility request occurs?"

"It won't happen."

"The intermediate dokkaebi hates you…"

"Then I will deal with him." Right now, he would be busy being
reprimanded by the Bureau. "We will start injected mana. Based on my
calculations, it will hatch in 10 hours. I will take four hours and you will
take six hours."

"Why do I have to inject mana for six hours?"

"Isn't your magic power level higher?" At this moment, the number of
avatars decreased dramatically. I noticed something. "Tell me honestly.
What level is your magic power?"

"Why should I tell you?"

"It is information needed to clear the scenario."

[The provisions of the Temporary Contract will take effect.]

Han Sooyoung's expression distorted.
"…Level 55."

I was honestly surprised. I thought it would be over level 40 because she
could control dozens of avatars, but level 55… this was almost approaching
the scenario limit.

Her physique and strength were relatively low so she must've been putting
all her coins into magic power.

"I will change it. I will take two hours. You will take eight hours."

"Hey! That's unfair! And now I have run out of magic power."

I opened the Dokkaebi Bag and bought a few Intermediate Magic Power
Recovery Potions.

"Then drink this."

'What is this?"

"Coin item."

"…Is your sponsor huge? You are just giving something like this to me?"

"I am the one who is big."

Han Sooyoung glanced at me. "Did you put anything strange in it?"

"Then I'll start first."

I touched the moon stone and started injecting magic power. 10 hours later,
the guy inside the meteorite would wake up.
How long was I asleep? I opened my eyes at the sound of someone
shouting.

"Hey, get up quickly! That guy has started to move!"

Han Sooyoung shouted with a nervous face while touching the meteorite.

The meteorite had started to crack.

It was a phenomenon similar to when the fire dragon broke out of the
meteorite. It wasn't an aggressive reaction but if I said one word wrong…
both of us might die here.

A brilliant light emerged from the moon stone, lifting some of the darkness
of the night.

It was an awakening of a powerful presence that gave off a heavy pressure
just looking at it.



[1] Jeon Woochi was a Taoist scholar during the Joseon dynasty of Korea.
Known by many as the most prominent "sorcerer" in Korean history.
            Chapter 79: Ep. 16 – The Fifth Scenario, III


The broken pieces of moon stone fell to the ground. A being scattering a
silver mane was hatching. If he was a cub, I could control him using the
'imprinting' phenomenon. But this being wasn't such a naive creature.

[You have encountered a creature from a different world for the first time in
this scenario.]

[Affinity with the species from a different world has increased.]

[2,000 coins have been rewarded.]

[You have received a bonus skill for smooth communication with the other
world species.]
['Other World Interpreter Lv. 1' has been

acquired.] I could hear Han Sooyoung gulp next to

me.

It was natural to be nervous since the encounter with the other world
species was the prelude to the fifth scenario.

It was completely different from the previous scenarios. The slightest
mistake in the fifth scenario could cause all of Seoul to disappear.

[The exclusive skill 'Other World Interpreter Lv. 1' is activated.]

[The effect of the item Protection Symbol of the Imyuntar has increased
understanding of the specific language.]

The item I got from the fire dragon would be helpful from now on.

[Automatic interpretation has started.]

I heard a voice from the shining moon stone.

""#%#$… damn, already?"

The creature curled up inside the moon stone grumbled and raised its body.
The silver mane reminded me of a wolf at first glance, but I knew he was
different from a wolf. Above all, I knew the species of this person.

「 They are three meters tall. The dominant species of the world
'Chronos' that can transform using the moon stone at night. They are
fighters with monstrous physical strength who use the power of the wind.
」 One of the five dominant species of Chronos.

"I am the great first wolf."
「 In Chronos, they call the first wolf 'Imyuntar'. 」

"I am Lycaon of the Imyuntar."

There was a creepy breathing sound in the darkness of the night, causing
the surroundings to be still. I made eye contact with him while Han
Sooyoung hid behind me. Of course, I didn't back down.

 Overall Evaluation: One of the five dominant species of the destroyed
 Chronos. After losing his world, he invested in the Star Stream and
 became a guide in the scenario. He is characterized by always looking
 at the world with eyes filled with remorse.
As expected, the hero of another world had great skills and stats. The
average level of the stats was 75. He exceeded the current limit of the
scenario. He was the goal of many representatives.

Lycaon's blue eyes looked down at me like I was interesting.

"You are the ones who woke me up?"

I nodded.


"I see… Is it finally time? Congratulations on clearing the tutorial
scenarios, warriors of this world."

It sounded like a tutorial. It was funny how he imitated the dokkaebi for
dramatic effect.

There was no tutorial in this world. Every scenario was an actual event and
the dead couldn't come back again. Then what type of tutorial existed?

"Those who are facing extinction. First, I deeply regret that 'disaster' has
come to your world."

Lycaon spoke while looking up at the sky.

He was looking at the Great Hole over Seoul, Korea.

A huge vortex reminiscent of a black hole was gradually increasing its
volume every moment. Lycaon would've also seen the Great Hole on the
day his world was destroyed.

All guides in the scenarios were those who lost their homes to the
scenarios.

"Since I am here, you can rest assured. I am a 'guide' to stop the destruction
of this world. I will train you to prepare for the disaster and give you the
necessary instructions. And…"
It came out quite hastily but he was good at reciting the words. He probably
got a manual grom a dokkaebi.

Lycaon suddenly stopped talking.

"…By the way, you are the only ones who woke me up?"

"It is just us."

"Strange. The fourth scenario isn't cleared? If it had been cleared properly,
the five guides, including myself, would be hatched in the same place…
Where is the owner of the Absolute Throne?"

He was right. Originally, the five guides, including Lycaon, would gather as
soon as the master of the Absolute Throne was born.

I spoke to Lycaon. "We have no king."

"There is no king… did the master of the Absolute Throne die? No way.
At present, there is no way to kill the master of the Absolute Throne."
Lycaon expressed his disbelief in a threatening manner.

"There was no owner of the Absolute Throne from the beginning."

"What does that mean?"

"We cleared the fourth scenario without getting the Absolute Throne."

Flames appeared in Lycaon's eyes.

"Are you lying to me right now? Such a thing is impossible! The fourth
scenario doesn't end until someone takes the throne."

"There is also the method of destroying the Absolute Throne."
Lycaon's expression stiffened. He seemed to grasp my words and his eyes
widened.

"…Perhaps?"

The embarrassment of such a noble hero was really worth seeing. His silver
mane quivered as he looked closely at me.

"The numerous constellations…surely you didn't destroy the throne…?"

"That's right."

"How could you do such a terrible thing?"

Lycaon let out many curses that I couldn't hear properly. Han Sooyoung
looked at the bellowing Lycaon and whispered to me, "Hey, was it that
serious? For you…?"

Han Sooyoung also received Other World Interpreter and heard the
conversation. Lycaon screamed before I could answer.

"Why did you do that? Now there is no one in the world under the banner
of that great god?"

"No."

"Ahh! The Star Stream constellations didn't care about Chronos! Now this
world is ruined! Living things with less intelligence than a kobold should
do their jobs!"

I felt scorn as I watched the despairing Lycaon.

Yes, this was the essence of these guys. On the surface, they were
dispatched to help this world. However, they had a separate purpose that I
would never let happen.

"Prince of the Imyuntar, Lycaon Isparang. It is too early to be frustrated."
The prideful prince of the Imyuntar immediately responded to the change in
my attitude.

He growled out angrily. "Cheeky human. Show respect in front of a great
species! You don't know the weight of your sin!"

"Lycaon, didn't you see anything when your world perished? The Imyuntar
were the ruling species of Chronos, not Earth."

Lycaon's expression stiffened. I didn't miss this gap and continued, "There
were five disasters that destroyed your world."

"What…"

"The southern continent of Chronos where you lived was destroyed by the
dragon. Right?"

Lycaon's eyes filled with disbelief. "How do you know this?"

"Fire Dragon Igneel. The Disaster of Burning Hell. It is the name of the
disaster that destroyed your world."

The small disaster that I killed, Lesser Igneel was originally a 'disaster'.

A single flame could turn a small city into a sea of fire and a single flap of
its wings could destroy a lower species.

The southern continent of Chronos was destroyed by him. The fire dragon
that woke up from a meteorite.

Lycaon gritted his teeth. "You are speaking like it is someone else's story.
You will regret it. Pretty soon, your world will also struggle in that hot
hellfire."

"Don't worry. Igneel won't come down to this world."

"What?"
"I have already killed him. There will be no 'Burning Hell' disaster in this
world."

Lycaon had a bemused expression, like he heard his home had been brought
back.

"That is the best joke I've ever heard. Is there such a joke in this world? Is it
fun to joke about the world that will soon cease to exist?"

Well… of course not. I pulled out a blue coloured medallion. Then like
magic, Lycaon's laughter subsided.

The Protection Symbol of the Imyuntar. Lycaon's shaking hands reached
out to take the medallion.

"W-Why… how do you have this…?"

The Protection Symbol of the Imyuntar was proof that a person had hunted
a disaster dragon.

"Lycaon of the Imyuntar. Pay respects to the protector."

Lycaon's body slowly fell. First his knees touched the ground, slowly
followed by his head. There was a severe shaking of his eyes like he
couldn't admit it.

"Do it properly."

Before long, his head touched the ground. He was over three meters tall so
it wasn't until he fell down that his eyes were lower than mine. I looked
down at Lycaon.

This was the useful part of catching the fire dragon.

Han Sooyoung wasn't able to grasp the situation yet and looked at Lycaon
with confused eyes. I was almost killed by Han Sooyoung's brutality but
she ended up making things easier.
Lycaon spoke in a quivering voice. "Great dragon hunter… I would like to
belatedly ask your forgiveness for my rudeness."

"My name is Kim Dokja."

Once again, I thought that my name wasn't that great. This would be a great
scene if my name was Yoo Joonghyuk. I added a quick remark to diffuse
the awkward atmosphere.

"Lycaon. There is something I need you to do."

Lycaon carefully looked up."

"Teach me the Way of the Wind, which is the secret technique of your
people."

Lycaon's eyes slowly became bigger. This was my purpose behind hatching
Lycaon.

The southern disaster of the fire dragon had disappeared so the first disaster
in the fifth scenario would surely be the 'east disaster'.

In order to prevent the catastrophe in the east, I needed to gain the secret
technique of the Imyuntar.

Way of the Wind It was the only answer to the disaster of the east, the
'Disaster of Questions'.




An hour later, I explained the situation to Han Sooyoung who hadn't been
able to follow the conversation.

"Then the medallion you got from killing the fire dragon is an important
thing for them?"
"Yes."

"I still don't understand… the fire dragon you killed at that time was one of
the disasters?"

"That's right."

"…Then in the fifth scenario, we have to prevent four instead of five
disasters?"

"You seem to understand yet not understand?"

Han Sooyoung frowned.

"I still don't understand. Didn't you kill the 'Lesser Igneel?' How can he be a
disaster if he's just a deteriorated dragon? Is this also a development of
Ways of Survival?"

"…Everything that hatches from a disaster meteor is a disaster. That guy
came out instead of Igneel so Igneel won't appear in this disaster. In
addition, Igneel didn't appear in the original. Igneel's hatchling came out. It
is only the
fifth scenario so how can something like that wake up already?"

"…You speak well. Are you a spokesman for Ways of Survival? Are you
actually the writer?"

The scenario difficulty was ridiculous but it was adjusted so that it could be
cleared if people risked their lives.

…Of course, the adjustment was carefully controlled.

The Lesser Igneel, the deteriorated version of the hatchling had annihilated
the prophets, which could be called the elite troops at the time. Was that
all? I was once killed by that dragon. If it wasn't for the King of No Killing,
I wouldn't be standing here.
If Lesser Igneel had been released into Seoul and continued to level up,
Seoul would've ended up the same as Lycaon's hometown.

Of course, Han Sooyoung had no knowledge of such matters and was busy
complaining.

"Anyway, aren't the disasters a bigger deal than I thought? I have a lot of
trouble grasping the scale because of the way it was expressed in Ways of
Survival…"

"We were lucky with the fire dragon. The disasters that will come will be in
their original state. Terrible beings will appear."

It was pleasant to see the expression of the plagiarist writer at the word
'original'.

"Then what should we do?"

"We have to use that guy."

I looked at Lycaon, who was preparing for the training in a distant place.

Han Sooyoung asked, "He looks strong. Do you want him to fight?"

"That guy is a coward. In addition, the guides are prohibited from fighting
against disasters of another world. We have to take care of our work on our
own."

I heard Lycaon calling out to me.

"Protector, I am ready."

Protector was the title for the owner of the medallion. I told him to call my
name a few times but Lycaon didn't yield.

"From now on, I will teach you the secret technique of my clan, the Way of
the Wind."
Way of the Wind. It was a hidden skill that allowed the user to use the wind
like their own limbs.

Among the other species, only those with the Protection Symbol of the
Imyuntar could learn this skill.

Yoo Joonghyuk was originally scheduled to obtain this but not this time. I
couldn't give the strong person all the good skills.

"Then I will start."

For the next three hours, I sweated hard to learn the skill.

It would be nice if the system had a message like 'Would you like to learn
the skill?' but this wasn't possible. It was only possible to gain the skill by
learning it directly.

I had read the novel so I was able to follow Lycaon's movements a little bit.
To be exact, I thought I was following it.

Approximately one more hour passed. Lycaon hesitated before opening his
mouth. "Protector. I'm sorry to say this but…"
             Chapter 80: Ep. 16 – The Fifth Scenario, IV


I gasped and asked, "What? Is it over?"

"No, that is…"

"…Then what am I doing wrong?"

"To be precise…"

"Don't drag it out and tell me quickly."

"It is all wrong."

It was so sincere that I sat down like I had received a nuclear punch. I
breathed roughly and looked up at the sky. All of a sudden, the Great Hole
floating in the sky seemed bigger. It seemed to be mocking me.

Lycaon looked at me and prepared for the kill.
"Protector… you don't have any qualities suited for Way of the Wind. No,
to be honest, you don't have the qualities for almost every skill."

If this went wrong, the world might perish because of me.




A few more hours passed like this and then days went by. There were eight
days left until the start of the fifth scenario.

I didn't give up and continued to learn Way of the Wind. Of course, it
wasn't possible.

Grrr. "Protector, it is better to give up…"

"…Why can't I learn it?"

Han Sooyoung giggled beside me and said, "Why? It is because you have
no talent."

"That isn't possible."

"Why not? You aren't the protagonist. Do you think that you became Yoo
Joonghyuk because you have been doing a good job lately?"

My chest was sore like I had been stabbed. I spoke with a frown, "But I
understand everything in my head."

"Ah, yes. Everyone thinks they can go to Seoul National University."

"I'm telling the truth."

I remembered most of the enlightenment associated with Way of the Wind.
I felt so frustrated one hour ago that I got a second battery from the
survivors and read the text again.
"There is a gale in the right hand and a storm in the left hand. The Way of
the Wind will be opened when the straight lines and the curves meet."

"H-How… You really understand it!"

Lycaon felt admiration from where he was listening to me.

In fact, the words I just muttered was Yoo Joonghyuk's enlightenment in
Ways of Survival. In Ways of Survival, Yoo Joonghyuk gained insight in a
single 'phrase' followed by a Chinese character. He learned Way of the
Wind in just 5 minutes.

But it wasn't that simple and I had wasted two days already.

"How can I do this?" I grumbled.

"Huh? You just said it… there is no representation more accurate than
that."

"No, it was a metaphor."

"Your words weren't a metaphor."

It was enough to make me go crazy. This time the problem wasn't solved by
the writer's description in Ways of Survival. It was because the explanation
was just complete noise to me and the Fourth Wall was also useless at this
moment. Fourth Wall gave me judgment and calmness but it didn't give me
talent.

I felt a little feverish as I spoke to Lycaon. "Then you should try this. One
wind will meet another wind to form ying and yang. Once again, one wind
will meet another wind to form the principles of negative and positive."

Yin and Yang was a concept from Earth but Lycaon understood it instantly.

"How could you have gained such profound insight?"
"Don't just speak it, spread it directly through your body."

"So it is like this."

Lycaon concentrated and winds from different directions started to form
around him. The two winds swirled, adding a hot and cold energy to the
wind.

…To be honest, I thought it was ridiculous. He just heard it and could carry
out the technique instantly? Then why couldn't I do the same?

My pride was provoked.

"Then how about this? 'Four winds meet and form a defense. Then another
four winds are added, making it the Eight Trigrams. Therefore, wind is
everywhere yet exists nowhere'. Can you do this as well?"

This sentence was the enlightenment that Yoo Joonghyuk gained in the 9th
round of regression. This time Lycaon made a puzzled expression. I spoke
in a triumphant voice.

"You can't? This is how I am feeling."

"Pushov… no, Protector. I really appreciate it."

…What?

[The 5th grade other world species 'Prince Lycaon of the Imyuntar' has
received great enlightenment.]

Lycaon suddenly turned and started practicing.

[You have a great impact on the evolution of Prince Lycaon of the
Imyuntar.]

[Lycaon of the Imyuntar feels a great appreciation towards you.]
[Some constellations from the ruined world 'Chronos' thank you.]

[2,000 coins have been sponsored.]

I finally figured out what was going on. That damn wolf gained
enlightenment by hearing what I said.

Han Sooyoung was laughing so hard that she was holding her belly.

I felt belated frustration. Maybe I knew Ways of Survival but I didn't know
anything about myself.

[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' admires your
patience.]

[The constellation 'Secretive Plotter' is disappointed in your weakness.]

Looking at the system messages appearing in the air, I thought about
signing a contract with a sponsor. Of course, it was impossible due to the
contract with Bihyung.

[So why did you break the throne? Fool.]

I looked up and saw a transparent figure floating in the air. I opened the
dokkaebi communication.

'Is it okay to talk now? What about the intermediate dokkaebi?'

[He won't come for a while. He is being properly disciplined. He won't
come before the fifth scenario opens. Ah, my channel also upgraded again.
Hopefully I can reach the intermediate level next month. It is all thanks to
you.]

'That's good'.
[Why don't you look happy? It is also good for you if I do well.]

'You will be busy when you reach intermediate level'.

Bihyung laughed at my words.

[Brat, don't worry. I don't know about other incarnations but won't I look
after you? These days there are many intermediate dokkaebi at the Bureau
but… it is noisy because some bastards are twisting their probabilities
extensively.]

I didn't need him to tell me who it was.

[Oh, of course it isn't you.]

It was completely Yoo Joonghyuk.

In fact, Yoo Joonghyuk's growth rate was impossible through any
possibilities. He was growing at a rate that was close to a cheat.

[There is one abnormally rapidly growing guy and the Bureau can't touch
him… I think his sponsor is probably a formidable guy.]

Perhaps Yoo Joonghyuk's 'possibilities' wouldn't be a problem in the future.

In the end, the 'possibility' wasn't a problem if there was a constellation
capable of that 'possibility'. And it was possible for Yoo Joonghyuk's
sponsor.

[By the way, why don't you buy a growth package? I'll sell it for a cheap
price if you buy it now. Aren't you suffering right now because you can't
learn that skill? This package…]

'I won't buy it. In any case, isn't the growth package only applicable to skills
already learnt? Did you show up just to eat money?'
The growth package had a penalty when abused. It was why even the
powerful Yoo Joonghyuk didn't use the growth package.

[Sheesh, you knew…?]

Bihyung muttered with a dissatisfied expression.

'But it is time to buy something'.

[Coins Possessed: 62,372 C]

I still had a lot of coins despite raising my stats due to selling the fire
dragon parts.

If I had 40,000 more coins, I would've bought Sky Dragon Steps but I
couldn't this time.

Bihyung's face became rosy.

[Oh, really? What do you want to buy?]

'Aren't you going to receive new coin items soon?'

[…How do you know? Did you plant a mole?]

'It is natural since a new scenario will open soon. At that time, tell me. I'll
buy it'.

[Hoh, you will…]

I turned off the dokkaebi communication. I didn't want to talk to him when
there was nothing to say. I looked back and Lycaon was still gaining
enlightenment. Han Sooyoung approached me and raised her chin.

"Hey, what are you going to do now?"

"…I don't know. I'm still thinking."
"Then let me learn it."

"What?"

"Or let the other survivors learn it."

I looked at the people around us.

It was two days after the coin farms collapsed. The rescued survivors were
working together and caring for the other wounded.

The atmosphere was quite different from the survivors of Deputy Yoon's
coin farm. Perhaps Han Sooyoung's hypocrisy-filled good deeds had
changed them. It turned out that hypocrisy was a good thing.

Han Sooyoung opened her mouth again. "Isn't it just learning Way of the
Wind? Does it matter who learns it?"

"…Right, anyone can learn it."

"Why do you insist on being the one to learn it? Are you trying to get the
attention of the constellations alone?"

It wasn't wrong, but it wasn't exactly right.

"Only people with the protection medallion can learn Way of the Wind."

"Then give it to me."

"It isn't transferable."

[The character Han Sooyoung has confirmed that the statement is true.]

This woman really…

"You are the first person who is more suspicious than Yoo Joonghyuk."
"You brought it up. This skill, Yoo Joonghyuk should've originally learnt
it?"

"That's right."

"Then why do you have to go through this trouble? You can leave it to Yoo
Joonghyuk. It isn't too late now so let's go find Yoo Joonghyuk. He is
growing well. That guy would manage it somehow."

"Yoo Joonghyuk doesn't listen to what other people will say."

"I'll tempt him."

I stared at Han Sooyoung before looking away. "Yoo Joonghyuk doesn't
like the body of a child."

"Are you ignoring me now?"

"Besides, there is also a problem in finding Yoo Joonghyuk."

Even Yoo Joonghyuk couldn't learn Way of the Wind without the
protection medallion.

It meant the medallion needed to be taken from me, but ownership wouldn't
be released until I died.

In other words, Yoo Joonghyuk must kill me. Besides, even if he had the
medallion…

"You know that I beat him up pretty badly in the end. Once we meet, he
will definitely try to kill me."

Yoo Joonghyuk flew from my punch filled with 100 strength. In the
meantime, the eyes that wanted to tear me to pieces were still vivid.

"…Well, he was really bold when he cut off my head." Han Sooyoung
stroked her neck as memories of Chungmuro Station surfaced.
"Besides, finding out where he is now…"

At this time, an uproar was heard in the distance.

"There is someone injured. Please help! It is serious!"

Someone had found a wounded person nearby.

[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' is looking forward to your
companionship.]

[Some constellations are expecting you to treat the wounded.]

The messages of the constellations, including Uriel, arrived. What was
going on?

I took Han Sooyoung and headed there.

After a while, I found the cause of the problem and glared at Bihyung
floating in the air.

Bihyung sniggered at me.

[I didn't know about this.]

The bleeding Yoo Joonghyuk was waiting for me there.
             Chapter 81: Ep. 16 – The Fifth Scenario, V


I stepped away from the bleeding Yoo Joonghyuk lying down and spoke to
Bihyung.

'Is this your doing?'

Even if Yoo Joonghyuk was nearby, he couldn't be found in such a timely
manner. It was clear that Bihyung had made a sub scenario to bring Yoo
Joonghyuk over here.

[Are you suspecting me? Is there evidence?]

There was no evidence but I felt it in my heart.

[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' is concerned with your
judgment.]
[500 coins have been sponsored.]

I felt a strong belief.


Han Sooyoung whispered to me as I looked down at Yoo Joonghyuk with a
dumb expression. "…We found him. What are you going to do?"

"What else?"

"Shouldn't you save him? This jerk, he is the protagonist."

Of course I had to save him. However, if I saved this bastard, I would
surely die. Han Sooyoung looked scared that Yoo Joonghyuk would wake
up straight away.

"Do you have anything that will restrain him?"

"Yoo Joonghyuk won't tolerate them."

"Lock him up…"

"Then he will commit suicide."

"But if he goes back… Damn, what will happen if he regresses?"

Han Sooyoung belatedly came to this realization.

What would happen to this world if Yoo Joonghyuk went back? It was one
of my biggest challenges living in this world.

"We have to stop it. Nobody knows what will happen."

It was right to assume the worst when things were unknown. If I made a
mistake and the world was reset, my existence would disappear.

By the way… how did this jerk end up like this?
I looked closely at him. There was a wound around the belly. All internal
organs and ribs were broken. It felt like someone incredibly powerful had
hit Yoo Joonghyuk in one blow…

At this moment, I stared blankly at my fist. Perhaps?

"What is with that expression? Why is your face suddenly dark?"

"…It is nothing."

All of a sudden, I was convinced. He was hit with a fist filled with 100
strength…

Then he had been like this for two days. Now I felt sorry. With this, it
might not be possible to restore my relationship with Yoo Joonghyuk.

As I slowly looked from his belly to his face, I took a few steps back
because I got goosebumps.

"…Shit."

Yoo Joonghyuk was staring at me with bloody and teary eyes. His lips were
moving and he was obviously saying something like 'Dead, Kim Dokja'.

I thought Han Sooyoung was beside me but she had run away as quickly as
possible. I shouted towards Yoo Joonghyuk from a distance.

"Hey! Can't you release your anger?"

"…"

"Wasn't it a fair fight? Didn't you try to kill me as well?"

Yoo Joonghyuk's eyes didn't change. Dammit…

I had no choice. Yoo Joonghyuk had to survive here, even if he killed me. I
might be able to stop the Disaster of Questions without Yoo Joonghyuk but
I wouldn't be able to prevent the other disasters and the world would be
destroyed.

Why was the protagonist of Ways of Survival such a person? The story
would've been easier of it was Lee Hyunsung or Jung Heewon.

…This wasn't the time for complaints.

I decided to use a skill. It was obvious what he was thinking but I needed to
check.

[Exclusive skill, Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint stage 2 has been

activated!] At this moment, something amazing happened.

「 Kim Dokja. 」

My eyes widened as I watched Yoo Joonghyuk.

…Did he just call out to me?

「 You can hear my words. Isn't that right? If I look back at what you
have done so far… 」 …What?

「 Say that you can hear me. If you don't move now, the world will…

」 I looked at him in a slightly confused state.

「 …It was my mistake. Dammit. 」

Yoo Joonghyuk's eyes slowly closed. I hesitated for a moment before
approaching Yoo Joonghyuk. Yoo Joonghyuk didn't seem to have the
power to fight me at all in this state. Besides… I didn't see any animosity
towards me.

"Yoo Joonghyuk. Can you hear me?"
Yoo Joonghyuk struggled to raise his eyelids, only to close them again. It
was strange.

No matter how badly wounded he was, he would've automatically triggered
Recovery when he was hit. Then why was he still in this state?

 *Currently in an abnormal condition.

 *Currently, this person is affected by the Thousand Spirits Poison.


There were no problems with his stats. Yoo Joonghyuk was still one of the
strongest incarnations in Seoul and his skills had grown compared to the
last time I saw him.
The problem was his abnormal status.

Yoo Joonghyuk didn't have the skills Thousand Poisons Resistance or
Immunity to Ten Thousand Poisons yet. Therefore, poison was currently
one of Yoo Joonghyuk's few weaknesses.

He was like this because he was poisoned.

I looked closer and saw that there were blue blood vessels all over his body.
It hadn't been long since he was poisoned. Fortunately, he was still alive.

But it was strange. I knew of only one person who could infect Yoo
Joonghyuk with Thousand Spirits Poison at this time…

A woman watching me in the distance asked, "You… are you Kim
Dokjassi?"

I nodded. I looked at the woman who brought Yoo Joonghyuk here.

"He was like this the whole time. He kept asking me to take him to Kim
Dokja…"

Yoo Joonghyuk?

I looked down at Yoo Joonghyuk's face, which was more blue-tinged than
before, and instantly had many thoughts. The terrified Han Sooyoung who
had been fleeing came back.

"Hey, what's going on?" Han Sooyoung poked my shoulder but I didn't
answer.

I struggled for a moment before speaking to Bihyung.

'Bihyung, open the Dokkaebi Bag'.
[Now do you understand? This wasn't my doing.]

'Open the bag'.

After confirming my remaining coins, I found a coin item that could cure
Yoo Joonghyuk.

He was affected by the Thousand Spirits Poison so it couldn't be removed
simply by eating the Ellain Forest Essence. I quickly turned on the text and
checked some of the ingredients before purchasing items from the
Dokkaebi Bag.

[You have purchased one Midday Tryst.]

[You have purchased one Old Barbara Branch.]

[You have purchased two Putna Daltun Horns.]

[You have purchased one Detox Potato.]

[You have purchased two Aintern Temple's Purification Water.]

[You have purchased one Ellain Forest Essence.]

[A total of 7,370 coins are consumed.]

It was an unexpected bleeding service. I asked the survivors around me for
a small bucket, lit the Magic Power Stove and poured the ingredients into it.
Han Sooyoung asked,

"What are you going to make?"

"An antidote."

"Did you decide to save him?"

I nodded and replied, "This bastard, he came to me deliberately."
"Deliberately? Why?"

"I don't know."

"Did he come to ask you for help? I don't think Yoo Joonghyuk would
come all this way to kill you."

"That is impossible for Yoo Joonghyuk."

"How do you know?"

"I know. He is that type of bastard."

I adjusted the flames of the stove.

Fire blazed and the contents in the bucket started to boil. Based on the
colour and form, it looked like food from the Death Valley goblins. It might
seem terrible but this soup was an excellent antidote.

Han Sooyoung placed her hands on her knees and stared at the terrible
food.
"By the way, was Yoo Joonghyuk such a bad person in Ways of Survival?"

"…What?"

"It was a thought that I had. Didn't Yoo Joonghyuk save a lot of people and
do good deeds? Of course, he is like a psychopath but isn't he moving for
the people? He is fighting to save the world. I don't want to admit it because
I am a bad person."

When I thought about it, Han Sooyoung's words weren't completely wrong.
I laughed and said, "Your defense of Yoo Joonghyuk is energetic because
you haven't read as far as me."

"But that is that and this is this. You can't judge people by only looking at
one side."
It was an unexpected conversation so I looked up at Han Sooyoung for a
while.

Han Sooyoung was smiling coldly.

"No matter how much you claim that my work is plagiarism, it has actually
never been affected by Ways of Survival."

"…You almost convinced me without saying that. It is a real

pity." I said this but my mind was a bit complicated.

What type of person was Yoo Joonghyuk? Could I really say that I was
familiar with the existence of Yoo Joonghyuk?

I was able to confidently answer until a while ago. I was the only reader
who read all of Ways of Survival.

But I felt that some of my answers were being diluted in the soup. Did I
know Yoo Joonghyuk at all?

Not long after that, the soup started boiling.

[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' is impressed with your good
deed.]

[Constellations of the absolute good system support your good deed.]

[3,000 coins have been sponsored.]

It was rare for a person to be damaged by sponsorship. Shit.

I approached Yoo Joonghyuk with the soup. Han Sooyoung brought me a
spoon from a nearby store. I scooped up the soup with the spoon and put it
in Yoo Joonghyuk's mouth. Han Sooyoung watched me blowing on the
soup.
"You are acting like a wife."

"Do you want to do this?"

"I don't want to."

In fact, I wouldn't have given the job to her anyway. It was due to the
system message that I heard every time I scooped up a spoonful of soup.

[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' is impressed with your good
deed.]

[500 coins have been sponsored.]

It was tremendous to receive coins every time I fed him.

[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' is impressed with your good
deed.]

[300 coins have been sponsored.]

I thought it was a loss to me but it turned out to be a huge honey event.
Indeed, people should live a good life.

However, I started to feel a bit strange after 10 spoonfuls.

[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' is impressed with your good
deed.]

[400 coins have been sponsored.]

…Was this constellation really impressed with the good deed? Would it last
until the bowl was empty?

Yoo Joonghyuk started to open his eyes with a slight groan. He was still in
bad shape but he was gradually healing from the poison. I didn't miss his
opportunity and took out one item.
[You have used the Midday Tryst.]

[You are seeking consent from the target.]

Midday Tryst was an item that allowed for a one on one conversation with
the selected target for a specified time period. If I had a bit more coins, I
would've learnt the Sound Transmission skill but I didn't have that much to
spare. Therefore, I chose the next best thing.

[The target has agreed to communicate with you.]

[The Midday Tryst has started.]

Once I sent a message to Yoo Joonghyuk, a small messenger window
emerged in front of me.

–Hey, can you hear me?

The connection was formed.

I purchased this item for three reasons.

One was because Yoo Joonghyuk's tongue was paralyzed by the effect of
Thousand Spirits Poison and the second reason was to avoid leaking
information to Han Sooyoung. The third and most important reason was
that I didn't want to confirm to Yoo Joonghyuk that I could read his
thoughts.

The next moment, Yoo Joonghyuk's message came up.

–Kim Dokja, move to the east right now.
             Chapter 82: Ep. 17 – SSS-grade Talent, I


I frowned at Yoo Joonghyuk's words.

Move to the east right now? I saved his life and now he was giving me an
order?

I was a bit annoyed but Yoo Joonghyuk spoke before I could say anything.

–The Disaster of Questions is waking up.

…What?

I was frustrated because I couldn't understand what he was saying and Yoo
Joonghyuk frowned.

–Someone is waking the disaster up.
After a while, Han Sooyoung and I left Lycaon who was still receiving
enlightenment and headed for Gangdong-gu.

It was at a tremendous pace.

"Can we just leave that wolf?"

"The Imyuntar can feel the master of the medallion. He will come find us
when he wakes up. Rather…" I looked at Han Sooyoung running beside me
and said, "Can't you carry him? You can use your avatar."

"I don't want to." The disgusted Han Sooyoung quickly moved away from
me.

"Didn't you say earlier that Yoo Joonghyuk might not be a bad guy?"

"That is that and this is this. Isn't he the one who cut my head off?"

I couldn't say anything to refute her words. Yoo Joonghyuk spoke through
Midday Tryst.

–You can leave me. I don't need help.

–Don't be so prideful. I really will abandon you.

I couldn't see Yoo Joonghyuk's face because he was being carried on my
back.

–When will you be able to move by yourself?

–In two days.

–Will you kill me when you recover?

I asked half-jokingly but this bastard didn't give an answer. I deliberately
reduced the pace at which I was moving.
–Then I can't help you. How can I believe a guy who is trying to kill me? I
will help you if you swear an Oath of Existence. Swear not to kill me until
the end of this regression.

–I can't do that.

Lousy bastard.

–Then swear you won't hurt me until the fifth scenario is over. If you can't
do that, I really won't help you.

Yoo Joonghyuk thought for a moment before replying.

–I swear.

Surprisingly, Yoo Joonghyuk agreed to the oath. The Oath of Existence. It
was a constraint on the person who swore it.

A cold flame emerged from Yoo Joonghyuk's body and dug into his heart.
If he broke the oath, this blue flames will burn his heart. I felt a bit relieved
but then Yoo Joonghyuk continued.

–I won't kill you. But… –

But?

–I will hit you once.

–What?

I was dazed for a moment. He was going to hit me?

–Is this because of two days ago?

Yoo Joonghyuk didn't answer again. I thought it was strange that Yoo
Joonghyuk agreed to the oath so easily.
–…It is one hit. I'll do it gently. Understood?

Yes, it might not be bad if one hit could restore my relationship with Yoo
Joonghyuk. In my current state, I wouldn't die from one of Yoo
Joonghyuk's blows.

Shortly after that, we crossed Cheongdam Bridge and entered Gwangjin-gu.

I felt the surrounding ecology change little by little. Grass was growing on
the streets and instead of rotting bodies, the smell of monster feces filled
the area.

The trunk of a huge plant emerged from the ground and wrapped around the
surrounding high-rise buildings.

[The 7th grade plant species 'Yanaspleta' is on the lookout.]

I spoke to Han Sooyoung who was pulling out a weapon. "Don't act so
rashly. It is fine as long as we don't attack first."

"…Don't these types of monsters suddenly attack with tentacles?"

"That is just in the manhwas. They are gentle. Just be careful not to step on
the roots."

At the top of the building, the head of the plant that resembled a sunflower
followed after us with its eyes. It seemed scary but it was actually a good
monster. This didn't mean that the situation was optimistic.

The plant species originally came after the Great Hole was fully opened.

"The terraforming has started."

Terraforming.

The fifth scenario was world versus world. Humanity fought against the
worlds that were coming.
Just like Seoul was suffering from the erosion of Chronos, China would be
facing the '3rd Murim World' while Japan would be facing the 'White
Demon Realm'.

Han Sooyoung scouted around with avatars and said.

"It is a monster colony. Damn."

"The terraforming will be even faster if the disasters awaken."

"What type of person is waking up the disaster?"

"A person like you. You woke up the fire dragon."

Han Sooyoung bit her lips.

"…Didn't you tidy it up?"

"At that time, the intermediate dokkaebi placed a penalty on the fire dragon.
And what if I didn't kill it? Don't tell me that you would catch it?"

"There was a penalty? Then didn't it benefit us to catch a weakened
disaster?"

"The Disaster of Questions has no penalty. It is questionable if the dokkaebi
would even place a penalty on it."

We moved quickly to avoid the monster's colony. In the streets, the ground
rats and grolls were eating corpses.

Looking at the traces of the destroyed monsters, Yoo Joonghyuk seemed to
have come through this path. Yoo Joonghyuk was great to walk so far in
this physical condition.

I spoke to Yoo Joonghyuk.

–I have a question.
–…

–Why come to me? I honestly thought you would commit suicide.

–Suicide? How ridiculous.

If he had seen his future in the 8th turn, he wouldn't be able to say this. I
was a bit confused by his next words.

–If I was going to give up so easily, I wouldn't have started this journey.

It really felt like the first time I read Ways of Survival. I thought that maybe
Han Sooyoung was right. The Yoo Joonghyuk I believed I knew was the
Yoo Joonghyuk who easily gave up, easily killed people and repeatedly
caused numerous tragedies.

However, the Yoo Joonghyuk of the third round wasn't yet like that. Maybe
I didn't know the Yoo Joonghyuk of the third round.

[Your understanding of the character 'Yoo Joonghyuk' is increasing.]

In the meantime, Yoo Joonghyuk said.

–I thought of you right away. I thought you would be a bit of help since you
are the one who smashed the Absolute Throne.

–You aren't going to say anything about me breaking the throne?

–I don't want to talk about what already happened. In addition, I thought
about it. You must've done it to rule out the 'god of the other world'.

–…You know?

I was honestly frightened because I had never really spoken to Yoo
Joonghyuk before.

Putting aside his coolness, this bastard had such a great mind?
Yoo Joonghyuk kept speaking.

–Honestly, I think it isn't a bad way. The problem is what happens next.
After you crushed the throne, the guides were scattered and there was a
setback in collecting the meteorite. This is why the terraforming of
Gwangjin-gu and Gangdong-gu is so fast. The wanderers are using the
power of the meteorites.

–What do you mean? Terraforming won't accelerate simply by using the
meteorites.

–One of the 10 Evils has taken possession of a 'disaster meteorite'.

The 10 Evils. My heart instantly sank. I had expected it but actually hearing
it was a different matter.

–Is it the Poisoner?

–…You know.

–She is the only one who uses Thousand Spirits Poison.

But there was still a part that I didn't understand.

–Then why are you poisoned? If you knew that the opponent was the
Poisoner, shouldn't you have avoided facing her from the front?

–I was trying to convince her.

–Convince? You?

Then a scene belatedly popped up. Yoo Joonghyuk said.

–I wanted to make her a companion.

Companion… I see. I remembered now. Poisoner Lee Seolhwa was Yoo
Joonghyuk's companion in the second round.
The 10 Evils weren't always opponents.

Just like Armed Fortress Master Gong Pildu changed in this round, Lee
Seolhwa was transformed into a companion in several rounds, including the
first regression. In all other regressions so far, Poisoner Lee Seolhwa was
one of the few companions that Yoo Joonghyuk could rely on.

–You did something that isn't like you.

–I admit it. I was pathetic.

–…

–She isn't the person I remember. I knew it. Still, I wanted to believe for a
moment that the woman in my memories was still alive. I wanted to be with
her again.

I couldn't help opening my mouth at the loneliness that he had buried
deeply.

In his second life, Lee Seolhwa didn't last long but she was Yoo
Joonghyuk's lover.

–I understand.

Yoo Joonghyuk was silent for a moment.

–You are talking as if you have regressed before.

–I don't need to regress to understand.

I knew that I shouldn't speak about understanding. Still, I wanted to say it.
Since he wouldn't receive understanding from anyone in the future, I
thought I could say this.

[The character 'Yoo Joonghyuk' is deeply shaken.]
[The character 'Yoo Joonghyuk' has received a faint consolation.]

–Strange. You obviously aren't a regressor… But I feel like you really
understand these emotions. Is this also the power of a prophet?

I didn't answer, making Yoo Joonghyuk continue speaking.

–Of course, you aren't a good person. You are the unscrupulous person who
kidnapped my sister.

–When did I kidnap her? I just protected her. You must've understood with
Lie Detection…

"Kim Dokja."

We stopped talking at Han Sooyoung's tense voice. The road from Cheonho
Bridge to Gangdong was visible. The Great Hole emitted a bright light and
something fell towards Gangdong-gu.

Dammit, it was already happening.

We fully entered Gangdong-gu and the density of the strange grasses
covering the ground increased. Dirty trees grew between buildings and
there were small beasts running on the trees.

Gangdong-gu was already half of another world.

Han Sooyoung bit her lips and asked, "Are we too late? What if the disaster
has already awakened?"

"It hasn't happened yet. Then we would've received the scenario."

We took a few more steps and saw several markings on the ground. It
looked like graffiti but it was actually a territorial display.

It was a warning that no one should enter.
From here on, it was the area of the Poisoner. Like the other wanderers, she
settled in Gangdong-gu and started to expand her base.

The progress was faster than I expected.

Han Sooyoung said, "If this group is well guarded, it won't be easy to
attack… Have you thought of something?"

No. I didn't intend to wage an all-out war in the first place.

"We only need the meteorite. We can just steal it. I will buy time while you
take the meteorite."

However, it wouldn't be so easy. The story might be different if I had an
assistant like the Wanderer King.

Yoo Joonghyuk interrupted.

–There is no need to rush. Even if the disaster begins, the Disaster of
Questions is a disaster that can be suppressed at an early stage.

An early suppression. Indeed, it was possible for Yoo Joonghyuk.

–Early suppression? Who will do that? Are you a half god?

–Of course it should be you. Weren't you thinking about it anyway?

–Why do you think that?

–You have already woken up the guide and received the Way of the Wind.

Based on his tone, he was slightly angry that I had taken the Way of the
Wind that he was supposed to learn. I said with a smile.

–I didn't learn it.

–…Why? There wasn't enough time?
I'm actually glad.

–No, I don't have talent.

I could feel Yoo Joonghyuk's deep contempt in his silence.

–You, from the beginning…

"There are people."

The moment I heard Han Sooyoung's words, I raised Unbroken Faith. It
was the territory of one of the 10 Evils so the peple would naturally belong
to their group.

I entrusted Yoo Joonghyuk to Han Sooyoung's avatar.

"…I will be gone for a while so take him. Do you understand?"

The people were getting closer. But something felt strange. Usually it
wasn't so loud when a single group moved. Then the clear voice of a
woman was heard in front of us.

"Everybody run towards Cheonho Bridge!"

It wasn't the Poisoner's group.

They weren't as powerful was the Wanderer King's group but some people
who survived the Poisoner's Group were escaping from Gangdong-gu. The
unarmed survivors gasped for air when they found us.

"O-Out of the way! Hurry!"

Terrible arrows came flying towards them. The man who spoke to me fell
down after being hit by an arrow. The man's back quickly became
discoloured and blackened. It was poison.

"Get those scum!"
The Poisoner's group. Dozens of men and women simultaneously fired
arrows.

The moment we tried to avoid it by moving behind a building, threads of
silk spread out in the air.

Dozens of webs were arranged at once, causing the arrows to become
tangled in the thread and not go any further. Han Sooyoung's eyes widened.

"…What the hell is that technique?"

In fact, it was fired from behind the Poisoner's group. The thread was like
steel wire. The sharpness of the thread caused the legs of people to fly
through the air.

"Kuaaak!"

All the threads were connected to one woman. The woman wearing a tight
black battle suit flew through the air. Two knives stretched out from the
fingers of the woman brilliantly riding the thread of magic.

The woman freely manipulated the length of the thread and she swept away
the Poisoner's group in an instant.

There wasn't any hesitation in her hand. The movements were beyond
beautiful. The combination of stats and skills showed that she didn't have an
ordinary sponsor.

[The information of this person can't be read in 'Character List'.]

[This person isn't registered in 'Character List'.]

She wasn't even on the Character List.

Han Sooyoung muttered. "Hey, that woman…"
I knew without her saying anything. It was because this woman was
someone I knew.

"…Yoo Sangah-ssi?"

I hadn't met her in two days yet she was completely different from the girl I
knew.
             Chapter 83: Ep. 17 – SSS-grade Talent, II


The bodies of her enemies were torn apart whenever Yoo Sangah's daggers
moved.

Amazing.

…Was this really the Yoo Sangah that I knew?

There weren't many skills that could show such power against a large
group.
At the present time, it was probably just Armed Fortress Master Gong
Pildu's Armed Zone and Han Sooyoung's Avatar. Yet Yoo Sangah was
showing such power without such a great skill.

How did she become so strong? What was this talent?

Yoo Joonghyuk spoke as if he had read my thoughts.
–She grew faster because you aren't around. You seem to have no aptitude
for raising your fellow companions. It is the same with Lee Hyunsung.

–…They grew to this extent because I pushed them in the beginning.

Actually, I didn't really believe it but I wanted to say it. Damn, why did she
get stronger when I wasn't around? Why didn't I seem to be much help?

"Hey." A voice was heard. I nodded at Han Sooyoung's words. I couldn't be
overwhelmed by Yoo Sangah forever. In any case, there were many
enemies and Yoo Sangah was alone.

"Yoo Sangah-ssi, this way!"

Yoo Sangah stopped when she heard my words. She clearly hadn't expected
to meet me in this place.

"Han Sooyoung, please."

Han Sooyoung triggered Avatar like she was waiting. Dozens of avatars
disturbed the vision of the Poisoner's group and I safely made contact with
Yoo Sangah.

"Dokja-ssi? How are you…"

"Let's talk after moving."

The group members were chasing from afar. Fortunately, the survivors
seemed to have escaped safely through Gangdong Bridge. The problem was
on our side.

–Go back to the high-rise buildings. The most important step is to go up
and secure visibility.

As expected, Yoo Joonghyuk's judgment was valid. I might've read all of
Ways of Survival but I couldn't make battlefield judgments like Yoo
Joonghyuk. Then Yoo Joonghyuk followed with meaningful words.
–And that woman, you should be careful of her.

Be careful? Who? Yoo Joonghyuk didn't say anything else.

We quickly hid inside a nearby high-rise building. The monsters suddenly
flooded the area, probably due to the turmoil, and just narrowly missed our
tail. They soon gave up and returned to inner Gangdong.

I looked back at Yoo Sangah.

"Yoo Sangah-ssi, are you okay?"

"Yes, I'm fine. Dokja-ssi?"

"Yes, I'm also fine."

It had only been a few days but the conversation was awkward. It felt like I
was meeting an alumni from high school 10 years after graduation. I looked
away from her in her tight battle suit and opened her mouth.

"That, um…"

I couldn't figure out what to ask.

In the meantime, I looked at Han Sooyoung. Yoo Sangah saw Yoo
Joonghyuk being carried on the back of Han Sooyoung's avatar and gave
me an unknown smile.

"Dokja-ssi must've done a lot in the meantime."

It was time to listen to a short story.
After the Absolute Throne was smashed, Yoo Sangah fell to Gangdong-gu.
Fortunately, there was someone who fell with her.

"Gong Pildu was with you?"

"Yes. Ahjussi helped me a lot."

Seeing that she was calling him ahjussi, they seemed to have become quite
familiar with each other.

"Where is Gong Pildu?"

"Two days ago, he was injured while we were fighting the Gangdong-gu
group. It was while trying to save me…"

Many surprising things kept happening today. '10 Evils' Gong Pildu risked
himself in order to save someone else. Yoo Sangah bowed her head and
spoke with difficulty.

"In the end, ahjussi lured them to Han River…"

Yoo Sangah bit her lips and a poisonous expression filled her face. I
suddenly realized why Yoo Sangah killed the Poisoner's group without
hesitation.

I spoke to comfort her. "Gong Pildu is probably okay. Don't worry."

I had a contract with Defense Master so I would know immediately when
Gong Pildu died. I would be penalized according to the terms of the
contract. The fact that there was no reaction meant that Gong Pildu was
alive somewhere.

Like the Poisoner, Gong Pildu was also part of the 10 Evils. It wasn't that
easy for him to die.

"Where did you get those clothes and the dagger?"
"Ah, this…"

After separating from Gong Pildu, Yoo Sangah found the green meteorite.
The green meteorite was a meteorite containing rare items. I checked the
items she had. I remembered that there was a meteorite containing these
items in the vicinity of Cheonho-dong.

[Ancient Assassin's Dagger]

[Rich Cat's Leather Suit]

Both were excellent S-grade items.

The Ancient Assassin's Dagger had the option of increasing damage to
distant enemies while the Rich Cat's Leather Suit increased movement
speed the longer the duration of the attack.

"They are great items."

"Yes, I am able to fight well thanks to these items."

Yoo Sangah smiled and then the quietly listening Han Sooyoung spoke up.

"Hrmm, are you sure that's all?"

"Huh?"

"Let's say that you 'accidentally' got the items. But it doesn't make sense to
have such combat skills with barely any items. Who the hell is your
sponsor? How did you raise 'Quick Movements' or 'Dagger Mastery' so
quickly? It is impossible for the growth to be so fast even with a growth
package."

"…Who are you?"

"Me? It am the 1st Apostle."
Yoo Sangah raised her weapon without speaking. "Calm down Yoo
Sangahssi. This person isn't an enemy."

Yoo Sangah looked at me with disbelief. "Are you friends now?"

"We aren't friends…"

"The Chungmuro group members died because of that person. Surely you
haven't forgotten?"

Yoo Sangah was the deputy of Chungmuro while I was absent.

Therefore, her affection towards the Chungmuro members would be much
deeper than mine. Han Sooyoung said, "Chungmuro? Ah, I see. You are
that woman?"

Yoo Sangah narrowed her eyes at the words.

Han Sooyoung smiled and added, "Hey, Kim Dokja. I am a bad person but I
am also a good judge. She has a big sponsor behind her."

"You…"

"When I saw her at Chungmuro, she wasn't that strong. Isn't it strange? She
can't grow so explosively in such a short period of time, even if she has a
narrative-grade sponsor. Maybe if she has an SSS-grade accelerated growth
skill… How can many constellations can provide such support to South
Korea?"

My heart wanted to deny it but rationally, I knew that Han Sooyoung was
right. There was also Yoo Joonghyuk's words from a short while ago. In
addition, Yoo Sangah had been hiding her sponsor from me.

Yoo Sangah's troubled eyes met mine.

I used to think that Yoo Sangah's sponsor was 'Abandoned Lover of the
Labyrinth'.
The only person who could find the path through the magic room was the
person who handed the thread to Theseus in Daedalus' Labyrinth, 'Ariadne'.

But as Han Sooyoung said, it was impossible for her to grow to such a
degree with Ariadne's sponsorship.

In addition, the movements that she showed while moving through the air
in the previous battle was closer to the Hermes Walking Method than Air
Steps. Ariadne's incarnation couldn't use Hermes' stigma.

I was about to open my mouth when something unexpected happened.

[Haha, everyone! How have you been?]

Dammit… this timing. I immediately looked out the window. A new
dokkaebi was floating in the sky.

[The participants in this scenario are quite hasty. There is still a week
before the start of the scenario and people are already waking up a disaster.
Are you curious about the next scenario?]

It wasn't the level of Bihyung's nonsense but it was still talking nonsense.
Perhaps there was no one in charge so this low-grade dokkaebi took their
place.

[The dokkaebi have left their positions so I will be here for this period…
haha. Now have you all eaten your fill? You do know that this event can't
be skipped, right?]

This wasn't good. It was a really bad development.

[I want to do that but I won't be a dokkaebi if I don't give scenarios.]

The fact that a scenario was appearing now told me one thing.

[The sub scenario – Disaster Prevention has arrived.]
It meant that the outbreak of a disaster was just around the corner.


  [Sub Scenario – Disaster Prevention]

  Category: Sub

  Difficulty: S-

  Clear Conditions: Unknown powers in Gangdong-gu are trying to hatch
  one of the disasters. Defeat them and stop the incoming 'disaster'.

  Time Limit: 2 hours

  Compensation: 22,000 coins

  Failure: Early emergence of the Disaster of Questions.


Since we received the 'Disaster Prevention' scenario, the Poisoner's group
would've received the 'Defend the Disaster' scenario.

The damn dokkaebis were still trying to be part of this unforeseen situation.
I looked at the party members and said, "It isn't the time for us to fight.
Now we have to handle this situation."

Han Sooyoung and Yoo Sangah nodded at the same time.




The Poisoner's group was based in Cheonho-gong of Gangdong-gu. To be
exact, it was an area filled with churches and a cathedral.
If their purpose was to awaken the disaster early, it was a good choice to
choose a religious area. The prayers of those who lost their places would
create an environment suitable for hatching the 'disaster'.

Han Sooyoung finished scouting and opened her mouth.

"The road with the lowest level of terraforming is in the northeast, centered
on the base. It is 16 Cheonjung-ro. If we go this way, we can reach the base
in the shortest time. But the defenses are formidable."

I nodded. We didn't have time so we had to go through the fastest way.

"It's okay. We have to reach that building as quickly as possible. Han
Sooyoung and Yoo Sangah-ssi will take the front. Don't fight each other."

"…I understand."

Yoo Joonghyuk couldn't help right now so I decided to leave him on the
roof of the high-rise building with Han Sooyoung's avatar. His role was to
watch the battlefield. Yoo Joonghyuk didn't express much dissatisfaction.
He just gave this piece of advice.

–If possible, get rid of them before the disaster hatches. Without Way of the
Wind, the initial suppression of the Disaster of Questions is almost
impossible.

Of course, I wanted to do that if possible.

"Let's go."

The moment I gave the signal, we jumped down the building.

Han Sooyoung used Avatar and took the lead. Dozens of avatars jumped
onto the road and attracted the attention of the Poisoner's group.

"What? Kill them!"
As the confused group members chased after the avatars, thin and
transparent thread filled the air.

"Kuaaak!"

The people chasing after the avatars were caught by sharp threads and their
legs were cut off. This wasn't the end. There was another strong thread in
the location where the people fell.

Their heads were cut off and flew through the air.

It was a terrifying double trap designed by calculating the angle of the fall.
Han Sooyoung clicked her tongue.

"She is brutal."

"You aren't someone who should be saying that."

Apart from their feelings towards each other, the combination of the two
was worth looking at. No, it was very useful.

Thanks to their help, I was able to dig into the center of the base while
avoiding their surveillance.

It wasn't difficult to find the disaster meteorite. It was a huge meteorite over
8 meters high. It emitted an ominous aura and seemed to say 'I am the
disaster'.

Certainly, it felt like the fire dragon was no comparison. If I couldn't stop
this disaster, Seoul would surely be destroyed.

Then a woman appeared next to the meteorite. She had hair as white as
snow. As I saw the lips that were like red flowers on a snowy mountain, I
could see Yoo Joonghyuk's taste.

The cold and glassy eyes stared at me and I felt a terrible spirit emerge from
her body.
It made my skin crawl. It was an overwhelming feeling compared to Gong
Pildu.

I see. Did she also receive the power of the disaster meteorite?

"…Who are you?" One of the 10 Evils, the Poisoner Lee Seolhwa asked.
             Chapter 84: Ep. 17 – SSS-grade Talent, III


There were three ways to wake up a disaster meteorite.

One was to let the meteorite hatch in line with the scenario. The second
method was to draw out the power of the disaster meteorite in advance. The
third and fastest way was to supply magic power to the disaster meteorite.

Dozens of Lee Seolhwa's group members were praying.

A faint magic power was flowing out of their bodies into the disaster
meteorite.

The hatching ceremony. They had chosen the third method. Based on the
meteorite's heavy shaking, the disaster would hatch in 30 minutes.

I looked at Lee Seolhwa and opened my mouth. "Won't you stop? Unless
you want to die together."

"…"
"What are you thinking?"

It was strange.

In the third round of regression in the original, there was no one foolish
enough to wake up the disaster, even if they did borrow the power of the
disaster.

Yoo Joonghyuk must've visited Lee Seolhwa in advance because he knew
about it.

"Stop hatching the disaster meteorite. Then I will spare you."

Lee Seolhwa looked at me quietly. "What if I don't want to?"

"You'll die here."

Poisoner Lee Seolhwa had an expression of ridicule on her face. Her hands
moved and the humans praying towards the disaster turned towards me at
the same time.

[The eighth grade outside species 'Lower Human Nam Minhyuk' has
showed hostility towards you.]

[The eighth grade outside species 'Lower Human Jung Minji' has showed
hostility towards you.]

[The eighth grade outside species 'Lower Human Kin Gapil' has showed
hostility towards you.]

Antennae grew on their heads and their hands turned sharp like rakes.
These wanderers seemed to become transformed humans rather than
wolves. There was a worrisome point.

"…It is strange. Isn't transforming humans the power of the disaster
meteorite?"
I murmured at the same time that Lee Seolhwa shouted, "Die!"

The loyalists leaped into their air, their wings spreading out. I aimed the hilt
towards them.

[Blade of Faith is activated!]

[The special option of Unbroken Faith is activated.]

[The ether property is converted to 'fire'.]

White flames split apart the air. All species with insect properties were
weak to 'fire'. The ether flames of Unbroken Faith spread to the skin of the
lower humans.

One to two, two to three.

"Kieeeek!"

The flames burned the skin of the lower humans. I cut off the legs and
wings of the lower humans.

"Kiiit!"

Magic power gushed out and burned the lower humans in a flash. It was the
same in the case of the werewolves. They walked a path other than human
and I didn't receive a penalty from killing them. I broke through the flames
and ran towards Lee Seolhwa.

For the first time, Unbroken Faith was blocked. Lee Seolhwa's fingernails
and forearms were tinged with a dark light.

The power of the disaster increased the level of the stigmas. By borrowing
the power of the disaster, her Poisonous Nails could block the Blade of
Faith. However, that didn't mean she could prevent all damage.

"Kuuack!"
Sparks flew and Lee Seolhwa's body was pushed back a few steps. It would
be strange if this didn't happen.

My current overall stats were the highest among all incarnations apart from
Yoo Joonghyuk. I might have no talent but I wasn't weak among the
incarnations.

"Give up. It won't be good for you if the disaster hatches now. Doesn't this
sub scenario have no penalty for failure?"

Lee Seolhwa looked towards the disaster meteorite nervously. There was a
change in the atmosphere.

It felt like she was aiming at the 'disaster' rather than power from the
disaster meteorite.

It was strange. Even a person who didn't read the original novel would
expect Seoul to be destroyed when a disaster hatched. Then why did she
want to wake up the disaster?

…Damn. I didn't think her condition would be like this.
[Due to the effect of your exclusive attribute, your memories of some
scenes became stronger.]

In my head, pages flipped and the sentences of some pages flowed over my
retinas.

「 There are five dominant species in the world of Chronos. The Velkia in
the east, the Parasites in the west, the Imyuntar in the south and the Mistilen
in the north. Finally, the Inba in the center. 」

I avoided the poisonous attack and kicked her back, causing her to lose her
balance. Lee Seolhwa rolled around the ground and groaned. I watched Lee
Seolhwa and opened my mouth.

"The fifth scenario is a scenario where the 'Disasters of Chronos' was made
into a motif."

Lee Seolhwa's eyes shook as she heard 'Disasters of Chronos'.

"On the day that Chronos was destroyed, the five dominant species of
Chronos elected one hero from each species. The five chosen heroes
shamefully survived the destruction and carried on Chronos' path."

"…"

"They were sent to another world through a contract with the Star Stream.
They came to that world, encountered other species and promised their
lives in exchange for stopping the disaster there."

A non-human cry emerged from Lee Seolhwa's mouth at the story.

"They were called guides."

"…Kit. How does a human of Earth know such things?"

How did I know? I knew because I saw it in a book.
"You aren't Lee Seolhwa."

The disasters were hatching faster than the original. There were no 'humans'
who would do such a thing.

"Parasite Queen Antinus. Why is a guide trying to wake up the disaster?"

Only a 'fallen guide' would dream of such a thing.

[The 5th grade Parasite Antinus is looking at you.]

Parasites were a parasitic species that lived through other species. Now Lee
Seolhwa was being manipulated by one of the guides.

I looked at the dead bodies of the lower humans.

Just like with Lycaon's meteorite, it wasn't the power of the disaster but the
power of Chronos' guide that promoted the human transformation.

"Why are you infecting the humans here? Why are you doing this?"

Kiiik…

"What do you get for waking up the disaster early? Isn't the purpose of the
guides to prevent the disaster along with the people of this world and unite
with us to build a new world? Why are you trying to destroy the
terraformed world?"

Kikik, kikikik…!

"This is an act that violates your mission! It isn't too late so get out of her
body right now. Do the right thing, Guide Antinus!"

If possible, I didn't want to kill Lee Seolhwa. Maybe Yoo Joonghyuk would
do the same.
The Poisoner became one of the Ten Evils after being infected by the
Parasite. Lee Seolhwa might not be one of the 10 Evils if the infection was
removed.

It was why Yoo Joonghyuk's conversation didn't work. He tried to protect
his old lover from the Parasite Queen.

The messages of the Midday Tryst blinked in the air.

–Kill her.

It was Yoo Joonghyuk.

–The important thing isn't her life but the survival of this world. Act wisely,
Kim Dokja.

Due to the far distance, I couldn't see what Yoo Joonghyuk's expression
was like.

He had to worry about this world rather than the woman to whom he once
gave his affection. Maybe this was the nature of a hero.

I said.

–Then you will be unhappy.

–It doesn't matter.

Yoo Joonghyuk's voce was steady and firm. But I knew. If Lee Seolhwa
died here, Yoo Joonghyuk would someday collapse.

Kiiit!

The deaths of his acquaintances would pile up, gnawing at Yoo
Joonghyuk's memories and making his mind weary.

"Kit! You are just a human!"
The Parasite Queen spoke through Lee Seolhwa's mouth. Hatred for
humans was ingrained in her tone.

In fact, I knew why she hated humans so much. However, the situation
wasn't relaxed enough for me to think about her feelings.

"Kit. Die."

Black liquid started to flow from Lee Seolhwa's body. The Thousand
Spirits Poison. This was when Lee Seolhwa's talent started to be shown off.
Black liquid shot from her fingernails towards me.

I took a few steps back while the Thousand Spirits Poison melted the
ground. If Yoo Joonghyuk was an ordinary incarnation, he would've
already become like this ground. Yoo Joonghyuk asked.

–Do you have a countermeasure to the Thousand Spirits Poison?

–I do.

I also wasn't an ordinary person. Strictly speaking, I wasn't an incarnation.
Lee Seolhwa's poison spread through the air towards me.

It felt like it had its own will as the poison freely moved through the air and
found my weakness. A few drops splashed on my thighs and then my
forearms. A part of the suit hit by Thousand Spirits Poison started to melt.

A satisfied smile appeared on Lee Seolhwa's face. However, this was an
early judgment.

I ran through the poison and punched her hard in the belly, throwing her
back.

"Kiiiiiet!"

She flew through the air with a terrible cry.
My skin touched by the Thousand Spirits Poison showed some
discolouration but it soon returned to its original colour. Lee Seolhwa was
upset.

"…Kik, the Thousand Poisons Resistance?"

Horror was in her eyes. Thousand Poisons Resistance was the terror of all
beings who used poison. However, I didn't have Thousand Poisons
Resistance or Immunity to Ten Thousand Poisons.

"Antinus, you don't know the sponsor behind your host?" I put my hand in
my pocket. "That's why you don't know. You don't know but I'm sure its
inside that body. Right?"

After a while, a book appeared in my hands.

[A constellation worried about the degradation of Oriental medicine has
revealed his own modifier.]

[The constellation 'Guam Divine Doctor' looks at you with amazement.]

"Kiiit…?"

[Dongui Bogam- Unfinished Book]

It was one of the greatest Oriental medicine records of the East. The
Dongui Bogam was an item that appeared in the five person dungeon
during the King's Qualifications.

"I had a hard time collecting this."

During the King's Qualifications scenario, all the kings were frantically
trying to get the Four Yin Demonic Beheading Sword.

While the kings coveted the Four Yin Demonic Beheading Sword, I picked
up other items. Many items were thrown away because they didn't know
their value. Among them, I was interested in the Dongui Bogam.
Internal Medicine – 4th part.

External Medicine – 4th part.

Various Diseases – 11th part.

Remedies – 3rd part.

Acupuncture – 1st part.

Table of Contents – 2nd part.

It was a star relic that could be completed after 25 parts were collected.

Unfortunately, I only collected eight pieces but that alone was enough to
see an effect. Even if I only collected eight parts, the Dongui Bogam had
the effect of the S-grade Immunity to Poison Bead.

[The effect of the Dongui Bogam – Incomplete has been activated.]

[Your body has temporarily gained the Poison Resistance ability.]

The baffled Lee Seolhwa shouted.

"How? The Thousand Spirits Poison…!"

"I know. Thousand Spirits Poison is a poison that can't be counteracted with
ordinary poison resistance. But it is possible for the Dongui Bogam. Why
do you think that is?'

[The constellation 'Guam Divine Doctor' is smiling faintly.]

One constellation faintly glowed as if in response.

"It is because the constellation who made the Thousand Spirits Poison is the
author of Dongui Bogam."
             Chapter 85: Ep. 17 – SSS-grade Talent, IV


「 The greatest good person can turn into the worst killer at any time. 」

This was a sentence that described Guam Divine Doctor in Ways of
Survival.

Guam Divine Doctor Heo Jun.

According to the records in Ways of Survival, the task that Heo Jun
devoted his last years to wasn't medicine but poison. Like many great
people who later became constellations, Heo Jun reached a level beyond the
actual history records.

「 "If I make a poison that can kill anyone, I can make a pill that can save
anyone." 」
Heo Jun was banished after the death of King Seonjo and devoted his last
seven years to this question.

Why was poison a medicine for some people and a poison for others? One
day in his last years, he finally reached a mystical answer.

「 "It isn't the body but the spirit that determines the action of the poison."
」

A poison made by analyzing a thousand souls. The result was the heavenly
poison that flowed out of Lee Seolhwa's body, the Thousand Spirits Poison.

Dongui Bogam was actually written from Heo Jun's failure to reach
Thousand Spirits Poison.

"Kiik, kiiik!"

I moved through the Thousand Spirits Poison and dealt a merciless blow to
Lee Seolhwa.

Lee Seolhwa flew through the air. It wasn't hard to defeat Lee Seolhwa if
her poison was disabled.

It was the Thousand Spirits Poison that solidified her reputation as one of
the Ten Evils. If I hadn't got the Dongui Bogam, I would've become a
sacrifice of her reputation…

This time her luck was bad.

[The constellation 'Guam Divine Doctor' is looking at you like he is sorry.]

[The constellation 'Guam Divine Doctor' is looking forward to you dealing
with this properly.]

[300 coins have been sponsored.]
The 'Parasite' infection was irrelevant to Guam Divine Doctor's intentions.
In other words, Lee Seolhwa's attack on me wasn't according to Lee
Seolhwa's will.

By the way, only sponsoring 300 coins…

[The constellation 'Seo Ae Il Pil' is looking forward to you dealing with this
properly.]

[The constellation 'Bald General of Justice' expects you to do your best.]

[300 coins have been sponsored.]

I ignored the response of the constellations and approached Lee Seolhwa.
Lee Seolhwa crawled across the ground with fear.

I could feel Yoo Joonghyuk's gaze in the distance. Yoo Joonghyuk would
probably be hurt badly if Lee Seolhwa died here.

I looked at the fallen Lee Seolhwa and opened my mouth. "Hey."

To be exact, I spoke to Parasite Antinus inside her.

"It would be good if you come out."

"Kik?"

"It isn't too late now. Return to your duties as a guide. Teach people skills
and get along with them."

"…"

"If you work hard, maybe you can become a constellation one day?"

The Parasite Queen, Antinus was a strong hero.
It wasn't possible for her to exert all her strength because she was restricted
by the probabilities. It wasn't impossible for her to become a constellation if
she continued to be a 'guide' and accumulated history.

"You humans… I hate…"

The problem was that she thought of humans as enemies. It was also a
mortal enemy. I glanced at the disaster meteorite that was intermittently
shaking.

"I am sorry that your world was destroyed. But is it necessary to destroy
this
world? Are you going to reproduce the same tragedy here?"

"…All of you will die."

I watched the smiling Antinus and sighed. If she didn't go out on her own, I
would have to force her out.

In fact, I didn't want to use this method. It wasn't just due to the pain Lee
Seolhwa would go through. I didn't want the burden of dealing with
Antinus after she left the body.

I glanced up at the sky. The constellations of the Korean peninsula. I owed
them a debt last time so this time I had to make a concession.

[The special option of Dongui Bogam – Incomplete has been activated.]

[Dongui Bogam – Incomplete has conveyed the essence of Oriental
medicine to you.]

I had an incomplete version of Dongui Bogam so I couldn't do miracles like
making a powerful poison or saving a dying person. However, I could do
simple treatments.

For example, taking a parasite out of a body.
Her body had to be bound for a smooth treatment, so I held Lee Seolhwa's
arms from behind, holding her to the ground. It was a misleading position
but her consciousness was buried deep inside her.

Common sense told me not to go after Yoo Joonghyuk's ex-girlfriend
unless I was a madman. Especially in front of Yoo Joonghyuk's eyes.

[The exclusive skill 'Hit a Pressure Point Lv. 2' is activated.]

I started to press at different pressure points on Lee Seolhwa's body.

Soon after, her skin turned red and I planted a needle made of magic power
into her reacting blood. It was my first time doing this so I didn't know if it
would work.

"Kiiit! It hurts! It huuuuurts!"

Lee Seolhwa howled loudly. I ignored her and kept pressing the pressure
points.

"Kiiit! Kihit! Kyaaaak…!"

Then Lee Seolhwa's screams gradually changed. It changed from the cry of
an insect to a human voice.

The mysterious thing was using Oriental medicine to remove a parasite
from the body. I was embarrassed that a person who had relied on Western
medicine so far was now practicing Eastern medicine.

[The essence of Oriental medicine is effective!]

[The constellation 'Guam Divine Doctor' is looking at you with a warm
expression.]

I got up while Lee Seolhwa gasped for breath.
Yellow mucus was flowing from the glands in her body where poison had
been secreted. The mucus was the main body of a Parasite.

"K…Kuock…"

This would've satisfied the constellations.

[The constellation 'Guam Divine Doctor' thanks you for your good deed.]

[500 coins have been sponsored.]

Lee Seolhwa's eyes slowly opened. Consciousness had returned to her eyes
but there was still no focus.

It was because she had been infected with a Parasite not long ago. She
wouldn't be able to see my face right now with her five senses half dead.

"You… who are you?"

I was well aware of the events that would happen if I answered this
question. A similar thing happened when Yoo Joonghyuk saved Lee
Seolhwa in other rounds. That's why the important thing wasn't my identity.

"I was sent by Yoo Joonghyuk."

–Kim Dokja. Don't do anything unnecessary.

Yoo Joonghyuk's angry voice pierced my ears. Lee Seolhwa's expression
changed.

"…Yoo Joonghyuk? Who is that?"

"You will soon find out."

Poisoner Lee Seolhwa had to become part of Yoo Joonghyuk's group.
After the prophets appeared and the Absolute Throne broke, the flow of this
world was slowly changing from what I knew.

It was difficult to make the mistakes of the original but it was also hard to
see the future that I didn't know.

That's why it was necessary to balance the important events directly. Some
things flowed the same while others flowed differently.

There were twists and turns but in any case, I thought that this 'round' was
approaching the ideal approximation that I was thinking of. And the
Poisoner… No, Immortal Doctor Lee Seolhwa could be one of the greatest
set points of this approximation.

"Kim Dokja, this side is done!"

I turned around and saw Han Sooyoung and Yoo Sangah approaching this
way. Amazing. The two of them swept up that many people?

It might be a situation where the Poisoner was missing but they were still
the 'Poisoner's Group'…

The original plan became meaningless. The two of them might be
comparable to Lee Jihye's Ghost Fleet and Gong Pildu's Armed Zone.

"Wait, don't come over here."

I had to restrain their movements. It was difficult if they didn't have
immunity to being infected. This fight hadn't ended yet.

Kiiiit… human…!

The mucus that escaped from Lee Seolhwa's body gathered in a ball at one
point in the air.

Parasite Queen Antinus. She was scary in parasitic mode but even scarier
when she didn't have a host.
The mucus moved like a small bug and formed a shape. It was a body made
of nutrients that had been absorbed for many years. It was a body with
beautiful curves and solid muscles.

She had dragonfly-like wings and a tail that resembled a scorpion. She was
covered in an insect's shell apart from the face, but she looked more like a
bipedal creature than an insect.

The real battle started now.

"Get away before you are infected!"

The sharp tail aimed for my stomach.

[The effect of the Dongui Bogam – Incomplete has been activated.]

[Your body is immune from a parasitic infection.]

It was so fast I couldn't avoid it despite having over 50 agility. I narrowly
caught the tail before it pierced me. But if it hit, I would've definitely got a
hole in my stomach.

Kik.

She used the fact that I was holding her tail to fly towards me and hit me. I
was knocked onto the ground and a strong pain filled my body.

Strong. She became even stronger when she wasn't in a host. The power of
her main body was comparable to a 5th grade insect king species.

Once Antinus unleashed her fighting power, it was equivalent to the
deteriorated fire dragon I once killed.

It might be destroyed but she was still the hero of her world. She was as
strong as Lycaon who emerged from the yellow meteorite.

This didn't mean I had no chance.
It was a clear violation of the scenario rules for the 'guide' to cause such an
uproar before the fifth scenario ended. It wasn't just killing a few people.
She even tried to hatch a disaster, which meant she had given up on her
probability.

The sign of a probability storm was already descending on Antinus' body.

As time passed, the collapse of her body would accelerate, even if I didn't
attack. It was a fight I could win if I just bought time.

Kiiiiit!

The problem was how much time I could buy before dying. At this
moment, the Protection Symbol of the Imyuntar started shaking.

Ah, that's right. There was this. I held my aching body and said to her, "I'm
sorry but I'm not your opponent."

As I spoke, a flash of silver light crossed the sky, causing a sonic boom.
The gorgeous mane scattered in the air as something landed in front of me
with a loud roar. The being was over three meters tall.

Lycaon, Prince of the Imyuntar, stood up.

"I'm sorry for the delay, Protector."
              Chapter 86: Ep. 17 – SSS-grade Talent, V


Prince Lycaon of the Imyuntar paid respect to me before immediately
turning to look at Antinus.

I couldn't feel reassured because the other world species were companions.

"Antinus."

"Lycaon…"

"What the hell is this?"

The queen of the Parasites just laughed.

"Have you forgotten your mission? Why are you fighting the humans of
this world?"

"Kikik, mission? Was there something like that?"

Lycaon's expression became determined at her teasing tone. "We are the
'guides'. We have to tell the people of the other worlds the right way to face
the disasters that are coming."

"You have already been spellbound by the dokkaebis. Wake up Lycaon."

"You are the one who needs to wake up Antinus!" Lycaon's voice was
furious. "Have you forgotten the sacrifice of the Chronos warriors? Have
you already forgotten the moment when the five ruling species was
destroyed? We are here to stop the disasters. Work with the species here to
defend the terraformed planet and rebuild Chronos' civilization in this
world! It is our sacred mission!"

Rebuilding Chronos' civilization. Antinus no longer laughed. "Lycaon, it is
impossible. This planet will perish. It is the fate of the scenario."

"No, this time will be different." Lycaon glanced at me. "The Protector has
stopped a disaster before all the disasters woke up. He has the medallion of
my people as proof. Perhaps there is a way to prevent the destruction."

"If it was a deteriorated disaster, we could've stopped it at any time."

"Earth is now only in the fifth scenario! There is no planet that has stopped
a disaster before the fifth scenario began. Think about it Antinus! There is
still hope for this planet!"

Antinus' compound eyes slowly blinked. The cry of an insect was boiling
inside her. Her cry was full of anger.

"Don't be so arrogant. You came here to stop the disaster? If you really
wanted to help them, why didn't you start when the disaster's destination
was set to 'Earth?'"

"That…"

Han Sooyoung quietly approached me while listening to their story. "These
guys, what are they saying now?"
Han Sooyoung didn't know the details of this scenario. The guides didn't
have such an in-depth conversation in the original third and fourth
regression. Now they were talking about something vague.

Antinus continued speaking. "Lycaon! You are like me. We came to this
planet for revenge! We will return the same disaster to those who brought
us the disaster!"

"If you do that, you will die. The probability of the Star Stream won't
forgive the 'guide' for going against it.

Antinus laughed. "Lycaon, I died with my kind on Chronos."

"…It doesn't make sense." Lycaon exposed his fangs. "Antinus. The
conversation ends here."

"Kikikik! Lycaon! Poor wolf of the Imyuntar! Have you forgotten the
history of Chronos? The wolf has never once won against the insects!"

The battle between the prince of the wolves and queen of the parasites
began.

Grrrrr!

Lycaon roared. The flow of ambient air was different. Some winds were
fast while some winds were slow. Sometimes there was no wind and
sometimes it was strong wind.

"I'm not the Imyuntar you knew!"

The winds in the surrounding area started to press on Antinus. Lycaon was
finally showing his Way of the Wind that had evolved one step.

"Kiiit… interesting! I'll check to see how your 'way' has grown!"
Antinus was the first one to move. The air barrier created by Way of the
Wind and Antinus' tail hit each other. Sparks filled the air and the sound of
leather tearing was heard.

Han Sooyoung and I looked up at the sky, spellbound for a moment. This
was the fight between fifth grade species. It was the confrontation of those
who showed a superior physique to humans.

Antinus quickly made her way through the gaps in the atmosphere and
arrived in front of Lycaon. Antinus' tail underwent an external
transformation into a wedge and rushed to Lycaon.

It was only one attack but it could mean the difference between defeat and
victory. But at this moment, Antinus' movements slowed down. It was like
a repulsion force was pushing at her tail.

Kihit?

On the other hand, Lycaon's movements were slightly faster. His attacks
suddenly accelerated. Antinus' tail struck empty air.

[The 5th grade species Parasite Antinus has activated Accelerating Wings
Lv. 8.]

Antinus' wings spread open and vibrated before she disappeared.

The S-grade movement skill, Accelerating Wings.

Her wings flapped thousands of times per second and she instantly
appeared in front of Lycaon, as if she had teleported. Antinus' arms turned
to scythes and flew towards Lycaon's back.

[The 5th grade species Parasite Antinus has activated Praying Mantis
Breakthrough Lv. 8.]
The accelerated scythes struck the atmosphere wall, causing a terrible burst
of noise. It was so fast that it seemed like even Lycaon couldn't avoid it.

Even so, Lycaon evaded. At the decisive moment, Antinus' attack slowed
down while Lycaon's movements accelerated. It was the difference between
life and death. Antinus' compound eyes blinked with surprise.

Yoo Sangah asked with surprise, "What type of technique is that. Instant
Acceleration?"

"No, that is the Way of the Wind."

The secret technique of the Imyuntar, Way of the Wind.

At first glance, the two of them seemed to change speed but this was
actually Lycaon's ability. The surrounding atmosphere flowed according to
Lycaon's will.

"Kit, this damn wind…!"

Antinus also noticed. There was wind on the path that she moved. Antinus
was caught in the wind and Lycaon used the wind.

It was a skill that controlled the movements of Accelerating Wings while
avoiding Antinus's Praying Mantis Breakthrough. The roads made of wind
could be used for evasion or to attack.

This was why I needed this skill. If I learnt Way of the Wind, I could
replace the necessary skills with that one skill. Lycaon roared.

"Queen of Insects! Kneel in front of the wind!"

The wolves of the wind. The sharp claws of the wind tore at her wings,
while a gale like kick hit her abdomen. His blow was filled with the wind's
acceleration and struck the upper part of Antinus' shell.

"Kyaaaack…!"
Antinus' lost half of her wings and she fell down. Perhaps if it wasn't for the
enlightenment I gave him, Lycaon wouldn't have been able to defeat
Antinus now.

I thought it was only good for others but it turned out to be helpful for me.
The sign of a probability storm on Antinus' body became stronger.

"Kiiit! It won't end like this."

Antinus attempted a landing with half her wings.

–Kim Dokja! Kill her! Quickly!

I was already running towards Antinus when I heard Yoo Joonghyuk's
voice.

[Blade of Faith is activated!]

It was possible to be caught up in her probability storm but that wasn't
important right now.

"My world, my race, my children!" She was heading in the direction of the
disaster meteorite. "The cost of destroying my world, I will absolutely make
you pay it!"

She shot all her magic power towards the disaster meteorite.

Lycaon ran to block the magic power while I swung the fire property Blade
of Faith towards Antinus' neck.

The insect's mouth became a smile of ridicule. Was it blocked? I turned my
head and saw Lycaon's pale face.

"Grrr…Protector, sorry…"

Then all sound disappeared.
Light burst from the disaster meteorite and a huge explosion struck me. One
of the fragments of the exploded meteorite struck my head. The world
shook. Lycaon flew away from the explosion.

The 'guide' couldn't withstand the force of this disaster. It was impossible to
rewrite the history of 'defeat'.

The balance of the world was collapsing.

[You have failed to clear the scenario.]

[The 'Disaster of Questions' has come to your world.]

My vision darkened and I was buried under a pile of shattered building
fragments. I barely came to my senses when Yoo Joonghyuk's voice rang in
my ears.

–Kim Dokja! Wake up! Hurry!

–…Recover your spirit.

–Get moving! Now you can still stop the disaster!

I honestly thought it was too much. I didn't have Way of the Wind and the
Disaster of Questions had hatched. It was better to consider a different route
than to carry out a suicide attack.

Yoo Joonghyuk opened his mouth like he read my mind.

–You, are you that weak?

–What?

–All the words you told me were false.

I reflexively raised my body. This bastard…
–The one who told me not to give up on this world will succumb to a
disaster of this degree?

Laughter emerged. I had to hear this from Yoo Joonghyuk, not anyone else.
Suicide wasn't enough to get rid of the shame.

–Of course not. I was just thinking for a second.

The damn Yoo Joonghyuk was right. It was too early for me to say that was
'impossible'.

I emerged from the pile of building fragments. The eight meter tall disaster
meteorite had split in two. It was obvious that something had hatched from
it.

I looked around quickly but couldn't see the disaster.

"Hey, this is…" Han Sooyoung approached me with a restless expression.

I couldn't see Yoo Sangah. Then I heard a voice.

"This place…"

There was a boy around a dozen steps away. He looked like a high school
student. He was completely naked without a stitch of clothing. The boy
muttered.

"This is… perhaps?"

The boy stretched and looked around like he couldn't believe it. I listened to
his murmurs and thought that I had to kill him right now.

However, my body couldn't move.

[An early hatching has weakened the Disaster of Questions.]
[Due to the early hatching penalty, you won't be able to attack the Disaster
of Questions for three minutes.]

Dammit…

We were the ones being penalized? That dokkaebi scum, what was he
doing?

The boy walked around the area and arrived in front of a woman nearby. It
was a woman who was part of the Poisoner's group.

The boy shouted in a clear voice towards the woman. "Woman! Hey, are
you okay?"

"U-Uh… who…"

"Excuse me, can I ask you something?"

No. She shouldn't answer that question. I wanted to shout but my voice
didn't come out.

"Where is this place? What year is it now?"

"W-Why all of a sudden…"

"Are you asking me a question back?"

The boy's strange tone seemed to bewitch the woman.

"T-This is Seoul and… the current year…"

A system message was heard the moment the woman answered.

[The first question has been resolved.]

[The first seal of the returnee 'Myung Ilsang' has been released.]
"Ha, haha… Hahaha!"

"W-What is that…?"

The boy laughed wildly at the confused woman and asked, "Do you know
how much I suffered? Do you know?"

"H-Huh?"

"Have you lived for 100 years? In a place where I was the only human…
Do you know that there are other dimensions?"

"Other… dimension?"

"Disgusting insects, werewolves and bird people… I have a problem. Can
you guess what it is?"

The confused woman shut her mouth. The boy asked, "Insects, wolves,
birds. Which of these three races are the best?"

"What… the best?"

Once the woman asked, the boy laughed like he was dying with joy. It was
a creepy laugh.

"Then… who among the three has the most delicious meat?"

I listened to the Disaster of Questions and thought. Yes, it might be natural
that Antinus wanted to destroy Earth. It was because a 'human' of Earth
destroyed her world.

The woman didn't answer the boy's question.

"P-Please, spare me…"

There was a sound and the woman's head flew away. The boy chuckled and
looked around.
"Now, there is this development. What, an S-grade incarnation? Those
scum are squeezing this kid. It is also a heavy duty alliance. No wait, before
that…"

[The early hatching penalty has ended.]

[The power that controlled your movements has disappeared.]

Shit. It was too late. I was about to yell when the boy disappeared and
moved to a remote location. Unfortunately, it was a place where
another woman was standing. "Haha! Noona is pretty! Yes?" I cursed.

–Yoo Sangah, avoid him!

Yoo Sangah raised her dagger and asked cautiously, "…Who are you?"

The boy grinned at the question.

"Are you curious?"

The boy's hand grabbed Yoo Sangah's chin at a speed that couldn't be seen.

"Should I tell you?"

One of the five disasters that destroyed Chronos, the Disaster of Questions.
He was a 'returnee' of Earth transferred back to this world.
            Chapter 87: Ep. 17 – SSS-grade Talent, VI


Returnee. This was the first statement that mentioned them in Ways of
Survival:

「Some people go back in time, others go to another dimension and some
are born again. In the end, the way to adapt to destruction varies from
person to person. 」

The second 'method' of 'How to Survive in a Ruined World'. To survive,
destroy other dimensions and return.

"Answer me. Are you curious about my identity?"

Returnee Myung Ilsang. This boy was a returnee from Earth who was
summoned to be a warrior in the world of Chronos.

"Hmm…isn't it normal to blush and lower your eyes in this situation?
Noona is looking straight at me?"
The Disaster of Questions was such a bastard.

Yoo Sangah opened her mouth. "What…"

–Yoo Sangah-ssi, don't answer the question!

Yoo Sangah's head turned towards me at my words. However, her chin was
caught by Myung Ilsang and forced her to look back.

"Where are you looking? Look at me. Is that your boyfriend?"

"Remove your hand."

Yoo Sangah shook off Myung Ilsang's hand. Her dagger moved in a
threatening manner through the air. Myung Ilsang laughed.

[The second question has been resolved.]

[The second seal of the returnee 'Myung Ilsang' has been released.]

"Ah, that's right. I've had a baby-face for 100 years."

The boy's cold eyes turned towards me. I didn't use Omniscient Reader's
Viewpoint but it was clear even without the skill.

"You were having fun in this peaceful world?"

His right arm aimed at me. At the same time, purple particles condensed
around his hand.

[The character 'Myung Ilsang' has triggered 'Small Black Fire Cannon'!]

Black Fire Cannon. This was the fire of death that destroyed the eastern
part of Chronos and burned all the insect kings in the forest.
The whole atmosphere was burning and I was surrounded by flames. Pain
spread across my skin. I cursed inside my heart. Damn! It hurt. It really
hurt. It hurt…

…Less than I thought?

After a while, the flames turned off and I looked at my skin. Every inch was
scorched and painful, but it was a bearable pain.

This was the black fire cannon that drove the insect kings to fear? However,
the Small Black Fire Cannon… it didn't hurt?

I looked up and saw Yoo Sangah wielding her dagger. Unexpectedly, she
had the advantage. Even the Disaster of Questions was perplexed by the
overwhelming attacks.

"…What? Why are you so strong? Is noona also a returnee? Or am I
weak?"

I didn't understand. The original Disaster of Questions with two seals
released should be stronger than this.

  questions. But you are still going to die.


I was nervous about the constant 'SSS' filling the screen but once I read it in
detail, I understood why he was weak.

The dokkaebis were fair. Right now, he was weaker than the original
disaster.
"Han Sooyoung! Yoo Sangah-ssi!" I didn't know if Bihyung was using his
strength but now we had a chance. "Attack with all your strength! We must
kill him now!"

If this was his current state, perhaps we could win without Way of the
Wind. I poured my remaining coins into my stats.

[Physique Lv. 50 -> Physique Lv. 60]

[Agility Lv. 50 -> Agility Lv. 60]

[Magic Power Lv. 25 -> Magic Power Lv. 60]

[39,500 coins have been consumed.]

[All stats have reached the scenario limit.]

I ran aggressively while activation Unbroken Faith.

"Remember! You should never answer his questions!"

Myung Ilsang seemed interested when he saw my Blade of Faith. "What?
An energy sword?"

My attack missed by a hair's breath due to his high agility.

Myung Ilsang kept chattering. "Ahjussi, are you a martial artist? How
can you use the energy sword already? Isn't this crazy?" I ignored him
and triggered a stigma.

[The stigma 'Song of the Sword' has been used.]

[Your sword is filled with the words left by the Duke of Loyalty and
Warfare.]
A random verse of Duke of Loyalty and Warfare's story appeared in front
of me, followed by a message.

「 The 28th day. Clear skies. I went to do official business. 」

Then nothing happened. Dammit, the Duke of Loyalty and Warfare didn't
help me at this time.

The Nanjung Ilgi didn't always contain content that fought against the
enemy. In fact, most of the contents were ordinary.

The sky was clear.

The Duke of Loyalty and Warfare went to do official business.

If I wrote a 'Destruction Diary', my diary would roughly be like this.

The sky was dark.

Kim Dokja was right.

I rolled across the ground to avoid Myung Ilsang's kick.

Myung Ilsang's expression gradually became serious. He carefully looked
at my Blade of Faith and sighed with relief.

"Phew… that's right. It isn't a real energy blade. Ahjussi, why are you
acting like it is real? You almost scared me?"

"Brat, you talk too much."

It was a cold female voice. While I was stalling for time, Han Sooyoung
made dozens of avatars and they ran towards him.

"Die!"
Han Sooyoung's attacks poured onto the boy whose movements were
blocked.

However, her attacks weren't strong enough to harm Myung Ilsang's body.
Rather, Yoo Sangah was unable to do any damage due to the excessive
number of avatars.

Myung Ilsang laughed as he was hit by Han Sooyoung's small hand.

"Aren't you also quite pretty? How old are you? A student?"

"Shut up, die!"

Myung Ilsang's face was marred by the continuous hits.

"…What is wrong with everyone? What did I do wrong? If you see a
nicelooked returnee like me, shouldn't you welcome me with open arms?
Should I get rid of all the monsters from now on?"

"What a mad dog!"

"Ah, were my words ridiculous? Wait a minute, perhaps you are…"

Myung Ilsang's expression changed.

"You guys are from the Hunters Association! Right? Isn't there normally
this development? Aren't they always the first one to show up with a
returnee comes back?"

"This chuuni bastard… no, shit?"

[The third question has been resolved.]

[The fourth question has been resolved.]

[The fifth question has been resolved.]
[The third seal of the returnee 'Myung Ilsang' has been released.]

Myung Ilsang smiled and nodded.

"You are from the Hunters Association."

It was really crazy. His momentum became even stronger. The surrounding
avatars were destroyed by a powerful wave of energy emitted from Myung
Ilsang's body.

Myung Ilsang burst out laughing. "Now, it is the munchkin's time!"

Han Sooyoung stepped back and glanced at me with an absurd expression.
"What is with that bastard?"

I gasped with irritation. "Didn't I tell you not to answer him? You are just
feeding that jerk."

"I didn't answer! I just swore."

"Just don't speak."

The point of the questions asked by the Disaster of Questions wasn't to get
an answer. No matter what the answer, he would use it to strengthen his
abilities.

Myung Ilsang kept speaking, "Then who should I kill first?"

But his words didn't last. It was because Yoo Sangah appeared behind him
while emitting a fierce killing intent.

[Hermes Walking Method].

[Theseus' Resolution].

[Arachne's Web].
The system messages didn't pop up but I was able to recognize these skills.
In a future scenario called Ragnarok, these skills were clearly described.
They were the stigmas of the Olympus related constellations.

The surprised Myung Ilsang unleashed a series of Small Black Fire
Cannons to keep Yoo Sangah in check.

However, Yoo Sangah rushed towards Myung Ilsang without caring
about the black fire cannons. "Something like this…?" It was
impossible.

As long as they didn't experience a special scenario event, there was no way
for an incarnation to simultaneously possess the stigmas of various
constellations.

It was a situation where I only had two stigmas. Then how could Yoo
Sangah have such a large number of stigmas?

"Let's try it! Does it hurts?"

Sweat covered Yoo Sangah's forehead.

The thread of magic power kept expanding and shrinking. She stepped
freely through the air. The dagger pierced without hesitation whenever
there was a visible gap. The vitality inside her body was burning.

It was an extraordinary change in just two days…

At this moment, I sensed something. The stigmas of various constellations
in one incarnation.

There obviously wasn't a single case in Ways of Survival. It didn't even
apply to Prophet Anna Croft of the United States. Then Yoo Sangah…

"Dokja-ssi! Now!"
Yoo Sangah gave the signal and I supported her explosive attack with the
Blade of Faith. Han Sooyoung also participated. Little by little, Myung
Ilsang became dizzy from all the hands and feet.

His movements were delayed for a moment and my Blade of Faith aimed at
the gap, cutting his shoulder and belly.

"Shit…!"

Blood flowed out. Myung Ilsang pulled back and chanted something.

[The character 'Myung Ilsang' has used Blink Lv. 1.]

Myung Ilsang's figure became blurry. My mind was in a hurry. He couldn't
get away.

I aimed the blade at his waist. But his body faded away just as the blade hit.
The only thing left was scattered blood.

[The constellation 'Secretive Plotter' lets out a sad sigh.]

[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' is going crazy from
all the sweet potatoes.] (Sweet potato is slang for when something is so
frustrating that there is a stuffy sensation)

[The constellation 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' is pointing a finger at
your heart.]

[The excitement of some constellations has reached a critical level.]

Han Sooyoung shouted, "Shit, we missed him!"

"It's okay. He is injured so we can catch him soon."

[Some constellations have calmed down.]

"Yoo Sangah. You did really well… Yoo Sangah-ssi?"
There was no answer from Yoo Sangah. I headed over because I sensed
something strange, where she was standing there stunned. Han Sooyoung
asked,

"What's wrong with her?"

I belatedly realized. Theseus' Resolution was a skill that drew out all the
power of the incarnation. The use of that skill allowed Yoo Sangah to deal
with a monster for a while.

I looked at her for a moment before handing her over to Han Sooyoung.

"Giving another person to me? Am I a daycare center?"

"We need to find the disaster quickly. Shouldn't you scatter more avatars?"

"I think I roughly know where he went."

"Please guide me."

I couldn't miss that guy here. Han Sooyoung opened her mouth again, "I
don't remember well… He becomes stronger every time he answers a
question, right?"

"That's right. He is weak at first but becomes stronger every time he hears
an answer. The returnees are too strong so there is a penalty when they fall
into this world. Didn't you see the seals being released?"

"That boy… how many seals does he have?"

"Perhaps dozens. There will be no answer if he releases all of them."

So far, five seals were released.

Fortunately, the additional scenarios of the dokkaebis hadn't come down
yet.
If an additional scenario was released, many people would try to hunt that
bastard and his seals would be released in a flash due to the many idiots
answering his questions.

…The moment I was feeling relieved.

[Hrmm. Everyone, aren't you great? Despite the penalty, this is still a
disaster. Only three people putting pressure on him…]

Han Sooyoung and I looked up at the air at the same time.

[By the way, aren't you being too greedy? As the old saying goes, you
should share the beans.]

"Shit."

Han Sooyoung cursed while messages arrived like they had been waiting.

[A new sub scenario has arrived!]

[The sub-scenario – SSS-grade Hunt has begun!]

I grasped the handle of Unbroken Faith. The situation was reaching the
limit.
              Chapter 88: Ep. 18 – A Reader's Fight, I


The dokkaebi's voice rang out.

A group of low-grade dokkaebis were looking down like they were
watching a burning house. Bihyung's figure could also be seen. He whistled
when he met my eyes.

The dokkaebi in the middle of the crowd slowly opened his mouth and
spoke to all of Seoul.

[Incarnations of Seoul! I have to tell you unfortunate news. Unfortunately,
due to the actions of some people, one of the disasters has woken up in
Gangdong-gu.]

The dokkaebi smiled as he met my eyes. This bastard?

[Ah, the sound of your sighs can be heard from here. I can see people who
are already leaving Gangdong-gu. Haha, everyone. You should listen to the
end. You will regret it later if you run away now. This disaster is definitely
an opportunity for you.]

The dokkaebi spoke in a loud voice.

[Haven't you been having a hard time gathering coins? I know it all. Your
life collapsed overnight and now strange existences are taking your coins.
The people who were friends yesterday are suddenly stabbing you today.
I'm glad I'm not you. Right now, the stars in the sky are probably tell you,
"Hey, shake your ass a little better. I'll give you 100 coins."] [A handful of
constellations are giggling and laughing.] The dokkaebi didn't laugh.

[I understand that you feel like shit and hate these jerks. Since the world is
destroyed, you just want to live the way you want. You are very courageous
but you feel a sense of helplessness when you realize that this world is
divided in two. You feel disappointed when you realize that your
constellation, which was barely obtained after shaking your ass, is inferior
to the constellation of a successful person. You feel angry about the unfair
world. I'm well aware.]

[Some constellations oppose the dokkaebi's speech.]

Speaking of which, this dokkaebi wasn't ordinary. A low-grade dokkaebi
with weak courage wouldn't be able to say this. Their channel would be
ruined if there was a backlash from the constellations.

But this was only for minority channels. The bigger the channel, the more
different the dokkaebi.

They knew the laws of the story. They couldn't tell a big story if they were
only obsessed with subscriptions. A true storyteller must deal with the
'person' rather than the 'audience'.

I closely observed the dokkaebi who was still talking.
[I have prepared something for all of you. You who are unlucky, lucky or
worked hard, you have a chance to become 'someone' overnight.]

The pointed horn on the crown. The leg shown through the white cap
looked like a one-legged crow.

Wait a minute, surely this bastard wasn't…Dokgak?

At this moment, a huge screen appeared in the air. A bleeding boy fleeing
was shown on the screen.

[Now, this boy you are seeing is an SSS-grade item walking around! Are
you looking at him from head to toe? His name is Myung Ilsang. He was
fortunate enough to be picked by the Star Stream to go to another world.
Can you imagine it? Imagine being summoned to another dimension,
suddenly receiving a powerful strength, spending a hot night with a cute elf
girlfriend, saving the world and being loved as a warrior! That's right. This
damn guy is the 'disaster' you have to catch today.] It was somewhat
strange.

I was wondering why a low-grade dokkaebi replaced the position of an
intermediate dokkaebi. It was because he was the dokkaebi of a major
channel.

[I can already hear your resentment. How the hell can you kill an
SSSgrade? Haha, there is no need to worry. This guy currently has a
penalty on him. His powers are sealed. He is strong but he is a treasure
chest if you hit him all at once.]

"…He is creepy." Han Sooyoung clicked her tongue. As a writer, she had
already grasped the dokkaebi's intentions.

If a disaster was called a disaster, no one would come. Then what if the
disaster was a treasure chest?
[Your life hasn't been ruined yet. Rather, I can say that you have good luck.
The sub scenario that I offer now will be a great stepping stone to reverse
your life. Now, the chance will only be for one day! Move immediately!
Only those who move the quickest can become the owner of an SSS-grade
item!]

As soon as they heard this, the incarnations scattered throughout Seoul
would gather in Gangdong-gu.
[The sub scenario has been updated.]


  [The sub-scenario – SSS-grade Hunt]

  Category: Sub

  Difficulty: B ~ ???

  Clear Conditions: Get rid of the SSS-grade Myung Ilsang.

  Time Limit: None

  Compensation: 50,000 coins, ???

  Failure: The fall of Seoul Dome.


The worst scenario was beginning.

Perhaps due to the failure result of the scenario shining red in the air, the
huge reward that had never been seen before seemed insignificant.

"Quickly find him before everyone dies."

"…Won't he be affected by probability?"
"The probability is offset to some extent by the interest of the
constellations."

This was why dokkaebis preferred exciting scenarios. The stories that many
constellations wanted offset the probabilities. Of course, it would be the
responsibility of the dokkaebis if it failed, but this situation was different.

[The eyes of many constellations are shining.]

If it went as Dokgak planned, Seoul would end before the fifth scenario
began. Han Sooyoung immediately used all her magic power to summon
the avatars to search.

Five minutes passed before Han Sooyoung shouted, "I found him. He is
2km northwest from here!"

I ran along the road with Han Sooyoung and soon heard voices.

"Over here! There he is!"

"That brat went this way!"

There were already people flocking. Myung Ilsang was laughing as he
was surrounded by a group of people. "Uh… right. Here I am."

"You jerk! Are you having fun?"

"I'm having a lot of fun…"

"This fuc…hey! Kill him!"

It was surprising to see so many humans with an inferiority complex.
Myung Ilsang avoided the swords waving through the air and asked, "Are
you jealous and want me to send you to that other world?

"What, you will send me there?"
"Of course. I will send you. You really want to go right?"

"If I can go then of course I want to go! It is better than this shitty world…"

Myung Ilsang nodded and extended his right arm towards the crowd.

[The eighth seal of the returnee 'Myung Ilsang' has been released.]

[The ninth seal of the returnee 'Myung Ilsang' has been released.]

·····.

"Then go well. Although I have no idea if it is better than here."

"What?"

[The twelfth seal of the returnee 'Myung Ilsang' has been released.]

[The thirteenth seal of the returnee 'Myung Ilsang' has been released.]

[The fourteenth seal of the returnee 'Myung Ilsang' has been released.]

·····.

I felt a sense of hopelessness as I watched the messages appearing in the
sky. It was too late.

"Because that place, I destroyed it."

[The character 'Myung Ilsang' has triggered 'Small Black Fire Cannon' Lv.
3!]

I grabbed Han Sooyoung and rushed behind a building.

A violet flash overturned the forest of buildings. Up to half a dozen high-
rise buildings were hit and an entire street disappeared. Those who ran
towards him disintegrated without leaving even bone dust behind.
A single entity that could be a disaster. This was the real strength of a
returnee.

Han Sooyoung collapsed beside me. "Crazy… how do we defeat that?"

This was real fear. It was fear that caused our bodies to shake, rather than a
skill. I spoke in an effort to resist it. "We can win."

"Don't speak nonsense and let's go back. We can never kill that guy."

"No. I can catch him. We will be better off if I kill him now'.


[The character 'Han Sooyoung' has used 'Lie Detection Lv. 2'.]

[The character Han Sooyoung has confirmed that the statement is true.]

Han Sooyoung's eyes widened. "…Really? You couldn't kill him before."

"A person who only thinks about one thing, how can you live?" I was only
speaking a half truth. In fact, the original plan was to defeat the Disaster of
Questions and build up a second narrative.

The problem was that my plan was based on learning Way of the Wind.

"Does anyone else want to go to the other world? Raise your hands! I will
send you!"

People screamed and ran away. Myung Ilsang was getting closer.

Then Yoo Joonghyuk's voice was heard from a translucent window.

–There is no chance if you fight him head on.

–I know. But I still have to try it.

–Why did you make the situation like this?
–What?

–You had many chances. You could've killed Lee Seolhwa. Or if you had
killed Antinus with Lycaon, you could've stopped the disaster.

I couldn't give any excuses. I didn't kill Lee Seolhwa because of Yoo
Joonghyuk and I didn't fight with Lycaon because I couldn't find a gap.

–I'm not a regressor like you. I have to be careful in case of failure. If I
don't think until the end…

–Careful? Don't be so cocky. Do you think you are a constellation?
Knowing the future doesn't mean you can control everything.

I felt like someone had punched me. Funnily enough, I thought that Yoo
Joonghyuk's words were right.

[The exclusive skill, 'Fourth Wall' is in use.]

It was arrogance from knowing the future. I thought I could somehow make
it even if the story was distorted. Maybe that led to the current situation.

–Then why don't you fight a little?

I couldn't answer.

–Don't use having no talent as an excuse. Not having the Way of the Wind
doesn't mean you can't win.

–I can win?

Yoo Joonghyuk was silent for a moment. The moment I was about to break
the silence, Yoo Joonghyuk's voice continued.

–My attribute is a 'pro gamer'. What is yours?

–What?
–I'm asking what can you do well?

…What could I do well? There was a tickling feeling somewhere deep in
my head. I felt that I was missing something important. But there was no
time to think.

"I've found you! You haven't left yet."

Myung Ilsang whistled as he rounded the corner. Han Sooyoung groaned
while I stepped back.

"…Uh?" The Hunters Association people from before?" Myung Ilsang
laughed. "Great. I really wanted to meet you. Don't you know that my
wonderful debut plans were ruined because of you?"

"…"

"I was trying to live well. Kill some S-grade incarnations, defeat the bad
groups and love the pretty noonas. But what is this? I have completely
become a villain. What should I do?"

I grasped my sword instead of answering.

[The stigma 'Song of the Sword Lv. 1' has been used.]

[Your sword is filled with the words left by the Duke of Loyalty and
Warfare.]

「 Today I am prepared for death. I pray to God in Heaven, may I destroy
the enemy. 」

The Duke of Loyalty and Warfare's words recorded in his war diary.
Fortunately, the Duke of Loyalty and Warfare took my side this time.
[The stigma 'Song of the Sword' has been used.] [The

decision to die has improved your fighting power.] I

squeezed out all of my magic power at once.

[Blade of Faith is activated!]

The Blade of Faith burst out. I ran towards him. Myung Ilsang's hands
lightly struck the Blade of Faith.

The splitting pain caused me to loosen my grip. It was only one blow but I
could clearly know it. The overall stats of Myung Ilsang had already
exceeded the limit of this scenario.

"What, you want to fight? Really? Didn't you just see me fighting?"

I looked at him laughing and was reminded of Ways of Survival. What
could I do well? It was to 'read'.

[Exclusive skill, Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint stage 1 has been

activated!] Then I started to hear his movements.

「 Right shoulder. 」

「 Left thigh. 」

The strikes still hit me despite me reading the moves. The fists surrounded
by a purple light ruthlessly poured towards me.

「 The belly, the belly, the belly, the belly.」

Blood poured from my mouth and my vision shook. I didn't give up. I
thought and thought again.

[The character 'Myung Ilsang' admires your spirit.]
[Your understanding of the character 'Myung Ilsang' has increased.]

The information contained in Ways of Survival alone couldn't beat him. It
was different from when I hunted the Dark Keeper. I couldn't fight despite
calculating everything.

「 Strong, weak, torso, head… 」

Too much information poured in at once, causing my dizziness to worsen.
This was despite borrowing the power of the stigma. At this rate, the battle
would be over in no time. I wiped the blood at my mouth and backed away.

…Did I have to use Ganpyeongui? I felt bitter that the last method I had
was to borrow the power of the constellations. If I called a powerful
constellation, I could probably win.

However, there was a burden of the probability after the last incident and
most of all, I didn't like to owe the constellations.

Damn, I wish I had talent. It would be preferable if I could steal someone's
talent.

…Eh? Wait. Steal? A dull shock filled my head. So far, my main weapon
was 'information'. However, there was so much 'information' that I actually
forgot some of it.

Pathetic. Why the hell did I forget about this skill? Wasn't this the first
thing I should've done?

[The exclusive skill 'Bookmark' can now be activated.]

As expected, Yoo Joonghyuk's name wasn't on the list. The main character
was the main character. Special conditions must be met before he was
unlocked.

In addition, people who weren't characters like Han Sooyoung, Yoo Sangah
and Lee Gilyoung weren't on the list.

It didn't matter. They weren't the people I needed right now. I scrolled for a
bit and finally found the person I wanted.

There he was. Why did I forget that he was also a 'character'. I didn't
hesitate to put him in the fourth bookmark.

[The level of the Bookmark skill is low, shortening the activation time.]

[Activation Time: 30 minutes]

[Your understanding of the character is significant. You can select some of
his skills to import.]

I chose a skill. The next moment, a silver storm emerged around my body. I
felt the courage of a wolf nestle in my body.

Damn, I felt like a fool. What had I been trying to learn so far? I wasn't a
regressor or a returnee.

[The character 'Prince Lycaon of the Imyuntar' has been registered on
bookmark 4.]

[The number four bookmark has been activated.]

I was a 'reader'.

[Way of the Wind Lv. 8 has been activated.]

And this was the way I fought.
               Chapter 89: Ep. 18 – A Reader's Fight, II


As I felt the refreshing wind wrap around my body, I recalled the sentences
that appeared in Ways of Survival.

Han Sooyoung was summoning avatars when she noticed the skill I was
going to use.

"What? I thought you didn't learn this?"

"Step back."

Way of the Wind.

「 There is a gale in the right hand and a storm in the left hand. The Way of
the Wind will be opened when the straight lines and the curves meet. 」

The sentence that I couldn't understand became a reality the moment I felt
wind at my toes.
Myung Ilsang's fist suddenly approached my nose.

The attack that should've hit was meaningless. The overwhelming power of
this skill filled in my lacking stats. This was the secret technique of the
Imyuntar.

Myung Ilsang's eyes shone.

"…Huh? You sped up?"

I didn't answer as I focused on enlightenment. From now on, it was a fight
against time. The remaining time for Bookmark was 30 minutes.

"Aha, I understand. Is it the skill of those wolves?" Myung Ilsang laughed
at me. "Did you receive a great enlightenment that allowed you to use this
shitty skill?"

"…"

"Do you know? I killed the king of those guys with my own hands."

Of course I knew. I remembered the creatures of Chronos who died.

Prince Lycaon of the Imyuntar, Parasite Queen Antinus…

The fate of those who survived their destroyed world was to be used in the
scenarios unfolding on another planet. I would be in the same situation as
them if Earth was destroyed.

A Medium Black Fire Cannon shot from Myung Ilsang's right hand.

「 One wind will meet another wind to form ying and yang. Once again,
one wind will meet another wind to form the principles of negative and
positive.
」

I used all my imagination to put these words into images.
Hot and cold wind swirled in front of me and the direction of the wind
started to twist.

The black fire was deflected once it hit the wind and energy spread in every
directions.

All ether attacks were propagated through a medium. If the root of the
medium was dispersed, the attack would have no choice but to go back.

Myung Ilsang looked surprised. "…Pretty good. You must have some
talent?"

Myung Ilsang once against started to flee.

[The character 'Myung Ilsang' has used Blink Lv. 4.]

It was another Blink. However, it wasn't hard for me to pursue him. Once I
closed my eyes and concentrated on the wind, I could read everything near
me.

I ran along the street at a speed that matched Yoo Joonghyuk's Red Phoenix
Shunpo and found Myung Ilsang. He was grabbing people randomly and
asking them questions.

I kicked off the steel frame of a building and flew towards Myung Ilsang. It
was a blow that would crush bone but he stood up.

[The twenty-fourth seal of the returnee 'Myung Ilsang' has been released.]

His next seal was released by a hair's breadth.

"…It was ticklish?"

Myung Ilsang spoke in a playful manner. He believed that he would win
anyway. His wounds were healed by the seal being released and as time
went by, more of my magic power was being consumed.
"Hahaha, try to stop me!"

In fact, I couldn't kill him if I used Way of the Wind as a buff skill. If this
alone could defeat the Disaster of Questions, Chronos wouldn't have
perished in the first place.

I had to do 'it'. The problem was… someone needed to buy time for me to
use this technique.

…Huh? Something suddenly fell from the sky diagonal to me. It looked
like a descending hawk as it pierced through the air towards Myung Ilsang.

There was a terrible explosion and a small crater appeared. A familiar
person was seen where Myung Ilsang was lying on the ground. I looked at
the man with a wide mouth and muttered, "…Yoo Joonghyuk?"

Didn't this bastard say he would take two days to recover? I looked at the
approaching Yoo Joonghyuk and reflexively stepped back. Surely he wasn't
planning to hit me right now?

However, Yoo Joonghyuk stopped a few steps in front of me and turned
around.

"Get started." Yoo Joonghyuk stood before me as if he knew what I was
trying to do. "I'll block him."

Han Sooyoung muttered on my behalf from where she was lying nearby.
"Ha, shit. As expected from the protagonist…"

But unlike her words, Yoo Joonghyuk appeared to be in a dangerous state.
His body was still unsteady and the blood vessels on his body were still
bulging.

Meanwhile, Myung Ilsang stood up from the crater, laughing while
coughing up blood.
"Ah, it is a bit annoying…"

He wasn't badly damaged despite the impact. It was unbelievable that he
was on the weak side of the 'returnees' who would appear.

Myung Ilsang ran forward and Yoo Joonghyuk met him.

Then I invoked Way of the Wind.

「 Four winds meet and form a defense. Then another four winds are
added, making it the Eight Trigrams. Therefore, wind is everywhere yet
exists nowhere'. 」

It was my turn to use the verse that gave Lycaon enlightenment. The
mysterious air wall in the shape of an octagon started to swirl.

It was a small dome of space. The tight seal choked me.

From now on, it was a fight against time. Yoo Joonghyuk flew back from a
blow while Myung Ilsang's expression hardened. He finally realized that
this wasn't a game.

"What…?!"

The next moment, all the air in the dome was removed. My ears became
blocked and all sound disappeared. The wind blew terribly but the dome
was as calm as the eye of a storm.

Myung Ilsang opened his mouth.

"…!"

"…?"

He moved his mouth several times but his voice wasn't heard. Sound wasn't
possible because there was no medium.
He was in a complete vacuum. Due to the difference in air pressure, the air
in my lungs momentarily escaped. I quickly sucked it back in.

Outside the dome, Han Sooyoung was shouting something.

[Exclusive skill, Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint stage 2 has been
activated!]

「 What is this? 」

I could hear Myung Ilsang's thoughts.

「 Why don't I have a voice? Magic? 」

Myung Ilsang was shouting with confusion. It was natural. All returnees
had a penalty. This was especially true for returnees who could quickly
recover their original strength under certain conditions.

[The penalty of the Disaster of Questions is activated.]

[The power of the returnee 'Myung Ilsang' has been weakened.]

[The twenty-fourth seal of the returnee 'Myung Ilsang' has been locked.]

「 Uwaaah, no! 」

They had the condition of being 'weakened' as easily as they were
'strengthened'.

[The twenty-third seal of the returnee 'Myung Ilsang' has been locked.]

Why did the Disaster of Questions keep asking questions? It was simple.
His abilities would weaken if he didn't ask questions.

「 Shit! Release this! Quickly release it! 」
His fist hit the wall of air many times but the wall didn't break easily. In a
space without a medium, the black flames didn't burn.

[The twenty-second seal of the returnee 'Myung Ilsang' has been locked.]

A vacuum prison that could be made using Way of the Wind. This was the
optimum strategy against the Disaster of Questions that I knew.

「 Uwaaaaah! 」

Myung Ilsang belatedly rushed towards me. He thought that the vacuum
prison would be broken if I died but it wasn't the case. This was a place that
I made.

I used Way of the Wind to avoid his attack and quickly reduced the area of
the prison.

Once the wall shrank, I made a narrow passage and escaped outside the
dome with Yoo Joonghyuk. Now Myung Ilsang was the only one left inside
the dome.

「 …You jerk! 」

A returnee wasn't a returnee for nothing. The dome cracked a little bit under
his power. I raised my hand and the wind filled in the weak spot. Then the
size of the dome started to shrink rapidly.

Blood flowed from my nose due to my excessive concentration. My
ultimate goal was to limit the vacuum prison to his body.

However, it wasn't easy to control. Shit, Yoo Joonghyuk had managed it
easily. Why was this so difficult?

"Don't try to control it. You must lead the wind." Yoo Joonghyuk's voice
was heard.
At that moment, I received enlightenment. Maybe it was my mistake to
make a 'wall'. The important thing was to remove the medium around his
body.

「 U-Uwaaah, uwaaaaah! I'm choking! 」

Myung Ilsang frantically scratched at his neck, causing himself to bleed.

"…Pretty good. Although you still aren't very talented." Yoo Joonghyuk's
voice was heard again.

Then Myung Ilsang attempted his last hurrah.

[The character 'Myung Ilsang' has used Great Black Fire Cannon Lv. 3.]

Myung Ilsang's right arm was surrounded by dark flames. To my surprise,
the great flames shot through the dome of wind.

I fell down while protecting Yoo Joonghyuk's body. A dull impact filled my
head. Myung Ilsang seemed to be squeezing out his remaining magic power
as the black fire cannon continued.

But the wind wasn't still. Once the black fire cannon was fired through the
dome, wind instantly filled up the spot again.

The last hurrah didn't change anything. The problem was that people were
dying from the black flames.

Yoo Joonghyuk saw my face and said, "Kim Dokja, don't think about
it. They wouldn't care if you died." "There are people like that'.

But not everyone was like that. I got up and confronted the black flames.

The black flames were scattered and twisted by the power of the strongly
rotating dome. A terrible pain followed. It was because I intercepted the
majority of the black flames.
The black flames burned my skin and the sensation in my bones faded little
by little.

I could do it. He wasn't strong right now. At this moment, I reached an area
beyond my limits. As my senses became faint, my body was like the wind.

[A constellation who loves effort enjoys your pain.]

[A touch of talent sleeping in your soul has blossomed.]

I controlled the vacuum prison with my left hand while moving the wind
with my right hand to dissipate the energy of the black flames. In a
complete trance, I tasted new heights in Way of the Wind. The wind at my
fingertips was creating a landscape I had never known before.

[The thickness of the exclusive skill 'Fourth Wall' has temporarily thinned.]

It was a strange feeling. This was how the 'characters' saw the world.


No matter how hard I read the text, I didn't know what to feel. I felt that a
part of the narrative that was felt through the pages touching my fingertip,
which I could never fully reach, was now completely understood.

Reading was different from understanding. Maybe I still didn't understand
one percentage of this world yet.

Soon afterwards, I felt the power of Myung Ilsang's black flames weaken.

「 Shit! Scum! Die! Diee!! 」

The momentum of the black flames was rapidly declining. In addition, my
magic power was still full.

It was a strange feeling. Even if I was in a trance, how could I have this
much magic power left?
Behind me, Yoo Joonghyuk said, "…I will kill you."

…Somehow I had absorbed Yoo Joonghyuk's magic

power. Then after a while, Myung Ilsang's attacks ceased.

[All seals of the returnee 'Myung Ilsang' have been

locked.] Yoo Joonghyuk and I looked at each other.

[The exclusive skill 'Way of the Wind Lv. 8' has been released.]

The fear-stricken Myung Ilsang stared at us.

"C-Cough, cough…!"

I threw Unbroken Faith towards the man who was gasping for air and trying
to run away.

"Kuheeok!"

He fell down with the blade in his back. He wouldn't be able to escape with
Blink anymore. I ran over and grabbed his neck.

"…Hah, it is really frustrating not being able to speak. Have your questions
finished?"

"Keeeok…"

"I will kill you if you ask me a question right now. Don't ask anything."

Returnees. The most arrogant and brutal existences in Ways of Survival.
Among the returnees, Myung Ilsang was one of the worst.

"Now I don't want to hear one sound from you."

Peeok! Peeeok-!
"Kuaaack!"

Myung Ilsang looked up at me like it was unfair. I hit him again and again
until that fear was completely crushed. The beaten up Myung Ilsang barely
managed to say, "I-It can't be like this…"

I looked at this guy and remembered when he was a warrior.

「 "I-I am a warrior? I am a real warrior? Really?" 」

The 17 year old high school student, Myung Ilsang. The innocent boy who
was chosen as a warrior to save the world and fell onto Chronos.

He obviously didn't want to become like this. He didn't want to be a
murderer that wiped out life on a continent. But he did so.

"It is you who chose to become a disaster."

Now he couldn't change that fact.

[Your understanding of the character 'Myung Ilsang' has increased.]

Myung Ilsang's face distorted. "I, obviously, p-protagonist, this, world…"

The man who wanted to become a protagonist but failed in the end. The
real protagonist soon approached and slammed a blade into his head.

I looked into the eyes of the man killed by Yoo Joonghyuk. It was a futile
death for the disaster that destroyed a world.

[You have won against a 'returnee' for the first time in the scenario!]

[Contributor: Kim Dokja, Yoo Joonghyuk]

[You have earned 40,000 coins as an achievement reward.]

[A new item will be added to your story.]
[The narrative 'Person who Opposes the Miracle' has been added.]

[You have obtained the possibility of a new stigma.]
             Chapter 90: Ep. 18 – A Reader's Fight, III


I looked at the system messages that appeared after Myung Ilsang's death.
He left this world with just a few lines of messages.

[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' is satisfied.]

[The constellation 'Secretive Plotter' nods with slight discontent.]

[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' is greatly pleased with your
story]

[Someone has recommended your scenario to the Star Stream.]

[25,000 coins have been sponsored.]

I got up and slowly looked around.

Gangdong-gu was ruined. The disaster had only briefly passed but the
ground was destroyed and the tall buildings collapsed.
On the road lit by the glow of the sunset, people covered with black dust
crawled out. They were all people who ran here to obtain items. People who
wanted to be the protagonist but had to remain as 'characters'.

Some people held their injuries while others wiped their tears. I could also
see people bowing down to me. However, most people were lying on the
ground as cold bodies.

I had read all of Ways of Survival. I understood the settings, the meaning of
the explanations and finally thought that I had figured out the author's
intentions. But in Ways of Survival, there were no sentences describing
these deaths.

I turned and saw Yoo Joonghyuk watching the same scene as me. Perhaps
Yoo Joonghyuk had seen this scene alone many times.

"Yoo Joonghyuk." He turned to look at me. I rolled the words around the
tip of my tongue for a bit before shutting my mouth. "…It is nothing."

The scenarios would continue in the future and I would see this moment
many times. I would encounter scenes that weren't expressed in the text
several times.

Then a translucent window appeared in front of me and I heard an
unexpected message.

[The dokkaebi 'Dokgak' has invited you to his channel.]

…Who was inviting me to a channel? I was confused for a moment but
decided to ignore it. Then the message flashed again.

[The dokkaebi 'Dokgak' has invited you to his channel.]

I looked up at the air and saw one dokkaebi looking down at this side. It
was a one-legged dokkaebi with an unpleasant smile. Bihyung was behind
him with a terrible expression and looked between us. There was a gap
even among dokkaebis of the same rank.

…Yes, I had a rough idea of this situation. I took a deep breath and
deliberately spoke in a loud voice, "What? You won't give me the
rewards?"

Dokgak's eyebrows twitched at my words. However, his mouth was still
relaxed.

[Oh, of course. I'm sorry. I made a mistake.]

Dokgak was a scary dokkaebi. He wasn't silly like Bihyung but had a
different constitution from the intermediate dokkaebis. Not just anyone
could be a streamer of a major channel.

[The sub-scenario – SSS-grade Hunt has ended.]

[The compensation settlement will begin.]

[You have obtained 50,000 coins as compensation.]

I felt better when I received a huge number of coins. This scenario gave me
50,000 coins in one go. It was a great scenario.

Given the fact that sub scenarios were formed at the discretion of the
dokkaebi, most of these coins would come from Dokgak's pocket. I thought
his stomach would hurt but Dokgak was smiling softly.

[It is a great pleasure to see interesting stories. How can I not be amused?]

He muttered like he read my mind. Well, he had a big channel in Tokyo
Dome so this level of coins being bled wouldn't matter.

Why did he leave Japan now? Chances were high that great players like
Oda Nobunaga or Miyamoto Musashi would still be active. Yes… was he
full because the incarnations in his house were so busy?
"Then give me the extra compensation quickly. Is this all?"

[Ah, of course. I should naturally give it to you. You are the one who made
this scenario interesting.]

I became somewhat angry at his sarcastic tone. If it wasn't for this bastard,
the Disaster of Questions would've been a lot easier. Bihyung glanced at me
from behind and communicated with me.

–Hey… you know.

However, Dokgak interrupted Bihyung before his words could be
conveyed.

[Bihyung, prepare the compensation.]

Bihyung made a surprised and angry sound.

[Huh?]

[Prepare for compensation. Do I have to tell you twice?]

Look at this? Bihyung hesitated before opening his mouth again. [You are
currently in charge of the sub scenario…]

[How interesting Bihyung. You dare act like this in front of the
incarnations?]

A fierce aura started to crush Bihyung's body. The power of the dokkaebi
depended on the size of the channel.

[It seems to be true that the size of your channel has grown lately.]

Bihyung shrank back as Dokgak kept talking.

[N-No! It is a misunderstanding!]
[You do know that the sixth scenario involves Korea and Japan together?
Have you already forgotten?]

[I-I'm really sorry. I'll prepare it right away!]

[Get started right away.]

[Yes!]

I didn't feel good because Bihyung was the one managing my channel. To
be honest, Bihyung and Dokgak's relationship seemed similar to how Song
Minwoo bothered me during high school.

[Additional compensation settlement will begin.]

[You have acquired Protection Symbol of the Parasites as a basic reward.]

[An additional selection reward exists.]

[You are the largest contributor to this scenario.]

[You have the first choice of additional compensation.]

I saw a translucent catalogue appear in front of me. Once again, it was quite
useful to catch a disaster.

[Infinite Dimension Space Coat] – SSS-grade.

[Dark Fire Half-Gloves] – SSS-grade.

[Sylphid's Jump Boots] – SSS-grade.

Triple S-grade compensation items. I quickly looked at the options of the
items.

The Infinite Dimension Space Coat had a special option of a 'inside pocket
space' that allowed it to hold many things.
Dark Fire Half-Gloves greatly amplified skills with the dark and fire
attributes.

Finally, Sylphid's Jump Boots allowed me to use the 'jump' effect three
times a day.

They weren't star relics but it was enough to go to the 10th scenario. People
might say, 'It is SSS-grade but it is only to the 10th scenario?' But the world
of Ways of Survival was originally like this.

The item grade inflation was substantial in the world of Ways of Survival.
The difference in performance of the items obtained in the early stages to
the middle stages was huge, despite having the same grade.

Of course, it wasn't necessary to throw away SSS-grade items now but
special materials would be needed to transcend equipment.

This was why it was good to have star relics. Unlike other items, star relics
didn't need transcendence. Once scenarios opened, the star relics would
recover their inherent power that was beyond the constraints of probability.

[…Please choose a reward.] Bihyung told me with a grouchy expression.
He was exhausted by the harassment.

At this moment, I heard Bihyung through the dokkaebi communication.

–Personally, I recommend the Infinite Dimension Space Coat. There is one
more hidden option. It is easier to transcend later.

He was working as my manager. The quick-witted Dokgak was staring at
Bihyung.

[Bihyung?]

[…Yes!]

[You must explain the items to the constellations. Have you forgotten?]
[I-I understand!]

Bihyung quickly started to explain the items to the constellations of Seoul
Dome. I used this break to talk to Yoo Joonghyuk. "Yoo Joonghyuk, what
are you going to choose?"

I had first choice but I decided to give it to Yoo Joonghyuk since I received
his help.

…Of course, this was if Yoo Joonghyuk didn't hit me into the ground.

"Yoo Joonghyuk?"

He didn't answer. He was just staring at me.

"Did you pass out again?"

I waved my hand in front of his eyes several times but his pupils didn't
change.

[The character Yoo Joonghyuk is currently using Recovery Hibernation Lv.
3.]

…Indeed, it was abnormal for him to move with that body. His body must
be half broken to be able to use Recovery Hiberation. I couldn't just pick so
I left a message with Midday Tryst. Han Sooyoung watched by my side and
interrupted, "…Perhaps I should choose instead?"

"Only if you want to be hit by Yoo Joonghyuk later."

Han Sooyoung became silent in an instant. I spoke to Bihyung, "I will
choose Infinite Dimension Space Coat."

However, the answer didn't come from Bihyung. Dokgak nodded and
turned off the catalogue with a flick of his fingers.
[You have picked a good item. Then let's go the payment area.]

Payment area?

[The additional compensation can't be paid here.]

Look at this.

"Where are you going to take me?"

[I'll take you to my 'Dokkaebi Official Post'.]

The Dokkaebi Official Post.


In folk tales, it was a type of clothing but here it was different. It was a
'room' that all dokkaebis had. It was a room that hid their true colours.

"That is a problem. Just give it to me here."

It was their unique space. I didn't know what to expect. As far as I knew,
there was no procedure regarding moving to a Dokkaebi's Official Post in
order to receive additional compensation.

It was obviously this guy's suggestion to go to his official post. Bihyung
was watching me anxiously from next to him. I watched Dokgak with
narrowed eyes.

[Hrmm… do you want me to cancel the additional compensation?]

"Try it."

The scenario's compensation was a fixed rule of the Star Stream. Even a
subscenario made with a dokkaebi's discretion couldn't take back an item
that was given after the scenario was over.

A smile flashed on Dokgak's face.
[How interesting.]

–This isn't a good idea.

The dokkaebi communication opened.

As Dokgak opened his mouth, I heard him saying two different things.

[Kim Dokja. I've heard your story. You are so famous that the
constellations of the lands beyond the peninsula know about you.]

–I know about your contract with Dokkaebi Bihyung. But among the
dokkaebis, it is possible to 'transfer incarnations'.

[I've heard that you act proudly in front of dokkaebis and today I have
discovered that the rumour isn't false.]

–I will speak bluntly. Come to my channel. I am going to expand my
channel to the Korean Peninsula. I will be happy to meet your desired items
and conditions.

Interesting. He made me a scouting proposal in this manner. The suggestion
from Dokgak could be seen as moving from a team in the Asian League to
a top team from La Liga.

It was an attractive offer. The problem was… the transfer. I knew this guy
called 'Dokgak'.

"I might look like this but I'm actually really scared. I'm trembling
while talking to you like this. So give me the item quickly." Dokgak's
expression hardened at my words.

[How interesting. You are humble.]

–You are too arrogant. You will be humbled one day.
"…What does that mean?"

–Bihyung's channel will soon disappear.

A laugh emerged from Dokgak's mouth.

[Then it can't be helped. I originally wanted to announce this after paying
the 'compensation' but I'm sorry.]

…An announcement? What announcement?

Dokgak looked up at the sky. He looked at the constellations emitting light
and slowly opened his mouth. His voice seemed to echo in all of Seoul.

[I have regrettable news for the constellations who have watched the
scenario with interest so far.]

The low-grade dokkaebis quickly withdrew from Bihyung's vicinity.
Bihyung made a bewildered expression. It wasn't good whenever the
dokkaebis acted like this.

[Unfortunately, among the channels operating in Seoul Dome, there is a
channel that has been illegally manipulating the scenarios.]

[Many constellations are paying attention to 'Dokgak's words'.]

[It is the #BI-7623 channel of Dokkaebi Bihyung. As a result of a survey,
the low-grade dokkaebis in Seoul Dome have concluded that 'probability'
has been infringed due to excessive channel scenario manipulation.]
…Wait, what?

[On behalf of the low-grade dokkaebis of Seoul Dome, I am formally
asking the Bureau to determine the 'probability conformity' of this channel.]
             Chapter 91: Ep. 18 – A Reader's Fight, IV


Han Sooyoung asked with a dumbfounded expression.

"What? What does this mean? Why did he suddenly mention the
probability?"

"He is arguing needlessly."

"Arguing? Why?"

Why? Was it because I rejected his offer? Dokgak floated in the sky and
reported to the Bureau.

The probability judgement…

I didn't think it would be used in this way. I expected the dokkaebis of other
big channels to start a fight but I didn't expect it to be like this.
Bihyung's face turned red and he was tearful as he looked between me and
Dokgak. It looked like tears would burst out as soon as he was touched. –
W-What? What do I do now?

–Tell me honestly. Did he find out about our contract?

Bihyung shook his head.

–Did he notice you opening the Dokkaebi Bag?

–T-That can't be.

–Really?

–P-Probably…

–Well, don't panic yet. Even if that is the case, it isn't something that is
worth asking for a 'probability conformity request'. In the first place, it isn't
a violation of regulations.

It was true. There was no precedent in which an incarnation made a 'stream
contract' or could use the 'dokkaebi bag', so it wasn't a direct violation of
Star Stream's regulations.

Bihyung belatedly nodded with relief.

–Y-Yes. I understand.

Seeing this childlike Bihyung, I didn't know if he was the dokkaebi or if I
was. I looked at Dokgak and the low-grade dokkaebis again.

[The #BI-7623 channel manipulation has been reported.]

[The Bureau is currently discussing this issue.]

If I was right, the probability request would eventually be cancelled.
Although the story would be different if Dokgak had 'evidence' for this…
He was hiding information and I had no way to figure out what it was. Then
there was only one way left.

"Hey, can you stop stalling and quickly give me my reward? Don't you see
that the constellations are becoming bored?"

[That is a problem. This is more important than the compensation payout.]

–Have you changed your mind? If you agree with my proposal, I will get
rid of all of this for you.

I looked up at Dokgak. Yes, let's try a frontal confrontation.

"What are your concerns? Let me look. How is the channel I belong to
illegally manipulating the scenario? Is there any evidence?"

I would find out what his evidence was if he had it. If he was bluffing, the
situation would end immediately.

Dokgak smiled like he had been waiting.

[Do you really want to hear it? You will regret it.]

"Tell me."

[This issue involves you, Kim Dokja.]

"…Me?"

At this moment, I had a thought.

Was it because I used future information from the text? But due to the
filtering, this information shouldn't have spread to the constellations or the
dokkaebis. Otherwise I would've already been caught in a probability
storm…

[Do you see the screen?]
A huge screen appeared in the air. The screen showed videos of my recent
battles. The first screen showed my conflict with Poisoner Lee Seolhwa.

[This is proof.]

"…What is the proof?"

The screen just showed that I didn't kill Lee Seolhwa. Dokgak changed the
screen.

[This is also proof.]

The second screen showed me watching the battle between Lycaon and
Antinus. What was this…

[This is the third proof.]

On the third screen, I was attacking the Disaster of Questions, Myung
Ilsang.
It was a scene where Myung Ilsang continuously released his seals.
Suddenly, my stomach felt pained.

[What do these screens have in common?]

I realized it at this moment. This guy wasn't talking to me right now.

[Constellations looking at the screens, do you have any idea?]

Everyone in the area became quiet.

[The fight against the Poisoner, the fight against Antinus and the fight
against the Disaster of Questions. There is one thing these three fights have
in common.]

Then the screen kept changing.
[He actually had a chance to kill the Poisoner and stop the disaster.]

His finger pointed to the Poisoner.

[He could stop the disaster by killing Antinus.]

Then he pointed to Antinus.

[He could've stopped the Disaster of Questions before the seals were
released.]

He pointed to Myung Ilsang then he pointed towards me.

[But he 'deliberately' didn't do it.]

"Wait! You are now…!"

Now I noticed what Dokgak was trying to do. Goosebumps covered my
entire body.

I see. This was what the dokkaebi was planning.

[Constellations. Incarnation Kim Dokja colluded with the channel's
streamer, 'Bihyung'. He deliberately concealed his strength and manipulated
the development of the scenario. He made the scenarios harder for
malicious purposes.]

Then the final screen appeared. It showed me using Way of the Wind to
stop Myung Ilsang.

[He did this to 'direct' the last catharsis.]

This bastard, he didn't intend to ask for the 'probability conformity request'
from the beginning.

Dokgak…
This was his real purpose.

[It is just to rip off coins from you.]

It was the end of Bihyung's channel.

[Some constellations are silent.]

The evidence that Dokgak exposed didn't violate the terms of the
'probability conformity judgment'. Dokkaebis controlling incarnations to
make a scenario interesting wasn't uncommon.

The problem was the constellations who hated it. The moment they thought
I wasn't serious about the scenario, the constellations would lose interest.

It was like alienating them from the play. The moment the fourth wall
between the audience and the character collapsed, the audience would cool
off straight away.

This was what Dokgak aimed for.

[The constellation Bald General of Justice's mouth is gaping open.]

[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' is chuckling.]

[The constellation 'Secretive Plotter' shrugs like it is fine.]

Some constellations were astonished, some constellations had no idea and
some constellations were silent.

The problem was the other constellations.

[Some constellations have left the channel.]

[Constellations questioning the fairness of the channel has left the channel.]
[Some constellations are requesting coin refunds from the channel.]

The constellations left and Bihyung's channel started to shrink.

[The size of the channel is reduced.]

The messages continuously popped up. Bihyung's pale body was becoming
smaller. His horns were shrinking.

I eventually sighed. "The channel is dead."

There was only one way left. I looked at the dwindling number of
constellations and spoke to Dokgak.

"I understand so give me the compensation when you are done talking. I
will accept your offer."

Dokgak's lips curved upwards.

–You are smart.

Bihyung's eyes grew wider with disbelief.

[Y-You…!]

"Don't look at me like that. It can't be helped." I shrugged while speaking in
a loud voice.

Bihyung's lips trembled from the betrayal. This child was scared.

–Bihyung, do you trust me?

–What…

–Trust me this once. Aren't you already ruined?

I finished the communication and spoke to Dokgak.
"Start moving."

[Good. Then let's have a sweet rewards time.]

Dokgak flicked his fingers and the surrounding landscape disappeared. We
reappeared in a room reminiscent of a luxury hotel suite.

…This was his 'official post'? I looked around a bit nervously. Low tables
and chairs suitable for a dokkaebi were placed over luxurious rugs. There
was a wide variety of alcohol on one side. Later I realized that it was a
suitable setting for a dokkaebi who liked to drink.

I finished looking around and approached the window. The landscape
outside was…

Oh my god. A darkness with no end filled my vision.

Glittering stars flowed in the darkness of the grand universe. It was a
superb vision of the grand universe like endless jewels. The constellations
repeated their orbits and rotations, each one part of the huge galaxy.

It was funny that at his moment, I was purely impressed. This was the Star
Stream. It was the flow of the great stars that governed all scenarios. Every
story began here.

"It is great." I looked back and saw Dokgak standing there. "Sometimes I
just stare blankly at this landscape. I never get tired of this sight."

"You are now…"

"Ah, are you surprised? This is my 'real' voice."

It was the first time I heard the dokkaebi's voice. Previously it was always
heard through a broadcast. In other words, the sight before me was
Dokgak's real 'body'. Dokgak's eyes shone.

"What are you thinking about?" I asked.
"What do you think? Ah, do you think I'll kill you?" He burst out laughing.
"You know that is impossible."

"I'm not crazy enough to fight against a dokkaebi either."

"I like it. Then let's start the contract."

Dokgak flicked his fingers and a dokkaebi with a contract appeared before
him. It was Bihyung. He was tied up by the system and stared at me with
reproachful eyes.

"I brought Bihyung as a notary. In any case, you have to break the contract
with him to form a contract with me. The cost of the destruction will be
covered by Bihyung."

I was a bit surprised. This guy, he knew about my contract with Bihyung. It
meant he knew from the beginning that I was a good person to attract the
'find an incarnation' group.

I pretended to be calm. "Do as you like. I don't care."

"It is good that the story is fast. Would you like to check the contract? It is
also my first time making such a contract."

I read the contract. Needless to say, the contract was completely full of
adverse conditions for me. Donations would be distributed 5:5. There were
also some conditions that bound my freedom. Even now, I was the 'gap'
instead of the 'eul'.

Dokgak laughed. "How about it? This is the industry average but I can
make some adjustments."

It sounded like the industry average. Bihyung also tried a similar contract in
the beginning.
I nodded and said, "Well, it isn't bad. But before I sign the contract, I have a
suggestion."

"Suggestion? What is it?"

"Isn't it a shame if I'm the only one moving channels? Surely you won't be
satisfied with just one thing? There are some strong constellations in my
channel."

"Hoh? Who are they?"

"Prisoner of the Golden Headband, Abyssal Black Flame Dragon,
Demonlike Judge of Fire…"

Dokgak looked surprise at each modifier.

"Prisoner of the Golden Headband? I didn't think you would have
such constellations… Bihyung, you are quite good." Bihyung hissed
through his gag.

I continued speaking. This was the most important part.

"Honestly, I don't want to leave these constellations behind in this channel.
Therefore, I want you to build a bridge so that the constellations can move
channels with me."
              Chapter 92: Ep. 18 – A Reader's Fight, V


[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' will judge your sincerity.]

[The constellation 'Secretive Plotter' is somewhat annoyed.]

[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' is actively giving off
annoyance.]

[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' asks if you really
want to move channels.]

Dokgak smiled like he was interested.

"A bridge?"

"Connect your channel to me."

"Then isn't it like a duplicated connection?"
"It doesn't matter. You will be able to move channels through me without
having to struggle with the constellations."

"Hrmm. That's true. Very interesting."

"There is also something I'm curious about."

"Curious about?"

"What types of constellations are in the channel I will contract with? I'm
just wondering what a big channel looks like since I've only been in a small
channel like this. I would like to see it in advance. Is it okay?"

I deliberately spoke towards Bihyung. Bihyung's expression became hurt in
real time. A smile of satisfactory appeared on Dokgak's face.

"Bihyung, you signed with a really good incarnation. I really think so."

Dokgak's hands moved through the air and he started to manipulate the
system.

"Good. Then let's show you the air of a big city."

The next moment, it felt like a new cord was stuck in my body. There was a
definite connection that seemed to lead somewhere.

I slowly blinked and felt countless gazes on me. One, two, three… all the
hairs on my body rose. It was quite different from Bihyung's channel. I
could feel their presences just from their eyes.

Amazing. This was the channel of a dokkaebi who dominated Tokyo
Dome?

"How is it? There is a new league for you to play in."

It seemed that there weren't just Japanese constellations. Did this jerk had
fixed subscriptions on other continents or worlds? If I worked in such a
place, how many coins could I get at once? To be honest, I couldn't even
guess.

I murmured, "Great. Isn't this really big?"

"Then the contract…"

"Before that, I want to say hello for a moment. Is that okay?"

"…Please do so."

Dokgak made a disgruntled expression but he eventually allowed it. I
started talking with my eyes closed. "Constellations of Tokyo Dome. Can
you hear me?"

[Some of the constellations who hate the Korean peninsula are looking at
you.]

"I'm sure that some of you have heard my story. I am Kim Dokja, the one
who smashed the Absolute Throne and became the king of a kingless
world. Please note that I have no sponsor… um, well. That's correct. I hope
to get along with you in the future."

[Constellations of Tokyo Dome are listening to you.]

I only gave a brief introduction and some constellations were already
starting to approach me indirectly.

Good. The start wasn't bad?

"By the way. As a memorial to my channel, I will do a small event. I mean,
a joint event between South Korea and Japan… If you are curious, please
connect to #BI-7623 right now. I will draw tickets for the early
constellations and give coins―"

Then the channel link was disconnected. I opened my eyes and saw Dokgak
staring at me as he asked, "What the hell are you doing now?"
"What? It is an event."

"What are you thinking? Do you want to die? The constellations in my
channel don't play in such shallow waters…"

I would gladly give him a surprise because he cut me off at the point where
people were feeling curious. Then Dokgak's body started to slowly change.
"Wait, constellations. Where are you going?"

The flow was changing. Constellations started pouring into Bihyung's
channel little by little.

[A number of constellations have entered channel #BI-7623.]

[The channel level has risen.]

I smiled widely. "A lot of you came. Thank you. Are you here for the
event?"

[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' is annoyed at the
appearance of these constellations.]

[The constellation 'Maritime War God' resents the appearance of hostile
constellations.]

"Wait, don't fight. I didn't call you here to fight."

[The constellation who likes Murasama is urging you to proceed with the
coin lottery.]

[Some constellations are asking about the coin event.]

"Don't be in a hurry. I'll do it in a bit. Think about it. Is it so important to
get a coin or two? What is the point if you don't have incarnations to spend
the coins on? Go slowly, slowly."

[Some constellations are looking at you with disgruntled eyes.]
"You may have heard of this but I'll tell you again. I am Kim Dokja and I
don't have a sponsor. I won the war between kings and prevented a disaster
before it began. There are probably few incarnations stronger than me if
you look around the world. There will be none with no sponsor. By the
way… it will be hard to last until the end."

Dokgak started to turn pale as he noticed my intentions.

"Wait! You…!"

I laughed at Dokgak. A production? Yes, I would show him what a real
'production' was.

"Seoul Dome is now ahead of the fifth scenario. If you are smart, you will
know what that means. Yes, that's right. There will soon be an event that
you will like."

Now there was less than a week until the start of the scenario. Before the
entire disaster scenario started, a special event would be hosted. A banquet
for all the constellations in the Star Stream. Soon, the second Sponsor
Selection would start.

I continued speaking. "In celebration, I would like to do a surprise event. If
the number of subscriptions to this channel reaches 10,000 on the day of the
Sponsor Selection…"

[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' is gulping.]

"I will make one of the constellations in this channel my partner."

[The constellation 'Secretive Plotter' is looking at you with interest.]

"It doesn't matter what gender, race or world you originated from. It doesn't
matter if you are strong or weak, famous or not famous. Anything is okay.
What I am looking for is passion. I hope you have the passion to see the end
of this damn story with me."
[The constellation 'Bald General of Justice' wipes his head.]

"Whoever is good. I will be waiting for you. 10,000 viewers. Do you
remember? Please convey it to other people properly."

"W-Wait a minute! Wait! Just wait!"

Dokgak cried out but it was already too late. There was a wicked voice and
unstoppable channel messages. I was dizzy from the indirect messages that
came from everywhere.

Some time passed.

Cold anger rose on Dokgak's face. He made a decision and raised his hand
towards me. "Incarnation Kim Dokja. You will die here."

Yes, I thought he would react like this. I laughed while pretending to be
calm. "There are currently many constellations watching. Aren't you afraid
of the storm?"

"Don't underestimate the master of Tokyo Dome."

There was no patience left in Dokgak's furious face. Damn.

"Do you think I can't deal with the probabilities caused by killing a bug like
you?"

Dokgak's fingers moved. It was a gesture like he was flicking away a bug.
Powerful sparks appeared around me. It was the 'balloon burst' that was
Dokgak's specialty. The currents would cause my body to burst like a
balloon. My swollen intestines would scatter as fragments and all the pieces
that made up my body would become dust scattered into the universe.

This was what originally should've happened.

"…What is this?"
He tried again. Dokgak flicked his fingers two more times. However, there
was no change. Not long afterwards, even the sparks disappeared.

"T-This is…" The confused Dokgak stared at his fingers. However, he still
didn't understand. The problem wasn't his fingers.

There was a chill and a enormous shadow appeared behind me, darkening
my vision.

"Hey. Dokkaebi."

A voice was suddenly heard. I instinctively knew. The owner of this voice
was now protecting me. It was natural when thinking about it. One a
dokkaebi who used the system could prevent the use of the system.

"Is it fun to show off your power?" It was the first time I heard Bihyung's
real voice.

The astonished Dokgak stuttered, "Uh, how did you get Character
Redemption…?"

"Ah, this? Didn't you just give me a hard time because of your strength?"

Dokgak's face turned red. Belated rage filled his face. "You are at best a
lowgrade dokkaebi… Bihyung! What do you mean by this rudeness?"

"Low-grade? You are also low-grade despite your number of subscribers."

"I didn't get a promotion on purpose. Do you dare anger me, the master of
Tokyo Dome?"

"Tokyo Dome? Good, Tokyo Dome. Are there many good constellations
left there?"

Bihyung moved from behind me towards Dokgak. "By the way, were you
this small?"
Their appearance looked the same but now Bihyung was several times
larger than Dokgak.

Bihyung's giant shadow proved it. Once again, a dokkaebi's power
increased with their number of subscribers.

The fear stricken Dokgak staggered back. "H-How…?"

"You were talking very well earlier. What? I was illegally manipulating the
scenario?" A black arm emerged from Bihyung's shadow and grabbed
Dokgak's neck, raising him into the air. "The jerk who steals the
incarnations of others… who taught you business ethics?"

"U-Uh. You absolutely won't be safe if you do this…!"

"What the fuck!" Bihyung's right arm swelled enormously. "Go to
Andromeda and find your concept!"

The shadow's fist burst through the shield on the ceiling and Dokgak flew
to the far side of the universe.

He wouldn't die because he was a dokkaebi but he would be hit hard for a
while. Bihyung let out a breath like he was relieved.

By the way, I nearly died. I sighed with relief and approached Bihyung.
The channel had just grown but Bihyung seemed strange. We looked at
each other and I was met with Bihyung's confused eyes.

I couldn't tell if he was laughing or crying. Perhaps this was the expression
that dokkaebis made when they were really happy.

"Do you know what I am seeing right now?"

I didn't know but I had an idea. It probably wasn't much different from what
I'm seeing.

[The channel level has risen.]
[The channel level has risen.]

[A constellation who likes the Korean peninsula wants to be your sponsor.]

[A constellation who wants historical reconciliation wants to be your
sponsor.]

[A constellation who likes to change gender wonders about your heart.]

[A constellation that enjoys subculture is interested in you.]

The endless messages started to fill the ears of me and Bihyung. Now the
stage would expand to the world.
                  Chapter 93: Ep. 19 – Singularity, I


Since it was the first time I came to a dokkaebi's official post, I looked at
some of the documents on the table while Bihyung managed the
constellations.

[Singularity Trend Report]

…Singularity? The moment I curiously turned a few pages, the documents
disappeared into dust. It seemed to be a database system, not real
documents.

Bihyung looked this way.

–…What are you doing?

–Nothing.

Bihyung saw the powder on the table and looked at me suspiciously. Then
he sighed and opened his mouth.
–Hey, are we okay?

–Why? Are you regretting it now?

–That…you know. The constellations that come out using this method will
quickly leave.

The fallen constellations would return to the Tokyo Dome channel. At that
time, Dokgak's revenge would begin. But that was for then.

–Besides, you lied before. What the hell are you going to do? What if the
subscriptions really reaches 10,000? It is already at 5,000.

I shrugged without speaking and Bihyung continued.

–Wasn't there a condition for you to not choose a sponsor when you signed
the contract with me? How can you say something like this?

–It will work out somehow. You can also break the contract.

–I can't do that.

–Jerk… I risked my life for you yet you can't do this?

Bihyung's expression darkened.

–That…

Indeed, I was a fool to expect anything. I told him, –

Don't worry, I have an idea.

–…Really?

–Yes, so give me my item. Dokgak is gone so shouldn't you hand me the
item now?
–Ah, that's right.

Bihyung belatedly manipulated the system. Then after a while, a white coat
descended from the air. The clean design carefully paid attention to fashion
as well as combat function. I took the coat and checked the pocket first.
[The special 'space' feature of the Infinite Dimension Space Coat is
activated.]

The advantage of this coat was that I could store various items in it without
the Inventory skill. It was a good item for me since there were many
troublesome items to carry such as the Ganpyeongui, Dongui Bogam and
Magic Power Stove.

"…By the way, it is white unlike the catalogue photo."

[The other colour is out of stock.]

Out of stock. How many of these items were there?

[Don't you know? This is a mass production item.]

I checked the options of the items.
  [Item Information]

  Name: Infinite Dimension Space Coat ver1.1 (made by Mass
  Production Maker)

  Rating: SSS

  Description: A customized coat for returnees. Despite being a mass
  produced product, it was mysteriously given an SSS rating. In
  consideration of the returnees who can't activate the attributes
  window, the additional 'Subspace' function can be activated from the
  inner pocket of the coat. Of course, the space isn't wide so use it
  cautiously.


I looked at it again. Only the subspace could be used but it had an SSS
rating? When considering that the ancient dragon Ignitus's heart had an
SSgrade…

[…Honestly, it is just due to the influence of the maker. He is a powerful
constellation.]

It made sense. The Mass Production Maker was a famous constellation
among returnees… Even if the rating was a bit off, this was one of the best
items to get early on.

In any case, I received it.

[Then let's go back.]

Bihyung flicked his fingers and the surroundings started to change. I
blinked once and returned to ground. Han Sooyoung freaked out and
retreated when I suddenly appeared in thin air.

"Hey! Where the hell did you go?"
"I had to do something for a moment."

"…Was it resolved well?" Sometimes Han Sooyoung had a habit of
speaking like this without knowing what happened. Was it a writer's ego? I
just nodded.

"New clothes? Damn, I'm envious." She gazed at the coat I was staring with
envious eyes and then Yoo Joonghyuk, who was still unconscious. She
looked between Yoo Joonghyuk's black coat and my white coat before
opening her mouth.

"By the way, are you a couple?"

"…It is just a coincidence. It is a common design."

[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' is delighted for an unknown
reason.]

[A constellation who likes to change gender has shining eyes.]

…Come to think of it, there were many unique constellations. Who was the
constellation who liked to change gender? Did this constellation appear in
Ways of Survival? I thought I should look through the novel soon.

[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' is controlling the
constellation who likes to change gender.]

Speaking of which, I decided to look at Yoo Joonghyuk. Fortunately, his
recovery seemed to be going smoothly. His breathing was stable and his
wounds were healing.

"Let's go quickly. Before this jerk wakes up."

Yoo Joonghyuk had fainted with two clenched fists. It wasn't hard to
imagine what would happen if this guy woke up first.
I left Gangdong-gu with Han Sooyoung. Yoo Sangah was being carried by
Han Sooyoung's avatar. She was still unconscious from exhaustion.

I had gone back to the battlefield where we fought Antinus but couldn't find
Lycaon. There was no body so he seemed to be alive. I just didn't know
why he didn't come to me. He must be severely injured after being struck
by the hatching disaster.

Han Sooyoung looked back at me and asked, "Is it really okay to leave
him?"

"It's fine."

"But that is the Poisoner. Can you trust her?"

The unconscious Yoo Joonghyuk was left with Lee Seolhwa.

"The Poisoner originally isn't a bad person. It is due to the Parasite."

In many episodes where she wasn't infected by the guide, Lee Seolhwa was
called the 'Doctor' rather than the 'Poisoner'. Maybe she would be called
that in this regression.

–Take him and go towards Gaebong-dong. In the 5603th military division,
a poor soldier will be waiting for you.

I confirmed Lee Hyunsung's location using Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint
and decided to accept Yoo Joonghyuk's advice. I was arrogant to think I
could raise my colleagues with my strength.

I had a limited time and information, even if I was a complete reader.
Therefore, the best trainer for Lee Hyunsung right now wasn't me, but Yoo
Joonghyuk.
"I'm hungry. Shall we eat that?"

I pointed to a plant growing around a high-rise building.

[The 7th grade plant species 'Yanaspleta' is looking at you.]

Han Sooyoung looked at the huge sunflower's eyes and cried out with
fright, "…Can we eat that?"

"We have to eat it because there is nothing else. According to Ways of
Survival, it is quite delicious. It is also a child and easy to hunt."

"Uh…"

Han Sooyoung made a disgruntled expression and soon started to summon
her avatars. We cut off the stems and tentacles of the plant species. The
yanaspleta was shortly disconnected from its roots and closed its eyes.

Once again, I felt like I had become stronger. Even if it was young, a
seventh grade species was handled so easily.

"Han Sooyoung. Are you going to eat?"

"…I don't know."

"Then I'll cook."

I started cooking the yanaspleta like I had read in Ways of Survival. I
peeled off the hard skin of the stem and sprinkled a bit of herb salt that I got
from a nearby grocery store.

The inside contained pinkish flesh reminiscent of seasonal crab meat. Han
Sooyoung's eyes shone.

"What the hell is this? It is a plant right?"

"That's right."
"We are eating a salad?"

"Of course not. I'll burn it."

I roughly cut off a branch of the surrounding tree, turned the yanaspleta
stalk into skewers and put it on the Magic Power Stove. I set the stove to a
medium fire but it took a long time to cook because it was a seventh grade
species. I flipped it around a few times and then sprinkled more salt. After
some time, the smell of grilling meat filled the area.

"Hey, can you smell it?"

"Wait, we can't eat it just yet." I stopped her from reaching into the stove
and handed her a teacup that had been warming up on the side. "Drink this
before eating."

"What is it?"

"Juice from the boiled stem. It needs to be consumed before eating the
yanaspleta."

Han Sooyoung took the cup with a doubtful expression. Then after a while,
her expression became impressed. She drank all the juices and started to cut
the stem.

"Eat slowly."

"…This isn't a joke. You can really cook."

"Maybe only in this ruined world."

I laughed because she looked like a five year old child stuffing her face
with good food.

[Some constellations who love cooking are curious about your cooking.]

[Some constellations who like fast progress and violence are complaining.]
[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' says to keep
watching.]

There was one week left until the start of the fifth scenario. The Burning
Hell disaster and Disaster of Questions had been overcome, making the
development smooth.

Yoo Joonghyuk would take the disaster in the west with Lee Hyunsung
once he woke up while the Wanderer King would handle the north. The
only thing to be aware of now was the 'central disaster'.

I picked up the yanaspleta juice and looked at the still unconscious Yoo
Sangah. "Yoo Sangah-ssi."

Was I mistaken? The unconscious Yoo Sangah obviously flinched.

"I know your mental state right now. Come and eat this."

"…"

"If you don't, I will just eat it."

Yoo Sangah didn't rise. Then I heard a growling sound from her stomach.

"You must be sleeping. Then we will eat this. Ah, too delicious."

"…W-Wait a minute!" Yoo Sangah cried out and rose from her spot. As
expected, Yoo Sangah couldn't just lie down after smelling the food. She
consumed a lot of stamina so it was natural for her to be hungry.

I glanced over at Han Sooyoung, who was still eating. "Hey. You have
eaten a lot so get up."

"Why?"

"Do you have to ask?"
"…Tsk. You make people feel uncomfortable. I understand."

Maybe Han Sooyoung knew that Yoo Sangah was already awake. She also
knew that Yoo Sangah wouldn't move because of Han Sooyoung's
presence. This girl was really bad.

"I will go around the area once. Don't eat it all and leave me some.
Understood?" Han Sooyoung grabbed a skewer and disappeared into the
darkness.

Once she completely disappeared, Yoo Sangah slowly approached. The
skewer on top of the stove made a delicious cooking sound. I gave the
skewer to the hesitating Yoo Sangah. Yoo Sangah accepted it and started
biting into it.

Yoo Sangah ate one skewer and barely managed to open her mouth.

"…Delicious."

There were tears in her eyes. Anyone who saw her now wouldn't think she
was that girl wielding the daggers.

"Eat slowly."

The two daggers at her waist showed that her appearance during the
daytime wasn't a dream. It was one month since the destruction began. I felt
like there was a lot of work to do.

Yoo Sangah ate the skewers silently while I also ate while watching her.
The skewers were really delicious. It was as if the taste wasn't of this
world… Yoo Sangah watched the flames blazing from the stove and
muttered, "… This is real."

"Probably."

"Now we can't go back?"
"Yes, probably."

Yoo Sangah's hands faintly trembled. She killed humans with those hands.
In order to live, her hands had taken away the lives of others.

The hand that had been covered in someone's blood now covered her eyes.
Her shoulders intermittently shook. It was probably her last pride that no
sobs leaked out.

"It isn't your fault." I didn't know if my words comforted her or not. I
couldn't see Yoo Sangah's heart. Yoo Sangah started to cry. Tears flowed
down her face and the skewer she was eating fell to the ground.

How much more would she cry? Little by little, her sobs died down.

The 7th grade yanaspleta showed a strong sleeping effect when eaten
without taking the juices.

I looked at her for a while before opening my mouth. "It really isn't your
fault."

These words were for Yoo Sangah.

"So…" At the same time, I spoke words not directed towards Yoo Sangah.
"I hope to find out who you are, how about it?"

In the ruined city, the spooky cries of monsters were heard. It seemed like I
was talking to myself. I watched Yoo Sangah while asking, "Are you going
to pretend?"

"…"

"I don't know why you are watching me but haven't you been doing it for a
while now?"

The white blade of Unbroken Faith shone in the darkness.
"I won't hesitate to do anything to reach my purpose." I pushed the white
blade towards Yoo Sangah's throat. "You better open your mouth quickly.
Unless you want your precious incarnation to die."

From now on, it was a game of chicken. I waited while gradually pushing
the blade towards her throat. The blade was 1cm away from her throat and
blood started flowing. All of a sudden, Yoo Sangah's eyes shone.

[The exclusive skill 'Fourth Wall' has offset your mental shock.]

There was a gust of wind and I was thrown away from Yoo Sangah's body.

There was a menacing presence that made my heart dull. A faint glow
appeared around Yoo Sangah's body. I looked into Yoo Sangah's blurry
eyes. Revolving in the pupils, the shadow of a distant nebula was seen.
Then a voice like thunder burst inside my head.

[Insignificant human.]

I wiped the blood flowing from my mouth and grinned. They finally
appeared. The damn constellations of Olympus.
                 Chapter 94: Ep. 19 – Singularity, II


In the world of Ways of Survival, the constellation were divided into two
types. One type were the free constellations that didn't belong anywhere.
The second type were constellations belonging to a particular nebula.

[A trivial human dares to threaten the great stars?]

I swallowed my saliva in front of that furious momentum. There were
several famous nebulae based on the myths of Earth.

There was Asgard from Nordic mythology and Eden from the apocalypse
type mythology. Then there was the equally famous Olympus in front of
me.

I told them, "…Pick a form. I'm not a devotee."

Yoo Sangah's expression changed. The constellations that suddenly
descended looked a bit embarrassed but I kept talking.
"The probabilities in the beginning scenarios will never allow access to the
gods of Olympus. Isn't that right?"

[You…!]

If the probabilities didn't exist as a balance, the Seoul area would've already
been destroyed by the Olympus 12 descending. The ripple effects of the
storm would be huge. Many of the gods of Olympus might look down on it
but they weren't stupid. I saw the threads of magic power wrapped around
Yoo Sangah's body.

"It seems that you are currently the only one who can come out, Abandoned
Lover of the Labyrinth."

Just like Korea had great constellations, Olympus also had great
constellations. In fact, the majority of Olympus were great constellations.

The Abandoned Lover of the Labyrinth. This was the modifier for Ariadne,
the lover of Theseus.

"You represent the lowest possible cost so Olympus must be quite stingy to
send you."

[Shut up! You dare!]

The magic threads fluttering around her caused the ground to shake. The
ground was split apart by the momentum.

Indeed, Ariadne couldn't be ignored. No matter how weak the power of her
story, she was still stronger than non-constellations. But I knew that she
couldn't attack me.

Sparks flew in the air. The shackles of probability had moved. It wasn't a
full descent but a large amount of probabilities was consumed when she
deprived the will of the incarnation and partially descended.
Besides, Ariadne was a constellation belonging to a big nebula. Her
movements were bound to be exposed to other powerful beings.

The Great Hole in Seoul's sky was howling. An unprecedented fear filled
me and my whole body got chills.

Yoo Sangah's complexion paled due to Ariadne inside her.

"I don't think you have much time. Shall I get straight to the point?"

This was the reality of the constellations. They were the strongest of the
Star Stream but they couldn't throw off the heavy shackles of 'probability'.

"The gods of other worlds seem to have noticed you."

[…How can a human know this?]

"Is that important right now? Didn't you come to me for a reason? I don't
think the constellations can endure the probability storm that will soon
occur."

Thunder struck around the Great Hole. As expected, it was too early for the
great constellations to descend.

I continued speaking, "I will ask three questions. If you answer my
questions, I will answer your questions."

[You want to do the three questions exchange?]

"Yes."

The three questions exchange. This was originally the trading style of the
constellations to minimize the consumption of probability.

Ariadne glared at me with disapproval. [A human using the constellation's
method of trading…]
"Are you going to agree or not?"

[…Wait.]

Yoo Sangah's eyes closed. Perhaps Ariadne was now communicating with
the other Olympus constellations through their network.

[A constellation who doesn't like the fun to be spoiled is interested in your
proposal.]

In any case, the Olympus spectators had appeared. Ariadne finished the
communication and opened her eyes.

[I will allow the questions.]

Then a message was heard.

–The Divine Three Questions and Answers has begun.

–Both sides will exchange three questions and answers.

–All questions should only be answered with the truth.

–Both sides can refuse to answer one question.

–The conversation won't end until the questions and answers are fully
exchanged.

"I will ask first."

[Okay.]

–The first question ticket has been used.

"One, why are you in Yoo Sangah's body?"

[…]
"Your home is on the other side of the continent and aren't you busy
working on your scenarios? Why this place?"

[It is to monitor the singularities of this world.] –

The first answer has been received.

"Singularity?"

[Is that your second question?]

Dammit, she was quite smart. The 'question ticket' disappeared even when
the person answered the question vaguely.

"No. Now you ask."

–The constellation 'Abandoned Lover of the Labyrinth' has used the first
question ticket.

[What is your identity?]

"Me? I am one of the singularities you are watching."

–The constellation 'Abandoned Lover of the Labyrinth' has received the
first answer.

The embarrassed Ariadne muttered, […How do you know this?]

"I just guessed I was a singularity."

I was just talking but it ended up being right. Ariadne's eyes narrowed.

[You…]

"Don't be angry. Don't you guys do it often?"
[A constellation who doesn't like the fun to be spoiled is pleased with your
wit.]

Ariadne's atmosphere became filled with killing intent. However, the 'Three
Questions Exchange' should be done in this way. Those who answered the
other person's questions straight away would only see a loss. The questions
ticket should be used in a useful way while wasting the opponent's question
ticket. This was the intense fight of the Three Questions Exchange.

I continued speaking.

–The second question ticket has been used.

"Then this is my second question. What the hell is a singularity?"

[It means beings like you.]

Urgh, she was using her head. However, this time I couldn't accept this
much.

"Answer it properly. Or do you want to keep spinning in circles?"

[…In principle, they are the ones who appear in a 'divine message'.]

"Can you tell me more? I still can't get the hang of it."

Ariadne thought for a moment before speaking.

[We originally didn't mean to monitor you. It is just a coincidence that we
found you.]

…A coincidence?

[We were trying to monitor someone else. He carries the wheel of a giant
destiny on his back and destroys the probability. A singularity is such a
person.]
As soon as I heard this, I understood what a 'singularity' was.

–The second answer has been received.

Those from Olympus had already found Yoo Joonghyuk in this regression.
An Olympus level nebula would be able to search through the
massproduced filters and trace the information back.

First of all, they had the excellent information tracker in Hermes. In
addition, the great constellations would already become aware of the
deviation in the world's probabilities due to Yoo Joonghyuk…

However, there was something strange. The information about the
'regressor' wasn't information that the current Ariadne could reach.

[It is my turn for an answer.]

–The constellation 'Abandoned Lover of the Labyrinth' has used the second
question ticket.

[Who will you select in the next Sponsor Selection?]

It was an unexpected question. I didn't expect Olympus to be aiming for
me.

[A constellation who doesn't like the fun to be spoiled is listening to you.]

[Some constellations that love the Korean peninsula are nervous.]

[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' is chanting his own
modifier.]

It was difficult but I had no choice.

"I won't answer. Is it any fun if I tell you who I will pick?" –

You have used a 'refusal ticket'.
–You can't exercise the right to refuse to answer a question from now on.

It seemed she had expected this as Ariadne immediately followed with a
question.

–The constellation 'Abandoned Lover of the Labyrinth' has used the third
question ticket.

[Then I will ask the last question. How did you notice that we were
watching?]

Shit, this was her purpose from the beginning. It was probably the result of
Ariadne thinking hard. Simply asking for my 'identity' didn't give an answer
so she created a specific question. I thought for a moment before opening
my mouth.

"I read a book well."

[What?]

"I found out after reading books."

My answer wasn't convincing but I couldn't reveal the story of Ways of
Survival here. It would all be filtered anyway, making it impossible for her
to understand. In addition, I didn't want to explain.

"Originally, us Koreans know the myths."

[…What does that mean?]

"You are quite famous in my country. You are so popular that
children's cartoons are produced. Don't you know that you are quite
famous in my country? Is there anyone who doesn't know about
Olympus?" Ariadne's confusion was conveyed through her shaky
eyes.
[It is impossible. A small country…]

"The Cretan labyrinth."

[…!]

"A half monster."

Her eyes became bigger.

"The lover who forgot you. Naxos Island. The love affair afterwards… shall
I continue?"

[S-Stop! I understand so stop!]

–The constellation 'Abandoned Lover of the Labyrinth' has received the
third answer.

Ariadne made a completely wounded expression and closed her mouth.

[How can humans in a trivial country…]

I inwardly sighed. I somehow succeeded in overcoming this. Ariadne was a
constellation with a low probability cost. It was fortunate that she came out
as the representative of Olympus.

The movements of the Great Hole was becoming increasingly restless.

I opened my mouth, "Then this is the last question. What is the content of
the 'divine message' you received this time?"

Ariadne worried about it for a long time while her eyes looked like she was
measuring an invisible scale.

[I can't tell you.]
–The constellation 'Abandoned Lover of the Labyrinth' has used the refusal
ticket.

–All questions and answers have been fully exchanged.

–The three questions and three answers have ended.

I expected it but I felt sorry. In fact, the last question was the most
important.

[A constellation who doesn't like the fun to be spoiled has a taste of regret.]

Ariadne looked at the lightning bolts falling from the sky and frowned.

[My husband was curious about your story and I gave him a bit of
entertainment, but it ends here.]

Her voice started to accelerate like she realized she had no time.

[I only came here for one reason. Olympus will give you a stern warning.
Don't hinder our work. We are working to prevent the destruction of the
world. This woman will grow into a breakwater of the great destruction.]

"Why this woman?"

[Looking for the reason is pointless. Even the three sisters who spin the
thread of fate don't know why.]

Damn. Olympus used the excuse of the Fates.

[Incarnation caught in the scenario. The direction of fate is turning. The
stories of the stars are gathering in one place and the fate of the
constellations will begin.]

"What are you talking about? Are you referring to Gigantomachia?"
[…You even know this information. You are really amazing. But even if
you know this information, you shouldn't arrogantly think that you
understand everything.]

The sparks around Yoo Sangah's body were reaching the limit. It was the
sign of a probability storm.

[You, a puppet of the moment, will never understand. Remember. Once the
time comes, if you aren't standing on the right side―]

At that moment, a lightning bolt struck Yoo Sangah's body and I felt
Ariadne's power draining out of her. The sound of tearing through space
and time resonated and Yoo Sangah's body collapsed like a broken doll.

I hurriedly grabbed Yoo Sangah's body. Then I felt someone's gaze from
the sky. I shouldn't raise my head right now. Nobody told me this but I
instinctively knew. If I looked above me…

[The exclusive skill 'Fourth Wall' has offset your mental shock.]

I looked up with confusion. There was something in the distant Great Hole.
It was a presence that destroyed Ariadne's power. It seemed to be a tongue
or a tentacle but in the end, it didn't resemble anything. It was a fear that
was beyond language and it was unable to be comprehended.

A god from another world.

Time seemed to slow and sweat soaked my forehead and back. It was a
flow of time filled with breathless pain. I barely blinked and the Great Hole
returned to normal. I trembled with fear. This thing was what I had to fight.

I saw Han Sooyoung running towards me in the distance. The roar of
agitated monsters filled the moonlit night and the screams of humans came
as they were intermittently hit by lightning.
There were several scenarios related to 'the end'. Ragnarok. Gigantomachia.
Armageddon… I didn't know what Ariadne was talking about but it was
certain that something was different from what I knew.

This was what I wanted. I could never reach the end I wanted if it flowed
like the original story.

I carefully laid down the collapsed Yoo Sangah. It felt like her flesh would
break if I touched it. Yoo Sangah's face was pale and she had a tight
clenched fist, as if she didn't want to support her sponsor.

Humans were weak. However, there was one thing overlooked by the stars
who were only afraid of a great probability. It was that all the myths on
Earth started from the weak humans they ignored.

I gently touched my fist to Yoo Sangah's fist.

[In the depths of your soul, the power of the 'story' is wriggling.]

[Your first stigma is ready to germinate.]

I would build a 'story' that didn't fall to any myths.




At this time, a silver wolf was running through the darkness.

'Kiik… damn wolf'.

Parasite Queen Antinus frowned as she looked at her body. The newest
body she required was an Imyuntar.

Of course, it was a situation where she just survived. Her body was torn by
the probability storm and she would've died if Lycaon hadn't been lying
unconscious nearby. Her instinct of survival saved her. It was only possible
because she was a parasitic species.

Black blood poured from Lycaon, who was hit by a fragment of the
disaster. The guides had a body that couldn't resist the disasters. Now
Antinus didn't have much time left.

'…I need a new host'.

Antinus shook as she thought of the men who killed the Disaster of
Questions.

Those humans prevented the disaster that destroyed her planet. She was
desperate in front of the unbelievable sight and decided again. She would
get revenge through any means. She would exterminate the humans who
destroyed her home, Chronos. At this moment, her antennae reacted.

'This aura?'

A familiar aura was felt. It was a power that she felt from the insect kings
species found on Chronos in the past. Antinus' increased her pace. If she
infected a person with this potential, revenge wasn't impossible.

Finally, Antinus reached the location and encountered an unexpected being.
She couldn't believe it. How was this presence on Earth?

"K-Kieeek―!"

She instinctively made a sound and the boy's eyes gleamed in the
moonlight.

"You will be the first insect!" The boy, Lee Gilyoung laughed at Antinus.
                  Chapter 95: Ep. 19 – Singularity, III


It was already morning when I opened my eyes. Han Sooyoung saw me
wake up and smiled. She was the last person keeping guard. "Did you have
a nightmare?"

"A little bit."

The embers of the firewood burning all night was white. I put out the fire
and touched my forehead, which had a splitting headache. The scene that I
saw through Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint…

Gilyoung, I didn't know if he was okay. "Where is Yoo Sangah-ssi?"

"She went to scout." Han Sooyoung answered while touching her
smartphone.

I asked her, "What are you looking at?"

"A novel."
"Your novel?"

"What other novel would I look at?"

Indeed, it would be strange to read other novels under these circumstances.

"I always wondered, is it fun for a writer to read what they wrote?"

"It is very fun."

"Even though you know all the details?" I actually asked without thinking
but Han Sooyoung gave me an unexpected answer.

"I sometimes feel that the story is different despite reading the same thing."

"What?"

"A writer doesn't have complete mastery of the novel. There are many holes
whenever I look back. In the end, reading is the process of keeping the
irregular holes in place."

"I really don't know what you're talking about."

"…It means that after some time, I can see it as someone else's writing.
Ultimately, every human is their own writer."

The words were unexpected and I felt surprised. Han Sooyoung was able to
say such a difficult thing.

I told her, "Come to think of it, you are like that. You really wrote someone
else's novel."

Han Sooyoung yelled something back but I blocked my ears for a while.
Who told her to plagiarize in the first place? Han Sooyoung turned off her
smartphone and asked me, "By the way, what are you going to do next?"

"What will I do? I will wait for the start of the next scenario."
"Who would believe that? I'm sure you have a plan."

She seemed to have something to say so I let her speak. In fact, she kept on
talking anyway.

"Yoo Joonghyuk is taking charge of the west and the Wanderer King is
handling the north. What about the center?"

"We will stop it all together."

"Isn't there an easy method? Have you forgotten?"

I stopped for a moment and stared at Han Sooyoung. "Did you copy that as
well?"

"…When did I do that? I just came up with it in my novel." Han Sooyoung
fumbled with her words while pouting. "In any case, aren't I right? As far as
I know, there is an easy way to prevent the disaster in the center."

Certainly, her words were right. If we did that, we could clear the fifth
scenario and prevent all disasters without difficulty. Han Sooyoung looked
at me with piercing eyes. "Are you going to do it?"

"That… let's think about it on the way."

I looked around and saw Yoo Sangah waving her hand in the distance. Han
Sooyoung grumbled, "Why do you look so happy after seeing her?"

"It is because she is a trustworthy person."

"Tsk. Untrustworthy people will survive."

We set out again. There were five days remaining until the start of the
scenario. We moved west along the Han River.

There were two purposes behind this. One was to look for the missing
Gong Pildu around Han River and the second was to collect coins from
nearby monsters. More than anything else, it was currently a coin event so I
should gain as much as possible.

"Yoo Sangah-ssi, to the left! Han Sooyoung, take the lead!"

We hunted all the visible 7th grade monsters. Once Yoo Sangah joined us,
we were able to hunt 7th grade species and even 6th grade. I had a thought
while watching Yoo Sangah.

Maybe she didn't know about those from Olympus. I called them out to
figure out their intentions. They had used up their assigned probability and
couldn't interfere with Yoo Sangah for the time being. The battle ended and
I approached Yoo Sangah.

"Yoo Sangah-ssi. You should only use one stigma at a time in the future."

"Ah, I'm sorry. Was I a big problem last time?"

"No, that isn't the reason."

The people supported by a nebula were special. Of course, being sponsored
by a nebula didn't mean all constellations in the nebula would support her.
However, the laws of the Star Stream applied to the constellations and
incarnations.

The price for going against the laws would eventually be returned to the
constellations and incarnations. The constellations might have a way to
escape but the problem was the incarnations.

"Using multiple stigmas will place a burden on Yoo Sangah-ssi's body."

The damn Olympians wouldn't tell her this but there was a limit to the story
that a single being could afford. Every stigma contained the history of the
constellation and the random blend of histories would impair the human
spirit.
If Yoo Sangah borrowed the stigmas of a large number of constellations,
her remaining vitality would be reduced in an instant. Then in probably one
year…

Yoo Sangah smiled faintly. "Thank you for your concern."

I realized something and opened my mouth. "Did you already know?"

Yoo Sangah's eyes moved downwards and she spoke quietly, "Dokja-ssi, do
you still think that I'm a competent office worker?"

Yoo Sangah continued speaking. "I'm different from Dokja-ssi. I can't do
anything in this changed world. This is a world where the TOEIC, degrees
and service scores are useless."

I wondered, "Do you think everything can be resolved if you become
stronger?"

"A little bit."

Her words were correct. In fact, strength only made up for some of the
world's problems.

"I have decided to build up useful specifications of this world. That is the
only thing I can do."

There were numerous wounds on the back of Yoo Sangah's hand as she
spoke. The wounds felt like a big hole for me. Han Sooyoung had said, 'In
the end, reading is the process of keeping the irregular holes in place'.

If there was something a reader had to do, I needed to read it properly. I felt
a vibration in my arms. I opened my smartphone and saw that there was a
notification window.

–Han Donghoon: hyung, are you okay?
The Hermit King of Shadows, Han Donghoon. I was stunned when I read
the message.

–Han Donghoon: I haven't been able to connect to the Internet recently so
the messages are delayed. I am struggling with my ability…

He had been sending messages for a long time and they stacked up. It
seemed the piled up messages arrived at the same time once the Internet
connected.

I showed the messages to Yoo Sangah in order to change her mood. I
looked at Yoo Sangah's smile and thought.

I wasn't a completely incompetent reader.




I connected to Han Donghoon through the messenger but I could hear news
about other people through it.

–Han Donghoon: I am on the Yongsan-gu side. There is also Gilyoung.

–Kim Dokja: Gilyoung is there?

–Han Donghoon: Yes.

The location of my main party were roughly grasped. Lee Hyunsung and
Jung Heewon's positions were also confirmed through Omniscient Reader's
Viewpoint.

I was a bit curious about what happened to Jung Minseob and Lee
Sungkook but it was difficult to care about them. They had some prior
knowledge so they should manage. Lee Jihye… well, Yoo Joonghyuk
would take care of it.
–Kim Dokja: For the time being, don't leave Yongsan. I'll be there soon. If
possible, try contacting other people.

A reply didn't come back. Perhaps it had disconnected again. I looked
around at the party members and said, "I think we'll have to cross the river."

Currently, we were south of Han River. North of Han River was Yongsan-
gu.

"We have to cross that?" Han Sooyoung asked me with a dumbfounded
expression.

It wasn't strange. I looked at Han River with her. Flickering shadows could
be seen from the swirling water. The ichthyosaurs that had travelled near
Dongho Bridge had once again filled Han River. We had been following
the river but I never thought of crossing because of them.

"Have you seen Cheonho Bridge? It is broken."

The ichthyosaur was a 7th grade monster species. It wasn't a problem to
hunt but there were too many. It wasn't just one or two so it would take a
few days to deal with all of them. We were going to cross Han River in
such a situation? It was unthinkable.

"We will move along the river. There might be a place that isn't broken."

We moved along the river for several hours but an intact bridge couldn't be
found. Instead, we found a group of wanderers.

Han Sooyoung was going to raise her weapon but Yoo Sangah moved first.
She took meat out of her backpack, making Han Sooyoung irritated. "What
are you doing?"

"The people are hungry."
"So what? You want to share that? Are you crazy? Don't you know that
people are the most dangerous existences in an apocalypse?"

"I can kill all of them if I want." Han Sooyoung saw killing intent for a
moment on Yoo Sangah's face and shut her mouth. "Therefore, I can save
all of them if I want."

Yoo Sangah took the meat from the monsters and distributed it to the
people. Some people felt sorry and bowed to her.

"Ah, this…"

"It is just leftovers. It doesn't matter."

I left Han Sooyoung alone and pulled a yanaspleta stem out of my bag. It
wasn't possible for everyone to become a 'hunter' in this world. By now,
there would be a great deal of research about the monster species all over
the world. The man who received the plant from me bowed deeply.

"Ah! Thank you…"

"It's nothing. Difficulties should be shared."

Of course, I was essentially a different person from Yoo Sangah. All my
good deeds were planned activities.

[A few people have a great liking towards you.]

[Your understanding of the character 'Shin Yooin' has increased.]

[Your understanding of the character 'Ma Kangcheol' has increased.]

[New characters have been added to your bookmarks.]

Han Sooyoung said sarcastically, "You're a fake."

"…Sometimes I do good things."
[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' is impressed with your good
deed.]

[400 coins have been sponsored.]

Han Sooyoung grumbled as she watched Yoo Sangah, "Damn, she is like a
woman from a novel."

I agreed with her words. Yoo Sangah was like the heroine of a novel even
before the fall of the world. Now that reality had become a novel…

From among the crowd, a child approached me. She was a young girl
around the same age as Gilyoung.

"What is it?"

The girl who bowed had a Western look. Her eyes were bright and her face
was full of an exotic cuteness. The child bowed 90 degrees towards me.

"Thank you."

She was a very polite child. I looked around but didn't see anyone who
looked like this child's parents. The child noticed my gaze and said, "They
aren't here anymore."

"Both of them?" The child nodded.

I was a bit confused. A child without a guardian survived alone until the
fifth scenario. It was almost impossible in Ways of Survival.

…Wait a minute? The moment I used Character List, the child spoke again,
"Then I'll be going."

Did she come just to thank me? I tried to grab the child and reflexively
looked back at Han Sooyoung. She happened to be looking elsewhere.

"…Be careful."
It would soon be dark. I worried for a moment before summoning the party
members together.

"We will rest here today."

We looked for a place to sleep. Han River was cold even when we lit a fire,
so we decided to use a partially destroyed building. Han Sooyoung became
firmly determined and warned Yoo Sangah.

"Just watch. Those people from earlier will be back. Didn't you see them
covet our weapons? They will clearly bite the hand that fed them."

Han Sooyoung declared that all humans were wicked and trash who
would repay goodness with malice. I carefully looked at Yoo Sangah
who said, "Not every person in the apocalypse is bad." "No, they are all
bad. Almost everyone is bad." One hour passed.

"They'll come soon. Then you will be crying."

Two hours passed.

"Um, they are patient people."

Three hours passed.

"…Is this possible?"

Finally, four hours later, noises started to be heard outside. Yoo Sangah's
expression darkened and Han Sooyoung smiled with satisfaction.

"Look, what did I say?"

Han Sooyoung had just taken out her weapon when someone entered the
building.

"H-Hello?"
Han Sooyoung stopped as she was about to get up. The one who came was
a young girl. It was the child who politely thanked me during the day. The
little red-eyed child held something out.

"T-This…"

It was a blanket. She must've grabbed it from the area because she was
afraid we were cold. Han Sooyoung made a surprised expression while Yoo
Sangah looked blank. In the apocalypse, goodwill wasn't always repaid
with malice.

[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' is making a loving smile.]

[2,000 coins have been sponsored.]

Yoo Sangah acted as the representative of the party. "Thank you, I'll use it
well."

"Yes…"

"By the way, are you alone? It is dangerous to wander around at night."

"It is the same everywhere."

Yoo Sangah's expression darkened at the words. "Would you like to stay
with us?"

"Huh?"

"It will be fine if you are with us."

Yoo Sangah looked at me like she was asking for permission. However, the
child's answer was faster. "I don't want to be a nuisance."

It happened when the child was trying to run away. A flag flew from
somewhere and fell in front of the child's feet. The frightened child fell
down and Han Sooyoung's scathing voice followed.
"Wait a minute. You can't leave."

"What are you doing right now?" Yoo Sangah looked at Han Sooyoung and
spoke in a cold voice. However, Han Sooyoung was looking at me.

"Kim Dokja, don't you know what to do? Isn't that why you wanted to sleep
here?"

I slowly closed my eyes. Damn, she had noticed… It was a miscalculation.
I didn't know this person could use Detect Attributes. Han Sooyoung asked,
"Ah, are you going to act as a hypocrite? Is it because the other person is a
child?"

"…"

"The other person is a child? Then the villain must solve it."

Han Sooyoung approached and Yoo Sangah blocked the way.

"Stop."

"Get out of the way. Do you want me to kill you?"

"Why are you killing an ordinary kid all of a sudden?"

"An ordinary kid?" Han Sooyoung laughed and pointed towards the child.

"I told you to stop." At the same time, Yoo Sangah's dagger pointed to Han
Sooyoung's neck. Then Han Sooyoung summoned dozens of avatars. Han
Sooyoung grumbled.

"Kim Dokja, explain it quickly. Before I turn around and kill everyone."

It ended up like this. I sighed and opened my mouth. "This child…"

The child looked up at me with innocent eyes and I felt a sense of urgency.
"…Five days later, she will destroy Seoul."

Yoo Sangah's eyes shook. If Han Sooyoung hadn't found out, I might've let
it pass by but now it couldn't be helped. This damn scenario never gave us
the happy endings we wanted.

[The constellation 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' is smiling.]

[Many constellations are interested in the development of this scenario.]

It had been a long time since the messages of the constellations seemed so
hateful.

"This child is the last disaster of the fifth scenario."
                 Chapter 96: Ep. 19 – Singularity, IV


That night, the child didn't die. Yoo Sangah didn't want to kill her and I
agreed.

"Do what you want." Han Sooyoung muttered and left in a huff, leaving
only Yoo Sangah and I in the abandoned building. The child was
temporarily frozen with Hit a Pressure Point. Yoo Sangah stroked the
sleeping child's hair and spoke in a dark voice.

"She is a disaster?"

"Yes."

"Dokja-ssi, do you know this with your ability?"

"It is something similar."

I recalled a sentence from Ways of Survival.
「 The final disaster of the fifth scenario. The Disaster of Floods is the
most dangerous and saddest disaster. 」

Yoo Sangah bit her lips and asked, "Is she the same as the Disaster of
Questions?"

"It is similar but a bit different."

The Disaster of Floods. If she used all her strength, she would be an
unmatched disaster compared to the Disaster of Questions. The Disaster of
Questions would just affect Gangdong-gu but the Disaster of Floods was
different. With her power, Seoul would be wiped out in less than an hour.

"No matter how I look, she doesn't seem like a disaster. Can this kid
become a disaster in just five days?" Yoo Sangah wondered.

In fact, Yoo Sangah was right. Right now, the child wasn't a disaster.

Shin Yoosung. This child's name showed that she was the disaster. This
child would destroy Seoul in five days.

Yoo Sangah said, "I heard that disasters hatch from meteorites. Yet this
child didn't come from a meteorite…"

"That's correct. This child didn't hatch from a meteorite. She was born and
raised on Earth. She will still be a human of Earth in five days."
"Then why…"

"The Disaster of Questions was originally from Earth."

Yoo Sangah's eyes widened. "This child is like the Disaster of
Questions…"

"Yes and no."

"Huh?"

All disasters from Earth were returnees. They were destroyers who wiped
out another world and returned. This child could be called a returnee
because she destroyed Chronos. However, that wasn't all.

Among the five disasters of Chronos, this child was special. She was also
the most dangerous.

"The one who will cause the disaster isn't this child, but her future self."

"Her future self?"

"This child came back from decades in the future to finish off Earth."

The sweet and innocent child would become one of the most terrible
disasters of this world in the future.

"That is why Han Sooyoung said to kill this child. If we kill this child now,
we can eliminate her 'future'."

A disaster that even Yoo Joonghyuk couldn't stop.
「 Yoo Joonghyuk looked at the empty hole in his chest. It was a wound
that couldn't be healed without using Recovery immediately. He angrily
asked the woman who made the wound.

"Shin Yoosung. Why… have you thoughts changed?"

"Changed? I didn't change." Shin Yoosung laughed. "I'm not a regressor
like Captain. I'm just a toy stuck in the cogs of the scenario. I have the same
personality as the 'disasters' that Captain has met in the past."

"Then why…"

"Is this currently your third regression? I must've given you a chance in the
second regression. Yet Captain once again failed. I gave you so much
information but you failed again."

Shin Yoosung smiled sadly at the blank-looking Yoo Joonghyuk.

"You can't change the world. Many things are still intact and nothing has
changed." Shin Yoosung spoke while looking up at the Great Hole in the
sky. "Thus, I thought about it. Indeed, this world should end here." 」

My old emotional state came back as I read Ways of Survival again. This
was the taste of Ways of Survival.

"Hey, what are you doing?" I heard a voice and turned off my smartphone.
It was Han Sooyoung and she asked, "What did you decide?"

"I'm still thinking."

Han Sooyoung frowned at the indecision in my voice. She whispered while
paying attention to Yoo Sangah and Shin Yoosung. "Have you forgotten?
Yoo Joonghyuk almost died because of the last disaster in the third
regression."

"He didn't die."
"That doesn't matter. The important thing is that we can't win in a frontal
battle."

Han Sooyoung's words were true. The third round Yoo Joonghyuk actually
ended up dying because of Shin Yoosung.

"If you hadn't killed him then the Delusional Demon Kim Namwoon
could've…"

Unfortunately, this time there wasn't the Delusional Demon to kill the
young Shin Yoosung.

"I certainly said that I am opposed to it. I warn you, do you think I will do
nothing?"

[Some constellations dislike the burning of the sweet potatoes.]

[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' is getting out some
cider to go with the sweet potatoes¹.]

[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' expects your wise judgment.]

Perhaps this conversation wasn't properly filtered. The filtering of future
information was slowly loosening up…

Yoo Sangah sighed after talking to Shin Yoosung and came this
way. "Dokja-ssi, you can't think about it." Her face was desperate.

"It is a future that hasn't happened yet. If we take good care of her now,
perhaps the disaster won't happen? Like the butterfly effect…"

It wasn't without reason. The person who came to this world was the 'future
Shin Yoosung'. This world was the 'first world' that created the future Shin
Yoosung.
In other words, if we changed the present Shin Yoosung then the disaster
might not come. It was theoretically possible. It was the same as killing
Shin Yoosung to prevent the disaster. However, there was a problem.

"The event that makes this child a disaster happens in the distant future. It
won't be affected by anything we do now."

The butterfly effect didn't happen that easily. A butterfly flapping its wings
in the Pacific Ocean would cause a typhoon on the other side of the world?

It was theoretically possible. The important thing was the time it took for
the wings to become the 'typhoon'.

Yoo Sangah's expression became grouchy. "You don't know that…"

"Once again, it isn't possible at this time. Even if we change the kid, the
disaster that will come in five days won't change."

In fact, Yoo Joonghyuk had attempted it several times in the mid to late
regressions. The first thing he did was find Shin Yoosung and try to prevent
her from becoming a disaster. He failed every time. No matter what
changes were made to the Shin Yoosung in the present, the future Shin
Yoosung would return in five days. Then she destroyed Seoul.

Yoo Sangah voice gradually weakened. "Why is this child a disaster? What
happened in the future?"

"I don't know."

I naturally knew the answer but I didn't say anything. Instead, I walked
towards the child who was eating meat and asked, "Is it delicious?"

"…Yes."

I could feel Yoo Sangah and Han Sooyoung watching me from a distance.
'No'.
'Kill her'.

'I won't let it happen'.

'Kill'.

In fact, killing Shin Yoosung wouldn't damage the important part of the
ending point. If I didn't kill Shin Yoosung now, the slightest mistake meant
Seoul would be destroyed.

Looking in the short-term, saving Shin Yoosung would only bring
damages. Shin Yoosung ate the meat and looked at me with unknown eyes.
"Ahjussi, can you see the future?"

"Huh?"

"I… am I a bad person in the future?"

Perhaps she heard our conversation. I replied quietly, "Perhaps."

"How bad am I?"

"You are probably the worst person in Seoul."

"As bad as Joker or Thanos?"

"I don't know."

Shin Yoosung lowered her head. "It isn't unusual."

"Why?"

"I am already a bad person."

She didn't have to tell me why. I already knew how Shin Yoosung was able
to survive in this world.
[Your understanding of the character 'Shin Yoosung' has increased.]
[Exclusive skill, Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint stage 2 has been
activated!]

「 I killed him. 」

She killed her dog in order to survive the first scenario.

「 I'm sorry. 」

She stole a coat from an old man who collapsed from an attack. She killed a
woman who always looked after her to protect her own green zone. She
handed over a person chased by someone in order to get food.

In this world, everyone was forced to commit crimes. Not everyone could
rationalize such things.

「 I will be punished. It isn't worth living. 」

Determination filled the child's frightened eyes. The expression of a person
determined to die was no different for an adult or a child.

"You can kill me. I'm ready."

If I was the protagonist of this story, I would've killed Shin Yoosung
without hesitation. However, I was a reader. A reader had to make a
reader's choice.

Of course, I wasn't a writer so the only things that emerged from my mouth
were obvious words. I stroked Shin Yoosung's head and said, "Don't worry.
Your death isn't in the ending that I want."

Yoo Joonghyuk's regression would have no meaning if I killed this child.
He was fighting to change the past. If someone killed another person
because the future was fixed, what did this suggest?

Thus, I would prevent this child's death for Yoo Joonghyuk.
Her eyes shook.

[The character 'Shin Yoosung' feels a faint loyalty to you.]

[Your understanding of the character 'Shin Yoosung' has increased.]

"But I must die…"

"There is a way to stop the disaster."

I could hear Han Sooyoung sighing behind me. By her side, Yoo Sangah
was watching with tightly closed lips.

"I can do it with your help."

In the first place, the ending I wanted was impossible. Yet if I changed
small impossible things one by one, I might end up changing it to the
impossible ending. Shin Yoosung would be one of the small cornerstones
of this impossible story.

I immediately opened the Dokkaebi Bag and bought a few items. Shin
Yoosung muttered without any confidence, "What can I do? I don't have a
sponsor."

"Why does it matter if you don't have a sponsor?"

[You have sponsored the 'Growth Package I' to the incarnation 'Shin
Yoosung'.]

Shin Yoosung's mouth dropped open.

[You have sponsored the 'Growth Package II' to the incarnation 'Shin
Yoosung'.]

[You have sponsored the 'New Scenario Commemorative Package' to the
incarnation 'Shin Yoosung'.]
…

The messages continued rising. Shin Yoosung paled.

"W-What is this?"

"It's okay, I have a lot of money."

"Ahjussi, who are you?"

"I am Dokja. Kim Dokja." I tapped the head of the child who lost her sense
of realism. "In the next five days, you will become stronger than anyone
here."

It was true. Beast Lord Shin Yoosung. This child would later become one
of the world's 100 most powerful people.

This child, who might become a disaster, would become my 'first
incarnation' in this round.



[1] Sweet potatoes and cider are two Korean slang words, meaning
"frustration" and "relief" respectively.
                 Chapter 97: Ep. 19 – Singularity, V


I wanted to sleep for a while but it was early dawn when I opened my eyes.

[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' encourages you to take care
of your incarnation.]

I unknowingly woke up from Uriel's message. Damn, the constellations had
been making a fuss since I made the 'sponsor declaration' yesterday.

[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' is chuckling at your
choice.]

Truthfully, there was no way I could be a sponsor when my narrative wasn't
properly built. A sponsor who couldn't give their incarnation a stigma was
just a hindrance, although I had a lot more money than a decent sponsor.

[Many constellations are curious about your choice.]

[Some constellations think that your actions are ridiculous.]
The reaction of the constellations to my incarnation was split into two.
Those who liked me were the 'incarnation seekers' while those who disliked
me were the 'amusement seekers'.

Of course, there was one constellation who was unclear.

[The constellation 'Secretive Plotter' is watching your strategy with
interest.]

[1,000 coins have been sponsored.]

I thought he was ordinary when I first saw the modifier but I recently
changed my mind. The average size of his sponsorship was too large. This
constellation was at least 'narrative' grade. However, no matter how much I
searched through Ways of Survival, I couldn't see the name Secretive
Plotter at all.

This meant he wasn't a constellation of this world or he wasn't properly
handled in Ways of Survival. Who was it?

Wooong. Since last night, Shin Yoosung had been practicing her skills in
one corner of the abandoned building. Shin Yoosung used the magic power
recovery potions that I gave her and kept using a skill on the nearby young
groll.

A faint aura stretched out from Shin Yoosung and touched the skin of a
groll. This was the power of Diverse Communication that I saw from Lee
Gilyoung.

I looked down at Shin Yoosung who had dark circles under her eyes.
"Yoosung, have you slept?"

"Not yet."

"Don't you know the penalty for not sleeping? Go to sleep."
"Just a bit more."

[The character 'Shin Yoosung' has used 'Diverse Communication Lv. 8'.]

[The character 'Shin Yoosung' has used 'Taming Lv. 7']

Shin Yoosung's concentration soon disappeared.

[Taming has failed!]

[The monster has started to run wild!]

The groll broke away from the control and rushed towards Shin Yoosung.
Before I could move, the drooling Han Sooyoung sleeping nearby acted.
The groll stopped breathing as it slammed into a wall of the abandoned
building. Han Sooyoung fell asleep again.

I spoke to Shin Yoosung, who was controlling her breathing with a dejected
face. "Do you understand now?"

"Yes." Shin Yoosung made a gloomy expression.

  [Character Summary]

  Name: Shin Yoosung

  Exclusive Attributes: Beast Tamer (Rare), Reflexive Killer (General)

  Exclusive Skills: Taming Lv. 7, Diverse Communication Lv. 8, Agile
  Feet Lv. 8, Hybridization Lv. 6.

  Stigma: None

  Overall Stats: Physique Lv. 19, Strength Lv. 14, Agility Lv. 44, Magic
  Power Lv. 45

   Growth Package I is currently applied.
   Growth Package II is currently applied.
   The New Scenario Commemorative Package is currently applied.




Her skills growth rate was enormous thanks to the growth package I bought
her.

There was also the New Scenario Commemorative Package that promoted
the evolution of stats. I didn't know if any incarnation on the Korean
peninsula had received such package support.

She was a talented person so Diverse Communication would soon break
through the 10th level and become Advanced Diverse Communication.
The problem was that she couldn't properly tame the 8th grade groll despite
her stats. This should be impossible thanks to the help of the system. Shin
Yoosung bowed her head like she was embarrassed. "…I don't have any
talent."

If she didn't have talent then I should just kill myself.

"Don't worry. You have talent. " I couldn't let my precious incarnation
become frustrated. Perhaps Shin Yoosung couldn't use it properly because
of her trauma. "What are you thinking of?"

"I'm scared."

It wasn't hard to guess why she was scared. I told her, "The monsters aren't
pets."

"I know."

"Still, it might be okay to make one a companion. They are durable and
strong."

Shin Yoosung was someone who killed her dog with her own hands. It was
to survive. This fact still remained deep in this child's heart. I thought for a
moment before saying, "Did you know? If all the scenarios are cleared, you
can make a wish…"

"Ahjussi's face changes when you lie. Your nostrils become larger."

This reminded me of Gilyoung. Perhaps the children with Diverse
Communication were more sensitive to body language. I decide to go
forward like a gangster. "…What do you want to ask?"

"Can I do it?"

"You can do it."

"You are speaking without any sincerity."
"I chose you." Shin Yoosung's eyes shook at my words. "I chose you
instead of Seoul. I don't regret it."

"…"

"You can do better than anyone else."

Shin Yoosung looked up at me as she squeezed her fingers together. Then
she started to tear up. "Ahjussi, if I really become strong…"

"Strong?"

Shin Yoosung hesitated for a moment before laughing. "It's nothing. I will
try hard."

Then Shin Yoosung turned around and used the skill again. I suddenly
remembered something. I recalled the type of person Shin Yoosung was
like in the original novel.

「 "Joonghyuk oppa is handsome." 」

「 "Joonghyuk oppa is the best." 」

「 "I like Joonghyuk oppa the most." 」

…This girl, she was a fan of Yoo Joonghyuk in Ways of Survival. Of
course, she wasn't a heroine candidate. Due to her age, she was in the
younger sister position. I remember her having a big fight with Yoo Mia…

I suddenly became a bit worried. Would I lose the person I worked so hard
to raise to Yoo Joonghyuk?

I suddenly turned my head to where Han Sooyoung was stretching as she
woke up. Han Sooyoung noticed my gaze and turned away. This girl, she
had been sulking since yesterday.

I called out to her. "Hey."
"What?"

"Are you going to keep sulking?"

"Don't talk to me."

"There is something I want to ask you."

Han Sooyoung raised an eyebrow at my words. I lowered my voice so that
Shin Yoosung couldn't hear and asked, "What do you think about my
looks? Especially when compared to Yoo Joonghyuk."

Han Sooyoung looked at me like bugs had entered her ears. "Why the hell
are you asking me this?"

"I'm just purely curious."

I had never been interested in what I looked like since I graduated from
high school. Then I thought about the reactions of the prophets when I
pretended to be Yoo Joonghyuk and it seemed that I was ugly. I didn't think
I was ugly when I took occasional selfies in the bathroom.

[A windy constellation is looking at you like you are pathetic.]

She replied, "Accept your fate."

"No, I really am just curious…"

"All I can do now is cheer you up."

Shit.

"…To that extent?"

I quietly looked at Shin Yoosung and made up my mind. I could never let
her meet Yoo Joonghyuk.
We hunted the monsters around us and collected the coins. I invested the
collected coins into Shin Yoosung, causing her stats to grow remarkably
fast.

The coins were primarily used for agility and magic power. It was to
maximize the advantages of Agile Feet, Taming and Diverse
Communication.

By the time night came again, Shin Yoosung finally learnt Advanced
Diverse Communication. However, the Taming skill still didn't succeed.
Shin Yoosung asked, "The future me will be much stronger?"

Of course. The current Shin Yoosung was no match for the future Shin
Yoosung in a frontal battle.

However, if she trained intensively then she could seal one of future Shin
Yoosung's important abilities. The Disaster of Floods was dangerous
because she could lead an army by herself.

"I believe in you more than the future that hasn't come yet."

If the future Shin Yoosung could do it then it was a possibility for the
present Shin Yoosung. Besides, there was a chance of winning if she
confronted her future. It was because the future Shin Yoosung could never
kill the present Shin Yoosung.

"I ate well." Yoo Sangah gave a short prayer after eating the groll meat and
cleaning up its bones.

"Yoo Sangah-ssi is religious?"

"No I'm not."
"Then why pray…"

"I did it for the gods of Olympus."

It was such a realistic prayer that I was dumbfounded. That reminded me.
The gods we knew had become reality and the objects of our prayers were
now clear.

"Today Han Sooyoung and I will stand guard first. Yoo Sangah can sleep."

"Is it okay?"

"Yes."

Yoo Sangah lay down and fell asleep first. Han Sooyoung leaned against
the wall opposite her and messed around with her smartphone.

It was natural to be uncomfortable. They were enemies by nature. Han
Sooyoung's ideas were the opposite of Yoo Sangah's ideals. No matter what
happened in the future, the two of them would be more antagonistic than
friendly.

The tired Shin Yoosung had fallen asleep and only embers remained of the
fire. Han Sooyoung spoke first. "You sleep too."

I lay on the floor but sleep didn't come easily. There were four days left
until the start of the fifth scenario. Shin Yoosung hadn't made any new
progress today but a message came from the Gangseo area this afternoon.

[Someone has dealt with the Disaster of Ice that came from the west.]

This was the message. I didn't have to ask who killed the disaster. Yoo
Joonghyuk had prevented the disaster that would've caused Seoul to
become an Ice Age. Perhaps he had met up with Lee Hyunsung.

Han Sooyoung was watching the embers when she suddenly opened her
mouth. "Hey, I have a question."
"You are ugly."

Han Sooyoung frowned. "Who is wondering about that? You bastard."

"…Then what is it?"

"What do you want to do?"

"What do I want to do?"

"What is your purpose? I think it is strange every time I see you. You
shattered the throne and didn't kill me. What do you want?"

"I have a desired ending."

"Ending?"

I nodded lightly. Unexpectedly, Han Sooyoung didn't ask anything else.
Instead, she spoke about something else. "There was an ending I wanted to
write."

"For your novel?"

"Yes."

"Then let me ask you something."

"What is it?"

"Why did you plagiarize? You write well."

"It isn't plagiarism. Do you think that Ways of Survival is like the Bible?
Aren't the ideas everywhere? The sponsorship of transcendent beings.

Survival missions. A protagonist who regressed. Isn't it harder to find a
novel that doesn't have one of these ideas nowadays?"
"It is because yours is the closest."

"There is a reason for that. Shall I tell you a story? In the past, there was a
poor girl…"

"It is a story of a literary girl living in poverty who became frustrated with
her dream and eventually plagiarized a novel for food and living."

Han Sooyoung's mouth gaped open. "Can you actually read someone's
mind?"

"Eh?"

"Anyway, something like that is possible. Right?"

"What type of god do you think I am? I wouldn't be suffering like this if I
had that skill."

[The character 'Han Sooyoung' has used 'Lie Detection Lv. 3'.]

[The character Han Sooyoung has confirmed that the statement is false.]

Han Sooyoung laughed. "Is it possible for me?"

I didn't answer.

"Well, you don't have to tell me. In any case, if possible please read my
mind right now."

"I can't read it."

"In fact, I didn't plagiarize."

I looked at Han Sooyoung suspiciously and she used Lie Detection on
herself.
[The character Han Sooyoung has confirmed that the statement is true.]
…What?

"It is just a coincidence that the story I wrote was similar to Ways of
Survival. I just wrote according to the dreams I had."

[The character Han Sooyoung has confirmed that the statement is true.]

…This girl was using her subconscious as a shield.

"In any case, you saw it. It was a dream to you."

"Maybe that is true. Then…" Han Sooyoung hesitated before saying,
"Sometimes I think about it."

"Think about what?"

"If this reality is the original and I only reproduced the original then I
might've plagiarized…"

"What are you saying? Then you did plagiarize?"

"Who said that? I said it was just a thought."

In fact, I didn't mean it. It was a thought I had from the moment Ways of
Survival became reality.

Was this world overlaid on a novel? Or was reality turning into a novel?

I stood up and shook my head. "Hey, let's change the shift. Go ahead and
sleep. The constellations on my channel will be reduced if I keep listening
to such a painful story."

"My constellation support has reduced because I've been with you lately."

"That's because you keep doing cancerous things."
We shot a few more barbs at each other before shutting up. I leaned against
the wall of the building and looked at the snoring Han Sooyoung.

I suddenly had a thought. Perhaps I was a bit lucky that she was here. At
least I wasn't alone in knowing that this world was a 'novel'.

At some point, I fell asleep. It might be because I was too tired or perhaps I
was distracted by the unexpected comfort. It was a short but sweet sleep.
However, perhaps I shouldn't have fallen asleep.

When I opened my eyes the next day, Han Sooyoung was a cold corpse.
             Chapter 98: Ep. 20 – Disaster of Floods, I


My heart sank as soon as I looked for Han Sooyoung's pulse. I was more
shocked by the fact that Han Sooyoung was dead. A bit of time passed
before my sense of reason returned.

"…Dokja-ssi?" Yoo Sangah noticed something and got up. I examined Han
Sooyoung's corpse with Yoo Sangah's help.

"There are no wounds."

The situation came to a standstill. There were no wounds. Then was it a
poison? If there was a poison that could kill Han Sooyoung without leaving
any traces then it was a terrible poison.

However, such a poison couldn't be released now. That wasn't the only
problem. Why was only Han Sooyoung poisoned while the rest were safe?
Even if there was a person with such a poison, there was no reason to only
poison Han Sooyoung.
It was strange that I suddenly fell asleep in the first place.

…Wait a minute, I fell asleep?

"Uh, I'm sorry. I slept too much." Shin Yoosung finally opened her eyes.

I suddenly looked back at Yoo Sangah. "Yoo Sangah-ssi, did you sleep all
night?"

"…Yes."

Yoo Sangah blushed like she was embarrassed. If Yoo Sangah hadn't
woken up then no one was standing guard yesterday. I was the last lookout
and once I fell asleep, everyone was sleeping.

I was a fool. My suspicions should've started from 'Why did I sleep?' rather
than 'Who killed Han Sooyoung?'

Was it a sleeping spell? No, only returnee had such magic. Hit a Pressure
Point? They must be able to fool my senses to use it.

In the end, there was only one answer remaining. I approached the fire
where the bones of the groll I ate yesterday was hanging.

This was the only possibility for everyone falling asleep. I cleared up the
bones that were eaten cleanly of their flesh and some green powder fell to
the ground.

'It is the stem of the yanaspleta'.

It was as expected. There was only one reason for this being here. Someone
had mixed the plant stem powder into the groll meat. The stem of the
yanaspleta had a powerful sleeping effect if not taken with the juices. It
wasn't poisonous so it couldn't be resolved with Dongui Bogam. That's why
I always boiled it with the juices.

"Who cooked the groll yesterday?"
"It was Sooyoung-ssi…"

I inwardly sighed. The meat I ate yesterday was the young groll that Shin
Yoosung failed to tame. The one who killed the groll was none other than
Han Sooyoung.

"It was one blow."

I approached the pale body of Han Sooyoung. I was so confused that I had
forgotten for a while. An avatar didn't vanish unless the head was
destroyed.

However, why did she set up this play? She was bound by the 'Temporary
Pledge' and couldn't run away. At that moment, a blue light emerged from
Han Sooyoung's heart. This was…?

"Wait a bit."

I didn't care about the reaction of the others and trampled on Han
Sooyoung's head. The blue light burst out and the avatar was destroyed.

[The character Han Sooyoung's avatar has received the punishment for
violating the contract.]

[The character Han Sooyoung has offered up her avatar as a sacrifice to
offset most of the punishment of the Temporary Pledge.]

"Ah…"

Yoo Sangah let out a groan as if she realized something. I had no idea the
avatar had such an effect. I had seen it receive damage on behalf of the
original but I didn't know it could take the contract's punishment. It looked
like only some of the punishment was offset but Han Sooyoung wouldn't
die.

Shin Yoosung asked, "That unni went away?"
"It seems so."

The question of why was meaningless. Once I thought about it, Han
Sooyoung didn't have much to do with me.

–My constellation support has reduced because I've been with you lately.

I would soon meet with the people of Chungmuro and they would be hostile
to Han Sooyoung, just like Yoo Sangah.

Tsk. A person who couldn't be trusted would live in misery. Han Sooyoung
would be alone, surrounded by enemies. For a moment, I mistook her for a
companion.

There were some coins and a piece of paper in the place where the avatar
turned into white powder.

–The value of the meals.

This was how she said goodbye. As if to turn the time we spent together
into nothing, her avatar was blown away by the strong winds of Han River.

Still, I was curious about why Han Sooyoung stayed with me for so long
despite being able to use 'Surrogate Death' through her avatars.

I didn't know. I couldn't read Yoo Sangah or Han Sooyoung's mind. Ways
of Survival, which explained everything, didn't tell me this.

"We should get up."

Then a strange sensation overcame me. Was it Omniscient Reader's
Viewpoint? I instinctively looked in the direction that I felt it but couldn't
see anything.

…Was I mistaken?
"A fool."

Han Sooyoung looked at the abandoned building from a distant high-rise
building. The wind of Han River permeated through her ripped jeans and
was cold. She bit her lip and muttered.

"…Shouldn't you pretend to feel something?"

However, she knew he couldn't do that. It was natural. He was as much a
'reader' as she was.

She turned on her notepad and started to type something. It was the habit of
an author to write it down when inspiration struck.

「 Reading a book doesn't mean you will understand people. 」

'I will see you again'.

She didn't know the ending that Kim Dokja wanted. However, they would
surely meet again as long as they kept moving towards the end.

「 She didn't know if they would be enemies or not the next time they met.
」

Han Sooyoung covered her smartphone and started walking.




The morning hours passed quickly.
That afternoon, Shin Yoosung's agility and magic power reached the
scenario limit of level 60. I felt that it was time and bought the Sponsor
Contract from Bihyung. Bihyung grumbled but still gave me the contract.

[…You do know that this won't change the disaster?]

'…'

[The present her isn't directly related to the future disaster. The disaster
comes from a world derived from the 'first world' line. Even if their
existences are connected, the history…]

'Don't speak useless words and give me the contract'.

I finished writing the contract and handed it to Shin Yoosung. "I have no
stigma right now and can't lend you my strength like other constellations. I
only have a lot of coins."

"…"

"You don't have to sign the contract if you don't want to. However, you
won't regret it if you sign with me."

"Mother told me not to mess around with this type of stuff…"

"It's okay. I don't really mean to be a typical sponsor."

"If I sign this, I can't contract with another constellation?"

"Yes."

Shin Yoosung nodded with determination. "Okay. I believe in ahjussi."

[The Sponsor Contract has been concluded.]

[You have become the sponsor of the incarnation 'Shin Yoosung'.]
A brilliant light rose and wrapped around me and Shin Yoosung. Unlike the
brilliant light, a humble message popped up.

[You aren't a constellation. You are unable to use most of the functions of a
sponsor.]

[List of Available Functions]

   [1.     Sponsor the incarnation.]

   [2.     Encourage the incarnation.]

Well, I had expected it. This was about it for now.

[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' scoffs.]

[The constellation 'Secretive Plotter' congratulates you on your first
contract.]

[5,000 coins have been sponsored.]

[A number of constellations want to be your sponsor.]

The reactions of the constellations were hot. It was different from the time
with Gong Pildu. Shin Yoosung was now my direct incarnation. Therefore,
the 'incarnation seekers' group were going crazy over me.

I wasn't a constellation, I was an 'incarnation' with an 'incarnation'. If they
signed a contract with me, Shin Yoosung would naturally come under that
constellation as well. As I increased my number of incarnations, the number
of constellations who wanted me would increase rapidly.

[The channel is going crazy…!]

Bihyung screamed happily as I looked at the party. "It is time for us to
leave. We will cross Han River."
"We still haven't found any bridges. Will it be okay?"

"We'll go swimming."

"Huh?"

"Don't you know how to swim?"

"I do know but…" Yoo Sangah looked at the river with concern.

I knew what she was worried about. The water levels of Han River had
increased. There were more ichthyosaurs present than yesterday and they
were intermittently roaring. They were all 7th grade. Shin Yoosung
muttered, "I can't swim…"

"Hold onto this and cross."

I pulled out a styrofoam box that I had obtained in advance. I asked Yoo
Sangah to connect the box to me using Arachne's Spiderweb.

"Let's go."

I jumped into Han River without hesitation and Yoo Sangah immediately
followed me. Shin Yoosung was frightened but she quickly grabbed the
styrofoam box and dipped her feet into the water of Han River.

The cold temperature of Han River wrapped around my body. There was
the smell of strange beasts and the movements of the ichthyosaurs started
to change. Yoo Sangah asked, –Is this really okay?

Of course it wasn't okay. However, it was the only way considering the
time remaining.

–If it gets really dangerous then get out as soon as possible.

–…Yes.
–That's why you should pretend to be in danger before it is actually
dangerous.

–Huh?

–It is for Yoosung to quickly awaken. I am deliberately creating a crisis.
Understood?

I pulled the styrofoam box as I started swimming in Han River. This was
the reason why I raised Shin Yoosung's skill level without worrying. It
wasn't shown in the attributes window but she had an innate ability to
adapt.

An ordinary girl could never survive until the fifth scenario. Shin Yoosung
seemed like a good child but her inner self wasn't that simple.

A child who killed her dog, who tricked adults and who disguised herself to
gain favour from the strong. Shin Yoosung was such a child. The first time
we met, there were many calculations going on inside her head.

I spoke to Shin Yoosung who was looking around. "Yoosung."

"Y-Yes!"

"Don't run away."

"…"

"If you run away from here, you can't go back." Shin Yoosung closed her
slightly open mouth. Shin Yoosung was a clever child rather than a brute.
"Do what you can."

Tricks wouldn't work on her. I couldn't protect her just because she was a
child.

"I understand."
Fear was fear, fear was determination.

[The character 'Shin Yoosung' has used 'Advanced Diverse Communication
Lv. 3'.]

Killing intent was all around me. The predators seeking prey were
increasing. I could see 10 of them above the surface of the water. It was a
difficult number to fight all at once. However, I could escape and survive.
The ichthyosaurs couldn't chase me the moment I left Han River.

"Dokja-ssi!"

Yoo Sangah called out a warning. The attack of the ichthyosaurs began.
Sharp fangs flew from every direction.

[Blade of Faith is activated!]

I swung the blade and immediately pierced one ichthyosaur. The serpentine
body hit the surface of the water.

The ichthyosaur's writhing overturned Han River. I flew in the air along
with the river water. Looking back, Shin Yoosung had let go of the
styrofoam box and was also rising in the air.

Something quickly rose into the sky and Yoo Sangah's spiderweb wrapped
around Shin Yoosung. It was the linked Hermes Walking Method and
Arachne's Spiderweb.

Yoo Sangah retrieved Shin Yoosung safely while I stepped on the dead
ichthyosaur and started swinging my sword at the approaching
ichthyosaurs.

"This way you bastards!"
More than a dozen ichthyosaurs swam in my direction. Huge waves rocked
the river and the body of the ichthyosaur I was standing on was in danger. I
took a deep breath and adjusted my posture.

Way of the Wind would allow me to easily handle this crisis but it wasn't
time yet.

"Ahjussi!"

Shin Yoosung's face became desperate as she was held in Yoo Sangah's
arms. Several fangs aimed at my skin as I wielded the blade. A few
ichthyosaurs received mortal blows and fell down. The flowing blood
cooled down and this area was becoming more and more crowded.
However, I laughed.

Become more urgent.

Become more anxious.

Become more desperate.

It was the only way.

A terrible injury was created where an ichthyosaur's fans grazed my skin.
Blood started to pour from the wound.

「 No―!」

The scream entered my eardrums.

[The character 'Shin Yoosung' is about to evolve.]

[Incarnation 'Shin Yoosung' has entered a trance state.]

Shin Yoosung's eyes were turning white. It was the same as when Lee
Gilyoung used his power. It was as I thought. All of this was staged for
Shin Yoosung's awakening.
[The character 'Shin Yoosung' has used 'Taming Lv. 9'.]

The level 60 magic power started to spread out through Han River, the aura
pouring like a waterfall.

The ichthyosaurs' momentum slowed. The ichthyosaurs shivered and
groaned, as if responding to an enormous spirit.

The number of ichthyosaurs seen above the surface of the water increased.
Previously it was around 10 and now it was more than 20. This meant that
below the water, more than twice the number of ichthyosaurs were
gathering.

Then the ichthyosaurs started looking at me again. The confused
ichthyosaurs emitted a sharp killing intent and became more violent.

Dammit, was it a failure?

"Yoo Sangah-ssi!"

It couldn't be helped. It was best to use her stigma to escape quickly. Yoo
Sangah nodded, escaped the ichthyosaurs and released her threads. I called
out to Shin Yoosung.

"Yoosung. You can stop. Shin Yoosung!"

However, Shin Yoosung didn't answer. The waves around Shin Yoosung
grew stronger and now her body was covered with a bluish aura.

At this moment, a whirlpool occurred in the center of Han River. I couldn't
grab onto anything and was swept away by the water. The surrounding
ichthyosaurs screamed. I barely endured the centrifugal force while hanging
onto the scales of an ichthyosaur.

The next moment, there was a huge splash of water. Then an ichthyosaur
five or six times bigger than the other ichthyosaurs slowly rose.
It was so big that it didn't seem like an ichthyosaur. It was much bigger than
the sea commander that I killed previously. It had a majestic beard and
arrogant eyes that dominated its species.

All the ichthyosaurs around it bowed their heads to the surface of the water.

[The fifth grade seawater species, the 'Queen Mirabad' has been
discovered!]

…Shit, she called this monster? I knew Shin Yoosung had great talent but I
didn't know it was enough to call a 'queen'. This was a monster comparable
to a disaster.

I opened up Bookmark and was about to invoke Way of the Wind when
Yoo Sangah's voice was heard.

"…Dokja-ssi?"

I looked back and found that Shin Yoosung's body was floating in the air.

She followed the path of the aura that stretched out to Queen Mirabad and
Shin Yoosung slowly approached the queen. The queen looked at Shin
Yoosung and Shin Yoosung looked at the queen. Then Shin Yoosung's
small hand quietly touched the queen's nose.

The river water subsided and the ichthyosaurs quietly disappeared. I looked
over and saw Shin Yoosung riding on the queen's head. I now realized what
Shin Yoosung was.

Beast Lord. The ruler of all monsters.

The colour slowly returned to Shin Yoosung's eyes as she watched me.
She wiped at her bleeding nose like it was nothing and said, "Let's go,
ahjussi." I nodded.
              Chapter 99: Ep. 20 – Disaster of Floods, II


I remembered Han Myungoh boasting about a private yacht at his Maldives
villa. He had said this: The propeller cutting through the water was like a
highway on the sea.

Now I knew what that feeling was like. If Director Han's boat on the ocean
was like the Gyeongbu Expressway then I was currently on the Autobahn.

"It is really amazing."

Yoo Sangah and I rode on the back of the queen and watched the ripples of
Han River with fascination. As if testing her control, Shin Yoosung led the
queen straight through the group of ichthyosaurs. Now Han River had
become a safe zone and it was preferable to disembark near Yongsan-gu.

The ichthyosaurs swam after Queen Mirabad like ducklings following their
mother. I closed my eyes and felt the cool air against my face. This was a
real feeling. It was a luxury I wouldn't have enjoyed if the world had
remained the same.
Shin Yoosung kept mumbling on the queen's head in order to sync their
spirits. Yoo Sangah watched Shin Yoosung and spoke with a complicated
voice. "By the way, Dokja-ssi. If Yoosung becomes stronger now then
won't her future self be stronger as well?"

I thought she would ask something like this.

"I don't think so."

According to the original novel, the disaster that would come was the Shin
Yoosung of the 'future of different regressions'. She was betrayed by Yoo
Joonghyuk and abandoned outside the world.

She lost her sense of time and wandered the universe. Then she became part
of the scenarios due to the Star Stream's blessing and she became a 'disaster'
of past scenarios.

Yoo Sangah raised a question. "Then why will the future disaster be
stopped if the current Yoosung dies? If the branch is completely
different…"

"Have you heard of the Disconnected Film theory?"

"…No." I watched the water and opened my mouth. "Put simply, it is like
this. Let's assume that the history of Yoosung from the first world is a
film."

"Film… are you talking about the film for movies?"

I nodded and continued. "Assuming that this world is film one, there must
be countless films of the other worlds right? There could be two films and
there could also be 34 films."

"I see. Is that right?"
"What happens when one of the films, with the front broken, sticks to the
back of the first film? For example, what if the ripped 34th film sticks to
the back of the first film? What do you think will happen if the film is
played?"

Yoo Sangah seemed troubled for a moment. "Then the movie would change
along the way… ah, wait a minute. The two stories will never affect each
other?"

"That's right."

"Ah… Yoosung is currently in such a situation. The present Yoosung is
from the first film while the disaster Yoosung is from the 34th film. The
two stories are completely independent and any changes in our world can't
affect the disaster." Yoo Sangah was truly smart. "Still, the question
remains. Shouldn't the disaster remain if the current Yoosung is killed?"

"The contents of the film don't affect each other but the two films are
connected."

"Huh?"

"What if the front of the film is set on fire?"

Yoo Sangah shouted after realizing. "The rear film… will be on fire as
well."

The two world lines were connected. If the present Yoosung dies, the future
Yoosung would also die. However, any changes to the present Yoosung
wouldn't change the future Yoosung. That ambiguous paradox was at the
heart of this disaster.

"Dokja-ssi really knows a lot. I've heard of parallel cosmology but I've
never heard such a theory before."
I awkwardly nodded. Of course she wouldn't know it. It was a theory that
the author of Ways of Survival created. As far as I knew, the laws of Ways
of Survival had never been violated.

After a while, the water of Han River calmed down. We finally arrived at
the other side of Han River. The queen dropped us off and then disappeared
into Han River again.

Shin Yoosung sighed like all the tension had been released. "…How was
I?"

"Are you really asking? You have done well."

"Yes."

Shin Yoosung's expression changed. She was pleased at receiving praise.
Now there was nobody left to praise the child.

Then I felt a fierce hostility coming from the buildings of Yongsan-gu. A
huge shadow came out from the shadows of the building.

…A giant praying mantis? The boy on top of the praying mantis looked
down at me.

"Dokja hyung?"

There were Lee Gilyoung wearing a snapback and Han Donghoon with
headphones.

Lee Gilyoung slid down the praying mantis and rushed into my arms. Lee
Gilyoung's snapback fell off his head.

It was a reunion after one week. Then a message popped up on my
smartphone. It was from Han Donghoon.

–It is good to see you, hyung.
"Shouldn't you say it is nice to meet me after a long time?"

–I don't want to.




Lee Gilyoung and Shin Yoosung had a war of nerves as soon as they met.
Lee Gilyoung's hair was moving like it was really an antennae while Shin
Yoosung kept touching her hair.

"Ahjussi, that boy keeps glaring at me."

"Hyung, who is she?"

It seemed people of a similar type recognized each other. One was a beast
master and the other was an insect master. I didn't know if they would fit
together.

I asked Lee Gilyoung, "You haven't met Heewon-ssi yet?"

"Yes. However, I know where she is. I sent an insect to look. Heewon
noona is currently in the north."

As expected from Lee Gilyoung. He was already searching for the group
members without needing to be told.

By the way, the north was where the King of Wanderers was currently
located. Maybe Jung Heewon was in contact with her.

"I knew hyung was coming. I sent a lot of diving beetles."

Speaking of which, the bugs on Lee Gilyoung's head had increased. There
had definitely only been a cockroach before… Shin Yoosung frowned like
it was disgusting. I checked the power of the party and concluded.
"It is better to stay here for two days. Raise your skill levels as high as
possible and collect coins in your spare time. Take care of your overall
stats. Ah, Yoo Sangah-ssi."

"Yes."

"Did you contact your family?"

Yoo Sangah's face suddenly darkened. It seemed that she hadn't contacted
them yet.

"Donghoon."

Han Donghoon kept his headphones on and nodded silently. Han Donghoon
had Wide-area Internet as a skill. In other words, it was possible to
communicate with the outside world.

Yoo Sangah's smartphone rang and there was a message that it was
connected to the Internet. Yoo Sangah looked down like she doubted her
eyes before staring at me tearfully. I nodded and continued.

"Please tell your family of this situation. Once this scenario is over, the
outside of Seoul will no longer be a safe zone."

"What will happen?"

"I don't know what will happen. Just tell them to be prepared. That is
enough for now."

"Dokja-ssi, don't you have to contact anyone?"

"I'm fine."

"But…"

"My family is in Seoul."
"Seoul? Then…"

"They are safe."

I silently stared towards the north. Then the system message arrived like it
had been waiting.

[Someone has dealt with the Disaster of Water in the north.]

The King of Wanderers had finished her work safely. There was only one
disaster left. It was the Disaster of Floods.




「 The bright energy sword made a faint sound as it was raised in the air. It
struck dozens of energy blades at once. Blood flowed from Jung Heewon's
eyes and scattered through the air. Soon Jung Heewon's sword stopped.

"I think that's it."

Jung Heewon carefully inspected the sword and smiled with satisfaction.
The middle-aged woman across from her also smiled faintly.

"Jeon Woochi's technique is amazing."

"Heewon-ssi's kendo is also excellent. You will soon have a sponsor and I
might not be a match anymore."

"I'm flattered."

Jung Heewon stared at the woman's blue prison uniform. In the past week,
Jung Heewon had been indebted to them. It was a debt that probably
couldn't be repaid with the remaining time. A middle-aged woman asked.
"Do you really not want to join our New Wave group? The king will be
delighted if Heewon-ssi joins."

"I'm sorry but my companions are waiting."

Jung Heewon raised her hands in an apologetic manner. The middle-aged
woman just smiled like it couldn't be helped. The woman already knew who
the members of Jung Heewon's party were.

"I hope he knows that Heewon-ssi is this desperate."

"He knows." Jung Heewon looked at the sky with a slightly disgruntled
expression. "Somehow, I think he is watching me right now." 」

…This was why I didn't want her knowing about Omniscient Reader's
Viewpoint.

In any case, Jung Heewon seemed to be growing well. I was worried since
her character hadn't seen the light in the original book but I was glad my
choice was correct.

Then I watched someone else using Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint.
Unfortunately, there weren't many visible points to determine the person's
identity.

…Um? What was this? A familiar face soon appeared on the screen.

…It was me? Wait. These people?

「 "Hey, you." Lee Gilyoung spoke in a ferocious voice. "Stay away from
hyung."

Then Shin Yoosung, who was lying next to me, replied, "What if I don't
want to?"

"This mongrel…"
"Don't talk to me, you worm bastard."

Lee Gilyoung was stunned. The cockroach and other bugs moved wildly on
his head. Lee Gilyoung barely regained his composure.

"Hyung hates kids like you."

"I know who ahjussi likes."

"…You know who hyung likes? Who?"

"An unni."

Lee Gilyoung laughed. "Unni? I think you are misinformed. Hyung likes a
man."

"How do you know?"

"I've been with hyung for a long time." 」

I barely managed to wake up as the terrible conversation began. I hurriedly
looked around and saw Lee Gilyoung and Shin Yoosung sleeping with their
heads leaning on something.

…Did I see wrongly? Was it just a dream?

"Dokja-ssi, what's wrong?"

I shook my head at Yoo Sangah's question. It must be a dream. I was just
lying back down when I heard a whisper from somewhere.

'Hey, bug. Come to think of it, you hugged ahjussi earlier?'

'…'
'Are you a baby? Do you like old people?'

It wasn't a dream.

"Excuse me… aren't you sleeping?"

Yoo Sangah warned. Then the surroundings became silent and the
children's snoring started soon afterwards.




Two days flew by in a flash.

[The sub-scenario – Survival Activities has ended.]

Everyone heard the system message as they woke up and got ready. It didn't
feel like a lot of time has passed, but the scenario was already over. Then a
message from Bihyung arrived.

[9,421.]

It was a number. Bihyung spoke again.

[9,513.]

'What?'

[Don't you understand? 9,611.]

I noticed right away what the number was. At that time, I made a '10,000'
promise.

[Constellations who love the Korean peninsula are nervous about the
number of subscribers left.]
I asked Bihyung, 'Did you do what I told you?'

[…I did but I don't know if it will be any good. In any case, I wish you
luck. 9,781.]

The swirling Great Hole in the sky showed an unusual omen. There was a
thunderstorm and the intermittent sound of thunder was heard. Then an
intermediate dokkaebi appeared in the air.

[Everyone, you have been waiting a long time.]

The intermediate dokkaebi looked gaunt. He had probably been suffering
from the bureau.

[Did you enjoy the survival activities? The scenario that you have been
waiting for will finally begin. There were some disruptions but… yes, well.
It will be a fun scenario to look forward to.]

He looked at me and the incarnations and continued speaking in a
disgruntled tone.

[You have stopped four of the five disasters. I fully acknowledge your
accomplishments. But do you know? The other four were just child's play
compared to the last disaster.]

The faces of the people became tense. In fact, he was right. None of the
other disasters could compare to the Disaster of Floods.

[Depending on the success of this scenario, everything that you have done
so far might go away and everything will be over. Frankly, the odds of that
happening are over 90%. Fortunately, there are those who commiserate
with you.]

I formed tight fists. It was finally starting. The last event before the fifth
scenario started.
[Then, from now on I will start the second Sponsor Selection.]
