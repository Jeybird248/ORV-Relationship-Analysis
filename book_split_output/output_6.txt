250: Ep. 47 - Demon King Selection, IV


The ground and the sky rattled like cogs. Something gigantic was
descending from the sky and there was a person blocking it. The magic
power and giant story caused a burst of brilliant sparks as they collided.
[There are 40 seconds until the start of the destruction scenario.]

The opponent was an outer god. Little by little, the ceiling of the sky was
coming closer. The Breaking the Sky Sword Saint didn't back down despite
the pressure weighing down on the entire castle. No, she couldn't back
down. She never backed down from her beliefs. This was the banner of a
transcendent who only walked a single story.

"Fight it!"

The Breaking the Sky Sword Saint revived the despairing Murim people.

[Many constellations are interested in the development of this scenario.]
[Some constellation are paying attention to the transcendent 'Namgung
Minyoung.]

The stars were gathering in the night sky. Like piranhas smelling blood, the
constellations illuminated the sky with a red light. The dokkaebis also
appeared like they had been waiting.

[Constellations, it is time for the destruction to come!]

Some of the constellations were watching the world's demise with a somber
expression while others were watching with excitement. Every person's
feelings were different but the downfall of one world was nothing more
than entertainment for them.

…Just like me. At this moment, many emotions muddled my head. Maybe
these emotions had been piled up since the Gourmet Association. If I threw
away Murim here, would I be any different from them?

"Breaking the Sky Sword Saint! I…!"

I pulled up my status and a change occurred in the constellations.

[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' is looking forward to
your choice.]

[Many constellations are paying attention to your presence!]

The attention moved from the Breaking the Sky Sword Saint to me.

[ Yo u…? ]

If I caught the eye of the outer god, I wouldn't be able to escape this place.
The Breaking the Sky Sword Saint knew this and stopped me. "This isn't
your battlefield."

It was as if this page wasn't allowed for me.
"Leave this world to the people here."

I didn't know what Murim was for the Breaking the Sky Sword Saint. It was
a place that worshipped her a god while also bringing her down.

Nevertheless, at this moment, the Breaking the Sky Sword Saint decided to
defend Murim.

[The stories of the 29th scenario area, the First Murim is piling up.]

Then Murim responded to the Breaking the Sky Sword Saint.

[The 29th scenario area has found its guardian.]

[The First Murim is looking at 'Breaking the Sky Sword Saint Namgung
Minyoung'.]

[The possibility of a giant 'story' is germinating.]

The Breaking the Sky Sword Saint blinked with surprise. Perhaps it was the
first time she had heard this message. If someone wanted to destroy the
world, the world would respond to the destruction.

「 In this world, everything that has built up history has a will. 」

It was a land that was made of the blood, flesh, sweat and effort of the
Murim people. The stories carved onto the land were flocking to the
Breaking the Sky Sword Saint. Grandeur could be felt from the Breaking
the Sky Sword Saint as Murim nestled in her body.

The possibility of a giant story. It hadn't blossomed yet and I didn't know
when it would be germinated…

Still, it as the possibility of a giant story.

[ Ka ka ka ka ka ka ka. ]
A bizarre sound that resembled laughter poured from the sky. Finally, five
tentacles descended from the sky.

No matter how great the possibility of a giant story, it was impossible to
stop the outer god with just the Breaking the Sky Sword Saint. The outer
gods were beings who had lived a long time and faced such giant stories.
She knew no more time could be wasted and the Breaking the Sky Sword
Saint shouted, "Go now!"

Then my body was pushed into the car.

[The portal is activated.]

Yoo Joonghyuk belatedly regained his mind and tried to get out of the car,
but the X-grade Ferrarigini had already started.

It only took one moment. As we passed through the portal, the Breaking the
Sky Master was silent. The scenery of Murim slowly moved away and
everything was covered in darkness. The survivors never said anything for
a long time.




[You have arrived in the 73rd Demon Realm.]

[There are three days remaining until the Demon King Selection.]

Maybe it was because too many things happened in a row. The party had no
words after returning. The car turned off and only a stillness remained.

"I'll smoke a cigarette for a while."
Han Myungoh left while Jang Hayoung placed his head against his knees.
The Breaking the Sky Master whined while Yoo Joonghyuk… damn. I
breathed calmly while thinking about what I gained from this journey.

Everything I had done was for the upcoming Demon King Selection. I went
to Murim to recruit the Breaking the Sky Sword Saint as a colleague and
went to the Gourmet Association in the process.

I couldn't bring the Breaking the Sky Sword Saint back with me. I couldn't
persuade the constellations of the Gourmet Association. The only income
was that Yoo Joonghyuk and Jang Hayoung became stronger, there was a
transcendent dog and…

[Coins Possessed: 4,890,875 C]

…

[The second revision update has been completed.]

Despite the message, I didn't dare to look at my smartphone. Nevertheless, I
had to look, even if I felt disgusted by the contents I would see.

"Kim Dokja."

I looked up and saw Yoo Joonghyuk staring at me. I couldn't bear to read
the anger in his heart. I had nothing to say even if Yoo Joonghyuk tried to
kill me here.

"What do we do now?" It was a voice that contained no special feelings. I
felt a subtle fear and triggered Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint. Then I
immediately regretted it.

「… 」

「… 」
「… 」

My chest was stuffy from the suffocating emotions. They were emotions
that couldn't be described in words. The sorrow was too deep that it couldn't
become language.

Yoo Joonghyuk was already a madman. Maybe he had been like this for a
long time. This event would wear him down even more. The emotions that
didn't burst would move onto the next turn and it would lead to his death. It
would wear at him and isolate him.

The Breaking the Sky Sword Saint of the third round would be forgotten. I
opened my trembling lips. I needed to say something.

The Breaking the Sky Sword Saint was surely alive. She would come back
alive. However, I couldn't say it. I wasn't tls123.

"We have to try." That was all I could say. "Struggle, fight and turn things
upside down."

Yoo Joonghyuk stared at me quietly before leaving the car. I could see it
without asking. Maybe he was going to do his own preparations.

This was Yoo Joonghyuk. He didn't give up on his goal even if he gave up
his life. Despite the mighty despair, he challenged it again and again,
overcoming that despair. Thus, he lived and would live like that.

Eventually, he would become unhappy. Once Yoo Joonghyuk, only one
sentence that I read from his heart was left with me.

「 I'm not like you. 」

I brooded over this sentence as I turned on my smartphone. I knew what
Yoo Joonghyuk was talking about.

–Three Ways to Survive in a Ruined World (2nd Revision).txt
The death of the Breaking the Sky Sword Saint would be recorded. The
success of this round would be written down. Maybe the changed 'ending'
would be written.

[The 'Fourth Wall' is shaking faintly.]

My trembling fingers touched the screen several times. Yoo Joonghyuk's
words once again emerged.

「 I'm not like you. 」

I didn't know what that bastard knew about me. I had watched Yoo
Joonghyuk for over 10 years while Yoo Joonghyuk hadn't even known me
for a year. That jerk, what did he know about me…?

I turned off the screen. It didn't matter what was written. In any case, the
story I wanted to create wouldn't be in it.

"Jang Hayoung. I want to save Murim."

Jang Hayoung wiped his eyes while raising his head. I stared at him and
slowly opened my mouth. I didn't know if this would work or not. Still, it
was better than doing nothing.




There were various beings in the detention center of the Executive Branch.
It was mainly filled with imprisoned constellations and transcendents
caught by the 'probability conformity assessment'.

However, it was rare for a member of the Executive Branch to come
directly, even if probability was
violated. Those who used too much probability would be hit by a storm and
it was easy to avoid attention.

Even so, the Executive Branch had to step in for this man's situation. The
dokkaebi 'Youngki' sighed as he gazed at the map trapped in the probability
net.

"Look here."

Then the little person looked at Youngki. Youngki gazed at the handsome
face and said, "You should now return to your original scenario area. Isn't
your home in danger?"

"…"

"Thanks to you, your planetary system is unable to proceed with the
scenario."

The small man laughed. "Once I leave, you will send the 'disaster' to Peace
Land again."

"Didn't I already say that won't happen?"

"I don't believe in your words."

Youngki flinched and stepped back at the growling voice. This was why
transcendents were tricky. The constellations could quickly understand
once spoken to but the transcendents were stubborn mortal and sometimes
made absurd messes like this.

The man continued to speak. "There is someone I'm waiting for. I'll stay
here until he returns to my home."

"Waiting for? Who is it?"

"I'll leave on my own once he comes."
Youngki was about to open his mouth again when the prison door opened
and a new prisoner appeared.

[Grrr… fucking dokkaebis!]

The prison shook from the fierce true voice. Youngki and the small man
turned towards the voice at the same time.

At the entrance, a constellation who had been bounded by the Executive
Branch dokkaebis was walking in. It was a constellation with the
appearance of a lizard.

[That bastard scammed me! He was the one who stole my coins. Why did
you grab me instead of him?]

"If you can't find a way to repay your debt, we will be forced to take away a
story."

Youngki had a rough idea of the situation. Sometimes these things
happened.
The constellation came here because he couldn't repay the ridiculous loan
interest.

Youngki was clicking his tongue while the constellation continued yelling.
The dokkaebis were familiar with such turmoil but one person wasn't.

"Shut up."

The Brash Swamp Predator turned at the cold voice.

[Who are you? Little man…!]

At this moment, a tremendous airflow swirled around the 'little man'. His
body seemed to rise in the air and blue lightning wrapped around his body.

[What… kuk…?]
The Brash Swamp Predator let out a confused sound. The power of a mortal
pressed down on his 'status'. It was something he had never experienced
before.

The 'net' of the prison let out a pained scream. A strength beyond the
probability assigned to this place was rising from the small man. The
shocked Youngki and the other dokkaebis increased the output of the net
but the situation didn't change.

The man's body became smaller and he 'popped' through the net. The huge
storm shot towards the Brash Swamp Predator. The whole building shook
and dust rose.

[Uh… uhh…]

The Brash Swamp Predator lay on the floor. Five dokkaebis had bravely
rushed forward and barely managed to deflect the trajectory of the
bluewhite fist. The terrible traces left by the fist remained on the wall.
Rather than blaming the master of the fist, the dokkaebis quickly delivered
a report.

"Congratulations Brash Swamp Predator. You are free."

[Huh? What?]

"I just received an order to release you. Someone has paid your debt."

[What? Who…?]

The Brash Swamp Predator forget what just happened at the news. The
moment the dokkaebi mentioned a name, Kyrgios' body stopped while the
Brash Swamp Predator wondered,

[…That guy paid my debt?]
At this moment, the blue-white lightning of Electrification shot towards the
dokkaebi. Kyrgios picked up the dokkaebi by the collar and asked, "What
did you say just now?"

"N-No, what…?"

"The name you just said. Where is he now?"

Before the dokkaebi could answer, a message flew into Kyrgios' ears.
Kyrgios stared blankly at the air for a moment before walking past the
dokkaebis towards the entrance.

Youngki urgently exclaimed. "Wait a minute! I can't let you go! If you go
back to your home planet—"

"I won't go home." The Paradox Baekchung, Kyrgios Rodgraim spoke with
a smile filled with anger. "I will go to my disciple."
         Chapter 251: Ep. 47 - Demon King Selection, V


We soon arrived at the Yoo Joonghyuk Industrial Complex (formerly
Syswitz).

Along the way, Yoo Joonghyuk spoke no words and acted similarly once
arriving at the industrial complex. The moment the X-grade Ferrarigini
turned off, Yoo Joonghyuk got off the car and told me, "From now on, I
will act separately."

"…Will you come for the selection?"

Yoo Joonghyuk briefly nodded before moving his feet and disappearing
from view. He seemed to know where he was going and what he was going
to do. The one certain thing was that everything in his vision would be
broken.

"…You aren't going to stop him?"
I nodded at Jang Hayoung's question. After all, I made a plan on the
premise that Yoo Joonghyuk didn't listen to me. Yoo Joonghyuk just
needed to live safely until the Demon King Selection.

The important thing was what I needed to do now. I ignored the minor
procedures and headed straight to Aileen's council room.

"It has been a while."

I hadn't met Aileen for some time and she looked haggard from the busy
industrial complex.

Aileen pushed up her glasses and submitted a report. "Since the duke left, I
have been struggling with the other industrial complexes… the party
members handle it well."

"Party members?"

"Yoo Joonghyuk's party. You don't know it? Every morning, there are
people walking around saying 'I am Yoo Joonghyuk'. It was founded just
before you left… you must not have seen it."

Was it them? Damn. I sometimes thought I could still hear the shouts from
that day.

Aileen shook her head and continued. "In recent days, a group of followers
of the 'Punisher' was created."

"Was her identity revealed?"

"Not yet. She was suddenly gone soon after the duke left."

"Gone?"
A strange feeling entered my heart. Perhaps? I had a thought but it wasn't
possible. It was impossible for such a thing to come true, no matter how I
thought about it.

Aileen let out a small sigh. "I don't know why I keep reporting to you. The
owner of this industrial complex is Yoo Joonghyuk."

"It doesn't matter. In any case…"

"…The duke should now go to his industrial complex."

This wasn't my industrial complex. Since I had returned to the Demon
Realm, I had to go check the current status of the Kim Dokja Industrial
Complex (formerly Gilobat). I left it to Mark but I didn't know what
would've happened.

I stared at the landscape of the industrial complex through the window.
Many things had happened since coming here. I got up from my seat and
Aileen rose with me.

"D-Duke-nim."

I looked back and Aileen's expression was strange. It seemed cold, sad and
disappointed. Even so, her voice was calm when she opened her mouth. I
had studied Aileen in Ways of Survival and knew whenever she made this
voice.

Aileen rummaged for a moment and then held out a small box. "This is
what you asked for before."

The box contained a small watch. It was a small pocket watch designed
with very fine circuits. I held it and felt a slight vibration from the watch.
As I sensed the slow but surely moving time, many things passed through
my mind.
The story horizon, the revolutionary game… All the memories that had
gone retreated to an out of reach place were ticking away.

I stared at the watch for a while. I glanced at Aileen again and she was
looking at me with both wrists overlapping each other.

I seemed to know what would happen from now on.

"Duke Yoo Joonghyuk."

It was a motion that crossed both wrists. This was a greeting from the home
planet where Aileen lived, Lindberg. Crossing two veins and conveying the
vibrations to the other side. As if the second hand of the clock was moving,
Aileen's pulse was conveyed to me.

"This industrial complex won't forget you."




After leaving the Yoo Joonghyuk Industrial Complex, I headed straight to
the Kim Dokja Industrial Complex. Originally it should've taken a week but
the engine of the X-grade Ferrarigini meant it only took two hours.

I sat in the passenger seat and looked at the scenery passing by while
thinking about Aileen's words.

–There was on dokkaebi, one from the sinister family with a lump and
several constellations.

It was a list of those who came to visit while I was away. The dokkaebi was
probably from the bureau and the sinister family with a lump was probably
a wenny person. I couldn't guess the constellations because they didn't leave
their modifiers.
–Be careful, there are many strong people in the Demon Realm watching
you.

There was no need to tell me. I just needed to look at the channel.

[Many constellations are paying attention to your actions.]

[Your modifier is spreading among the constellations of the absolute evil
system.]

[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' is watching you with anxious
eyes.]

There were no three days until the Demon King Selection. I looked to the
back seat where Jang Hayoung and the Breaking the Sky Master were
hugging each other while sleeping. The Breaking the Sky Master and Jang
Hayoung must be tired.

In particular, Jang Hayoung was forced to operate the Unidentified Wall
because of me. Still, their presence meant I could think of something to
try. I glanced at the driver's seat and asked, "Department Head Han
Myungoh."

"Hmm?" Han Myungoh glanced at me with a puzzled expression from
where he was experimenting with the function of the X-grade Ferrarigini. I
didn't know if he was conscious of my gaze but Han Myungoh cleared his
throat. "Hum hum, life isn't easy?"

…Honestly, the timing was strange. Han Myungoh saw my confusion and
quickly added.

"I felt it while living… life is supposed to be like this. There are times when
nothing can be done and times when things don't work out."
It was an obvious statement but Han Myungoh's expression contained a
certain amount of affection. Come to think of it, Han Myungoh had really
experienced many things. In a sense, he might've had a harder time than
me.

I thought about it and suddenly wanted to ask Han Myungoh something.
"Can I ask you something?"

"Ask me anything."

Perhaps the man who gave birth to a child in this world could make a
reliable expression. I repeatedly turned the smartphone on and off as I
thought about what to say.

Han Myungoh seemed to accept my actions and opened his mouth.
"Kung… it was painful."

"What are you saying?"

"I thought that's what you wanted to ask. It is a pain that's hard for any man
or woman to endure."

I was shocked once I understood what Han Myungoh was talking about.
No,
I didn't want to ask him about that…

Still, I was curious. "Where did it come from?"

"I gave birth in my heart."

"Was it painful?"

Han Myungoh pulled out a cigarette and suddenly made a serious
expression. "At first, I was going to kill you."

The bitter cigarette smoke flew out the window.
"It was shameful and humiliating. I was dumbfounded and wondered why I
was in a situation like this."

"…"

"I tried the methods that appeared in dramas. For example, things like
eating a lot of soy sauce. It wasn't easy to find because of the situation."

There was no sense of reality as I heard this story from Han Myungoh. It
would've been an unimaginable hardship for me.

"I was scared. What if I gave birth to a monster? What if my child ate me?
One day, suddenly tearing out of my belly and killing me…"

"…"

"I was alone for countless nights, ran away and avoided monsters while
feeling worried. What should I do about this child? Should I kill it, let it
live, kill birth to it or…"

I didn't use Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint but the numerous scenarios
where Han Myungoh ran away passed through my head. Han Myungoh
spoke with an expression I had never seen before.

"Even so, do you know? Funnily, months passed as I thought about it. Then
while struggling, I survived."

Han Myungoh was able to survive the grandiose scenarios for one reason.

"I realized it at that time. Ah, perhaps this child saved me. Thus, I decided.
Whether I live or die, let's give birth to the child."

He suddenly threw the cigarette out the window. Han Myungoh pulled out a
new cigarette. In that short time, Han Myungoh looked distant before
coming back.
I knew Han Myungoh well. He was one of the people who would surely
enter the list of 10 worst people I knew. Nevertheless, at this moment, Han
Myungoh felt like a decent person.

"She was an infinitely beautiful baby. She wasn't human but she was
incredibly pretty."

"…I've seen her."

She was pretty, which was why Asmodeus used her as his incarnation body.
I was just thinking this when the smile on Han Myungoh's face disappeared.
The story didn't end well but I could see what Han Myungoh wanted to say.

After a while, Han Myungoh kept speaking. "Thus, Dokja-ssi should try it."

"…I should try giving birth?"

"No, I'm worried about Dokja-ssi."

I felt a momentary prick. My confused face reflected on the smartphone
screen.

"I don't know what Dokja-ssi is thinking. To be honest, I didn't like the
original Dokja-ssi."

"That's good to know."

"Yet I can feel that Dokja-ssi is strange

recently." I closed my mouth.

"I know that things don't work out well. Not everything will flow as you
wish. Even so, don't dwell on it too much and let your heart lead you."

"…"
"It is Dokja-ssi who survived whatever happened. If you don't do it right,
you'll regret it later."

Really, I had lived for a long time and see the world. I never expected there
would come a day when I empathized with this guy.

The LCD screen of the smartphone turned on and the file of Ways of
Survival was shown.

–Three Ways to Survive in a Ruined World (2nd Revision).txt

I didn't have Han Myungoh's experiences. I never had a child, nor did I plan
to have one. Nevertheless, I strangely knew a bit of Han Myungoh's
feelings.

To read or not read the second revision. This was the only thing occupying
my thoughts for the last few hours.

I was scared that I would be affected by reading the novel. It was painful to
confirm the results of my work. I was afraid that my 'future' might be fixed.
However, it was laughable from the beginning. Han Myungoh's words…

Yes, this story wasn't properly born yet. I opened the file of Ways of
Survival without hesitation. Then I started reading as I always did.

The second revision of Ways of Survival started from the fourth round.

「 It was just like what happened at that time. In the third round, Teacher
would've died there if it wasn't for him. 」

Some statements relieved me.

「 Nevertheless, I couldn't change it. 」

Some of the descriptions still hadn't changed.
「 That guy isn't in this round. 」

I still wasn't present in Yoo Joonghyuk's fourth regression.

「 I failed the third round. 」

I didn't panic because I had already expected it. I didn't know why the
author sent me something like this. It might be to frighten me or to use me
for the ending that he wanted. I didn't even know if it was the writer who
originally sent this.

I slowly closed my eyes, took a deep breath and opened it. Then I thought
at the Fourth Wall.

「 Kim Dokja thought. 」

It was as if I was writing a sentence in a novel.

「 I don't know what he wants in the end. However, no matter the result, I
will only make the ending that I want. 」

I wrote the sentence and stared at the air for a while. Understandably, there
was no return answer. Instead, it was the Fourth Wall that reacted.

[The Fourth Wall is wriggling happily.]

I suddenly looked out and saw the industrial complex in the distance. It was
the first time I was visiting the Kim Dokja Industrial Complex. By the way,
Han Myungoh suddenly reduced the speed.

"What happened?"

"…The scenario is progressing."

Scenario? No way… The Demon King Selection hadn't started yet?

[Do you want to enter the hidden scenario area?]
Han Myungoh cautiously approached the industrial complex. The entrance
of the industrial complex was bare without a single guard.

I opened the window and could hear words being shouted from inside the
industrial complex.

"I'm Kim Dokja!"

"No, I am!"

"I'm Kim Dokja! Me!"

Han Myungoh and I glanced at each other at the same time.

"What is this…?"

A system message followed.

[Hidden scenario ― the Kim Dokja Game is in progress.]

Something strange had happened in my industrial complex while I was
away.
         Chapter 252: Ep. 47 - Demon King Selection, VI


[You have entered the hidden scenario area.]

[Would you like to participate in the hidden scenario ― the Kim Dokja
Game?]

Han Myungoh stared at me and muttered in a dumbfounded manner.
"… What is going on?" I stared at Biyoo.

[Baat, baaat…]

Biyoo repeatedly shook her head. It wasn't Biyoo who did this.

Most hidden scenarios were activated according to the will of the Star
Stream, just like the main scenario. Then why at this time? A subsequent
system message gave a hint.

[The owner of the industrial complex is currently absent.]
[An emergency promotion scenario is activated.]

It seemed that I had been away for too long. "I think the Star Stream has
determined that I have no intending of inheriting the duke's position."

"Isn't it okay now that you're here?"

"That would be good."

The scenario remained unchanged after I entered the industrial complex.
Maybe the Star Stream scenario was twisted by the impersonation act that
Yoo Joonghyuk and I committed. At the time, there was a message that an
error occurred.

"…What is the Kim Dokja Game? It is a free participation scenario?"

Jang Hayoung opened his eyes in the back seat and stretched.

[We are currently electing the 'real Kim Dokja' of the industrial complex.]

At this rate, my name was going to be stolen. I turned towards Han
Myungoh and asked, "Will you participate?"

"Why would I do that?"

"What about you, Jang Hayoung?"

"I don't want to be Kim Dokja." HIs expression quickly changed and he
seemed to be sulking. "…I don't know the Demon King of Salvation."

In order to avoid reality, he had decided to separate me from the Demon
King of Salvation. The last one I looked at was the Breaking the Sky
Master.

Woof woof!

I nodded. "Then only I will join."
"Is it okay? You don't know what is going on…"

"No matter what happens, I have to go. This is my industrial complex."
Immediately after joining the scenario, a message window emerged.


  [Hidden Scenario - Kim Dokja Proof of Identity]

  Category: Main

  Difficulty: ???

  Clear Conditions: Prove to the constellations of the 'Kim Dokja
  Industrial Complex' channel that you are Kim Dokja.

  Time Limit: 3 hours.

  Reward: Become the duke of the Kim Dokja Industrial Complex and
  200,000 coins.

  Failure: ???

  * All aspiring 'Kim Dokja' in the scenario will have the same
  appearance until the scenario ends.

  * During the time limit, the aspiring 'Kim Dokja' who receives the most
  points from the constellations will inherit the Kim Dokja Industrial
  Complex.


…It was the first time I had seen such a scenario. This scenario naturally
wasn't in the original.

[A new aspiring 'Kim Dokja' has entered.]

[There are three hours left in the scenario.]
[You must be acknowledged as 'Kim Dokja' by most of the constellations.]

[You are the 1131st aspiring Kim Dokja.]

The scenario started and I was summoned to the outskirts of the plaza in the
Kim Dokja Industrial Complex. There was already a struggle to prove they
were Kim Dokja.

[Haha, everyone! Do you want to be recognized by the constellations?
Show us that you are the real Kim Dokja!]

I heard the voice of a dokkaebi. While I was away, the bureau had
successfully advanced into the Demon Realm. It would be a hindrance to
the wenny people… in any case, they gathered like ghosts whenever there
was a story.

[Baaat!]

Biyoo became determined and started to expand the channel.

[Multiple constellations have entered the channel.]

I looked around slowly at the other aspiring 'Kim Dokja'.

"I am Kim Dokja! Look!"

"I'm Kim Dokja!"

The aspiring Kim Dokjas had mosaics on their faces as they shouted.
Perhaps I looked like this to the other constellations.

…Damn, something felt strange. Most of the aspiring Kim Dokjas were just
repeating my name and not showing any unusual gestures. They were those
who were blinded by the duke's position and participated.

However, not all of them were the same.
"I am the prophet Kim Dokja!"

"I am the Demon King of Salvation!"

[Some constellations are interested.]

[Candidate 986 has gained 10 points.]

I stopped for a moment as I saw some candidates screaming 'Kim Dokja' in
a plausible costume.

"I am the King of a Kingless World!"

[A few constellations are interested in this candidate.]

[Candidate 986 has gained 20 points.]

…Wasn't he quite good? I entered the center of the industrial complex and
more and more people started saying plausible things. Some Kim Dokjas
could be seen duelling. I wanted to know why this area was so bloody when
I heard a message from a familiar constellation.

[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' is arguing that Kim
Dokja is a brave person.]

…I was wondering why the Great Sage, Heaven's Equal was so quiet. He
was already in the middle of this situation. There was the sound of a blade
cutting through the air and the aspiring Kim Dokja collapsed.

"Kuaaack!"

A sharp magic power cut at the waist of another aspiring Kim Dokja. Some
candidates fled and the winning Kim Dokja shouted,

"This is proof that I am Kim Dokja."
A blade made of blue magic power was in his hand. I was honestly a bit
surprised.

[A great number of constellations are interested in this candidate!]

[Candidate 312 has gained 100 points.]

Candidate 312 wasn't using the Purest Sword Force but it was similar in
appearance. Candidate 312 glanced at me before starting to wipe out other
candidates again. It was only a fleeting moment but the moment I met his
eyes, Aileen's words went through my head.

–Since the duke left, I have been struggling with the other industrial
complexes… the party members handle it well.

I had a rough idea of how things turned out like this. Some of the aspiring
Kim Dokjas here were from other industrial complexes. In other words,
there were those who received sponsored information about me and posed
as Kim Dokja.

My mind was a bit complicated. If I was defeated in this game, the wrong
Kim Dokja would enter the Demon King Selection.

[A few constellations are interested in you.]

[A few constellations are demanding that you prove you are Kim Dokja.]

How could I prove my identity? I had no resident registration or
identification card to prove myself.

[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' says the true Kim Dokja
loves companionship.]

…Uriel? I was about to shout at her when a candidate in the center of the
square knelt down and started crying. "Yoo Joonghyuk! Yoo
Joonghyuuuuk! Wake up! Please wake up!"
Kim Dokja screamed as he held the imaginary Yoo Joonghyuk in his arms.
I couldn't help laughing. I didn't do such a thing. Uriel couldn't be fooled by
such acting…

[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' is shedding tears.]

[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' is begging you to show her
again next time.]

[Candidate 32 has gained 300 points.]

…I couldn't believe it. I shook my head and passed Candidate 32, only to
hear an unexpected statement.

[The constellation 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' claims that the real Kim
Dokja is a chuuni.]

Abyssal Black Flame Dragon? When did he come…

[The constellation 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' claims that the real Kim
Dokja surely knows the true middle-school second-year syndrome.]

A true chuuni? I think I knew what happened… surprisingly, at the same
time, there was a candidate who started shouting,

"Uhhhh, Yoo Sangah-ssi. Do you know? Kukuk. I am a reader. I have the
life of a reader."

My thoughts became incredibly complicated. It was a story before the
scenario appeared. How did he know… no, wait, I never said it that way.
[The constellation 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' is satisfied.]

[The constellation 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' has given Candidate 97
300 points.]
I felt desolated and my lips were trembling. At this rate, I would lose my
name to these ridiculous people.

I should think calmly. In order to show that I was Kim Dokja, I needed to
remind them of the events shared by only me and the constellations.

"Get your hand off me and get lost, you damn jerk!"

[Candidate 32 has gained 200 points!]

Something only the constellations and I knew…

"I like to smile like this!"

[Candidate 97 has gained 250 points!]

The constellations and I…

"My favourite thing is a Chinese dress and garter belt!"

[Candidate 312 has gained 400 points!]

Damn, what the hell was happening? I organized my complicated thoughts
and decided to use an easy method. I would directly inform them that I was
Kim Dokja thought the Demon King of Salvation's indirect message.

[During the course of the scenario, the constellation 'Demon King
of Salvation' can't speak.] …Son of a bitch.

[There is one hour left in the scenario.]

There wasn't much time left now. I quietly held Unbroken Faith in my
hand. There was a limit to the number of aspiring Kim Dokjas. If I killed all
the aspiring Kim Dokjas, the last candidate would become the true Kim
Dokja.
However, I didn't want to use this method. They were currently blinded by
power but most of them were citizens of my industrial complex…

I sighed and shook my head as I gripped and released the hilt of my weapon
repeatedly.

「 These actions aren't like you. 」

To my chagrin, Yoo Joonghyuk was right. Kim Dokja would never solve
things this way. I thought about it. How do I prove my identity? No, what
did it mean to prove I was 'me' in the first place?

At this time, there was a sudden change.

"This is Electrification, the ultimate technique taught by the Paradox
Baekchong…!"

Candidate 312 was shouted while holding a lightning sword. I was about to
point out it was Paradox Baekchung, not Baekchong when lightning struck
from the sky.

"Uwaaaack!"

The blue-white lightning hit the candidate's blade and tore his body apart.
Some candidates screamed and retreated while some constellations liked it
and randomly gave points. At the crucible of the confusion, I looked up at
the sky. Something small was falling from the sky.

…I thought it was time for him to come but I didn't expect it to be this fast.
The small dot that gave off huge pressure landed in the square of the
industrial complex with a deafening roar.

A blue-white light flooded the square. A small man stood in the center of
the lightning and emitted a huge presence. Sparks flew as a voice was heard
from the dust.
[Where is my disciple?]

After a while, the appearance of the voice's owner was revealed.

[Many constellations are astonished.]

The small man didn't care if the constellations were astonished or not.
There were some constellations who realized the identity of the man.

"This small body…"

"Wait, don't tell me?"

They glanced at each other and then fell down in front of the man.

"M-Me!"

"I am Kim Dokja! Teacher…!"

Numerous Kim Dokjas fell down in front of the small man. I looked at
them and clicked my tongue. It was good that they were quick-witted.
However, it would be better if their bodies could move faster.

"Aaaack!"

"Kuaaaack!"

The Kim Dokjas were attacked by the blue-white lightning and turned to
ashes. I looked at the teacher kind enough to personally come to pick up his
disciple and realized something.

…I see. In the first place, 'I' wasn't something that could be proven.

[Your unique story will be played.]

[The story 'Returnee's Disciple' has begun.]
It was because 'I' was made up of things that didn't only belong to me.
Amidst the fleeing Kim Dokja, there was one person who knew the real
Kim Dokja.

[Where is my real disciple?]

If I came forward, I would be ripped apart like the other fakes. Then I heard
a familiar voice.

"Damn, what is this? Are they all Kim Dokjas?" I looked back and saw
Jang Hayoung grumbling.

I spoke to Jang Hayoung. "Jang Hayoung."

He looked over with surprise after hearing his name and flinched back with
surprise. "…Kim Dokja?"

I nodded and asked, "Did you learn the Breaking the Sky Swordsmanship?"

"…Of course I learnt it. Why?"

I smiled and spread open my arms. "Use it on me now."
         Chapter 253: Ep. 47 - Demon King Selection, VII


Kyrgios had accepted three disciples so far. One was after his first
transcendence and another was 50 years later. Then he didn't accept any
disciples for a while.

It was because all his previous disciples had died. One was to the successor
of the Heavenly Demon School. The other was to the Blood Demon School.

It was the events triggered by these two deaths that made the 'Paradox
Baekchung' Kyrgios Rodgraim become famous. Enraged by his disciples'
deaths, Kyrgios struck the homes of the Heavenly Demon School and the
Blood Demon School. It wasn't known exactly what happened in Murim at
that time. One thing was for certain…

Half of the 100,000 Great Mountain Ranges became a bare mountain. The
Blood Demon School withdrew its forces from the First Murim.

100 years later, Kyrgios once again accepted a disciple. Kyrgios asked the
disciple whom he met after much trouble.
[…What is this about?]

"This poor disciple is greeting you."

Kyrgios looked at his disciple with a bitter expression. This was the last
disciple he received with his heart.

[I asked you. Why is it like this?]

This disciple wasn't talented and didn't have any spots to like. The moment
they met, he acted familiar and like they knew each other for a long time.
He was 'friendly' to the Paradox Baekchung. The paradox was so bizarre
that Kyrgios wanted to learn a bit about him.

"I've been to the First Murim."

Kyrgios glared at his disciple who was covered in blood. He was a person
full of mischief on Peace Land. The reason Kyrgios didn't punish him for
the sin of stealing the technique and fleeing was because he saved Kyrgio's
planet.

Thus, Kyrgios waited. Someday, his disciple would reflect on himself and
show up again. Yet his disciple appeared like this…

Kyrgios' eyes narrowed as he spoke. [There are traces of the Breaking the
Sky Swordsmanship from your wounds.]

"…"

[Did you encounter the disciple of the Breaking the Sky Sword Saint? Or
was it the Breaking the Sky Sword Saint?]

The disciple didn't answer. Kyrgios' force became stronger.

[Answer me.]
The entire industrial complex wriggled like a trampled bug. The presence
spread and all the Kim Dokjas in the industrial complex kneeled from the
pain. It was just a wave of magic power but it was like he showed off his
'status. This was the presence of the Paradox Baekchung. The only one who
didn't kneel was his disciple.

"I didn't want you to see me like this."

[What does that mean?]

"I have defiled the name of Baekchung."

[…]

"Please kill me."

Kyrgios' eyebrows wriggled at the words. It was because he remembered
the message he received before coming here.

–Please kill me.

Kyrgios small teeth made a sound as they grinded together.

[It is true that I came to punish you. But…]

His disciple was beaten up in a distant place. Moreover, it was a situation
where his disciple told him to kill him because his disciple couldn't
overcome the disgrace.

In such a situation, what type of teacher could punish his student? There
would certainly be such a teacher but at the very least, Kyrgios wasn't like
that.

[…Why are you so keen to be killed?]

"…"
[Foolish guy.]

Kyrgios turned his back to his disciple. He didn't know what happened to
his prideful disciple but he would find out if he went to Murim.

[Did you say it was the First Murim?]

His disciple didn't answer but Kyrgios was already moving.

[That world will know that there is a 'paradox' above the 'breaking the sky'.]




Kyrgios left and the war clouds over the industrial complex disappeared
like they had been washed away. In the places where Kyrgios passed, the
aspiring Kim Dokjas were lying down.

"U-Uhh… uwaaah!"

I saw those who wanted to be me and felt very complicated. Jang Hayoung
asked, "…Was it too much?"

It wasn't a question for the aspiring Kim Dokjas. I stared at the portal that
Kyrgios disappeared through and said, "That's the only way to move him."

Kyrgios had already lost two disciples to Murim. In order to send him to the
First Murim, I was forced to make a cowardly excuse.

"What if he kills the Breaking the Sky Sword Saint?"

"Don't worry about it." I responded while placing a story fragment on the
wounds caused by Jang Hayoung.
It seemed that Kyrgios was going to get revenge for me but it remained to
be seen how things would turn out. A transcendent of Kyrgios' level would
notice the trouble occurring in the First Murim.

[You have triggered a new sub scenario.]

Perhaps by now, Kyrgios would've gained a sub scenario to intervene in the
First Murim. Kyrgios was also unhappy with the outer gods. Once he found
out the situation, he would be forced to help the Breaking the Sky Sword
Saint.

"You should be more worried about us."

"What? Why?"

"Originally, Kyrgios shouldn't appear here."

Despite the countless crises I had experienced, I didn't call Kyrgios thought
Jang Hayoung. I originally intended to call him during the Demon King
Selection.

However, I used that card to save the Breaking the Sky Sword Saint. I
didn't know if it was the wrong choice but at least it was an honourable
choice.

I looked up at the night sky.

[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' is watching you with anxious
eyes.]

Some stars were worried about me.

[Some constellations are smiling at you.]

Some stars were taking my crisis as an opportunity. I smiled bitterly
towards those stars. "If you've seen enough, can you make a decision now?"
I took a deep breath and declared towards the sky. "I'm the real Kim
Dokja."

The conversation with Kyrgios was open to the public and no further proof
was needed. The stars in the night sky shone at the same time.

[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' admits that you are the real
Kim Dokja.]

[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' admits that you are
the real Kim Dokja.]

[The constellation Queen of the Darkest Spring admits that you are the real
Kim Dokja.]

.

.

[A very small number of constellations disagree with the results.]

Those who wanted something else disagreed but this was a majority vote.

[Many constellations recognize you as the real Kim Dokja.]

[You have been recognized as the real Kim Dokja.]

[The hidden scenario has been completed!]

[200,000 coins have been acquired as a scenario reward.]

The faces of the aspiring Kim Dokjas started to change one by one. The
mosaic scattered and their real faces were exposed to the sky. For the first
time, the citizens confirmed the true owner of the industrial complex and
cried out with amazement. "Kim Dokja! The real Kim Dokja!"
"T-The master of this industrial complex is back…!"

More messages popped up.

[You have formally inherited the former Gilobat Industrial Complex.]

[The former Gilobat Industrial Complex has been officially declared as the
Kim Dokja Industrial Complex.]

[Your notoriety is spreading in the Demon Realm!]

[Your fame is strengthening your current stories.]

A bright light surrounded my body and my stories were further
strengthened.

[You are the 'duke' of the industrial complex.]

Soon, a lonely fight would begin.




After the situation settled down, the first place I headed to was Mark's
office in the heart of the industrial complex.

"…I'm ashamed."

"No, you did well."

Riots occurred due to the Kim Dokja Game and Mark and other officials
were detained. I patted Mark on the shoulder and comforted him. "You did
your best."

No one, including Mark, would've been able to stop the Kim Dokja Game.
In the first place, it was an event that occurred because I went away. It was
thanks to Mark that the industrial complex was maintained to this extent. In
fact, Mark was a mercenary leader on his home planet and possessed a very
high level Crowd Control skill.

I listened to Mark's report on the surrounding trends.

"There is news of war coming from everywhere."

A group of people exiting the industrial complex could be seen from the
office window. Some of them were people who just participated in the
scenario and others weren't.

"A war can't be done alone. Don't you know?"

"It is foolish to hold onto those who have no will to fight."

Most of them would die from the penalty of 'leaving the scenario area'.
Even so, they decided to move. It meant the situation was desperate.

[The population of the industrial complex is decreasing and the power of
the Factory is reduced.]

The story weapon, the Factory was maintained through the work of the
citizens. It was natural for the power to go down once the labour force
shrank. However, I spoke like it wasn't a big deal. "We can't see the
outcome with just the power of the industrial complex. The main focus of
the enemy isn't the industrial complex anyway."

I had to deal with Melledon and Bercan. Melledon had joined hands with
Vedas while Bercan was working with Papyrus.

It shouldn't be a direct alliance with the nebulae based on the scale of the
alliance. They had probably just contracted with some constellations of the
nebulae.
Nevertheless, it was a power that couldn't be ignored. It was still unknown
but in the Demon King Selection, perhaps I would have to fight at least 10
constellations.

"Is there a plan?"

To be honest, the odds weren't very high. I had just become a constellation
and it would be suicidal to fight them, even with Yoo Joonghyuk's help.

"I have a way."

I couldn't say it now. There were too many eyes watching.

[Many constellations are admiring your ambition!]

[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' is wondering what
that means.]

[2,000 coins have been sponsored.]

In fact, there were a few things that I had thought about. It would've been
impossible before but now it was possible. Before I could use these
methods, there was something I had to check first.

[The Fourth Wall is wriggling.]

It read my mind and responded. I slowly blinked as I thought, 'I need your
help'.

It would know what I wanted to say without me needing to open my mouth.

'Let me see my Attributes Window'.

Until now, I have somehow fought without properly knowing my
information.

Until now.
[The Fourth Wall is shaking nervously.]

It would be difficult to do so from now on. It would be hard to know the
enemy without knowing myself. I already knew a bit about the enemy so I
had to know about 'myself'.
         Chapter 254: Ep. 47 - Demon King Selection, VIII


[The Fourth Wall is showing its teeth in a threatening manner.]

Fierce sparks filled the air. I quickly ordered Mark to leave the office. I
wouldn't be able to figure out what was happening if he was present.

'Wait a minute, listen to me'.

I thought about what I could do to appease this damn wall. 'You love
stories. Once this is over, I'll feed you many things that you want to eat.

[The Fourth Wall is looking at you with a frown.]

The growling pressured seemed to calm down a bit. It didn't seem to have
any effect.

'I have something I need to check. I could die if I don't know it. Is that what
you want?'
The Fourth Wall was silent. Fortunately, this guy didn't want me to die at
the moment. The Fourth Wall was silent for a long time before speaking.

「 The Fourth Wall says, Kim Dok ja. 」

"Yes."

「 It wi ll be dan ge rous with out me. 」

I thought I knew what it was talking about. One of the Fourth Wall's
functions included protecting me from the eyes of the constellations. Thus,
it was worried about the constellations harming me once it was turned off. 'I
know. However, this time I have to look'.

In front of my firm will, the Fourth Wall was silent for a moment before
opening its mouth.

「10 se conds on ly. 」

10 seconds. Yes, it was a bit tight but it was fine.

「 All chan nels must be block ed. 」

I nodded.

–Biyoo. Play an ad on the channel.

The moment the order was sent via the dokkaebi communication, the screen
turned off.

[Many constellations are confused by the sudden advertisement.]

Okay, this was enough. However, the Fourth Wall wasn't satisfied.

「 The Fourth Wall says, Not e nough yet. 」
'Not enough? What?'

The Fourth Wall didn't answer. I looked up and Biyoo was blinking
innocently.

[…Baat?]

Biyoo was clearly blocking the channel properly. It wasn't enough yet…

At this moment, the previous scenario came to mind.

Hidden Scenario - Kim Dokja Proof of Identity. In this industrial complex,
there was a dokkaebi carrying out the scenario. I stared out the window at
the ruins of the scenario.

The Star Stream created the hidden scenarios but it was the dokkaebis that
guided the direction of the scenario.

[Many constellations are protesting the unstable channel conditions.]

In retrospect, 'Kim Dokja Proof of Identity' was a rather unusual scenario. It
was a scenario that precisely knew the demands of the constellations and
even contained information about 'me' before the first scenario…

No matter how I thought about it, there was only one person who would do
this. I sighed and slowly opened my mouth. "Bihyung, won't you come
out?"




"Ahjumma! Where are you? I came!"

A charitable medical relief station in Seongnam. This shelter, established
with the government's help, was one of the civilian relief organizations that
cared for the casualties of the scenario invasions.
Han Sooyoung shouted while kicking a fallen patient in her way. "Kim
Dokja's mother! Kim Dokja's mother, raise your hand!"

The patient who had been lying down quickly moved away due to the kick.
Yoo Sangah hurriedly approached and took care of the patient.

"I'm sorry. Are you okay? …Hey, Han Sooyoung-ssi!"

Han Sooyoung was disgusted by Yoo Sangah's sharp voice. "Ahhh, go
away if you're going to nag me."

"You are too much. These people are patients!"

"I'm a patient too."

As the frowning Yoo Sangah finally became angry, the door of the relief
center opened and new patients appeared. They were incarnations wounded
by the monsters present in this world. They were people the large wards
couldn't handle and were forced to come to this relief station. Han
Sooyoung saw a familiar woman as she looked around.

"Lee Seolhwa is also here."

Doctor Lee Seolhwa. She was a colleague of Yoo Joonghyuk who was
taking care of the patients here.

Han Sooyoung sighed deeply. "It is a real mess… Do you know? She was
originally destined to be a very bad woman."

"How do you know that?"

"I just know. Why can't I know what Kim Dokja also knows?"

Yoo Sangah's eyes narrowed when Han Sooyoung mentioned Kim Dokja.
Han Sooyoung glanced at Yoo Sangah and said, "Kim Dokja has changed
too many things. He saved those who were meant to die and killed those
who were meant to live…"
"…Is this about the prophecy?"

"You don't know it anyway. I just want to say that I would've never done
what Kim Dokja did."

Han Sooyoung pulled out a piece of dark chocolate and ate it. The bitter
taste of the chocolate spread in her mouth and the bitterness seemed to
affect Han Sooyoung.

"The future was ruined by him. The story should flow the way it was meant
to. If it was me…"

"If it was you, Kim Dokja and you would be no different from a
'character'."

It wasn't Yoo Sangah's voice. Han Sooyoung smiled and turned towards the
person.

"You look healthy, Sooyoung."

Kim Dokja's mother, Lee Sookyung was behind them.

"It doesn't matter if I'm healthy or not."

"My Dokja seems to like unhealthy children."

"I don't care what Kim Dokja likes!"

Lee Sookyung laughed at Han Sooyoung's reaction before turning her head.
"It has been a while, Yoo Sangah-ssi. What's going on here?"

Before Yoo Sangah could reply, Han Sooyoung interrupted again. "Use
Good or Bad Luck, Disaster or Happiness Fortune."

Good or Bad Luck, Disaster or Happiness Fortune. It was one of the
stigmas Lee Sookyung received from her sponsor, Founder's Mother.
"Good or Bad Luck, Disaster or Happiness Fortune… you always seem
confident. Why are you suddenly trying to lean on something like this?"

"I wish I could solve everything with confidence."

"You have lost your information. Is that right?"

Han Sooyoung and Lee Sookyung were different from Kim Dokja. Han
Sooyoung only read the 'early' parts of the original novel while Lee
Sookyung only knew the information she had heard from Kim Dokja. In the
end, both of them had uncertain future information.

Lee Sookyung smiled lightly and asked, "Why did you come to me? Sangah
can do something similar with Olympus' power."

"Are you joking? Did you forget what Olympus did to Kim Dokja?"

The two of them bickered while Yoo Sangah muttered with an embarrassed
expression.

"I'm sorry, I can't help you right now…"

"Don't worry about it. I know the situation with Olympus is complicated.
Isn't it in the midst of an internal feud right now?"

"…Yes."

Yoo Sangah bowed her head with an unconvinced expression while Han
Sooyoung said, "Just leave it alone. They've had so much sex that their
lifespan is being cut. Faster than―"

Yoo Sangah's eyes widened at the unexpected words. Lee Sookyung looked
at them and laughed.
"Okay, young ladies. What information do you want to know? For
reference, I can't see the concrete future with Good or Bad Luck, Disaster
or Happiness Fortune. I can only point the way."

Han Sooyoung nodded as if she already knew. "I want to know about Kim
Dokja's current situation."

"Hrmm…"

Lee Sookyung looked at Han Sooyoung with a subtle gaze and Han
Sooyoung quickly added. "It is because the Korean Peninsula could be
destroyed depending on how things are going over there. I am hearing
strange stories from the constellations these days… why are you laughing?"

"You're just cute."

Han Sooyoung complained. "Quickly do it."

"I've been looking at it for a long time."

"Yes? …Then what is it?"

Lee Sookyung smiled. "Well, it can be either. A week ago, it was in the
middle and three days ago it was inauspicious…"

"What? Inauspicious?"

"Yesterday it was lucky…"

"Then what is it now?"

Lee Sookyung pulled out a bronze mirror without speaking. It was a
fragment of the Heavenly Mirror, one of the three divine treasures. "See for
yourself."
There was an unusual nuance in her voice that caused Han Sooyoung and
Yoo Sangah to simultaneously put their heads together. Then faint letters
appeared on the bronze mirror.

―Great Misfortune.

For a moment, Han Sooyoung doubted if she read the hanja¹ properly.

"Is this real?"

"I don't know. If you're curious, you can ask the Hongik nebula." She said
this but Lee Sookyung didn't look very comfortable either. Then the surface
of the mirror shook and the writing changed.

"Ah…? The word 'help' appeared?" Yoo Sangah exclaimed and the other
two glanced at the mirror.

Help. It was an obvious meaning and there was no need to interpret it. Han
Sooyoung and Yoo Sangah faced each other at the same time.

Lee Sookyung sighed lightly and asked them, "Then who will go?"




[ …Kim Dokja is truly Kim Dokja. How did you know?]

Bihyung appeared out of thin air. His fur was shiny and he was now
wearing good quality cloth materials. The dokkaebi used to only wear tiger
underwear but that was an old story now.

"What about the Korean Peninsula channel?"

[I was demoted. Can't you tell?]

"It looks like you're not doing well without me?"
[You'll know if you come back.]

Bihyung didn't use honorifics as before. Perhaps it was proof that the
relationship between us had changed. In fact, my contract with him had
ended with my death.

Bihyung stared at me for a while and I gazed back.

[Have you been well?]

"It is as you can see."

[Yes, I've heard many stories about you.]

I lightly nodded.

[Do you want to come back to my channel again? I will treat you well.]

Perhaps Bihyung's words were sincere. It was a more dangerous proposal
because it was genuine.

"Well…"

I didn't hate Bihyung now. However, I wasn't naive enough to join hands
with Bihyung. Bihyung was a dokkaebi with strings to the bureau and the
bureau was one of the most dangerous groups in the world.

[Indeed, you were originally such a person.]

Bihyung's expression was changing. It was natural for the dokkaebis to be
aloof to those who left their channels. The idea that Bihyung could become
an enemy wasn't impossible. Even so, the time had come sooner than I
thought.

[Then what about this? Build a joint channel with me. It is fine since this is
the Demon Realm.]
For a moment, I thought I heard wrong. "…Are you serious?"

[Think about it once.]

In fact, it wasn't a bad suggestion. If I built a joint channel with Biyoo, it
would allow Biyoo to learn and grow quickly. "I understand. More than
that,
now…"

At this moment, I heard Bihyung through the dokkaebi communication.

–Do you want me to turn the channel off?

I nodded. As expected, Bihyung only pretended to be stupid.

–I don't know what you're trying to do but I wish you well. I have a few
things to do so… let's resolve the rest at a later time.

I didn't understand why Bihyung was so favourable towards me. In any
case, I was fortunate. Bihyung changed the settings and then a message
from the constellations was heard.

[All constellations in the channel are dissatisfied with the channel's
connection!]

I immediately looked at the Fourth Wall.

「 The Fourth Wall says, Do not look for too lo ng. 」

[The exclusive skill 'Fourth Wall' has been released.]

I felt the curtain surrounding my world disappearing. I didn't miss this time
and turned on the Attributes Window.

[Checking the Attributes Window.]

A vast amount of information entered my mind.
  [Character Summary]

  Name: Kim Dokja

  Age: 28 years old

  Sponsor: None

  Modifier: Demon King of Salvation (Narrative)

  Exclusive Attributes: Lamarck's Giraffe (Legend), Demon Realm Duke
  (Legend), Scenario Interpreter (???), ■■ Apostle (???)…
  …
  …




I could now see my attributes that I couldn't confirm properly last time. To
be honest, it was surprising. I thought my attribute would be 'reader'…

Scenario Interpreter? Besides, what was ■■ Apostle? Why wasn't the
attribute rating shown?

[You have checked your Attributes Window for the first time.]

[The effect of the 'Scenario Interpreter' is activated!]

In any case, I kept checking the information. The part I watched most
carefully was the 'Exclusive Skills'.


  Exclusive Skills: Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint Lv. ?, Bookmark Lv.
  ?, Character List Lv. ?, Fourth Wall Lv. ?, Reading Comprehension Lv.
  ?, …
One of the skills originally hidden with a ■ could be seen.

Reading Comprehension. At first glance, it seemed like the ability to read
and understand something but I didn't think it was that simple. Most of the
skills I've acquired so far were like that.

I raised my hand to the Attributes Window without thinking. Then there
was the sound of sparks appearing and the Attributes Window started
breaking apart.

…Was it already 10 seconds? I thought so at first but the problem wasn't
that simple.

A faint ringing was heard in my ears and my head suddenly throbbed. The
finger touching the Attributes Window was numb and the world became
dizzy. I felt like vomiting. Beyond the insurmountable wall, something was
calling me.

[The exclusive skill 'Fourth Wall' is strongly activated!]

The situation wasn't improved despite the Fourth Wall activating. The
surrounding landscapes started to mix together. It was a scene where things
that shouldn't go together were merged. In the midst of this terrible mood, I
felt a strange sense of unity. It felt like something I had been wanting for a
long time.

Then I heard a strange message.

[Your understanding of the character 'Kim Dokja' has increased.]

What…? The moment my consciousness flickered, someone spoke to me.

「 (So, you were told not to look for too long). 」

         Chapter 255: Ep. 48 - Entrance as a Character, I


A burning pain was felt from my cheeks several times.

"Kim Dokja! Hey! What is this?"

My vision blinked and my consciousness slowly rose to the surface.

[The exclusive skill 'Fourth Wall' is strongly activated!]

"Uh…"

My voice didn't sound like me. It was only a moment but it felt like I had
become a different existence and came back. A terrible sensation remained
in my entire body. The shoulders being touched by Jang Hayoung's fingers
trembled.

"What's wrong with you?"
I couldn't clearly remember what had happened. I asked the Fourth Wall to
check the Attributes Window and then I heard a voice…

I rubbed my temples and asked, "…How did I faint?"

"I don't know! I came running because of a sudden lightning bolt!"

"Lightning?"

"Do you know the sparks that appear when you break the probability?
That…"

"Did it strike like lightning?"

Jang Hayoung nodded. "It was the first time I had seen something so big."

My coat and other clothing were charred black. I couldn't believe that the
coat with the automatic restoration function was damaged like this… The
ceiling of the office looked like it had been hit by a meteorite.

"Are you okay?"

"I'm fine. Of course, I'm fine…"

Rather, I felt lighter. It was impossible. My body was burnt like this but my
spirit was clear. The power of my stories felt fuller.

[The effect of the exclusive skill 'Reading Comprehension' has increased
understanding.]

I saw the message and a previous memory emerged. That's right. I had
obviously seen such a message.

[Your understanding of the character 'Kim Dokja' has increased.]

The message marked me as a character. It was something that never
happened before. Cool energy filled a corner of my chest.
I had seen the presence of 'characters' many times'. They were those who
came from outside the original novel but was eventually assimilated with
the original. They were mostly those who stopped reading the novel.

I urgently summoned the Attributes Window. 'Attributes Window'.

However, the Attributes Window didn't easily open. The reason was
obvious.

[The Fourth Wall is looking at you.]

I started sweating.

「 Kim Dok ja look ed for 15 se conds. 」

'I'm sorry, really'.

Who knew who much time had passed? In fact, 10 or 15 seconds to look at
the Attributes Window was a tight time frame.

「 I wi ll no t see you for the mo ment. 」

'Wait, let me ask you something'. I grabbed the Fourth Wall before it was
about to disappear. 'What the hell is behind that wall?'

It was a vague memory but I definitely saw something before I fainted. I
looked a bit closer and it seemed I had been talking to someone. There were
clearly a few shadows.

「 …Sleep y. 」

Then the Fourth Wall fell asleep. The function was still working but the
consciousness had turned off. Shit.

[You have acquired a new story!]

[The story 'Looked into the Abyss' has been acquired.]
[This story doesn't have a rating.]

I stared at the messages in the air with blank eyes.

Looked into the Abyss. I knew the existence of this story from the original
novel. I couldn't prevent the goosebumps.

Unrestrained questions flooded my head. Why did I get this story here?
What was the relationship between that story and being called a character?
Was I now a character or was I still a reader? I… Was I still able to change
the future?

"Kim Dokja?" Jang Hayoung was staring at me with emotional eyes.

How much better would it be if my situation was as clear as his eyes? If I
could read myself like I read these eyes…

At this moment, there was a flash in my head.

「 What if I use Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint on myself? 」

I never thought of it before. There was clearly something lurking inside me
that I didn't know. I didn't know if it was something the author left behind
or if it naturally permeated me during the process of the world changing.
The obvious thing was I needed to figure out what it was.

However, I hesitated to use Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint.

…Could I figure it out using this? In the first place, Omniscient Reader's
Viewpoint was a skill that read the thoughts and movements of the target…

[…Kim Dokja? Are you okay?]

I barely escaped from the mire of thoughts thanks to the dokkaebi floating
in front of me. "Bihyung?"
I stared at Bihyung with a stupid expression. Didn't he say he was leaving
earlier? Bihyung started stammering.

[Ah… after the sudden storm…]

He said he was busy but he must've been observing in the vicinity. In any
case, he was a sneaky fellow. I couldn't trust him.

[D-Don't get me wrong. I forgot to tell you that I came back.]

As I spoke to the dokkaebi with calm eyes, Jang Hayoung looked over here
with the frightened eyes of a rabbit. I patted his shoulder with a gentle
gesture and asked Bihyung. "What aren't you saying?"

[As you know, the Demon King Selection will be a very big event.]

It was already expected. The story of what happened at the Gourmet
Association must be spreading between the constellations. Some of those
present would certainly participate in the Demon King Selection.

[It isn't just getting bigger, there is also a fight over the broadcasting rights.
You might've expected it but I'm not the only one dispatched to the Demon
Realm.]

"Then?"

[You know the dokkaebi on the other side.]

I knew the dokkaebi?

[It is a guy with a huge grudge against you.]

There were two of them. However, one was in Murim so there was only
one more left. "…Is it Dokgak?"

[Yes.]
Dokgak. The dokkaebi, who was in charge of the Japanese channel, had
been humiliated by me and Bihyung.

I was lucky at the time but now it was different. Among the dokkaebis
mentioned in Ways of Survival, Dokgak was a person with outstanding
talent regarding channel management. If he was chosen as one of the
dokkaebis to lead this 'Demon King Selection', the future schedule would
never flow smoothly.

[In any case, be careful. The channel management is good so… wait a
minute. What about your dokkaebi?]

"Dokkaebi?"

Come to think of it, I felt very lonely. Through the cracked ceiling, the
constellations shining in the sky could be seen. It was strange. I might've
ordered the blocking of the channel but I should be hearing their
complaints. Yet I didn't hear any messages.

"Biyoo?" I called out a name with an uneasy heart.

Biyoo didn't appear. At first, I thought she was sleeping again. However,
minutes passed and there was no Biyoo. An ominous premonition struck
me.

…Don't tell me?

"Biyoo!"

Biyoo had disappeared.




[A new constellation has entered the #BI-90594 channel.]
.

.

[The constellation 'Bald General of Justice' is greatly moved by your
return.]

[The constellation 'Maritime War God' is welcoming you with a smile.]

[Many constellations are welcoming your return!]

I entered Bihyung's channel and familiar names greeted me. I couldn't
rejoice at all despite the baptism of cheers.

[The constellation 'Demon King of Salvation' is asking the whereabouts of
the dokkaebi 'Biyoo'.]

Some of the constellations answered immediately.

[The constellation 'Bald General of Justice' is wiping his head like it is
difficult.]

[The constellation 'King Heungmu the Great' is coughing and placing his
thumb and index finger together.]

[Some constellations say they are willing to answer if you give them coins.]

…It turned out that the constellations of the Korean Peninsula had little
money. I rummaged for coins in my pocket while Jang Hayoung opened his
mouth. "Perhaps she was caught in the storm?"

Biyoo wasn't from the bureau and didn't have a mighty story to protect
herself from a great storm. I couldn't rule out the possibility that she was
swept away by the storm. However—

"It can't be. There were no signs."
If that happened, terrible debris could be seen. However, there were no
traces of Biyoo. It felt as if someone had completely ripped away Biyoo's
existence. Who was it? Who took Biyoo…?

Bihyung looked up from where he was biting his nails. Our eyes met and
we realized that we had the same idea. Biyoo was the only dokkaebi with
an independent channel.

[Fuck, it's those guys.]

"The wenny people."

The sentences of the original novel flowed into my head.

「 The only scenario area that isn't under the jurisdiction of the dokkaebis.
It is the Demon Realm. 」

As written in Ways of Survival, the Demon Realm was essentially the area
of the wenny people. In such a zone, they confirmed there was a dokkaebi
who wasn't a member of the bureau.

–The soul is mine.

The first time we met, he had coveted the Dokkaebi Egg. The value of an
independent channel was so large that it couldn't be calculated at present.

A giant story event was currently taking place in the Demon Realm. There
was no way the wenny people would miss something happening in their
sphere of influence. They had definitely stolen the channel for the Demon
King Selection.

The wenny people were inherently resistant to probability. Thus, they
would've been able to take Biyoo when I was unconscious and there was a
storm around me. Dammit… why at this point?

[Leave it to me. I'll find them.]
I could see anger in Bihyung's eyes.

[The dokkaebis' honor is at stake. She might not be a member of the bureau
but I can't see this.]

"Let's go together."

Bihyung shook his head.

[It isn't long until the Demon King Selection. In the meantime, aren't there
certain things you should be doing?]

That's right. The remaining time was really short. If I misused this time to
find Biyoo, I might be defeated at the start of the competition.

"…Why are you doing this?"

[You belong to my channel now.]

Bihyung avoided my gaze while replying.

[I'm just moving for my channel. You have to win. That way, the
constellations will like you and my channel will become bigger.]
Then Bihyung disappeared into thin air.

Jang Hayoung asked, "…Is it okay to believe in him?"

There was nothing as stupid as a question about believing a dokkaebi.
Putting aside my belief in Bihyung, there was no race as mysterious as the
dokkaebis in all of the Star Stream.

I sighed briefly. Yoo Joonghyuk's situation wasn't good right now and Jang
Hayoung wasn't strong enough to pursue Bihyung.
A presence that could help me was in the night sky but the problem was
that I was now in Bihyung's channel. In other words, all messages I sent
through the channel would be inevitably read by Bihyung.

If so… there was only one way. "Jang Hayoung, call the wall."




There were quick footsteps in the darkness.

[Baat, baaaat!]

Biyoo burst out crying as she was trapped in a cage.

[Baaat! Baat…!]

An elderly man with a small lump on his left cheek was running along a
dark road. There was an excitement in his urgent steps. The old man was in
a very good mood.

[The age of the dokkaebis will now end.]

The old man was excited at the thought of showing off his achievement to
the other wenny people. He couldn't describe how envious he was when a
fellow colleague recently came up to him bragging about gaining the 'story
of beating up a dokkaebi'. Now he brought not a story about beating a
dokkaebi but a dokkaebi itself. The old man patted Biyoo's cage like it was
adorable.

[My child, you will be the first 'wenny person' with a channel.]

This was the long wish of the wenny people. It was to take back the
dominance of the story from the dokkaebis.
[■■'s streamer. From the hell of this terrible scenario, I will free the
slaves…]

The lump on the old man's left cheek swelled greatly. The lump wriggled
excitedly as it touched the cage containing Biyoo. Biyoo stared at the lump
with terrified eyes and urgently looked around. She searched for help but
unfortunately, there was no person to rescue Biyoo present.

[Hey.]

To be precise, it wasn't a 'person'.

[Won't you put that lump away?]
         Chapter 256: Ep. 48 - Entrance as a Character, II


The moment the wenny man turned around, three spears made of yellow
sparks struck in front of him. The wenny man frowned and stepped back. It
was an attack containing the power of a great story.

[A senior dokkaebi.]

A silhouette floated beyond the yellow trajectory that filled the air. It was a
baby-sized dokkaebi in neat clothing. It was Bihyung.

[Leave that baby behind and get lost if you know what's good for you.]

Red fangs flashed from the mouth of the growling Bihyung. The dokkaebis
of the Star Stream didn't easily become angry. The constellations in the
channels didn't like the dokkaebis to express their emotions. However, there
were times when a dokkaebi became truly angry. It was during those times
that the canines would be shone.
[Why are you coming out for a dokkaebi who isn't a member of the
bureau?]

[A dokkaebi is a dokkaebi.]

[How funny.]

[…I gave birth to this child. I might not want to raise her but shouldn't I act
as a parent?]

The wenny man laughed at the words.

[Parent? A parent!]

It was a great laugh and the lump on his cheek shook.

[Since when did a dokkaebi have such human aspects? If there was such
a thing, you should've given it to my ancestors.] [Sorry, I wasn't even
born at the time.]

[Then who will compensate for our suffering?]

One of the wenny man's eyes concealed by the fog was revealed. It was a
Great Demon's Eye. The yellow iris started spinning and emitting a fierce
pressure.

[Who will compensate us for the pain of having our 'Story Bag' taken
away?]

[What is this bullshit? I know that story but we gave back the Story Bag. It
was even double―]

The situation got worse and Bihyung's expression started stiffening. He
didn't expect for the wenny man to try to fight against him. Bihyung
might've made a big appearance but this was the first time he was fighting a
wenny person.
—No matter what happens, avoid fighting a wenny person as much as
possible.

It was advice left behind by the previous generation dokkaebis. Bihyung
was a fairly old dokkaebi of the Seoul branch but he knew little about the
relationship between a dokkaebi and wenny person.

The only thing certain was that the two races had been antagonistic since
the days before the concept of the 'channel' was established.

The wenny man said, [It looks like you don't know anything. You didn't
return the wenny people's possessions.]

Bihyung was annoyed. [I don't know about that. Just give me that child
quickly! If not―]

[There are many types of evils in the world.]

There was an eerie chill in the wenny man's voice. Before Bihyung could
even scream, the wenny person continued. It was like the sentence of an old
song.

[The 'first evil' is an evil that makes someone unhappy.]

The wenny man's lump was gradually getting bigger. A warning was
ringing in Bihyung's head.

[The 'second evil' is evil that enjoys misery.]

Along with the lyrics, something was released from the wenny man's lump.
It was something that absolutely shouldn't be released.

[The most 'repugnant evil' is the evil that reveals its misery to others.]

Bihyung moved without hesitation.

[The authority of a giant story is being used.]
Bihyung became a senior dokkaebi and gained the rights to a giant story.
The wenny person wouldn't be able to resist the power that could
manipulate the Star Stream. By the way, the wenny man was laughing.
[Didn't the previous generation tell you? Never use that power in front of a
wenny person.]

The story flowing out of the lump started to trap the story around Bihyung's
body. The language of the system was entirely black. It was as if someone
had covered the world in black paint.

[The operation of the giant story ■■■■…]

Bihyung was startled. This type of manipulation was only available to the
great dokkaebis above the highest-ranking dokkaebis. How did this wenny
man have this power…?

[Perhaps… the language of another world?]

[Stupid dokkaebi. Your mistake was coming here alone.]

Something was crawling out of the wenny person's lump. A monstrous
creature was sending its tentacles through the torn lump.

[ K-Kuoh, kuooooh. ]

The quick tentacles instantly grasped Bihyung's small body.

[The story 'Song of the Wenny Person' is in effect.]

Bihyung realized too late the moment the story touched him. Why did the
previous generation dokkaebis avoid the wenny people?

[Due to the racial characteristic, the resistance to the 'wenny people' has
plummeted.]

[The hatred of the wenny people makes your mind weak.]
[The wenny people's grudge has sharply reduced your fighting power.]

A feeling of helplessness filled Bihyung and he felt like an incarnation.
Countless gazes pouring from the air struck his body like arrows.

[The constellation 'King Heungmu the Great' is astonished by the power of
the wenny people.]

[The constellation 'God of Wine and Ecstasy' is frowning at the source of
the wenny people's power.]

[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' is forming fists.]

[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' is greatly angry!]

The wenny man laughed. [We can't apply this power to other races.
However, it is different for a dokkaebi.]

The force of the tentacles slowly squeezed tighter and suffocated Bihyung.
He could feel the deep grudge of the wenny people through the tentacles.

It was a story that showed a near-invincible force against the dokkaebis as
long as certain conditions were satisfied. He was apalled by the wenny
people's story, which had been filled with the hatred of a race since its birth.

[You will die in view of your favourite constellations.] I will get a very
good story today.]

The story flowed and squeezed Bihyung like he was a fruit. He belatedly
contacted the bureau but Bihyung would become juice before they came. It
happened the moment his consciousness was going to disappear under the
tightening tentacles.

The tentacles wrapped around Bihyung exploded. The surprised wenny
man retreated and Bihyung's small body fell to the ground. It was a tall man
who caught Bihyung.
"What a stupid dokkaebi to confront a wenny person."

Bihyung turned his head at the cold voice. Bloody boots. A long black coat
flapping in the wind. The trapped Biyoo shouted "Baaat," while the
constellations in the sky sent indirect messages.

[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' is screaming and cheering!]

Bihyung saw the black weapon in his hands and realized the identity of the
man.

[Y-You…?]

He got goosebumps the moment he locked eyes with the man. It wasn't
because of the man's skill Sage's Eye, which was designed by the oldest
man in all dimensions, nor was it because of the fierceness around his body.
Bihyung had met countless incarnations.

However, only one incarnation had the eyes of this man. He seemed to be
measuring how to kill Bihyung. The moment Bihyung started struggling,
the man threw Bihyung's body back.

"Stay back."

Bihyung fell with a loud sound and rolled across the ground. The man
gripped the sword in his right hand without hesitation. The Black Heavenly
Demon Sword started crying and a solid story of transcendence started
surrounding the man.

The cut-off tentacles wriggled on the ground. The wenny man stared
blankly at the scene and Yoo Joonghyuk opened his mouth. "You are the
great demon of the horizon."

[That's right. It has been a while. Puppet of the Oldest Dream.]

"…It is the first time I'm seeing you."
[Hahaha! You will never know! You will never know even when going
through 1,000 deaths and living 1,000 lives again. Because you are…!]

Yoo Joonghyuk had no intention of listening to the wenny man's bullshit
and his sword cut through the space.

The wenny man saw the blade passing right in front of his nose and
shouted, [Wouldn't it be good if we both backed away at this point? You
have nothing to do with this situation—]

"Give me Shin Yoosung."

[What?]

He followed Yoo Joonghyuk's gaze towards the cage where Biyoo was
trapped. The wenny man finally realized how the situation had gone wrong.
[Are you aiming for the dokkaebi? Bah! It is no use for a human to have a
channel—]

"I don't need a channel."

Biyoo's eyes shook from inside the cage. The fallen Bihyung stood up and
listened blankly. The atmosphere of transcendence surrounded Yoo
Joonghyuk's blade.

The wenny man laughed. [I'm dumbfounded. Don't you know the value of
this dokkaebi? It is unreasonable for you in this round. It is useless even
with the person called Kim Dokja! No matter how many variables, the flow
of the Star Stream…]

The sparks of transcendence appeared and a waterfall of magic power
poured from Yoo Joonghyuk's Black Heavenly Demon Sword. The arm of
the wenny man flew through the air.
Magic power flowed out from the blade in the form of the Breaking the Sky
energy and the wenny man shouted, [S-Stop! You don't know because your
cumulative deeds are still low. In other parallel dimensions…!]

The excessive leakage of information caused sparks of probability to splash
around the wenny man. He swallowed his words and yelled again.

[In any case, you're making a mistake now! Never make me your enemy―]

"I made a promise with my colleagues. I'll get revenge for her."

Biyoo in the cage was shaking. She might've lost her memory and many
parts of her past life had disappeared but Biyoo's body was trembling.

"You'll die here."

The Shin Yoosung of the 41st regression didn't have her memories. If so,
who was the revenge for? Yoo Joonghyuk didn't know. He just swung his
sword. Just like revenge for the first round was completed in the second
round and revenge for the second round was completed in the third round.

He tore at the tentacles coming from the lump and then placed a huge
sword against one of the wenny man's arms. The next moment, Yoo
Joonghyuk was standing behind the wenny man. The energy of Breaking
the Sky flooded the entire space.

[W-Wait a minute! Stop―]

The wenny person's lump flew through the air. The next moment, the
wenny man's body was engulfed in the darkness that emerged from the
lump.

[A curse, I will curse you. The 'I' of all dimensions will never forgive
you…!]
The wenny man was struck in the mouth by the Black Heavenly Demon
Sword. There was a terrible scream and the darkness that escaped from the
lump completely swallowed the wenny person.

The darkness stared at Yoo Joonghyuk for a moment before it completely
disappeared. Then a complete stillness came. Yoo Joonghyuk stood still for
a while from the excessive use of transcendence. Countless system
messages entered his ears.

[You have acquired a new legendary story!]

[You have accomplished an achievement that never existed before.]

[The story 'One Who Killed a Wenny Person' has been acquired!]

[All the wenny people in the Demon Realm have become hostile to you!]

Yoo Joonghyuk slowly walked towards the cage and carefully pulled out
Biyoo. Biyoo cried out loudly. Her little hand touched Yoo Joonghyuk
several times. Yoo Joonghyuk stared down at Biyoo for a while before he
placed her in his pocket and started moving.

[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' has wet eyes.]

[The constellation 'Bald General of Justice' is wiping his head with a
towel.] [The constellation 'Maritime War God' is so impressed that he is
writing a poem.]

The light of countless constellations was shining towards him but none of
them could reach Yoo Joonghyuk. No matter how many years they had
lived, they couldn't understand the regressor who suffered the destruction
of the world twice. The next moment, Yoo Joonghyuk heard a message.
[The constellation 'Demon King of Salvation' is looking at you.]

It was a star that never appeared in the last two rounds. Then why? Yoo
Joonghyuk felt like the star had been there for a long time.
Yoo Joonghyuk declared, "Get lost, Kim Dokja."

Then one of the stars in the sky really went out.

"…Kim Dokja?"

There was no answer from Kim Dokja.
        Chapter 257: Ep. 48 - Entrance as a Character, III


"Things have been roughly sorted out."

I sighed with relief as I looked at Yoo Joonghyuk through the screen of the
channel. I was anxious about the bureau arriving but fortunately, Yoo
Joonghyuk was faster. It was a good choice to convey a message to Uriel
through Jang Hayoung.

[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' is smiling brightly.]

It was Uriel who took Yoo Joonghyuk to that place. Yoo Joonghyuk was
angry with me over the Breaking the Sky Sword Saint incident so I decided
that Uriel's words would have more influence on Yoo Joonghyuk.

Jang Hayoung watched Bihyung on the screen and muttered, "It is the first
time I've seen a dokkaebi so helpless."

"The racial stories are intertwined. In order to deal with a wenny person, a
great dokkaebi or at least four dokkaebis must appear."
"…You know it very well? Aileen said that everything about the dokkaebis
and wenny people was covered in a veil."

"This is basic information among the constellations."

Jang Hayoung stared at me with strangely respectful eyes after hearing my
words. Of course, not all constellations knew this information. The screen
showed a short close-up of Biyoo and Yoo Joonghyuk holding her.

「 I will get revenge for you. 」

「 Goodbye, Captain. 」

「 Good job. 」

「 I'll leave it to you. 」

「 Rest. 」

The sentences that only I could see were passing through my head. Now
these words had gone to the place they were meant to. I didn't know much
about it but one thing was certain.

At least now they understood each other without words. The things I
couldn't read had definitely touched them. I didn't know why but I felt
lonely thinking about it.

"…Kim Dokja?" Jang Hayoung was staring at me.

I scratched my head and quickly opened my mouth. "In any case, Yoo
Joonghyuk will do it somehow. This side must be ready…"

…Shit. Already? Jang Hayoung and I looked out the window of the office
at the same time. Clouds of sand were gathering beyond the walls of the
industrial complex. There was a commotion among the citizens. I could see
Mark and the other lawmakers calming them down.
[Oh, there are some hot-tempered constellations. There are still 48 hours
until the Demon King Selection.]

The familiar voice of a dokkaebi was heard in the air. High above the
industrial complex, Dokgak stared at me and laughed.

[I was originally thinking the beginning should be more boring…]

He was obviously smiling but his eyes were full of resentment against
me. No matter how much he disliked me, he couldn't start his own game
within the Demon King Selection story. [This time, it isn't bad to start
early.]

…What?

[A new sub scenario has been acquired!]

[The Sub Scenario―'Skirmish' has started!]

I saw the emerging window and noticed how things were progressing. A
sub scenario. In the absence of Biyoo and Bihyung, this jerk…
  [Sub Scenario - Skirmish]

  Category: Sub

  Difficulty: ???

  Clear Conditions: Protect the 'Story Core' of the industrial complex for
  a limited amount of time. Or steal it.

  Time Limit: 48 hours.

  Compensation: Attacking side― qualification for the Demon King
  Selection

  Defending side―200,000 coins, ???

  Failure: ―


I frowned. It might be a sub scenario but opening a scenario in this way was
clearly out of the ordinary.

[Some constellations are dissatisfied with the unfair process of Dokgak!]

[Some constellations are requesting a 'probability conformity screening!]

Fortunately, I wasn't the only one to think so.

[Ahh, I knew some of you would think so. Certainly, there is some
unfairness. The number of defenders and attackers aren't equal.]

Dokgak was sneering at me. It was a smile that told me I could handle such
a scenario. It was an obvious provocation.
[Thus, I have slightly adjusted the difficulty level. As far as this sub
scenario is concerned, the individual constellations of the attackers and
defenders will have equal levels.]

The moment Dokgak spoke, a faint aura surrounded my incarnation bodies.

[The stats of everyone participating in the scenario is fixed.]

I slowly clenched my fists before opening them. The attacking
constellations would've received the same penalty. I couldn't see whether
my stats had fallen or increased.

[Some constellations are still protesting that this scenario is against the
probability!]

Dokgak had a troubled expression.

[Ahh, don't say that. This is really… you have all become weak. Have you
already forgotten that scenarios are fun because they're difficult?]

The channel became a terrible mess with indirect messages supporting
and opposing it. In the meantime, Dokgak pushed ahead with the
scenario. [You are currently the owner of the Kim Dokja Industrial
Complex.]

[You are playing the role of 'defender' in the Skirmish.]

[You must protect the Story Core from the attacking constellations.]

I smiled bitterly as I faced Dokgak. Yes, this was what he came up with.

"Kim Dokja, how…"

Rather than answering Jang Hayoung, I opened the wide and yelled towards
the citizens.
[All citizens. This is the first time I am personally greeting you.]

My true voice resonated through the industrial complex. I once again
breathed in and shouted, [Please calm down and concentrate on my words.]

The voice of the duke was heard for the first time and all the citizens looked
at me. Voices came from all over the place. "It is Kim Dokja!"

"That person is the duke!"

Unfortunately, I couldn't match their expectations.

[I can't protect you.]

Perhaps there had never been such a duke in the Demon Realm. In addition,
I hoped there wouldn't be any more in the future.

[So don't die here like dogs and find your own way to live. I will personally
recommend the Yoo Joonghyuk Industrial Complex!]

I could see the mouths of the citizens dropping open at my absurd
declaration. Even Mark looked up in a bewildered manner from where he
was calming the citizens. Still, it couldn't be helped. This was the only way
to save them. There should be no unnecessary sacrifices in this scenario.

[Do you want to free the citizens of your industrial complex?]

"Free them."

[All citizens of the industrial complex are freed from your influence.]

[The citizens of the Kim Dokja Industrial Complex have received the
'Escape Scenario'.]

[The citizens of the Kim Dokja Industrial Complex can now choose an
industrial complex.]
[You have acquired a new legendary story!]

[The story 'Liberator of the Industrial Complex' has been acquired.]

Messages poured out and I left a final message.

[Everyone, please leave. I will stop them until everyone leaves.]

Bihyung might've argued against this if he was here but now he was lying
in a distant place.

[The citizens of the industrial complex are giving a standing ovation for
your noble sacrifice.]

Thanks but I wasn't planning a noble sacrifice. I focused on the energy
coming from beyond the barrier of the industrial complex. There were four
huge energy sources. At least four constellations were approaching.

"Jang Hayoung. Take Han Myungoh and the Breaking the Sky Master. Flee
and don't look back.

Never think about fighting them."

"What? I don't want to!"

"I don't care if you want to! Go directly to Yoo Joonghyuk. Quickly!"

There were 'four' coming now but there would be more behind them. They
weren't something a transcendent dog, a human whose gender was
ambiguous and a middle-aged man who had been pregnant could face.

"I am one of them anyway."

I immediately ran downstairs and pulled out the Story Core of the Factory.

[The Factory has stopped running.]
The important thing was to protect this Story Core. I didn't have to stay in
the industrial complex to defend it. I opened Bookmark and used Way of
the Wind to climb onto the wall of the industrial complex.

[Is this what you want?]

The four approaching constellations listened to me.

[If you want it then you'll have to take it away.]




The fearsome constellations followed behind me. The reason I could flee
was because we had equal stats.

They were four and I was one. I didn't have much of a chance, regardless of
whether the constellations were high or low ranking.

I ran over barriers using Way of the Wind. The constellations confirmed I
was holding the Story Core and started to chase me. If they took me down
here, they could qualify to participate in the Demon King Selection. It
wasn't strange for them to go on a rampage like this.

Dokgak laughed at me. [Hahaha, it is very easy to run away! Constellations,
do you really want to stay on Bihyung's channel to watch such a person?]

This son of a bitch… I wouldn't have suffered from this sub scenario if
Bihyung hadn't been distracted. However, I couldn't do anything because
Bihyung wasn't here.

"Requesting a rise in membership level of the Dokkaebi Bag."

I had already become a 'platinum' level which was an increase by two
levels. Still, platinum wasn't the highest rating.
[The dokkaebi in charge is currently absent.]

[The status update will be automatically executed due to the dokkaebi's
absence.]

[500,000 coins have been consumed.]

[Congratulations! You have become a diamond member of the Dokkaebi
Bag!]

[Due to the increase in membership level, the items list of the Dokkaebi
Bag will be updated.]

The diamond members could purchase VIP exclusive items. If my
memories were correct, the 'items' would've been released by now.

[You can see the list of exclusive VIP items.]

If Bihyung was here, he would've hidden this list even if he died. It was
because Bihyung's black history was among the items on this list.


  * Random Story Box (ver 1.3) ― 20,000 C

  * Story Fusion Box (ver 1.3) ― 200,000 C


…It was as expected. These crazy coin items were being sold. Fortunately,
the updated version was the one I was looking for.

「 "Shit, what are the odds… why didn't they publish the odds?" 」

In the 71st round, Kim Namwoon bought this wrong thing and was ruined.

[You have purchased ten Random Story Boxes.]
[You have purchased one Story Fusion Boxes.]

[400,000 coins have been consumed.]

The Random Story Box was one of the few gambling items that consumed
coins to get 'stories'. Due to the description that the best quasi-myth-grade
story could be obtained, the incarnations and constellations ran towards this
item once it was released on the market.

Of course, it went without saying that they all became bankrupt. The result
was natural. The probability of getting a historical-grade story from the
Random Box was less than 0.001% and the odds of a quasi-myth story
wasn't even 0.00001%. Then what about the remaining 99,99%?

「 "Crazy! 50 historical-grade stories? There is even the lowest-grade? Is
this a joke?" 」

I grabbed a falling box and opened it with my mouth.

[Do you want to use the Random Story Box?]

I knew there was little chance of a good story coming out of this box. Then
why did I want this box? The story I wanted wasn't a good story.

.

.

[The story 'Head Shoulder Knee Feet' has been acquired.]

[The story 'Don't Cut My Hair' has been acquired.]

[The story 'Nose Pendant Hanging from the Nose'.]

[The story 'Earring Hanging from the Ears'.]

.
.

Indeed, it was as I saw in Ways of Survival. In the 1.3 version of the Story
Box, there was a more than 80% chance of stories regarding the 'body'
coming out. The most common of them was the Nose Pendant Hanging
from the Nose and Earring Hanging from the Ears.

From behind me, a serpent's fangs grazed my sides and thighs. It was an
attack containing the power of a story. I gritted my teeth and activated Way
of the Wind to the extreme, hiding behind the ruins of a building. I needed a
bit more time.

[Wh…ere… are… you…!]

I ignored the ugly true voice and confirmed the stories I had just acquired.


    [Historical-grade Story: Nose Pendant Hanging from the Nose]

    Description: If you place anything on your nose, it will trigger an effect
    that makes it look like an accessory. The item doesn't matter.




    [Historical-grade Story: Earring Hanging from the Ears]

    Description: It anything is hung on your ears, an effect that makes it
    look like an earring will be activated. It is a story made in combination
    with Nose Pendant Hanging from the Nose.


Needless to say, these stories weren't helpful when it came to breaking
through the current situation. However, it was different with the next item.
  [Item Information]

  Name: Story Fusion Box ver 1.3

   Rating: ―

   Description: It can fuse together different types of stories. There is a
   very low probability of randomly creating a higher-grade story.


An item that had a very low probability of generating a high-grade story
when mixing certain combinations of stories. Originally, this item wasn't
very useful. The same stories being put together produced different results
every time and the odds of getting a good story were ridiculously low.

Nevertheless, according to the characters' remarks, there was a bug in the
1.3 version of the fusion box.

「 "The sale of the box was discontinued because of this. Shit, I should've
tried it before Anna Croft―" 」

There was a bug with the 1.3 version fo the Story Fusion Box. It was that
when mixing certain stories, the first person who did it must receive a
'certain story'.

The two stories were poured into the box without hesitation and there was a
bright flash of light. A message entered my ears along with the throbbing
pain.

[The legendary story 'Distorting Things as One Pleases' has been acquired.]
        Chapter 258: Ep. 48 - Entrance as a Character, IV


One day, there was a constellation who left such a remark.

「 "Every story has a flaw. This means that all stories can be completed."
」

The legendary story 'Distorting Things as One Pleases'. This story was
made by the narrative-grade constellation who left behind that remark.

[The story 'Distorting Things as One Pleases' is searching for the target of
the distortion.]

I got up and moved away from the ruined building. I could see three
constellations chasing me through the dust clouds. It was originally four but
I didn't know where the last one went.

[Kuaaaah…]

[Gi ve me the sto ry co re.]
I was surrounded by the incarnation bodies. There was one giant snake that
reminded me of Orochi and one giant field mouse. The last one was a fiery
dog resembling a Cerberus. The Mass Production Maker had told me
something during my visit to the Gourmet Association.

–Not all constellations have a noble character.

Some of the constellations would build up stories like me to become
constellations while others would lend themselves to the 'authority' of other
constellations. In some cases, they might not have accumulated excellent
stories but they were lucky enough to fall into an advantageous area and
become a constellation.

"What if I don't want to give it to you?"

It was the case with the guys in front of me.

[The constellation 'Nouveau Riche Snake Boss' is staring at you.]

They were those who received the patronage of constellations or
'fortunately' became constellations by eating other beginner constellations
or incarnations.

[The constellation 'Nail-Eating Rat' is coveting your nails.]

[The constellation 'Dog Who Threw Himself into the Flames' is looking at
the surrounding constellations.]

I knew I would eventually bump into them from the moment they appeared
in front of me.

[Many constellations are looking forward to your battle!]

[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' is looking forward to
your performance!]
I could feel the hot gaze of the stars. They would be curious. I hadn't fought
properly since becoming a narrative-grade constellation. Dokgak spoke
from the air.

[Haha, you are still stupid… are you really going to fight?]

I listened to Dokgak's words and gritted my teeth. The three constellations
in front of me had exactly the same level of combat power as me. It was
due to Dokgak's penalty. A penalty where everyone in the scenario had the
same combat power.

I used Way of the Wind to avoid the poisonous liquid that poured out of the
Nouveau Riche Snake Boss' mouth. At almost the same time, the
NailEating Rat swiped his nails towards me. The moment I rolled around
on the ground, the surroundings were filled with the flames of the Dog Who
Threw Himself into the Flames.

I moved around the flames and pulled out my newest thing. This was a fight
that couldn't be won if we faced each other with our incarnation bodies.
This was if it was only the force of the incarnation body.

[The exclusive skill, Character List is activated.]

They might be animals but they were still historical-grade constellations.
Originally, I couldn't look at them with this skill.

[The effect of 'Looked into the Abyss' has increased the effect of all your
skills.]

[The exclusive skill 'Character List' is amplified!]

This time was different.

[You will be able to view constellations who are lower rated than you.]
.

.

[You can now read the constellation information of 'Nouveau Riche Snake
Boss'.]

[You can now read the constellation information of 'Nail-Eating Rat'.]

[You can now read the constellation information of 'Dog Who Threw
Himself into the Flames'.]

I looked at the characteristics of these guys. Of course, it didn't make sense
to simply identify the stats or attributes information when combat power
was set at a certain point.

[The effect of Character List will randomly output a list of the
constellation's stories.]

A list of their stories quickly crossed my eyes.

[Snake Eating Other Snakes.]

[Rat Turning Into a Person.]

[Loyalty Towards the Master.]

[Predator of the Weak.]

…

In the meantime, countless attacks were focused on me. The fist of the
Nouveau Riche Snake Boss grazed past my shoulders, my body flew
through the air from an attack by the Nail-Eating Rat and my skin was
burnt by the flames of the Dog Who Threw Himself into the Flames.

[Your reading speed has increased due to the attribute effect.]
I didn't back down and kept reading their list of stories. They were
constellations and had an excellent number of stories. Some were legendary
while most were historical-grade.

[Rat Who Stole the Words of the Night.]

[Fear of Rodents]

[Mine is Mine, Yours is Mine Too.]

[Towards Plandas.]

…

How long had it been? My legs were paralyzed and the Nouveau Riche
Snake Boss wound around my body. My vision was literally reversed as my
body was captured by him.

Gi ve me the Sto ry Co re.]

The strong grip on my body made by bones feel twisted. It was a mighty
power that the Infinite Dimension Space Coat couldn't bear. Story
fragments fell down from my body like crumbs.

[Constellations who love cruel stories are excited.]

[Some of the constellations want to see your body torn apart.]

The eyes of the snake changed at the indirect messages of the
constellations. Having the name of 'constellation' didn't mean all of them
were on the same level.

They were more like incarnations. They were watched by other
constellations and received coins from them.
"I have one question… Why do you want to live like this?"

The Nail-Eating Rat raised his head with a sound.

[Kuooooh…?]

I smiled bitterly. Well, I couldn't afford to think about such things. I had to
survive these guys.

"I feel sorry for you. Right? Usually a constellation should have a 'king's
story'…"

[The story 'Distorting Things as One Pleases' is paying attention to your
words.]

Whether it was a snake, a rat, a dog or a human… Those who steadily built
up their stories would have a story of a 'king' at the very least. However,
these guys have no such stories.

"…You have always fought against beings weaker than yourself and don't
have such stories."

[Wh at non sense…!]

The next moment, a bright light rose from my body.

[The story 'Distorting Things as One Pleases' has found a story to distort.]

The story, Distorting Things as One Pleases. This story didn't have the
power to improve my combat power.

[The story 'Distorting Things as One Pleases' is starting the story
distortion.]

Instead, it could wake up the potential of stories that hadn't yet found their
true power. The direction didn't matter.
[The story 'King of a World without a King' has been distorted!]

[The story 'King of a World without a King' is starting the story.]

I felt the power of the story seething deep inside my body. The muscles in
both arms swelled up. I gripped the Nouveau Riche Snake Boss that was
wrapped around my body. The snake screamed in my hands.

「 The world without a king is now here. 」

A huge magic power escaped and the story started to speak for itself. The
reason I checked the constellations' list of stories was simple. It was to use
this power.

「 He was born rejecting all thrones in his black world. 」

A brilliant light rose from the sword in my hands. The Four Yin Demonic
Beheading Sword. It was the sword used to destroy the Absolute Throne
and the weapon used in the story King of a Kingless World. The weapon
responded to my story and regained its original shape.

「 Reign over all beings who aren't kings. 」

[W-Wait! This strength…!]

The fact that our combat power was the same didn't mean the 'status' of the
stories is the same.

Even if the density and number of stories were low, I was also a
constellation. Dokgak should've properly recognized this fact.
[Some constellations are admiring your story application!]

[Constellations of the Big Dipper are paying attention to you.]
Dokgak was bewildered and he frantically tried to manipulate the scenario.
However, now it was too late to change the sub scenario. He had already
exhausted a lot of probability because of the excessive sub scenario.

[The constellation 'Nail-Eating Rat' is preparing to turn its tail and run.]

The rat realized the unusual signs and turned around first. However, I
wouldn't miss a single one.

"Stop."

[The effect of the story 'King of a Kingless World' is activated.]

[In front of your majesty, all beings who failed to qualify as kings must
bow.]

[Kuaaaah!]

[Eeeek!]

There were powerful sparks and the bodies of the Nouveau Riche Snake
Boss and Nail-Eating Rat became stiff. The Dog Who Threw Himself into
the Flames was already on the ground from the moment he saw my story.

[Grrrr. D… don't co me.]

As I approached, the Nouveau Riche Snake Boss wriggled on the ground.
Only those who had the story of a 'king' could resist this story.

[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' is pleased.]

[The demon king 'Devil of Lust and Wrath' is looking at you.]

As the king of the monkeys and king of the 32 Demon Realm watched over
me, the Four Yin Demonic Beheading Sword moved.

[Kuaaaaaack!]
One blow. Two blows. I struck the head of the Nouveau Riche Snake Boss
a few times. The scales of the Nouveau Riche Snake Boss weren't easily
destroyed. The flesh of the Nouveau Riche Snake Boss was cut by the
Purest Sword Force and his blood splashed, turning the surrounding land
red. The Nouveau Riche Snake Boss let out several pained screams before
falling quiet.

[Constellations of the absolute good system are frowning at your cruelty.]

I pulled the Four Yin Demonic Beheading Sword out of the head of the
Nouveau Riche Snake Boss.

[The demon king, 'Silver Claws Owl' is rejoicing in your execution.]

[2,000 coins have been sponsored.]

The constellations didn't know what was really cruel.

"You should've been prepared if you coveted my position."

This was a warning to the constellations. It was a warning that they
shouldn't interfere with the giant story. I watched the sky and waved the
Four Yin Demonic Beheading Sword.

[You have killed the Nouveau Riche Snake Boss's incarnation body.]

[You have acquired some of the stories of the Nouveau Riche Snake Boss.]

It was the power of the Four Yin Demonic Beheading Sword that could cut
off the connection between constellation and incarnation body.

[The constellation 'Nouveau Riche Snake Boss' has fallen into a deep sleep
with a scream.]

Perhaps the Nouveau Riche Snake Boss would never return to an
incarnation body. Then I looked at the Nail-Eating Rat. Soon after, the
Nail-Eating Rat received the same fate.
[The constellation 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' is delighting in your
madness.]

[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' is looking at you with sad
eyes.]

I brushed the blood of my cheeks and looked at the last remaining
constellation. The Dog Who Threw Himself into the Flames was trembling
uncontrollably while his head drooped down. The flames that covered his
body had already disappeared.

The only thing that remained on the dog's body were the black burn stains
from protecting its master. I recalled his list of stories. This dog was
different from the other two in the Twelve Zodiacs.

[The constellation 'Dog Who Threw Himself into the Flames' is pledging
allegiance to you.]

I looked at the panting dog and hesitated for a moment. Certain
constellations would be disappointed if I didn't kill the dog here.
However… Other constellations aiming for me were running in the
distance.

[The story 'Distorting Things as One Pleases' has come to an end.]

I had used an excessive amount of magic power and needed to recover. I
put away my sword and climbed onto the dog.

"Let's go to the Yoo Joonghyuk Industrial Complex."

As if waiting, the dog started taking strong steps. The scenery passed
quickly and I looked up at the sky.

The stars in the night sky seemed to be flowing to different places. Some
chose to watch and others chose to take part. Everyone started to draw the
trail of the story according to their respective desires.
The real Demon King Selection would soon begin.
          Chapter 259: Ep. 49 - The Best at Something, I


The Dog Who Threw Himself into the Flames ran while carrying me for
two days and nights. The constellations relentlessly chasing me were a
frequent threat but every time, the Dog Who Threw Himself into the
Flames literally threw his body to protect me.

[The story 'Faithfully Devoting One's Life' has been repeated.]

How far did we run? Finally, the brightness of a new day could be seen.

[The sub scenario ― Skirmish has ended.]

[You have kept the Story Core safe during the time limit.]

The constellations chasing after us stopped one by one in distant places and
all types of indirect messages flew through the air.

[Some constellations who failed to chase you are disappointed.]
[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' is yawning and asking
if it is all over.]

[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' is rejoicing with sleepy eyes!]

[The constellation 'Dragon Lying Down' is nodding at you ploy.]

[Some constellations are pointing fingers at your cowardice.]

It didn't matter if they pointed fingers or not. The most important thing was
to survive. Dokgak stared down at me with disapproving eyes and sent me
compensation.

[You have obtained 200,000 coins as compensation.]

[You have obtained two Anvil Stones for Equipment Transcendence as a
reward.]

I thought it was around the time for items to enhance equipment to be
released. SSS-grade items from the early scenarios were almost like scraps
in the mid-to-late scenario areas. However, using the transcendence anvil
stones allowed you to stop the equipment from losing its quality.

The income wasn't just that.

[The story 'One Who Went Against the Twelve Zodiacs' has been
acquired.]

It might be historical-grade but the more stories I had, the better. In the end,
these little stories gathered together to form the complete 'status'. In
particular, the stories obtained would be useful in future fights thanks to
Distorting Things as One Pleases.

[Constellations chasing you are returning.]

No long after the constellations hid themselves, the exterior of the Yoo
Joonghyuk Industrial Complex emerged. Citizens who received the escape
scenario were lining up to enter the industrial complex. Fortunately, Jang
Hayoung and Han Myungoh had done well.

I spoke to the Dog Who Threw Himself into the Flames. "You can leave
now. You don't have to be loyal to me."

He didn't want to follow me wholeheartedly anyway. Thus, it was better to
part ways at this point. However, after I turned away, he kept chasing me.

Pant, pant, pant.

I spoke with a frown. "What? You aren't going?"

Yip…

Moisture filled the big dog's eyes.

[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' is looking pitifully at the 'Dog
Who Threw Himself into the Flames'.]

The real name of the Dog Who Threw Himself into the Flames was the Dog
of Osu¹. In order to save his master from dying of fire, the dog wet his body
and used it to extinguish the fire. Unfortunately, even this name wasn't his
actual name.

"…Are you going to follow me?"

Yiiip!

I hesitated for a moment. Come to think of it, things would be hard for this
dog even if he split from me.

[Some of the constellations are looking at the Dog Who Threw Himself into
the Flames.]

In this world, there were just as many constellations aiming for other
constellations as there were constellations aiming at incarnations. If he
countered those who had the modifiers of 'Dog Hunter' or 'Melberg's Dog
Fancier' then he would be stolen or killed. So far, he had been safe
because of the Twelve Zodiacs. "Then let's go together." Pant pant pant!

"However, make your size a bit smaller. It will be a disturbance if you
are too big." Yiiip!

The Dog Who Threw Himself into the Flames reduced the size of his body.
He became the size of a golden retriever.

"Kim Dokja!" Jang Hayoung discovered me and waved in the distance.
"Hey! Are you okay? What is that dog?"

"I picked him up. What about the others?"

"They are busy guiding the people."

The Dog Who Threw Himself into the Flames licked Jang Hayoung's hand.
Jang Hayoung asked, "What's his name?"

I wanted to tell the truth but decided to say it roughly. "Osu."

[You have given a name to the Dog Who Threw Himself into the Flames.]

[The Dog Who Threw Himself into the Flames is greatly impressed.]

[The loyalty of the Dog Who Threw Himself into the Flames has greatly
increased!]

…If I had known, I would've given him a better name. Jang Hayoung
carefully examined Osu's body and was delighted.

"This is great. Sajeo will like you."

I was about to ask who 'Sajeo' was when I realized.
"…Are you talking about the Breaking the Sky Master? Was she a female?"

"Did you forget that only women can learn the Breaking the Sky
Swordsmanship?"

Come to think of it… The Breaking the Sky Swordsmanship was like that.
There were too many exceptions. For example, the guy in front of me…

"…Why are you looking at me like that?"

"No, it's nothing." I shook my head to get rid of my thoughts. The important
issue right now wasn't Jang Hayoung's gender identity. Because…

[The beginning of the Demon King Selection is imminent!]

The Demon King Selection was starting now.

"…It came."

Jang Hayoung looked up nervously at my words. The entire 73rd Demon
Realm was shaking. Unfamiliar coloured stars appeared in the sky one by
one. In order to watch the big event where the giant story was occurring,
the constellations arrived from various parts of the Star Stream.

[Multiple constellations are entering the channel!]

[Many demon kings are entering the channel!]

I could feel the mood just be looking at the beings entering the channel.

[The constellation 'Queen of the Darkest Spring' is looking at you.]

[The constellation 'God of Wine and Ecstasy' is staring at you.]

[The constellation 'Mass Production Maker' is waving at you.]

The constellations I had met also appeared in the high skies.
I tried to relax as I looked up at them in the sky. I had finally come to this
place. There were still many scenarios remaining and they were far away.
Nevertheless, it wasn't a long way off now. At the very least, I came to a
place where these lofty constellations were located in this mountain range.

[The 25th main scenario has arrived!]

[Excessive skipping of the main scenario has damaged party of your status.]

I didn't carry out the scenarios in the 20s. I started to 25th scenario straight
away so it was unavoidable that there would be a loss in probability.

[The Main Scenario ― 'Demon King Selection' has started!]


  [Main Scenario #25 - Demon King Selection]

  Category: Main

  Difficulty: ???

  Clear Conditions: Team up with 'helpers' to win the 'mythical
  battlefield'.

  Time Limit: ―

  Compensation: Official succession of the demon king position, ???.

  Failure: Death

  * You can recruit 'helpers' for this scenario.

  * There will be additional explanations from the dokkaebis as the
  scenario progresses.
It was a scenario where 'death' was marked as the failure result. I would die
here if I lost. It wasn't unfamiliar to me since it happened often.

[This scenario is held on a dedicated stage.]

[The total number of participants in this scenario is four.]

[The main participants can recruit 'helpers' if it is mutually agreed upon.]

[You are a main participant in this scenario.]

I felt something great from the north and west.

[Constellations belonging to the 'Melledon Industrial Complex' are showing
hostility towards you.]

[Constellations belonging to the 'Bercan Industrial Complex' are showing
hostility towards you.]

As the constellations in the sky flashed, the voice of the dokkaebi was
heard.

[You have been waiting a long time, constellations.]

They were Dokgak and Bihyung.

[Finally, the Demon King Selection that you have been waiting for has
begun!]

Along with Bihyung's words, a large hologram of a 'stage' appeared on the
screen in the air.

[First, thank you to the Mass Production Maker for making the game stage
for this scenario!]

There was exaggerated applause as the map created by the Mass Production
Maker appeared on the hologram.
[The game 'Mythical Battlefield' is loaded!]

The map was a vast forest area with huge cliffs at the edges. The forest
zone contained patterns of the 'industrial complex' in the east, west, north
and south, which probably signified the starting points of each industrial
complex.

[As you might have expected, this 'selection' isn't simply a hit and run fight.
It will be held in the form of a 'team competition', with each team being an
industrial complex.]

Some of the constellations were surprised by the dokkaebis' words and sent
indirect messages. Of course, I wasn't surprised. I knew it well through the
original novel.

[The rules of the game are simple. All participants can make a team of
seven people, including themselves.]

[Every team member is given a different position and will play a role in the
scenario through that position.]

It was similar to the so-called AOS games that were once popular on Earth.
One tanker, two close range damage dealers, two long range damage
dealers and one supporter. Finally, one all-rounder.

T

his was the game― the Mythical Battlefield where seven people teamed up
to fight.

[The constellation 'Mass Production Maker' is smiling.]

As a matter of fact, this game was made of elements that had been stolen
from somewhere…
The dokkaebi's words continued. [There are two ways to win the game. One
is to annihilate the participants of other teams apart from your own. The
second way is to take away the 'sentence' of the other team. Well, there will
be more details once you join the game… rather, there is one more
important announcement.]

Bihyung glanced at me after long words.

[A total of four teams were originally scheduled to participate in this
selection competition but one of the industrial complexes almost collapsed
before the game started.]

I felt uneasy for a moment. Bihyung continued. [To consider the fairness
of the game, we have decided to tie two comparatively unfavourable
industrial complexes together into one team.] Then I heard a message in
the air.

[You are currently a participant of the Yoo Joonghyuk - Kim Dokja
Industrial Complex.]

It was an unexpected situation. I had been worried about Yoo Joonghyuk's
team so now I was able to reduce my troubles. Perhaps it was Bihyung's
doing.

In any case, why was it the Yoo Joonghyuk - Kim Dokja Industrial
Complex? Based on the order of the hangul flowchart, shouldn't the name
of the industrial complex be Kim Dokja - Yoo Joonghyuk Industrial
Complex? In any case…

"Jang Hayoung, where is Yoo Joonghyuk now?" I looked around for Yoo
Joonghyuk but I couldn't find any traces of him.

Jang Hayoung's eyes were wide as he asked back, "What are you talking
about? Didn't you meet him?"
"…Meet him?"

"Didn't he go looking for you?"

"What?"

I had a bad feeling. I hurriedly used Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint.

[You can't connect with the current target.]

Dammit. I was wondering how to find this son of a bitch when something
flashed on my mind. Fortunately, it was now midday.

[You have used the Midday Tryst.]

The Midday Tryst. It was a one-on-one chat item that I linked to this guy in
the past. I didn't know if it was in range but this was the only thing I could
believe in right now.

[There are 39 unread messages.]

By the way, I had dozens of messages from him. I hurriedly opened the
window. The first message started as followed:

Kim Dokja, I saved Biyoo / Sender: Yoo Joonghyuk, 47 hours and 39
minutes ago.

The messages continued to come over the next few days.

But why did you suddenly disappear? /Sender: Yoo Joonghyuk, 46 hours
and 54 minutes ago.

I have no time for your childish antics. /Sender: Yoo Joonghyuk, 46 hours
and 39 minutes ago.

I will kill you if you don't show up again. /Sender: Yoo Joonghyuk, 45
hours and 18 minutes ago.
It isn't a joke. /Sender: Yoo Joonghyuk, 44 hours and 39 minutes ago.

…

Kim Dokja. /Sender: Yoo Joonghyuk, 41 hours and 38 minutes ago.

After that, the dozens of messages continued. The last message was:

I will go. /Sender: Yoo Joonghyuk, 23 hours and 14 minutes ago.

No, where did this bastard plan to go? I was dumbfounded and quickly sent
a message.

―You idiot, come back quickly! I am currently in the industrial complex!

However, Yoo Joonghyuk didn't answer. There were no signs that he read
it. Instead, I received a scenario message that was like a death sentence.

[Please recruit your helpers within 10 minutes.]

[You can recruit six helpers.]

There were two dogs, one gender ambiguous human and a person
trembling with fear that I would point to him… he had postpartum
depression… dammit. I urgently needed to fill up the seven people,
regardless of power. I sighed and opened my mouth. "…I will choose the
helpers."

The two dogs, Jang Hayoung and Han Myungoh were included but I still
needed two more. Even if one spot was left for Yoo Joonghyuk, one more
person had to be recruited separately. I looked up at the sky.

[Every constellation in the channel is listening to you.]

Now it was time to test my network.
[1] Dog of Osu – a Korean folktale about a loyal dog that sacrificed himself
to save his owner's life.
          Chapter 260: Ep. 49 - The Best at Something, II


The moment I opened my mouth towards the constellations,the frightened
Han Myungoh raised his hands. "D-Don't include me! Honestly, I don't
think I will be any help."

He was frightened. All participants and helpers would be at least a
historicalgrade constellation. It was a power that Head Manager Han of
Mino Soft didn't have.

I touched Han Myungoh's shoulder and told him, "Please fill in the number
of people. It isn't a real death even if you die in there. Just close your eyes
and play the game."

The Mythical Battlefield had a total of three chances. If I lost this round, I
could make up for it in the next round and the round after that.

"B-But it will be painful!"

"Yes."
"Then I don't want to! I won't…!"

"Thank you, Department Head-nim."

[You have gained 'Demon Earl Han Myungoh' as a helper.]

[Number of helpers spots left: 5 people.]

It would be nice if I could get a better pinch-hitter but there were no
suitable talents. I could choose Mark or Aileen but they were honestly
inferior to Han Myungoh, who was a demon earl.

"I will naturally participate." Jang Hayoung bumped his fists like he had
been waiting.

[You have gained 'Dimensional Mover Jang Hayoung' as a helper.]

[Number of helpers spots left: 4 people.]

How much was Jang Hayoung's combat power now? I heard he came third
in the martial arts competition but… I couldn't feel it because I wasn't
present. The Jang Hayoung of any round hadn't succeeded the Breaking the
Sky Swordsmanship during this period.

I turned my head towards another Breaking the Sky Sword Saint
disciple. "Breaking the Sky Master." Woof!

The answer was simple.

[You have gained 'Knowledgeable Dog Breaking the Sky Master' as a
helper.]

[Number of helpers spots left: 3 people.]

The transcendent dog Breaking the Sky Master could definitely compete
with the historical-grade constellations. This dog would obviously be a big
help in this fight. By the way, the expression of the Breaking the Sky
Master wasn't good.

Grrrr! Woof!

The Breaking the Sky Master's blustery gaze was directed towards a dog. I
knew what he meant.

"That's right. He is a new colleague."

Woof woof woof!

"It can't be helped even if you don't like it."

Osu, who had been watching quietly, started sniffing the butt of the
Breaking the Sky Master. Then the Breaking the Sky Master had flames in
her eyes as she kicked his forehead.

Yiiiip!

He wasn't reliable but I had to add him as a colleague. He was better than
Han Myungoh because he was a historical-grade constellation.

[You have gained 'Dog Who Threw Himself into the Flames' as a helper.]

[Number of helpers spots left: 2 people.]

One of the remaining two spots was for Yoo Joonghyuk.

[You have registered 'Supreme King Yoo Joonghyuk' as a helper.]

[The character is currently not nearby.]

[Once the person accepts the offer, they will be automatically summoned to
the battlefield.]
[There are five minutes remaining.]

Now I had one spot left.

[The constellation 'Demon King of Salvation' is looking at the
constellations.]

I could feel the eyes of the constellations on me. Let's get a volunteer.

"Is there anyone who can become a helper?"

To be honest, I thought there was no way there would be no applicants. The
constellations in the channel were those who had been following my story
all
the way here. If there was more than one volunteer, I might be able to
replace Han Myungoh. By the way…

[The constellation 'Queen of the Darkest Spring' is making an unknown
smile.]

[The constellation 'Bald General of Justice' wipes his head hard.] [The

constellation 'Mass Production Maker' is complaining of back pain.]

…Shit.

[Many constellations are turning their heads away from your eyes.]

I glared at the sky with disapproving eyes. This stage might not be
deserving of Persephone or the Mass Production Maker but there were the
historicalgrade constellations…

I sighed and turned towards Jang Hayoung. "Jang Hayoung, did you contact
the constellations I mentioned?"

"…Yes."
In order to prepare for this day, I asked Jang Hayoung to get in touch with
some constellations.

"What about Maritime War God?"

"He said he will think about it."

I frowned. How long was he going to think about it? No matter how much
he was worried about the probability… Was he afraid of going against
other nebulae?

[The constellation 'Bald General of Justice' is wiping his head with a
towel.]

Originally, my plan was to bring Breaking the Sky Sword Namgung
Minyoung and Paradox Baekchung Kyrgios Rodgraim. However, these two
people were now in Murim.

"Goryeo's First Sword?"

"There was no answer." At this point, I felt a bit betrayed.

[The constellation 'Bald General of Justice' has a traffic expression as he
wrapped the towel he wiped his forehead with around his head.]

It couldn't be helped. If this happened, I had to choose the second best
thing.

[The constellation 'Bald General of Justice' is nodding and looking at you.]

"Asmodeus. Didn't you say you would help me?"

A sinister black star in the corner of the sky wriggled at my words.

[The demon king 'Devil of Lust and Wrath' is looking at you.]
[The demon king 'Devil of Lust and Wrath' says he will help from the third
round.]

…From the third round?

[The demon king 'Devil of Lust and Wrath' wants to test if you deserve his
help.]

I bit my lip. This damn demon king was now measuring me… I wondered
if I could make it to the third round. Fortunately, I didn't see any names of
demon kings among the helpers on the other side.

[In the Melledon, the constellation 'Founder of Humanity' has been
designated as a helper.]

[In the Bercan, the constellation 'The Last Pharaoh' has been designated as
a helper.]

[In the Melledon, the constellation 'Poked Out His Eyes' has been
designated as a helper.]

[In the Melledon, the constellation 'General of Banara' has been designated
as a helper.]

There were the modifiers of some fearsome constellations, even if they
weren't demon kings. I could even see some narrative-grade constellations.
The desire of the constellations to tear, chew and taste this scenario could
be felt on my skin. It was a situation where I had to grasp at any straws.

"Uriel."

[The nebula Eden is troubled by your suggestion.]

[The demon kings of the Demon Realm are paying close attention to the
movements of the nebulae 'Eden'.]
…I forgot that this was the Demon Realm. The image of Uriel and the
writings of the Scribe of Heaven appeared in front of my eyes. As long as
the agreement between the two groups persisted, Uriel wouldn't be able to
participate in the game. In the end, I reached out for another straw.

"The Great Sage, Heaven's Equal."

However, the reaction of the Great Sage, Heaven's Equal.

[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' is scoffing at you.]

[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' is clicking his tongue
at the constellations of the other industrial complexes.]

He seemed to think that this stage didn't fit his pride as the Monkey King. It
would hurt his self-esteem to lower himself to this scenario.

[The constellation 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' is chuckling towards
you.] Jang Hayoung asked like he had heard the message. "What about the
fire dragon?"

"No."

"Why? He's better than I thought."

I knew the Abyssal Black Flame Dragon wasn't a bad guy but his power
was too risky to borrow. Crucially, there was a separate place where the
Abyssal Black Flame Dragon was needed. I eventually sighed. "It can't be
helped. The only remaining constellation is…"

"Who…?"

[The constellation 'Bald General of Justice' is holding his bamboo stick like
he has been waiting.]

"Jang Hayoung, send a message to Secretive Plotter."
[Some constellations are surprised by your choice!]

The constellation Secretive Plotter. Of the four main constellations in my
channel, he was the only one whose identity I didn't know. I didn't know
why he hadn't showed up in my channel when the Great Sage, Heaven's
Equal and the black dragon had appeared.

[A small number of constellations are afraid of your choice.]

[Some constellations are trying to dissuade you from your choice!]

The reactions of the constellations were understandable. I wasn't sure about
the identity of the Secretive Plotter but it was highly likely he was an outer
god. He also had enough influence to knock away the great old ones.
Perhaps the other constellations were deeply conscious of this fact.

Jang Hayoung typed something in the air before calling out to me, "Kim
Dokja. Did you say it properly?"

"Why?"

"Look at this." Jang Hayoung showed me the screen he had entered. The
following message was on the screen:

[This modifier doesn't exist in the Star Stream.]

I was stunned and asked Jang Hayoung, "Did you enter it correctly?"

"Do you think I'm a fool?"

Jang Hayoung once again entered 'Secretive Plotter'.

[This modifier doesn't exist in the Star Stream.]

Secretive Plotter… this modifier didn't exist?
[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' is making an
interested expression.]

[The constellation 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' is curious.]

[The constellation 'Master of the Skywalk' is turning on the network.]

[A number of constellations are searching for Secretive Plotter.]

I didn't think it would be like this and was momentarily paralyzed.

[There is one minute remaining.]

In fact, there were cases where constellations had multiple modifiers.
However, was that the current situation? A modifier had disappeared?

"What now?"

Jang Hayoung stared at me with nervous eyes. The remaining time was less
than 30 seconds.

[The constellation 'Bald General of Justice' is screaming and standing

up!] I looked up at the sky. It was hard to ignore him anymore.

"…Samyeongdang, please help."


The moment I spoke, lightning flashed in the sky.

[The constellation 'Bald General of Justice' is using probability to summon
an incarnation body!]

I stared at the incarnation body that was being formed in the dazzling light
and thought about it. It might be better to have a trustworthy ally compared
to a strong but uncontrollable constellation. At the very least,
Samyeongdang was one of the constellations who supported me when I first
got the rights to open a nebula.

The summoning ceremony ended but the light still hadn't disappeared. A
closer look showed a flash of light from the head of Samyeongdang. I used
my hand to form a curtain as a voice was heard.

[It's been a while, Kim Dokja.]

I was impressed by the true voice that contained a formidable history. Dogs
and cats could become constellations if they were lucky. This didn't mean
they were constellations.

"It's been a long time, Samyeongdang."

The three meters tall monk. He held a large bamboo stick that was like a
giant tree. The historical-grade constellation 'Samyeongdang' finally
revealed his true self.

[You have gained 'Bald General of Justice' as a helper.]

[You have all your helpers!]

.

.

[All participants have completed recruiting their helper.]

[The game 'Mythical Battlefield' has appeared in the Demon Realm!]
         Chapter 261: Ep. 49 - The Best at Something, III


The moment I heard the system message, the surrounding landscape started
to change.

The Mythical Battlefield. The feature of this Mythical Battlefield was to
virtually borrow the stage of a giant story.

[You have entered the Armageddon battlefield. The game will start after
three minutes.]

On one side of the sky, a stairway of heaven opened while the other side
was a door of hell. If this was real, the archangels of Eden would've flocked
to the staircase while the demon kings of the Demon Realm would've come
out of the gate of hell.

Fortunately, there was no such thing. This was a 'hypothetical stage'.

The constellation 'Guardian of Youths and Travel' is frowning at the
familiar stage.]
[The demon king 'Devil of Lust and Wrath' is showing hostility to
'Guardian of Youths and Travel'.]

[Many constellations and demon kings are confronting each other.]

…I really hoped it wouldn't be a big deal.

"It is eerie…"

Jang Hayoung held his shoulders while looking up at the sky. I heard an
eerie sound in the background. I looked at the huge shield that surrounded
us. The shield would protect us until the game started.

"Stay alert. Please check your selected position."

The party members regained their composure at my words.

"Who's the tanker?"

[I am.]

The tanker was Samyeongdang, the close range damage dealers were me
and the Breaking the Sky Master and the long range damage dealers were
Jang Hayoung and Osu. Han Myungoh was the supporter. Finally, the all-
rounder
was…

"Yoo Joonghyuk?"

"He might've fallen somewhere else."

The Mythical Battlefield depended on where you were summoned from.

[The helper 'Yoo Joonghyuk' has responded to the summons.]

This message appeared so Yoo Joonghyuk should be somewhere on the
battlefield.
Jang Hayoung asked, "Is this game on a battlefield of time and space? I've
seen it. If the enemy's stronghold is destroyed…"

"That's right. Still, it is a bit different."

Usually, an AOS game ended when you captured the enemy's main base.
This game was different.

"We have to capture the 'sentence', not the base."

"Sentence?"

I pointed to the object that was in Han Myungoh's hand. It was a small
monument shining with brilliant colours.

"W-What is this?"

"We have to protect that."

The monument literally contained a small sentence.

『 Messengers of Heaven, Gatekeeper of Hell. 』

Han Myungoh was terrified and tried to hand over the monument to me. I
pushed it with the palm of my hand and stated, "Department Head-nim
should hold it. It is important to guard it well."

"I-It is because it is important that Dokja-ssi should…!"

"Department Head-nim should hold it because it is important. The sentence
is usually held by the main participant. The enemies are expecting that."

"I-I won't do it! I have never played such a game!"

Han Myungoh was dull in games despite being the department head of a
game company. Come to think of it, Yoo Sangah played games well. Yoo
Sangah carried her team alone and reached the finals of the in-house game
competition.

…However, the person present now was Han Myungoh, not Yoo Sangah.
"In any case, there are two ways to win this game. One is to steal the enemy
team's sentence. The other is to kill all of the enemy team's participants."

"It will be easier to steal the sentence."

"Yes, that is usually the case."

"Good! Leave it to me!" Jang Hayoung cried out in a highly motivated
manner.

However, this wasn't a solo game. "I know you are motivated but stop
your personal play. From now on, we will make a plan…" Bark bark!

Woof woof!

…I had forgotten two of my companions. The Dog Who Threw Himself
into the Flames was sniffing around the periphery while the Breaking the
Sky Master was lying down like she wasn't interested. I turned my head
toward my last hope.

"Samyeongdang."

He seemed to be listening to advice from other constellations so he was the
only one I could expect anything from.

[I don't understand because you are using difficult words. Uhhh… game…
what is this?]

Samyeongdang had an incredibly annoyed expression.

[Some of the constellations of the Korean Peninsula are frustrated with the
Bald General of Justice.]
I never considered that he was an elder. Samyeongdang didn't know the
modern game terminology.

[In any case, I just have to kill all of them?]

"Yes, it is similar…"

[If that's the case, we'll be the winner! I am your helper!]

Samyeongdang started to run while wielding his bamboo stick.

[The game has started!]

Then the stage's shield was finally lifted.

[The stats of the players will be automatically adjusted based on the
difficulty of the game.]

[In the first round, all participants can only use 10% of their original stats.]

[This penalty will be reduced as the number of rounds increases.]

Then in our 'stairway to heaven' side, small angels resembling fairies started
to fly.

[The team's support group is created!]

[The low-grade angels are helping you!]

The surprised Osu barked at the angels.

"Hey! Don't bite them. They're on our side. Samyeongdang, wait! Let's go
together!"

It was a rollercoaster from the start. Samyeongdang was in the front line
and the Breaking the Sky Master and Osu started sprinting after him. Jang
Hayoung and I chased them while Han Myungoh was timid at the back of
the party.

"Department Head-nim, stay in the back as much as possible. Don't come
forward."

"…I will do my best!"

Han Myungoh was excellent at running away and would find a way no
matter what.

"Ah, the map changed?"

We left our main area and a vast plains area unfolded in front of us. Both
sides of the plains had a valley and forest respectively. If I remembered
correctly, there was the Apocalypse Imoogi on the valley side and the
Fallen Seraphim on the forest side. In addition, there were quite a number
of monsters that gave a buff effect if they were caught early in the map…

"Wait a minute! Samyeongdang! Don't go too fast!"

[Believe in me! I'm strong in a war!]

Samyeongdang let out a brilliant true voice and reached into the air.

[Fallen spirits of the Korean Peninsula! Give me the power to win!]

Who would give strength to Samyeongdang? Surprisingly, messages were
heard.

[The constellation 'Slumbering Lady of Fine Brocade' is supporting the
constellation 'Bald General of Justice'!]

[The constellation 'Last Hero of Hwangsanbeol' is cheering on the
constellation 'Bald General of Justice'!]
[The constellation 'King Heungmu the Great' has sponsored 100 coins to
the constellation 'Bald General of Justice'!] It was literally a simple cheer.

[Ohhhhhh!]

Soon after, the enemy appeared in front of him. Every constellation in an
incarnation body was holding a weapon.

[General of Vanara.]

[Poked Out His Eyes.]

[Thunder Eating Bird.]

There was a monstrous monkey dressed in armour with golden feathers. In
addition, King Oedipus whom I once met… the constellations were
encountered seemed to be from the Melledon Industrial Complex.

It was a party where narrative-grade constellations were mixed. However,
there was still a chance of winning because they had less insight into the
game.

[Come on, you barbarians!]

Samyeongdang discovered the enemies and made a sudden attack. His
voice was so loud that I felt some expectations for a moment.

Yes, I didn't know until I saw him fight. On the battlefield where only 10%
of stats could be used, I didn't know the strength of Samyeongdang. I
couldn't belittle a historical-grade constellation. There were strong people
like Cheok Jungyeong among them.

[This Guardian God of Victory will break down this battle formation!]
Samyeongdang swept the bamboo stick. The confused constellations
screamed and an explosion swept through the battlefield. Flesh scattered
everywhere. A weapon was broken. Blood scattered from a wound.

[The first death has occurred!]

Samyeongdang fought well. I looked around at the party members and cried
out, "Everyone, run away!"

[The helper 'Bald General of Justice' was defeated by the helper 'General of
Vanara.]

[The industrial complex 'Melledon' team has earned one point.]




"Shit, what was with that monk? Believe in him?"

Han Myungoh was the fastest when it came to running away. I thought it
would be like this but Samyeongdang wasn't just trolling.

[Samyeongdang's soul is roaming the battlefield.]

[Ohhhhh!]

The dead soul of Samyeongdang wandered around the battlefield and
attacked the constellations coming after us. It was thanks to this that we
found a chance to run away. However, the enemy's pursuit was fast.

The first one chasing us was a huge bird covering the sky. It was the
Thunder Eating Bird. If I remembered correctly, the bird's real name was
Garuda. He was the mount of Vishnu, one of the three lords of Vedas. His
beak changed trajectory in the air and turned towards me.
[The constellation 'Dog Who Threw Himself into the Flames' is throwing
his body to protect you!]

At this moment, Osu ran forward. He struck Garuda's big body from the
side.

Grrrr!

Fortunately, Osu clung onto the feathers of Garuda. Flames rose as Osu
barked at us to run away.

Bark bark! Bark! Yiiiip!

It was a situation where Osu was clinging to a constellation. It was too late
to save him.

[The helper 'Dog Who Threw Himself into the Flames' has died!]

…Dammit. The situation was getting worse. The Breaking the Sky Master
was nowhere to be seen. The people left were Jang Hayoung, Han
Myungoh and I.

"I-I'm sorry!"

Then Han Myungoh suddenly committed an abrupt act. Han Myungoh cut
off one of his legs.

[The character 'Han Myungoh' has activated 'One-Legged Swift Runner Lv.
10'.]

…Oh, Han Myungoh had that damn stigma. Han Myungoh started running
like an ostrich. Yes, it was all over if Han Myungoh so it was better for him
to run away. By the way, that skill had already reached level 10.

"Kim Dokja. Now what…?"
I blocked Jang Hayoung and immediately jumped into the surrounding
grass.

[You have concealed yourself in the nearby terrain.]

[The effect of the 'bush' means the enemies can't detect you.]

Grrrrrrr…

I looked up at Garuda and whispered to Jang Hayoung.

–We can't fight against them with our current power. We have to aim to win
by default due to the other players dropping out. It was important to buy
time.

–…Do you plan to consume time?

–For now.

There was something I believed in. It was strange since I thought I was
going to win with just this member. Somehow, I had to drag out the time a
bit more. At least, until he came.

[The Demon King of Salvation! Where are you?]

The true voice echoed in front of the bush.

[It has been a while since our ill-fated relationship. Fleeing fate and living
in a place like this… the blind prophet couldn't read it.]

The humble but arrogant way of speaking made me instantly aware of his
identity. After a while, the presence of King Oedipus, the blind and shrewd
king appeared in the forest. I knew he had participated in this selection.
However, I didn't expect to encounter him so quickly.

[You know that hiding is useless. This blind prophet already knows where
you are.]
The moment Jang Hayoung's shoulders flinched, I placed a finger to his
mouth.

–Don't worry. He can't read my future with his ability.

Thus, it was a clear trap. The moment we revealed ourselves, all the nearby
constellations would run.

[It isn't too late now. Olympus is still open to you.]

[The constellation 'Demon King of Salvation' says to go away and not
speak bullshit.]

[…How funny.]

King Oedipus laughed but his expression was completely stiff.

[I'll see if you can keep staying still.]

The surrounding constellations started to sweep through the bushes. Their
attacks were devastating as they used all types of explosions, acid and fire
to damage the nearby bushes. The acidic liquid melted my feet and burned
my neck and wrists. However, I held Jang Hayoung's wrists tightly and
didn't move.

A little bit more. Just a bit more.

The bombardment swept through the area. Fortunately, they didn't seem to
have found us. They started gradually moving away from us.

…Just a bit more. I listened to the sound and estimated their distance. 10
steps, 20 steps, 30 steps… Suddenly, all the explosions disappeared.

"Run."

Jang Hayoung and I ran out of the bush. We didn't see any constellations.
At this moment, a scream was heard out of nowhere. It was a long and
terrible scream. In the distant sky, a bird was falling down with a giant
sword through its neck.

[The helper 'Thunder Eating Bird' has been killed!]

…He came.
         Chapter 262: Ep. 49 - The Best at Something, IV


"…What?" The surprised Jang Hayoung's eyes widened.

"This is why I wanted to buy time."

[The participant 'Yoo Joonghyuk' has killed the helper 'Thunder Eating
Bird'!]

[The 'Yoo Joonghyuk - Kim Dokja' industrial complex has won one point.]

Yoo Joonghyuk falling through the air and the bewildered constellations
could be seen.

[The constellation 'Poked Out His Eyes' is crying out with surprise!]

[The constellation 'General of Vanara' is showing hostility towards Yoo
Joonghyuk!]

[Many constellations are amazed by Yoo Joonghyuk's movements.]
Yoo Joonghyuk wasn't panicked at all despite the attacks. His movements
seemed like he had grasped all the terrain features of this place. By the time
the furious King Oedipus swung his staff, Yoo Joonghyuk had already
disappeared.

[Where did you go?]

[Find him! He is near here!]

The constellations moved and searched around but they couldn't find where
Yoo Joonghyuk had disappeared to. I hid behind a tree with Jang Hayoung
and watched the scene.

One of Yoo Joonghyuk's attributes was 'Pro Gamer'. This guy received an
overwhelming advantage and adaptability in all games. This game was still
in the early stages and stats were limited.

Before the constellations were accustomed to the game, this 'first round'
was a better stage for us than anyone else. The opponents might be
constellations but it wasn't easy for them to face off against the current Yoo
Joonghyuk.

[There he is!]

The General of Vanara let out a wind blade from his mouth towards a bush
and shouted. There was a loud noise and the surrounding terrain was cut.
However, this time, Yoo Joonghyuk wasn't present. The confused General
of Vanara retreated and a flash of light emerged from the dirt on the
ground. It was too late to avoid it.

[The participant 'Yoo Joonghyuk' has killed the helper 'General of Vanara!]

Yes, Yoo Joonghyuk should catch at least two.

[The 'Yoo Joonghyuk - Kim Dokja' industrial complex has won two points.]
[The participant 'Yoo Joonghyuk' has started to blow blood onto the
battlefield!]

Jang Hayoung pointed towards Yoo Joonghyuk and shivered. "What is
this? A monster?"

"It is similar. He is the best pro gamer in South Korea."

I was talking about the setting of Ways of Survival. In the distance, the
General of Vanara's body was split in half and he disappeared. The rules of
the game were applied so he wouldn't really die, but the mental damage was
significant.

[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' is pleased.]

[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' has sponsored 20,000
coins to the incarnation 'Yoo Joonghyuk'.]

The true name of the General of Vanara was Hanuman, a monkey hero of
Indian mythology. Due to the characteristic of both being monkeys, the two
constellations didn't have a good relationship with each other. I guess it was
true.

[Shit, chase him!]

Yoo Joonghyuk killed two people and hid in the rocky gorge this time.
Then one more enemy appeared.

[The constellation 'Founder of Humanity' wants to show an example to his
arrogant descendant.]

The constellation who was close to a primitive man. The Founder of
Humanity, Manu. I forgot that he was on the side fo the Melledon Industrial
Complex.

"Maybe we should help."
Manu of Vedas was a narrative-level constellation. He might be low in
level among the narrative-grade constellations but it was absolutely
disadvantageous for Yoo Joonghyuk.

Yoo Joonghyuk had already consumed a lot of mobility and magic power
killing two constellations. He might have the attribute of Pro Gamer but it
was too much for him from now on…

[The participant 'Yoo Joonghyuk' has activated the 'Sentinel Golem's
Blessing!']

Yoo Joonghyuk stood on a rocky highland area and aimed a giant bow.

[The star relic 'Robin Hood's Strongbow' has maximized the user's
accuracy!]

This bastard, when did he get this? It was something that could only be
obtained from the 15th scenario area, Lugratia. Intangible arrows flew
towards the body of King Oedipus.

[Keok…!]

Of course, Yoo Joonghyuk's advantage wasn't only swordsmanship. This
guy could use all types of weapons with the Weapons Mastery skill.

[You! You're not a closer range damage dealer?]

In addition, Yoo Joonghyuk's position was 'all-rounder'.

[The participant 'Yoo Joonghyuk' will receive the position compensation
effect.]

While this game was in progress, Yoo Joonghyuk wouldn't be penalized for
using any types of weapons.

[I will kill you! This thing, this thing…!]
King Oedipus screamed as holes were drilled into his body.

"We should go help!"

"Wait a minute."

Making clumsy movements in the current circumstances would only hinder
Yoo Joonghyuk.

Immediately after launching Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint, Yoo
Joonghyuk's operation flowed into my head like a movie trailer.

Jang Hayoung frowned at my flippant smile and asked, "…What is it?"

"That bastard is scarier than I thought."

Yoo Joonghyuk didn't waste a single second when he came here. The
evidence was the Sentinel Golem's Blessing that was embedded in his body.

[The Sentinel Golem's Blessing has started to accumulate!]

The sentinel golem inhabited the outskirts of the gorge and gave a 'fainting'
buff effect. However, this buff had one condition. The person had to
succeed in 20 attacks before the 'fainting' effect was produced. Now there
were approximately 10 meters between Yoo Joonghyuk and King Oedipus.

[This thing, this thing…!]

King Oedipus jumped and tried to aim for Yoo Joonghyuk. King Oedipus'
body hardened from the ankle and he collapsed like a stone statue.

[The helper 'Poked Out His Eyes' has fainted.]

The duration of the fainting was three seconds. These three seconds were
enough time for Yoo Joonghyuk.
[The participant 'Yoo Joonghyuk' has killed the helper 'Poked Out His
Eyes'!]

[The name of the participant 'Yoo Joonghyuk' is widely circulated on the
battlefield!]

[The 'Yoo Joonghyuk - Kim Dokja' industrial complex has won three
points.] Three… I honestly admired him. The appearance of the dying King
Oedipus was unrealistic. It was hard to believe he was the constellation who
threatened me at the constellation banquet.

[Impertinent fellow!]

However, the fight hadn't ended yet. Before Yoo Joonghyuk could sigh, the
excited Founder of Humanity rushed forward. Yoo Joonghyuk was now
lacking physical strength and magic power.

The Primitive Spear belonging to the Founder of Humanity dug into a gap
that Yoo Joonghyuk revealed. It looked similar to a stone tool but the
power it contained was enormous.

On the other hand, Yoo Joonghyuk was also tough. He twisted his back
with a flexible motion and at nearly the same time, he swung his weapon.
The spear collided with the sword and a sharp sound was heard. The
distinctive yellow aura that was only for transcendents was wrapped around
Yoo Joonghyuk's Black Heavenly Demon Sword. It opposed the blue
'status' woven around the Primitive Spear wielded by Manu.

[These martial arts! They were skills left behind by worms. It still seems
useful.]

It was a situation where participants could only use 10% of their power.
Manu seemed unable to accurately determine the amount of force he could
control. There were dozens of exchanges in a flash and Manu laughed like
he was having fun.
[You are pretty good human. I have seen countless transcendents but none
as strong as you.]

"You haven't seen my master."

A power similar to martial arts emerged from Manu's spear. Manu had
mastered almost every type of talent that a human could gain. Originally,
the present Yoo Joonghyuk wouldn't be able to defeat Manu. Still, the
balance of power was even because Manu hadn't fought such a long battle
for a long time.

[How interesting! I haven't competed with more than 10 blows since
becoming a constellation!]

The forcible equilibrium balance maintained this confrontation. I grabbed
Jang Hayoung who was about to pop out.

"That jerk will die if this continues!"

The same thing would happen even if we popped out. I wanted to use
Electrification to run out and cut off Manu's neck.

However, I had to endure it for now. If it turned out like I thought, Yoo
Joonghyuk would soon welcome an opportunity. All I needed was time.
Just time.

"Jang Hayoung, send a message through the wall."

"What? To who?"

"The Founder of Humanity."

"Huh? The guy currently fighting with Yoo Joonghyuk? Ah…!"

The clever Jang Hayoung realized what I was planning. Jang Hayoung
turned on the Unidentified Wall and wrote a message. Soon after, Manu's
baffled voice rang out.
[What? These messages…!]

I didn't need to ask to know the situation that Manu was facing now.
Perhaps countless messages sent by the '15 year old schoolgirl' were
popping up like pop-up windows in his field of view.

[These ridiculous tactics!]

Manu hesitated and a white light started to emerge from Yoo Joonghyuk's
body. I had seen this bright light before. It happened when Jung Heewon
evolved to the Judge of Destruction. Then when Lee Hyunsung learnt Great
Mountain Smash…

[The character 'Yoo Joonghyuk' has reached the moment of attribute
evolution!]

[The attribute 'Pro Gamer' of the character Yoo Joonghyuk has evolved!]

Attribute evolution. Finally, Yoo Joonghyuk's second attribute had come to
full bloom. Manu rushed forward and wielded his spear. At the same time,
the dazzling light burst from Yoo Joonghyuk's body.

I watched the fascinating scene and recalled what Lee Jihye said in the
latter half of Ways of Survival.

「 "Master has countless attributes. Hmm…the best is naturally Regressor.
Other than that, Master of the Panacea and Enemy of Gods and Demons are
excellent… huh? Which one is the most envious attribute? Ahaha, it is
naturally…" 」

Manu's spearsmanship swept over Yoo Joonghyuk in vain.

「 "The Ruler of Amusement. It is that." 」

Yoo Joonghyuk slowly opened his eyes as he made the same expression I
had constantly read about.
「 At that moment, Yoo Joonghyuk seemed to understand everything about
this game. 」

Perhaps in Yoo Joonghyuk's eyes, all of Manu's attacks looked like a
combination of 0s and 1s.

It was the legendary attribute, Ruler of Amusement. As long as this stage
was a 'game', Yoo Joonghyuk was closer to a deity than any other
constellation in the world.
          Chapter 263: Ep. 49 - The Best at Something, V


Yoo Joonghyuk's attribute evolved and the game flowed smoothly like
water.

[The participant 'Yoo Joonghyuk' has killed the helper 'Founder of
Humanity'!]

[The participant 'Yoo Joonghyuk' has won the 'Living Legend' title!]

The constellations hadn't yet adapted to the game and weren't able to follow
Yoo Joonghyuk's movements. The constellations were inferior to Yoo
Joonghyuk in terms of utilizing game items, understanding the terrain and
the extra buffs.

[The participant 'Yoo Joonghyuk' has started to write a new myth on this
Mythical Battlefield!]

[The participant 'Yoo Joonghyuk' is raising his name in the rankings of the
Mythical Battlefield!]
Victory or defeat was decided in an instant.

[The time limit for the first game is over!]

[The winning team will be determined based on the pointed obtained during
the time limit!]

[The winning team of the first game is the 'Yoo Joonghyuk - Kim Dokja
Industrial Complex'.]

We got a total of six points. In addition, the sentence we took away from
the opposing team meant we had two sentences.

『 The flower of the story blooms in the cruel Demon Territory. 』

Jang Hayoung stared at the sentence we had obtained several times before
looking up blankly. "…We really won?"

"Yes."

I also didn't feel it was real. No matter the situation, we obtained the first
victory against the mighty constellation… it wasn't a level to be elated by
the fact that things went 'as planned'.

[The demon king 'Devil of Lust and Wrath' is looking at you with interest.]

[Many constellations are cheering for the Yoo Joonghyuk - Kim Dokja
Industrial Complex!]

[You have obtained 100,000 coins each as a reward for the first game!]

I was able to see Yoo Joonghyuk approaching from a distance. I wanted to
say something nice but Yoo Joonghyuk opened his mouth first. "The
messages were sent by this person."

Before I could ask what he was talking about, Biyoo popped out of Yoo
Joonghyuk's arms.
[Baaat!]

Biyoo seemed invigorated as she swung the Uriel doll like it was a toy.

[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' insists that she didn't do
anything!]

Biyoo threw the doll into the air and entered my arms. I stroked her head a
few days before asking Yoo Joonghyuk, who had grabbed the doll.

"Where the hell did you go?"

"I went to the vicinity of Melledon."

"Why there…?"

"There was an item I had to obtain."

"Item? What is it?"

"You don't need to know." Yoo Joonghyuk's expression was somewhat
dissatisfied as he stared at me. "In addition… I thought it would be helpful
to start at an unexpected position for the selection."

"It was a good judgment."

In the first round, the spawn location different depending on where you
were when the game started. Yoo Joonghyuk hadn't departed from the same
place as us and was able to farm items using a completely different route.
This made it easier for him to aim at the enemies.

[Hahaha, something amazing happened. However, the game isn't over until
it ends!]

I heard Bihyung's voice from the air. His expression seemed somewhat
excited because we won.
[5 minutes later, the second game will start!]

It wasn't the time to be drunk on victory. This game had a total of three
rounds. I looked over at my weary party members. The bodies of the dead
Samyeongdang and Osu were revived again.

"Now we just need to win one more time. The game is over if we win two
rounds first. So everyone, just try a bit harder…"

I tried to cheer them up but the condition of my party members wasn't good.

"Samyeongdang, why do you look like that?"

Samyeongdang had turned into a wooden gong and was making a rattling
sound.

[That… I spent too much of my probability.]

In this game, death didn't mean the disappearance of the incarnation body.
However, the thing that remained unchanged was the number of resources
consumed.

"Osu?"

Yiiip!

Just like Samyeongdang, Osu died in the last game and he was now almost
as small as a guinea pig. It seemed they had overconsumed their probability
and energy in the last game. The constellations of the same rank had
significant differences in level due to the quantity and quality of their
accumulated stories.

It was Han Myungoh who opened his mouth. "I-I can't do it anymore."

Han Myungoh had run away safely until the end of the first game. He was
like a lizard as his cut off leg slowly grew. Nevertheless, his face had aged
10 years during this short period.
"It's fine. You've worked hard."

No matter how much their power was suppressed, the opponents were still
constellations. He had faced the status of a constellation for more than an
hour and any normal incarnation would collapse.

The small consolation was that the Breaking the Sky Master was unharmed.

Woof woof!

In the first game, the Breaking the Sky Master helped Yoo Joonghyuk hunt
one of the constellations. Me, Yoo Joonghyuk, Jang Hayoung and the
Breaking the Sky Master. Now there were only the four of us in the team.
Understandably, four wasn't enough to win the game.

Then Yoo Joonghyuk opened his mouth. "I will try to call additional
power."

"Do you have any constellations?"

"I don't know if reinforcements will come in time. I'll just put them on the
list for now."

I had no idea of who he would call. Did Yoo Joonghyuk have any
connections during this period?

Yoo Joonghyuk continued talking, "We have to change our plan in the
second round. Our positions as well."

"Why? Can't we do it like the last round?"

At Jang Hayoung's question, Yoo Joonghyuk glanced at me and silently
shook his head. I ended up answering instead. "Yoo Joonghyuk's attribute is
powerful but it isn't invincible."

"…It seems almost invincible."
"It was because the constellations didn't know much about this game."

From the second round, the penalty on stats would be slightly released. The
constellations who had looked down on us would start to collect attributes
and skills related to the game and would narrow the gap using an enormous
amount of coins. Yoo Joonghyuk might have Ruler of Amusement but there
was a limit to him alone.

I pondered for a moment before declaring to the party members. "I have an
idea."




"We have decided to cooperate with the Bercan Industrial Complex."

[…Are you telling me to join forces with Papyrus?]

"It isn't the time to cover hot water with cold water."

A deep sigh emerged from Duke Melledon who resembled a rhinoceros. All
the constellations on the battlefield had been destroyed by a single
incarnation. They were caught off guard and hit in the back or had a sword
piercing their feet. There were even constellations who fought against him
one on one and were defeated.

"We can't let them win this time. You should know this."

[Don't worry. I was careless in the last round but this time will be different.]

Founder of Humanity, Manu gritted his teeth as he raised the Primitive
Spear.

[I have learnt enough about this game.]

In fact, messages had been coming from the air for a long time.
[The constellation 'Founder of Humanity' has purchased the 'Special Game
Talent' skill!]

[The constellation 'Thunder Eating Bird' has purchased the 'One Week
Game Master' item!]

The dokkaebis were grinning widely at the suddenly buying binge.

[Oh my, constellations! Going to this extent…]

The constellations didn't like this expression on the dokkaebis but the more
important thing was their pride, which had been crushed by the incarnation.
[Let's go.]

The game started and the constellations moved in unison. The influence of
the attributes and items was great. They used the terrain to cover their
actions and were fully aware of how their stigmas and skills were applied to
this game.

The all-rounder of the team was the incomprehensible incarnation. If they
killed him, the game would end.

[Over there.]

The Thunder Eating Bird glide and created strong winds. Amidst the
windswept bushes, the owner of the sword was revealed. It was Yoo
Joonghyuk.

"Now!"

The moment that Duke Melledon gave the signal, four constellations rushed
at once.

[It will be different from before!]

The Founder of Humanity swung his spear, followed by a ray from King
Oedipus. Yoo Joonghyuk couldn't avoid the attack and blood flowed from
his forearm. The shadow of General of Vanara split up and pursued the gap
revealed by Yoo Joonghyuk. A sharp rod brushed past Yoo Joonghyuk's
side. There was the sound of flesh being hit.

Now the power of the constellations was limited to 30%. That damage that
Yoo Joonghyuk received was different from before. However, Yoo
Joonghyuk held up well despite the constellations' onslaught.

[…What? Why isn't he dead?]

Duke Melledon felt it was strange and used a skill to figure out Yoo
Joonghyuk's physical state. Surprisingly, Yoo Joonghyuk still had more
than 70% of his health remaining.

"T-This guy's health is a bit strange. Don't tell me…!"

Then the screams of the constellations were heard from the rear.




The enemies probably believed that Yoo Joonghyuk was an all-rounder.

"Breaking the Sky Master!"

The Breaking the Sky Master flew forward at my signal. Like a spear of
light dividing the space, the Breaking the Sky Master penetrated the torso
of the Thunder Eating Bird who was aiming at Yoo Joonghyuk. The
battered bird fell down and the Breaking the Sky Master tore at the bird's
torso with her fangs.

As soon as our position was exposed, the nearby constellations started to
run this way. There were a total of three constellations rushing over. The
long distance damage dealer Jang Hayoung received an agility penalty so
there was no chance of winning when it was close combat. Even so, the
situation was different this time.

"Kim Dokja, buy me 10 seconds."

"Understood."

Jang Hayoung took a stance, his left hand forward while his right fist was
pulled back to his shoulder as he started gathering strength.

[Jang Hayoung has used the points earned to unseal a specific skill.]

[The helper 'Jang Hayoung' is preparing the ultimate.]

In this game, stigmas and skills over a certain power level were treated as
'ultimate'. In addition, the ultimate could only be released with points
obtained in the game. Jang Hayoung used the points we had just earned as
an assistant.

[The helper 'Jang Hayoung' has activated Breaking the Sky Force Punch
Lv. 10!]

There was the sound of a cannon bursting and a mighty wind was created as
Jang Hayoung's fist tore through the space. The wind crushed the ray of
light
coming from King Oedipus and blew away two of the running
constellations.

Breaking the Sky Force Punch. I had seen it in Ways of Survival. It was a
technique made out of boredom by the Breaking the Sky Sword Saint who
pursued the path of the sword.

…I didn't know she could make such a powerful technique when bored.

[The helper 'Jang Hayoung' has killed the helper 'Thunder Eating Bird'!]

[The helper 'Jang Hayoung' has neutralized the helper 'General of Vanara'!]
I thought it would be a success just defeating one constellation. Yet one
constellation died and one suffered a fatal wound.

"Didn't I say that I was a hard worker?"

Jang Hayoung laughed despite obviously overdoing it. Even Jang Hayoung
would find it hard to achieve such rapid growth. Maybe he made a deal
with the Unidentified Wall.

[Kill him!]

The enraged constellations ran in a messy manner. Jang Hayoung also ran
towards them.

"Kim Dokja! Go! Do it according to the plan!"

If I tried to save Jang Hayoung here, the time would be delayed. This time,
it was me who had the 'sentence'. Shortly after I ran towards the gorge, a
scream was heard from behind me.

[The helper 'Breaking the Sky Master' has been killed!]

[The helper 'Jang Hayoung' has been killed!]

…Shit. Fortunately, Yoo Joonghyuk was still in good shape. Whether he
was a tanker or all-rounder, Yoo Joonghyuk was Yoo Joonghyuk.

I went down to the bottom of the canyon and dark fog started to pour into
the vicinity. I had calculated this. If the fog had begun, the 'monster' would
soon appear here.

Then a constellation was felt from above the rocky terrain.

[You are quick, Demon King of Salvation.]
It was an unexpected move. Melledon's side should be tied up with Yoo
Joonghyuk. How did they already reach here? The moment I saw the
shadow on the canyon rocks, I realized what happened.

There was the shadow of a giant mummy and a goddess with a pointed
scorpion tail. They were constellations of the Bercan who hadn't been seen
in the last game.

'The Last Pharaoh' Cleopatra and the 'Scorpion Goddess' Serket…

Surprisingly, King Oedipus of the Melledon camp could also be seen. I
smiled bitterly. "…I see. You have decided to join forces?"

Serket's tail swelled up and fired a stinger towards me. I was about to avoid
the attack when old bandages released by the Last Pharaoh wrapped around
my ankles. Close range damage dealers were vulnerable to long range
damage dealers. My movements were limited so it was obvious that I would
die like this.

King Oedipus seemed ready to finish things. I reflexively curled up. A
powerful storm swept over my body.

I could hear the laughter of the constellations. It was a laugh that was
convinced of my death from this blow.

[You have converted the points won in the last game!]

[You have unlocked a certain skill with the points!]

I slowly raised my body in the dust. The laughter disappeared from the
constellations' faces as they saw me.

[The constellation 'Poked Out His Eyes' is astonished!]

[The constellation 'Scorpion Goddess' has wide eyes!]

The white fur wrapped around me protected me without a single scratch.
[The exclusive skill 'Bookmark' has been activated!]

It had been a long time since I used the third bookmark. I had been hesitant
to use this bookmark for quite some time. I didn't think it was polite to my
dokkaebi.

[Your understanding of this person is very high and the skill abilities are
strengthened!]

[The exclusive skill 'Beast King's Sensitivity Lv. 10 (+1)' has been
activated.]

I felt the warm of Biyoo curled up in my arms. The third bookmark, Beast
Master Shin Yoosung. I looked up at the constellations on the canyon with
the white fur wrapped around me.

[The participant 'Demon King of Salvation' will receive the position
compensation effect.]

I didn't have the same attack power as Yoo Joonghyuk. Nor could I learn
things quickly like Jang Hayoung. However, I had something better than
them.

"I'm sorry but I'm the all-rounder in this game."

The Demon King Selection would end in the second round.
                Chapter 264: Ep. 50 - Dokja's Story, I


"The fourth bookmark."

[The exclusive skill 'Way of the Wind Lv. 11 (+1) is activated!]

I avoided the flying sting of the Scorpion Goddess. If the strength of her
body hadn't been suppressed, the poison would've vaporized the whole area.
However, it was fine since I had Way of the Wind.

I stepped on the melted gorge and release the Purest Sword Force. My
sword cut the bandages of the Last Pharaoh. The moment my sword hit the
bandages, there was the sound of a drum beat. King Oedipus didn't miss
this gap and flew forward.

[The exclusive skill 'Beast King's Sensitivity Lv. 10 (+1)' has been
activated.]

Normally, this was an impossible fight. Originally, only one bookmark
could be used at a time.
[The effect of 'Looked into the Abyss' has improved all your skills!]
[Currently, two bookmarks are being used at the same time.]

[The duration of Bookmark is reduced by half.]

All my skills had improved since the last time I checked my Attributes
Window.

"The fifth bookmark!"

[The exclusive skill 'Electrification' Lv. 12 (+2) has been activated.]

I became smaller through Miniaturization. Then I turned into a point of
light and penetrated the torso of the Last Pharaoh. The Last Pharaoh
suffered a fatal wound and collapsed to the ground with a scream.

I was fighting with the history I had built up. The things I read. The times I
had lived. Everything that I had. How many more flashes of light were seen
and how much blood was spilled?

King Oedipus opened his mouth and spoke in a slightly weary tone. [Great,
Demon King of Salvation.]

"…"

[Honestly, I didn't think you would be this strong.]

Nevertheless, there wasn't a look of defeat on his face. Shadows flocked to
the top of the gorge. They were the other constellations belonging to
Melledon and Bercan.

Duke Bercan.

Mysterious Bird of the Nile.

Supreme God of Light.
…

The number of constellations that appeared was close to 10. They looked
down here from the high cliff of the gorge. I was stifled by the presence of
the constellations but I didn't back down.

"Are you just going to watch from there?"

Rather, I raised the 'status' that was sleeping inside me. I was also a
constellation. I didn't lose to them in terms of 'status'. Some of the
constellations were crushed by the status I released and stumbled back.
However, it wasn't everyone.

[You're an interesting child.]

All of a sudden, some of the constellations on top of the canyon bowed and
retreated. Someone was approaching from among the constellations.

His long, golden hair waved every time he took a step and his four arms
drew a beautiful rainbow. The third eye on his forehead looked down here
like the sun coming out.

[Mithra was trying to get his own holiday off so I was wondering what type
of person you were.]

His blinding appearance made his modifier obvious.

'The Supreme God of Light'.

I even knew his true name. "Surya."

Dazzling sparks appeared when I mentioned his real name. It was a sight
that attested to the status of the name.

[Kid, do you know my name?]

"I know."
The nebula Vedas had eight great Lokapala. They were the guardians of the
eight cardinal directions, including north, south, east and west.

"Surya of the southwest."

Surya was one of the eight Lokapala.

[The constellation 'Mass Production Maker' is frowning.]

[The constellation 'Goddess of Love and Beauty' is accusing the 'Supreme
God of Light'!]

[The constellation 'Queen of the Darkest Spring' is pointing out that this
behaviour doesn't fit the status of the Supreme God of Light!]

He was a powerful being equal to the 12 gods of Olympus. This presence
was staring at me.

[If so, you know that you can't win this game.]

The status of over 1,000 years emerged from his body and I suppressed the
desire to step back. He wasn't a constellation I could fight against. Lokapala
Surya was different from King Oedipus and Cleopatra, who were humans
that became constellations.

[Come to Vedas. You will die even if you win this game.]

"I don't want to."

[You don't know the world that will appear after the giant story. Do you
think you can stand against that power alone? It isn't a story that only one
star can afford.]

I knew what he was saying. Perhaps the world that Surya saw was different
from the world that I saw. Just by obtaining a single 'giant story', the level
of the world that the constellation could perceive was entirely different.
"Nope, I can afford it. I'm not alone."

[The possibility of a new story is germinated!]

The 73rd Demon Realm wriggled as if in response to my words. Surya felt
the vibrations and said, [You aren't alone… how funny. Who is with you
now?]

"A person who is more familiar with the cause and effect law than anyone
else is saying this… it is truly ridiculous."

A powerful storm started to flow from Surya's incarnation body. The
constellations around him turned pale. Still, he couldn't exercise all his
power in this game, no matter his status. Sparks burst out in a dazzling
manner.

In this game, Melledon had won two points. These two points might be able
to free one of Surya's stigmas. I couldn't let that happen. As I moved, the
constellations blocked my way.

A fist containing the power of Electrification struck the face of the
constellations. The Broken Heart of a Young Gold Dragon repeatedly
pumped and created a massive amount of magic power.

I didn't hesitate to release this strength. A little more, just a bit more. I had
to draw my magic power to the limits.

The constellations couldn't cope with the power of Electrification and fell
down while bleeding. It was a transcendent power that could even destroy
constellations. The white lightning burnt the bodies of the constellations.

[The participant 'Demon King of Salvation' has killed the helper 'Scorpion
Goddess'!]

[The participant 'Demon King of Salvation' has killed the helper 'The Last
Pharaoh'!]
The broken heart of the gold dragon couldn't afford the magic power and
the energy in my body suddenly fell sharply. I gritted my teeth and moved.
I dealt a blow to Duke Bercan and immediately turned my back to him,
striking a blow to the Mysterious Bird of the Nile.

[You are overly affected by the character!]

[The excessive use of Bookmark can leave a permanent injury on your
soul!]

Meanwhile, the Supreme God of Light wasn't perplexed at all as he saw me
moving closer.

[I have watched you for a long time. You always borrow the power of other
beings.]

The Beast King's Sensitivity wrapped around my body while I prepared to
deal a blow with Electrification.

[From the first scenario to the present, you have never fought with your
own power. Do you really think you can build up your own story?]

[The history that you've learnt is just history that came from stealing.]

It felt like I was facing hard steel. The Supreme God of Light used only one
of his four arms to block the blow from Electrification.

[It isn't yours.]

The third eye of the god shone as brightly as the sun. At that moment, I
realized what stigma Surya had released.

[The constellation 'Supreme God of Light' is invoking the 'Third Eye'.]

My vision distorted and all the light around me disappeared. In the
darkness, I felt the edge of this space gradually crumbling.
[There is no 'you' in your story.]

Everything around me was already Surya's space.

[You will die alone.]

The Third Eye had the power to control time and space. It was the power of
Surya's Third Eye. I was confused because I didn't think Surya would use
this power so quickly.

How could I get out of here? It wasn't possible to use Electrification and
Way of the Wind.

[The legendary story 'Distorting Things as One Pleases' has activated!]

I didn't know what to read. King of a Kingless World wasn't suitable.
Person who Opposes the Miracle was also ambiguous. The same was true
for One Who Hunted the King of Disasters.

The space was now reduced to one square meter. What should I do?

[The story 'Distorting Things as One Pleases' is screaming.]

My back was tingling when I heard a sound. It sounded familiar, as if
someone was eating a story.

「 De li cious food. 」

I looked back and a small mouth was stuck to my back, eating my story.

「 Kim Dok ja is a fo ol. 」

It was the Fourth Wall. This bastard wasn't going to help me? The torn
apart 'Distorting Things as One Pleases' was now nearly useless and was
entering its stomach.
I forgot the urgency and shouted at the absurd situation. By the way, the
thing that came out of my mouth wasn't a yell.

「 The Fourth Wall said, "Ku waa aaah!" 」

An explosive burst of sound poured into the surrounding space. The space
trembled like it was a living creature and a gigantic crack formed.

[The stigma 'The Third Eye' is shuddering.]

I realized what was going on. The Third Eye was a mental ability that
controlled time and space by manipulating cognition. The Fourth Wall was
the strongest skill I had in regards to a mental barrier.

[The constellation 'Supreme God of Light' is astonished!]

The darkness collapsed like glass breaking. Once the light returned, the first
thing I saw was tears coming from the eye on the forehead of the Supreme
God of Light.

[You… what are you?]

The astonished true voice resonated and the other constellations hurriedly
rushed towards me.

[You dare… die!]

My magic power was at the bottom. I didn't have enough power to open
Bookmark again. Nevertheless, it wasn't necessary anymore. It had been 20
minutes since the game started.

[The fog of the gorge is thickening.]

There was a groan from somewhere in the gorge and the movements of the
constellations stopped. The nervous constellations looked at the top of the
gorge and a dark shadow fell towards this side.
I nervously slid down a rocky wall. It had been a long time since I saw
something like this. The length was five kilometers. The body with a
circumference of over 10 meters was falling towards the ground along with
the collapsed upper part of the gorge. The constellations let out warning
signals but the large ones were crushed under the scales of the giant
monster.

[The helper 'Mysterious Bird of the Nile' has been killed by the 'Apocalypse
Imoogi'.]

The monster burst like a bug and coiled up in the gorge, crying towards the
air. The Apocalypse Imoogi. It was the name of the monster I had been
waiting for.

[Damn! Don't back down!]

The constellations were overwhelmed by the sudden disaster and started
attacking with their stigmas. The one who killed the monster could get a
powerful team buff.

However, there was no way I could knock it down. According to Ways of
Survival, the Red Dragon of the Apocalypse who appeared in Armageddon
had the fearsome power to blow up a third of the stars in the sky with a
single tail.

[Kuaaack!]

Of course, this imoogi wasn't at the level of the Red Dragon of the
Apocalypse but there were no constellations who could deal with this
monster at the beginning of the game.

[Kueeeeok!]

The constellations screamed as they were torn apart by the teeth of the
imoogi while those struck by the tail were blown away. The unstoppable
system messages were signalling the devastation of the gorge.
In a moment, seven participants and helpers died in the gorge. The
surviving constellations escaped from the gorge using the sacrifice of other
constellations.

Surya's cold voice echoed through the gorge. [You have a wicked trick up
your sleeve. However, you won't be able to make it.]

The Apocalypse Imoogi struck the constellations and was now looking at
me. A red sphere gathered at its mouth in order to dissolve the last insect.
The red flames of the apocalypse. It was the fire of judgment that could
melt everything on the ground.

The plan was okay. Melledon and Bercan suffered deadly damage and the
disadvantage of the game was now balanced to an almost equal level.

…I would've liked to have a bit more strength left. My death here meant we
would be deprived of our sentences. I felt regret and emptiness. If we went
to the third game… was there a chance for us to win?

My eyes slowly closed as dark red flames headed towards my head. The
waves of heat enveloped my body and there was the sizzling sound of rocks
melting. Still, I didn't die no matter how much time passed.

[A new helper has been summoned to the game!]

I opened my eyes and saw someone in front of me. He wore a neat
commando uniform. The soldier with the special forces mark on his
shoulder was blocking the flames with a huge shield.

[The constellation 'Master of Steel' is looking at you.]

He had endured even the hottest Hell Flames Ignition.

"A captain of South Korea's special operations command…"
I watched the trembling man swallowing and sighed. 'How' or 'why'. I
wanted to ask but didn't say anything. Numerous voices were pouring
towards me through Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint and all my words were
pointless.

Afterwards, a giant 'chimera dragon' was seen falling from the sky.

[A new helper has been summoned to the game!]

I saw the little girl sitting on the head of the dragon and funnily enough, felt
a bit tearful.

"Ahjussi!"

The helpers that Yoo Joonghyuk called finally reached the battlefield.
               Chapter 265: Ep. 50 - Dokja's Story, II


There were a total of three 'reinforcements' that Yoo Joonghyuk invited.
Beast Master Shin Yoosung, Steel Sword Lee Hyunsung and…

"Hyunsung-ssi! Please take Dokja-ssi out of here!"

Ariadne's web shot through the air and placed me on Lee Hyunsung's back.
A woman in a cat suit was running through the sky with the Hermes
Walking Method. It was the incarnation of Olympus, Yoo Sangah.

"Yoosung, fire the breath from a long distance! Continue until Hyunsung-
ssi leaves!"

The chimera dragon roared and fired a breath. The Apocalypse Imoogi
screamed like it was quite painful.

[The constellation 'Master of Steel' has given a great probability to his
incarnation.]
[The constellation 'Abandoned Lover of the Labyrinth' is supporting her
incarnation.]

[The constellation 'Master of the Skywalk' is supporting his incarnation.]

The constellations supporting Lee Hyunsung and Yoo Sangah seemed to be
struggling. Thanks to Yoo Sangah's commands, I was forcibly carried on
Lee Hyunsung's shoulder.

"…Lee Hyunsung-ssi."

"Stay still, Dokja-ssi."

"You don't have to do this. I can move now."

Lee Hyunsung didn't loosen his hard arms at my words. The only thing he
did was silently climb the gorge. Once the top of the gorge could be seen,
Lee Hyunsung opened his mouth. "Dokja-ssi, have you ever thrown a
grenade?"

"…Grenade?"

"To use a grenade, you have to go through three steps. Remove the safety
clip, remove the safety pin and throw it.

"I know because I've thrown it in the training camp."

"Then you know how important the safety pin is for a grenade."

I realized what Lee Hyunsung was trying to say.

"I lost the safety pin."

"…Wasn't it the bullet shell last time?"

"I thought that I shouldn't lose it again." Lee Hyunsung turned his head and
looked back at me. "Once the safety pin is inserted, it must be done well."
Soon after, we reached the top of the gorge. At the bottom, Yoo Sangah and
Shin Yoosung were riding the chimera dragon out of the gorge. I saw Shin
Yoosung's brightly smiling face and my heart felt complicated. "Hyunsung-
ssi."

"…Yes."

I knew what Lee Hyunsung wanted to say. He had been a soldier all his life
so this was the only way he could express it.

"Thank you for coming."

I heard a sniffling sound but pretended not to know anything. After a while,
something rolled like an acorn and crashed into my leg.

"Ahjussi!"

She hugged my tattered leg like it was precious.

"It's been a while, Yoosung."

Shin Yoosung nodded vigorously when her face against my coat. I patted
Shin Yoosung's back while Yoo Sangah approached. "It has been a long
time, Dokja-ssi."

"Yes. Have you been well?"

Well, it was a stupid question. Since the scenario started, no one could be
well.

"You are the same, Dokja-ssi."

Yoo Sangah's smile wasn't false. Before the destruction of the world and
after the destruction, Yoo Sangah was the only one who laughed at my
jokes.

"The others…"
"Only we came. Heewon-ssi and the kids wanted to come as well but…"

"I tossed the coin with Lee Gilyoung and won!"

Shin Yoosung interrupted with a laugh. I see. My life was decided by
throwing a coin. I stroked Shin Yoosung's head and said, "Thank you Yoo
Sangah-ssi."

"I was just thinking about going. There was a bad sign from Dokja-ssi's
Good or Bad Luck, Disaster or Happiness Fortune.

"Good or Bad Luck, Disaster or Happiness Fortune?"

I knew this skill. There was only one constellation on the Korean Peninsula
who had it.

"Yes, it showed 'great misfortune'. Sooyoung and I were wondering about
who should go when Yoo Joonghyuk contacted us…"

I roughly understood what was going on. I didn't think Han Sooyoung and
Yoo Sangah would throw a coin so… Yoo Sangah probably came because
Han Sooyoung had a problem. Han Sooyoung seemed to be doing well with
the job I entrusted to her.

"Sooyoung-ssi also wanted to come."

"Ah… yes. Indeed."

It was a lie. She disliked me.

Then there was a rumbling sound from a bush. I was so excited to meet my
companions again that I forgot the game wasn't over. I rushed through the
forest area with the group and asked, "Are you aware of the situation?"

Yoo Sangah nodded. "I heard the story from Bihyung."
Yoo Joonghyuk might be playing in the tanker position with Ruler of
Amusement but by now, his health would've almost reached the bottom.

The second game would be decided here.

The chimera dragon let out a burst of wind and the nearby trees collapsed.
The battlefield where the constellations was fighting was clearly revealed.

"Yoo Joonghyuk!"

Yoo Joonghyuk glanced this way from where he was surrounded by
constellations.

「 You're late. 」

He was still arrogant but the blood flowing from his body made him seem
like he was dying.

[You! He has a sentence!]

Perhaps there was a special skill to determine this as one constellation
screamed.

Apart from our team, the number of participants remaining was six. Our
side had only five people, including the new reinforcements. In addition,
Yoo Joonghyuk was in a state where he almost couldn't fight anymore.

[Go!]

As the all-out combat began, the constellations set up a formation centered
around the Founder of Humanity and General of Vanara. The first one to
run towards them was Steel Sword Lee Hyunsung.

"I! Won't! Lost! It! Again!"

Lee Hyunsung flew forward and started to fight with the narrative-grade
constellation, Manu.
Manu frowned like he was displeased to exchange blows with an
incarnation. His powerful 'status' burned at Manu's fingertips and the steel
shell was slightly softened, but Lee Hyunsung didn't back down.

[The constellation 'Master of Steel' is looking at the 'Founder of
Humanity'.]

The Founder of Humanity was narrative-grade but so was the Master of
Steel. I looked at the thorns of Steel Transformation rising around Lee
Hyunsung's body and I could only guess how harsh the personal scenarios
that he completed were. It wasn't a position that more than 10 incarnations
could reach. The current Lee Hyunsung showed an overwhelming growth
potential than the Lee Hyunsung of any other rounds.

Yoo Sangah watched the scene and also ran forward. "I'll take Olympus."

[This girl, are you crazy?]

King Oedipus discovered Yoo Sangah. The two of them both belonged to
Olympus. However, based on what I heard from Dionysus, Olympus was
currently in the middle of a civil war.

[Master of the Skywalk! You're making the wrong choice right now!]

I didn't know the exact situation but it was obvious that a group led by
Dionysus and Hermes was trying to be independent from the existing
Olympus.

Yoo Sangah started fighting with King Oedipus while Shin Yoosung
moved the chimera dragon.

The condensed breath covered the battlefield. The constellations who
couldn't avoid it screamed.

[There are 10 minutes remaining.]
The second round was reaching its end. At this moment, the points of each
team were almost equal. The constellations were desperate. Several
constellations headed towards the chimera dragon and the dragon and Shin
Yoosung were in a crisis.

The dragon wasn't able to use its force because it consumed quite a lot of
power when dealing with the Apocalypse Imoogi.

[A hatchling! It is only big!]

It would be our side that was disadvantageous if this round ended in a draw.
The game would flow into the third game and if we didn't win, we would
have to deal with the constellations on a stage where the penalty had
disappeared.

Yoo Joonghyuk knew this fact and pointed to Duke Bercan. "Kill the
duke. He has the sentence." I nodded.

"I will create a path." Yoo Joonghyuk squeezed out his magic power and
used Breaking the Sky Swordsmanship.

[They are aiming for the sentence!]

Yoo Joonghyuk slashed and slashed again to create a road. He used his last
force to draw a huge semicircle on the ground and the constellations rushed
at him.

「 I'll leave it to you, Kim Dokja. 」

Yoo Joonghyuk was pierced in the heart by Manu's spear.

[The helper 'Yoo Joonghyuk' has been killed!]

He stood upright even at the moment of death. The constellations turned to
me after Yoo Joonghyuk disappeared. The Primitive Spear and a ray of
light headed my way. However, the bombardment didn't reach me.
"Dokja-ssi!"

Lee Hyunsung activated Steel Transformation to block the attacks of the
constellations. The hot heat and shock would be terribly painful but Lee
Hyunsung seemed more energetic. Duke Bercan could be seen in the
distance.

[There are five minutes remaining.]

"Hyunsung-ssi, throw me."

"It isn't possible. Doing that again…!"

"You have to throw the grenade after pulling out the safety pin." I stared
into
Lee Hyunsung's shaky eyes. "Even if I die here, I won't really die."

The real death was losing this Demon King Selection. Lee Hyunsung
watched for a while before closing and opening his eyes. Lee Hyunsung's
eyes returned to that of a soldier. "I won't believe your lie again!"

"No, now isn't the time to be stubborn—"

"If you die, we will die together!"

[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' is greatly pleased.]

"I must do this."

Then Lee Hyunsung started running with me on his back. Manu was hit by
the rushing Lee Hyunsung and rolled on the floor like a bowling pin.

[Keeok! Cheeky incarnation…!]

No one was able to stop the berserk Lee Hyunsung. At least, it looked like
that.
[Proud child. As I said earlier, it is barely 'history'.]

Lee Hyunsung's movements were stopped by a powerful 'status'. The
Supreme God of Light Surya had recovered his strength and was blocking
the way. His Third Eyes might not work properly but he was still a
Lokapala of Vedas. He had the power to stop us.

His four arms moved and the entire ground shook as the running Lee
Hyunsung was pushed back. He tried running again but the same thing
repeated.

[The place where you are standing now is a place for humans. A human
who keeps repeating the same mistakes.]

I triggered Electrification from Lee Hyunsung's back. My fists stretched out
and struck Surya's torso.

Even so, Surya didn't budge. The transparent shield created by the four
arms smothered all my attacks.

[Only this much? Are you really trying to see the end of the scenario?]

It was the power to deny all the history I had accumulated. Electrification
and the Purest Sword Force didn't work.

[The times have changed. Only this much history…]

There was such a gap despite only 30% of his power being available. What
would happen if 100% of the power was opened?

Then a new voice was heard. "Don't ignore ahjussi!"

Shin Yoosung shouted from the head of the chimera dragon. The breath
poured out at Shin Yoosung's signal. Surya swung his arms and scattered
the breath.
Lee Hyunsung leapt through this gap. His Steel Transformation body
collided with Surya. Surya, who had been unmoved by countless attacks,
shook for the first time.

"Uwaaaaaah!" Lee Hyunsung swung his fists towards Surya like a madman.
Lee Hyunsung didn't stop despite the Steel Transformation around his fists
cracking, blood splashing and bones breaking.

[The 73rd Demon Realm is responding to the will of you and your helpers.]

[A new story about you is being made.]

The human's will to challenge a god was causing cracks in the defensive
wall. A little break. It was a very small crack that human history created.

"Hyunsung-ssi."

Lee Hyunsung and I didn't miss this gap. As if throwing a grenade, Lee
Hyunsung threw my body that had become small through Miniaturization. I
broke through the barrier created by Surya's arms and rushed to Duke
Bercan. Duke Bercan turned his head with surprise while I activated and
my side pierced his neck.

[The participant 'Demon King of Salvation' has killed the participant 'Duke
Bercan'!]

…I did it. Along with the triumphant victory, countless system messages
flowed into my head. Before I could read the messages, a power squeezed
at me. At the last moment, I saw Surya's face.

[You have died.]
              Chapter 266: Ep. 50 - Dokja's Story, III


My vision blackened before coming back. It felt like my consciousness had
experienced a power outage. I blinked blankly but only the dark ceiling was
visible.

…What happened? I took deep breaths and moved my heavy head as I
started thinking.

I was participating in the second round of the Demon King Selection. I
killed Duke Bercan and at almost the same time, I was killed by Surya.
Then the system messages poured out.

Did I win the second round? Or… did I lose? I thought about it but I wasn't
sure.

[You have taken away the enemy's sentence and won the

game!] I seemed to have heard this message.
[Your sentence was taken away and you have lost the game!]

I also seemed to have heard this message. Maybe it was both. Then which
one was first? For now, I had no way of knowing.

[You have died.]

The only thing I was sure about was this message. I died in the game and
awakened in this place.

"Ugh…"

I slowly rose from my seat and the place where I was lying was seen more
clearly. Numerous lamps were set up between niches, illuminating the vast
darkness. It was an unfamiliar place I had never visited before.

There was a sign stating [000~100] in the place where I stood and large
bookshelves around the sign. There was the smell of books. It was
reminiscent of a university library.

…Library? Why was I here? I pulled out a book on the closest shelf and
turned a page.

「 After Lee Seolhwa's death, Yoo Joonghyuk thought he should die many
times. He could never win against them with talent and skills alone. The
end of the scenario wasn't visible and the power of the constellations was
unbelievably strong. Revenge for Lee Jihye and Lee Seolhwa couldn't be
achieved. Yoo Joonghyuk thought in the midst of his despair. 」

The sentences in the familiar style were lined up and I read the sentences as
if they were being sucked in.

「 'What if I have a sponsor?'」
It was a scene that didn't appear in detail in Ways of Survival. Even so, I
knew this scene. It was because the scene was defeated dozens or hundreds
of times in my imagination.

「 [The constellation '???' wants you to be his incarnation'. 」

This was the first time Yoo Joonghyuk received his sponsor. Yoo
Joonghyuk in the 0th regression repeatedly trained to his limit without a
sponsor but had to kneel in front of the incarnation.

「 A new attribute, Regressor will blossom! 」

It was the story of when Yoo Joonghyuk first became a 'regressor'. I
reflexively closed the book and looked at the title.

[Yoo Joonghyuk, 56th record of the 0th round.]

I suddenly had an idea of what this place was. As my eyes became
accustomed to the darkness, the surroundings looked better. This was the
library where all the records of Ways of Survival were gathered.

I muttered in a slightly weary manner. "…It seems to be more than 3,149."

Ways of Survival was long but not to this extent. This huge space was filled
with books. I wasn't sure if I could read half the books even if I devoted my
whole life to it.

Then I got a headache. The curled memories were breaking out like a
eggshell cracking. This place that had just seemed unfamiliar now felt
familiar. The lamps in the niches and the shelves of books.

I slowly got goosebumps and an intense feeling struck my head. I had
already come to this place once. When was it? When…

「 Kim Dok ja. 」
The voice echoed through the library. I knew this tone. "…The Fourth
Wall?"

Then the entire library shook faintly.

「 Yo ur so ul was in dan ger. 」

"Danger?"

「 I call ed you…」

The Fourth Wall called me here. It wasn't difficult to figure out what he
meant. "Perhaps, are you also in here?"

「 Co rrect. 」

"How do I get out of here? Where is the exit?"

「… 」

"…Hey?"

I called out a few more times but the Fourth Wall didn't answer. He was a
guy who slept when sleepy so he might've fallen asleep again this time. I
had to find a way out myself.

[You can't use Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint in this location.]

[You can't use Bookmark in this location.]

All my available skills were blocked. I couldn't see the end of the library no
matter how far I walked. I couldn't see the exit as I looked to the north,
south, east and west. I became convinced that I couldn't escape and felt a
drug-like comfort.

"…Heaven."
Everywhere I looked was Ways of Survival. It was a world full of Ways of
Survival. I might've been happy if I came here before the scenario started. It
was a story that would never end no matter how much I read. I wouldn't go
hungry because I was just a soul.

…There was no way for me to go out so I should read more books. I didn't
know. There could be a way in the book.

I pulled the books out of the shelves, stacked them next to each other and
started reading them. I looked for a while and once again realized that
Ways of Survival was Ways of Survival.

"…There are too many explanations."

The surroundings were quiet so the speed at which I read the book was
faster than usual. However, I didn't read it roughly. Like a gourmet long
starved of meat, I cut every sentence into pieces and relished them.

"That jerk, he was cute at this time."

"…Damn, I should've killed him a bit more in the beginning."

Some of the stories were already known and some weren't.

"This information was forgotten…"

"What? There was something like this?"

There was no one in this place and I naturally spoke to myself. I wasn't
conscious about any listeners. Thus, I read a few more books. There was a
sense of pride in my heart and warmth rose.

Suddenly, I felt weak. Why didn't I just give up and stay here? It wouldn't
be too bad if I never woke up from here. There was no scenario here to kill
me.
I didn't need to see the constellations. After reading a number of books, I
ran past some bookshelves, reading those in the middle.

「 Yoo Joonghyuk sometimes thought this. 」

「 'If I hadn't met that guy on the bridge, what would've happened? Or if
I had killed him there… what would've happened to my remaining life?'
」 I saw the familiar phrases and reflexively looked at the title of the
book.

[Yoo Joonghyuk, 12th record of the 3rd round.]

…As expected, it was the third round. I opened a few more books Some
of them were written about me. 「 'Damn Kim Dokja'. 」

Some books contained:

「 "Kim Dokja, wake up! Kim Dokja!" 」

Some good words were written. In some books, nothing was written.

「■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■」

The sentences were filtered and couldn't be read. Some of the episodes had
blank pages. It was as if the story hadn't been recorded yet.

All books were organized in accordance to the order of the rounds. It was as
if someone had arranged it so I could find it easily when needed. But
who…

I just had this thought when I saw something on the other side of the
bookshelf. I reflexively put the book back and looked. It was a very short
moment but there seemed to be the shadow of a person.

"Who's there?"
The sound of footsteps started heading further away. I started chasing the
sound. I almost stumbled over a few books on the floor but persistently
followed the shadow. The signs of the bookshelves changed quickly.

From [000~100] to [100~200]. Then it was [200~300].

[Yoo Joonghyuk, 24th record of the 373rd round.]

[Yoo Joonghyuk, 31st record of the 473rd round.]

Countless books passed by quickly.

[Yoo Joonghyuk, 27th record of the 573rd round.]

[Yoo Joonghyuk, 12th record of the 681st round.]

…

I was a bit breathless and still couldn't see the end of the books. It was
obviously a soul body but I was breathless. I kept running. This was an
opportunity. If I missed this person here, I wouldn't be able to catch it
again.
How far did I go? I was getting a bit closer.

"Wait!"

The moment I shouted, the floor in front of me suddenly disappeared. My
body failed to overcome inertia and fell forward. I might've fallen down if
I hadn't reflexively grabbed the bookshelf next to me. [Yoo Joonghyuk,
22nd record of the 1863rd round.]

[Yoo Joonghyuk, 23rd record of the 1863rd round.]

[Yoo Joonghyuk, 26th record of the 1863rd round.]

…
Books poured towards me head. It hurt as much as Yoo Joonghyuk's fists. I
barely dug myself out of the pile of books and the shadow I was pursuing
had already disappeared.

"Shit…"

Instead, there was a cliff in front of my eyes. I couldn't see the bottom.

"Ah…"

I stared down the cliff like I was possessed. This was the end of the library.
It was the end of all the stories. I stared at it and felt the urge to throw
myself in. I felt like I could know something I had long wondered about. If
I could go inside there…

The moment my body tilted towards the bottom of the cliff, someone
tightly grabbed my shoulders.

「(You will die if you fall. It is really 'beyond' the wall.) 」




Slap! Slap! Slap! Slap!

"Wake up."

Slap! Slap! Slap! Slap!

"Yoo Joonghyuk-ssi, stop it! Dokja-ssi's face is swollen!"

"What the hell is happening?"

"He is still breathing. I think there was a shock to the soul…"
Yoo Joonghyuk frowned at Yoo Sangah's words and stood up. The swollen
Kim Dokja was lying on the ground. The bear-like Lee Hyunsung was
holding onto him and crying out madly.

"Dokja-ssi… wake up. Please…"

The moment the second round was completed, the Mythical Battlefield
suddenly disintegrated. All participants and helpers of the Yoo Joonghyuk
Kim Dokja Industrial Complex were left in front of the wastes of the
industrial complex.

Yoo Sangah stared at the people standing in the same camp. Two dogs and
one pretty boy. Also, Han Myungoh…

"You were alive, Department Head-nim."

"Y-Yoo Sangah-ssi…" Han Myungoh started sweating and retreated.

Yoo Sangah stared at Jang Hayoung. "You… are you on our side?"

"Ah, I…"

Jang Hayoung met Yoo Sangah's eyes and stuttered in a confused manner.
He didn't know how to introduce himself. Then Jang Hayoung caught sight
of Shin Yoosung. "Ah, weren't you in that video…?"

"…You know me?"

Jang Hayoung recalled the scenes of the 73rd Demon King scenario thanks
to Shin Yoosung and figured out who they were. "I'm a real fan! Wow, I
can't believe I'm meeting the incarnations of Earth…"

Jang Hayoung's eyes were glowing as he shook Yoo Sangah's hand. Yoo
Sangah smiled lightly and stared into the air.

"By the way… did we win or lose?"
Only one unknown system message was floating in the air.

[We are currently determining the winning team of the second round.]

Jang Hayoung said, "I think Kim Dokja killed him first. Then shouldn't we
win?"

"But our sentence was stolen…"

Yoo Joonghyuk shook his head. "Kim Dokja was faster."

The words filled with strong conviction caused Jang Hayoung and Yoo
Sangah to brighten. It was likely to be true if Yoo Joonghyuk said so.

Then a cloud of dust appeared on the other side of the wilderness. It was a
scene filled with a powerful 'status'. There were no need to ask about the
identity of the incoming beings.

Yoo Joonghyuk stared at the sky and his expression hardened.

[We are currently determining the winning team of the second round.]

It was still the only sentence floating in the sky. It had been the same for 30
minutes.

"Be prepared."

"Huh?"

"Something is wrong."

In the main scenario, the fast-paced bureau would never spend 30 minutes
to determine the winner.

In other words, this situation was intended by someone. Someone didn't
want the scenario to end this way.
The present 73rd Demon Realm was filled with an enormous amount of
probability due to the Mythical Battlefield.

Yoo Joonghyuk pulled out his Black Heavenly Demon Sword and declared,
"This time it isn't a game."

The terrible roar of the Thunder Eating Bird filled the sky. The
constellations who no longer received penalties from the game were
coming over here.
              Chapter 267: Ep. 50 - Dokja's Story, IV


A strong hand grabbed my shoulders. I reflexively turned my body and
punched out. There was a thud and my fist was caught in a big hand.

「 (Oh, did you come to fight?) 」

The darkness was lifted and a white face was revealed. 「 (I

saved you once before. You must've already forgotten.) 」 It

was a face I knew. Even… it was someone I killed.

"Why are you here?"

「 (…Are you really asking because you don't know?) 」

It was an ambiguous face where it wasn't clear if the person was male or
female. It gave me a feeling of incomprehensibility. This presence shouldn't
be here.
"Nirvana Moebius."

A long time ago, he was eaten by the Fourth Wall.




What happened to the beings who were eaten by the Fourth Wall? I had this
question from the first moment the Fourth Wall ate something.

「 (It is as you can see. This is what happened.) 」

Nirvana laughed. We hadn't met for a while but Nirvana was just the same
as our first meeting. If there was one difference, the letters making up Ways
of Survival was hanging on his body like a shackle.

"You've been alive here the whole time?"

「 (It's hard to say this is living.) 」

Looking closer, Nirvana's voice didn't flow out of his mouth. I couldn't
even say it was a voice. Nirvana stared up at the air.

「(I'm living thanks to that damn parasitic wall.) 」

At this moment, the warning of the Fourth Wall echoed.

「 Nir va na talk ing too much. 」

Nirvana laughed. His eyes were bitter but there was a strange uplifting
sensation from him. I followed Nirvana's gaze and looked around the
library. There were numerous types of letterforms that made up a world. In
this place, everything was Ways of Survival.

"Now you know everything you've ever wanted."
「 (There is no entity that knows everything. Just like you.) 」

Nirvana really seemed like a mysterious sage. I felt strange. For the first
time, a character learnt the secrets of this world.

"How do you feel? Now you know that you are a character in a novel."

Nirvana's expression changed at my provocation.

「 (A novel… is that what you really think?) 」

Nirvana looked at me with pitying eyes and his lips shook several times.
However, no sound emerged. I was frustrated. "What is it? Finish it to the
end."

Nirvana smiled quietly.

「 (I like your story.) 」

I was embarrassed by the unexpected words.

「 (To be precise, I like the story you have changed. The sentences that feel
your will, the context that contains things you don't say…) 」

"…What are you saying now?"

I stepped back in an awkward manner. I looked at his bastard and
remembered his words before his death.

「(It isn't just me. All the beings here love your story.) 」

"Who else is in this place?"

The air started shaking and a few dark shards fell from the ceiling. The
vibrations were like something giant was burrowing this way. Nirvana
picked up the fragments and frowned.
「 (There is no time so you better move quickly. It isn't good to talk too
much here. Something terrible will happen.) 」

Nirvana started walking before I could ask anything. I followed Nirvana
while looking back at the cliff I had almost fallen off. The vibrations in the
library were spreading from the cliff. "Wait, where are you going?"

「 (There is someone who wants to meet you the most.) 」

"What? Who?"

「 (It is the existence who organized the shelves from 000.) 」

…Organized the shelves?

「 (We aren't just here to play. If we don't clean up properly, you won't
remember it.) 」

"…Wait, what does that mean?"

「 (You don't need to understand.) 」

I turned and saw new bookshelves appearing. The library was really
spacious. Ways of Survival increased the number of rounds that were
skipped in the second half. Perhaps this library had arranged all those
omissions. A signpost saying [000~100] appeared in front of me.

「 (It's here. Then have a good conversation.) 」

I turned the corner and saw a familiar creature. It was the 'minimum' size
compared to what I saw in the past but it was definitely the existence I
knew.

12 tentacles were being used to pick up books on the floor. There was a
squid-like body controlling those tentacles. There was something like
hornrimmed spectacles placed on a small hole that was presumed to be the
eye.

"…You were here."

The squid looked this way. The 12 tentacles nodded simultaneously.

「 (The poor truthseeker came.) 」

It was the Devourer of Dreams. In Dark Castle, I defeated it with the help
of Cheok Jungyeong and the Fourth Wall. He was swallowed up by the
Fourth Wall and ended up in this space.

"Did you want to see me?"

「 (I want to help you.) 」

Something that was presumed to be the squid's mouth looked pleased. I
didn't know how to respond to this different species gesture.

"I don't know what you're saying all of a sudden. I need some time to figure
out the situation…"

「 (There isn't much time.) 」

"Why are you trying to help me?"

「 (With your help, I have reached the truth of the universe. Noble beings
will pay back their debts.) 」

Noble beings. In fact, it wasn't strange for the Devourer of Dreams to call
itself that. This squid was strong enough to chew up the constellations
making a fuss outside. "Then I have one thing to ask."

「 (Go ahead.) 」

"Who created this library?"
At this moment, huge sparks popped up and my body crashed into a
bookshelf. 12 tentacles stretched out at the same time, holding my body to
the bookcase. He looked at the falling books and the Devourer of Dreams
pushed up his glasses.

「 (It does not constitute a question. Ask another question.) 」

I bit my lips and thought about it. It was meaningless to ask a question
related to Ways of Survival right now. It was possible to read the second
revision and there was a way to come back to this space and read the related
questions.

In other words, I had to ask a question that wasn't recorded in Ways of
Survival. It was also a question that the 'outer god' had to answer. Finding
the question wasn't difficult.

"Who is Secretive Plotter?"

Strong sparks once again sprung up. I was worried that my body would be
thrown back again but fortunately, the sparks were weaker this time.

「(Are you curious about the great plotter?) 」

The tentacles moved very slowly.

「(He is one of the oldest beings in this universe…) 」

I was hearing information about Secretive Plotter for the first time.

「(The most solitary being in the universe, the one who fights against the
Oldest Dream.) 」

"How do I know if you are just saying this? Let me know the right
modifier―"
「 (A modifier is meaningless for him. However, he will help you if you
want.) 」

"Help? How…"

「(Make an Otherworld Covenant with him.) 」

The Otherworld Covenant. I knew what it was. In the fifth scenario, the
Absolute Throne that I destroyed was a type of covenant. However, there
was never a good end to a covenant in Ways of Survival.

"I can't do that."

A few tentacles nodded like they were heads.

「 (I thought so. You hate higher level beings.) 」

"I won't be able to create the story I want if I borrow your strength."

「 (You are now someone who can't be controlled.) 」

I felt strange. I didn't think an 'outer god' would say this.

「 (You need to think again about your anger. In order to reach the end, it
is necessary to properly consider the things you can use.) 」 Dudududu!

「( This world is heading towards ■■. It hasn't been written yet but it has
already been written. The great plotter can help you. So that you can find
the right way…) 」

"I believe in the stories I have accumulated."

Dudududu!

The gap in vibrations was gradually shortening. The Devourer of Dreams
spoke like he was resigned to my stubborn will.
「 (…Unfortunately, there is no more time. Remember that the great plotter
is always waiting for you.) 」

One of the tentacles wound around me. Meanwhile, the other tentacles
moved quickly and started looking for something on the shelves. The book
he found was:

[Yoo Joonghyuk, 38rd record of the 3rd round.]

The pages turned quickly. I realized what was going to happen and
hurriedly opened my mouth.

"Wait a minute. I still have something to ask!"

「(Goodbye, ■■'s Apostle. If the probability allows it, we will meet again.)
」

The pages of the book opened and sentences appeared on the blank pages in
real time.

「 Yoo Joonghyuk had a thought. 」

「 Wake up quickly, Kim Dokja. 」

「 Otherwise everyone will die. 」

…Dammit, this was why I was forced to leave. The next moment, I was
sucked into the context of the sentences.




The battlefield was a ruin. Yoo Joonghyuk wiped his bloody lips while
looking at the bodies of the incarnations on the ground and the approaching
constellations.
The combination of the transcendent dog Breaking the Sky Master and the
constellation Osu was amazing. They didn't mind their broken bodies and
were biting at the rushing historical-grade constellations.

Thanks to this, Cleopatra in the front was a mess while King Oedipus had
nasty bite wounds all over his body.

It was reasonably okay when dealing with historical-grade constellations.

[Disgusting! You dare to call yourselves constellations when you can't even
deal with such bugs?]

However, the narrative-grade constellations watching from the rear came
out and the situation completely reversed.

Shin Yoosung's chimera dragon crashed down due to the Thunder Eating
Bird. Lee Hyunsung had his Steel Transformation shattered by the General
of Vanara's fist and he was rolling on the ground. Yoo Sangah was
somehow managing to fight despite coughing up blood several times, but
this seemed to be her limit.

Osu was stabbed by the Founder of Humanity's Primitive Spear and
staggered to the ground. Osu's incarnation body was stabbed and the
Breaking the Sky Master also staggered.

They opened the limits allowed by the probability of the 25th scenario. It
wasn't 100% power but the powerful 'status' that the parties present brought
out filled the entire Demon Realm with dazzling white sparks.

This was the strength of the beings called constellations. They were beings
who came from the highest place in this world.

Yoo Joonghyuk asked, "Why are you doing this?"

[The constellation 'Supreme God of Light' is laughing quietly.]
"It looks like you don't have to have the history of being defeated by bugs."

Surya's cheeks subtly twitched at these words. The opening of the
Lokapala's status caused the expressions of the constellations to change.
The opening of an excessive force caused sparks to appear around Surya's
body. However, Surya looked confident like he could afford it.

[Kuwaaaaaang!]

He released his 'status' and dealt one blow. However, the whole area
became a terrible mess. The nearby structures were turned to ashes and the
fleeing incarnations were destroyed. People collapsed while blood emerged
from all orifices.

[Some constellations are dissatisfied with the progression of the scenario!]

[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' is greatly angry!]

[The demon king 'Overlord of the Great Demon Castle' is pleased.]

[The demon king 'Maker of Discord' is excited!]

[Many constellations are excited about the great battle!]

Lee Hyunsung was defending in front and blood poured from his ears and
mouth. Yoo Joonghyuk grabbed Lee Hyunsung's shoulder.

"Back off, Lee Hyunsung. This is an opponent you can't go against."

Lee Hyunsung reflexively tried to say something but even that seemed
hard. Yoo Joonghyuk left the faltering Lee Hyunsung behind him and
walked forward while wiping the blood off the Black Heavenly Demon
Sword.

It was a desperate situation. His Sage's Eye was analyzing the battlefield in
real time. The number of constellations visible at the moment was almost
20. Some of the historical-grade constellations were eliminated from the
field but it wasn't a number he could win against.

「 Young disciple, no. You will die if you open that power! 」

The Breaking the Sky Master instinctively realized what Yoo Joonghyuk
was going to do. However, Yoo Joonghyuk's will was stubborn.

Yoo Joonghyuk slowly raised his power and huge sparks appeared. He
knew he wasn't their opponent. However, it was always like this.

–Once you reach transcendence stage three, you can gain the power to
destroy constellations.

The words left behind by his teacher were the only comfort that Yoo
Joonghyuk now believed in. This time, he was using a shortcut to raise his
power. This didn't mean the power was a lie because he used a shortcut.

A dazzling aura burst from Yoo Joonghyuk's body. Soft hair poured down
like a waterfall while his large size became a smaller and sleeker body. He
took the form that allowed him to practice the ultimate Breaking the Sky
Swordsmanship. Yoo Sangah stared at the scene from behind and couldn't
help opening her mouth. "…Yoo Joonghyuk-ssi?"

Yoo Joonghyuk slowly turned back, his long hair cut off by the Black
Heavenly Demon Sword. The ines of the face had changed but it was
clearly Yoo Joonghyuk. No, it was even more than before. Yoo
Joonghyuk's gaze stayed on Kim Dokja's face for a moment.

"Take him away."

Yoo Joonghyuk turned his head and wiped the blade of the Black Heavenly
Demon Sword. The constellations who were laughing at him were
approaching.
King Oedipus opened his mouth. [Foolish transcendent. This is the cost of
going against the constellations. You will die here.]
Yoo Joonghyuk replied while still wiping his blade. "I guess so. However,
some of you will die too."

[Haha, it is useless! The extinction of an incarnation body…]

Yoo Joonghyuk didn't listen. Instead, he was reminded of Kim Dokja's
words.

'Don't give up on this life'.

"Then in the next life, half of you will die."

Yoo Joonghyuk's voice rang out quietly through the battlefield. Yoo
Joonghyuk raised his head along with the Black Heavenly Demon Sword.
The footsteps of the constellations stopped for the first time. The power of
transcendence was threatening the surroundings.

"In the next life, all of you will die."
The Black Heavenly Demon Sword's cry seemed to touch the sky. The
expressions of the constellations stiffened as Yoo Joonghyuk concluded his
words.

"You will die forever."
               Chapter 268: Ep. 50 - Dokja's Story, V


[Arrogant transcendent, what bullshit…!]

At the beginning of the showdown, Yoo Joonghyuk moved.

The scorn of the constellations and the overwhelming disadvantage in
power weren't important to the present Yoo Joonghyuk. From the moment
he entered the third round, he had been focused on only killing the enemies
in front of him.

An aura spread from Yoo Joonghyuk and some of the historical-grade
constellations in front murmured to themselves. However, most of the
constellations still looked down on Yoo Joonghyuk.

No matter how transcendent, he was just a human. The constellations had
no reason to lose in a situation where they had an overwhelming advantage
in numbers.

This became the last thought of the General of Vanara.
[The exclusive skill 'Giant Body Transformation Lv. 6 is activated!]

Giant Body Transformation was used and Yoo Joonghyuk narrowed the
distance to the constellations in an instant. Yoo Joonghyuk shot forward
like a meteor.

By the time the General of Vanara realized the sword and hurriedly raised
his huge double-edged sword, his head was already cut by the Black
Heavenly Demon Sword and flying through the air.

[You dare…!]

The General of Vanara's eyes widened and he spoke in his true voice, even
with his cut neck.

Yoo Joonghyuk cut the flying head in half using the Black Heavenly
Demon Sword.

It was a ridiculous end.

The excessively concentrated magic power was melting Yoo Joonghyuk's
blood. It was the result of invoking transcendence stage three to the limit.
The maximum time he could stay in this state was 10 minutes. In these 10
minutes, Yoo Joonghyuk had to defeat everyone.

"Next."

The death of the General of Vanara was a great shock to the constellations.
The constellations didn't disappear with the death of their incarnation
bodies.

However, there was no one who wanted to lose their incarnation body in
vain. A fatal death permanently damaged the constellations. All the
constellations became stiff.
Yoo Joonghyuk utilized this short gap to attempt a second attack. The
Black Heavenly Demon Sword left a dark trajectory as it moved and cut off
the wings of a giant bird. The Thunder Eating Bird let out a loud cry. Then
the constellations started to move.

[You!]

The Founder of Humanity's Primitive Spear aimed at Yoo Joonghyuk. It
was a blow that would've turned any normal incarnation to powder.

However, Yoo Joonghyuk received this blow. The impact ruptured his right
forearm muscle and the force pushed at his entire body. Blood poured from
his mouth but Yoo Joonghyuk didn't lose focus.

[Excessive concentration has expanded the category of the attributes!]

[The exclusive attribute 'Ruler of Amusement' is activated!]

His concentration awakened the power of the character. All the incoming
constellations became data and flowed into Yoo Joonghyuk's mind. At this
moment, the world was a game to Yoo Joonghyuk. Yoo Joonghyuk avoided
the attacks of the constellations with restrained movements and fought back
using magic power.

[Kuaaack!]

The Founder of Humanity screamed as his fingers were cut by the Black
Heavenly Demon Sword.

Yoo Joonghyuk's Black Heavenly Demon Sword let out a deafening roar as
it dug into the gap.

Breaking the Sky Swordsmanship.

Destruction skill.

Breaking the Sky Meteor.
The sword rose from the ground to the heavens, stabbing the sky like a
thunderbolt. The branches of the sword energy hide in the dark clouds and
created thunder. The thunder poured from the night sky and struck the
constellations like meteorites.

Dozens of thunderbolts fell from the sky and the incarnation bodies of the
constellations were pierced. It was a blow containing the power of
transcendence stage three.

[Kuaaah!]

Yoo Joonghyuk watched the constellations struggling with the pain and felt
himself dying. The experiences of the third round went through his mind.

It was a short round. Even so, many things happened.

[The story 'One who Inherited the Name of the King' is crying out.]

As if responding to his feelings, the stories starting speaking. It was as if
every story had its own will. Most of them weren't stories he had
accumulated alone.

[The story 'Person who Opposes the Miracle' has begun.]

A story about returnees.

[The story 'Paradise of Despair' has begun.]

A story earned by preserving the abandoned paradise. [The

story 'One who Fought Against an Outer God' has begun.] The

story where he confronted the outer god.

[The story 'Ruler of the Industrial Complex' has begun.]
It was a story that he would've normally never achieved. It was a story that
was unrelated to the current situation but it was a story related to someone
else. It was a story that could never be achieved alone.

The stories started talking at the same time. It was as if they didn't want to
finish the story here. Along with the bitter pain, blood poured from Yoo
Joonghyuk's chest. He didn't even know how he obtained these wounds.

There were a few fallen incarnation bodies on the ground. The Supreme
God of Light Surya saw it and spoke.

[Amazing. You already can't be called a human anymore, child.]

Yoo Joonghyuk's stories emitted a bright light like he was rebelling against
the true voice.

[The story 'One Who Hunted the King of Disasters' is roaring.]

Yoo Joonghyuk was a transcendent. The stories were the unique parts
making up the constellations. Just having stories didn't mean a person could
be equal to the stars in the night sky. Even so, the current light pouring
from Yoo Joonghyuk's body was brighter than any constellation in the
place.

Yoo Joonghyuk looked at the stories flowing from his body. Some were
known and some were unfamiliar. There was a story that couldn't be
obtained again.

[The story 'Life and Death Companions' wants to continue.]

He couldn't help glancing at Yoo Sangah and the other party members. He
also saw Kim Dokja on Lee Hyunsung's back.

Yoo Joonghyuk gripped the Black Heavenly Demon Sword that was
slipping from his hands.
…He couldn't die. He couldn't die in a place like this. He used the last of
his strength to point the trembling sword at Surya. Surya laughed as if the
sight was interesting.

[However, it is only a human story.]

Surya released a bright light as he used the stories he accumulated over
thousands of years. It was a status that couldn't be resisted. Yoo
Joonghyuk's short history was shaking in front of those formidable years.

[Foolish humans who don't know that a god's power is so high.]

The sunlight that melted everything poured towards Yoo Joonghyuk.




The scene of the industrial complex being destroyed by the constellations.
Incarnations died without being able to rebel. Some people who felt
desperate at the sudden disaster appeared up close on the screen. The most
horrifying thing was that a man who was covered in injuries and lost one
arm was still fighting.

[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' is furious!]

[The constellation 'Queen of the Darkest Spring' is sorry for the incarnation
'Yoo Joonghyuk'.]

[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' is pointing a finger to
the cowardly constellations!]

[Many constellations are complaining about the constellations on the
battlefield!]
There were countless indirect messages from the constellations and the
dokkaebi of the bureau were listening to them. Among them was Bihyung,
the dokkaebi in charge of the Demon King Selection.

[What the hell do you mean by this?]

He was rarely angry or agitated but now he had the same mind as the
constellations in his channel.

[The second game is the victory of the Yoo Joonghyuk - Kim Dokja
Industrial Complex! There was a time difference but there is nothing to
worry about. Then why not announce the winner?!]

Shortly after the second game, Bihyung contacted the bureau's approval
team directly. However, the only answer he got in return was 'it is being
prepared'.

In the end, the last connection Bihyung had was Baram, the next great
dokkaebi candidate. There was a crackling sound and Baram's face
appeared on the screen.

[This is the decision of the bureau.]

The decision of the bureau. They were magic words.

'This is the bureau's decision'.

'This is the bureau's decision'.

[Baram. This is the main scenario.]

There were some things that even the bureau couldn't touch.

[Since when did the bureau interfere with the development of the main
scenario? It is also a scenario where a giant story is involved… Baram,
don't you know what will happen if you do this?] Baram didn't answer.
[Please tell me. Who the hell did this? Is it one of your superiors?]

Bihyung glanced at Dokgak on the screen. It was clear that Dokgak was
associated with this situation. However, this wasn't something that could be
done by one or two senior dokkaebis. The silent Baram opened his mouth.

[…Are you doubting the 'great dokkaebis' right now?]

[Is there any other streamer who can do this beside them?]

[Bihyung, please wake up. Why would they do this?]

[I don't know. Perhaps some bribes were received.]

Baram frowned.

[The great dokkaebis aren't bound by such private understandings.]

[Then why is this happening? Baram, you must know something!]

[Bihyung.]

Bihyung instantly flinched. Baram's voice was furious. Bihyung thought
there would be a strict scolding but unexpectedly, Baram just relaxed. It
was as if he understood Bihyung. Baram on the screen was also watching
the scenes of the Demon King Selection. Baram's lips slowly opened.

[Yes, maybe one of the great dokkaebis created this 'delay', as you said.]

[Then…]

[However, even a great dokkaebi can only do it up to there. It is impossible
for a great dokkaebi to endure the storm that will be created from
intervening in a scenario of this magnitude.]

[…So who did it?]
At this moment, there was a loud noise and the ceiling of the bureau shook.
It sounded like a huge dragon passing by. It was the sound of 'probability'
moving.

Bihyung's expression hardened.

[Don't tell me… something so ridiculous…]

[Do you understand now?]

The existence that could move this probability. There was only one such
existence in the Star Stream. He didn't even know if it should be called an
'existence'.

Baram drove in the wedge. [The will of the Star Stream wanted this.]

[This is ridiculous!]

[There is no other way to explain it.]

Bihyung's words were taken away and he stared blankly at the screen. Kim
Dokja's party was shown on the screen.

Originally, they should be excited about winning. Now they looked terrible
as they lay on the ground.

It was a confrontation with constellations supported by the nebula. It was a
ridiculous fight from the beginning but the party fought well. They played a
game against powerful constellations and finally won the competition that
gave them a giant story. Now they were going to be losers just because
there wasn't a 'winner announcement'.

It was just because the Star Stream wanted this. Resentment mixed with
anger filled Bihyung's eyes.

[Then… why does a streamer exist?]
It was the first time Bihyung felt helplessness since becoming a dokkaebi.
His fingertips trembled as the parts of the scenario he touched fell.

[If we can't stop this nonsensical development… what are the streamers of
this world worth?]

[Bihyung.]

Baram saw Bihyung's sad eyes and slowly spoke.

[Steamers are also part of the story.]

The desperate Bihyung stared at the screen. Yoo Joonghyuk was gradually
melting in the dazzling sunlight. Now the story was leaving the streamer's
hand.

Thus, there was only one thing to believe in.

[Many constellations are looking at one constellation.]

The man on Lee Hyunsung's back was shaking. On the screen, the man was
slowly opening his eyes.
               Chapter 269: Ep. 50 - Dokja's Story, VI


[Baat! Baaat! Baaaaat!]

My cheeks hurt.

[Baaaaat!]

There was a bit more pain. I felt something violently shaking in my arms. I
opened my eyes at the exact moment the earth let out a tremendous ringing
sound. I reflexively raised my head and could see brilliant flashes of light.
The sparks of probability in the sky were falling like lightning strikes all
over the Demon Realm.

"Dokja-ssi?"

I woke up the moment I heard Yoo Sangah's voice. Like a disconnected
current being reconnected, thoughts started to flow through my head.
There were broken incarnation bodies everywhere. No matter how I looked,
this wasn't the Mythical Battlefield. All the fallen bodies were living human
beings. The industrial complex being torn apart by the Thunder Eating Bird
could be seen.

"Did the constellations come?"

Yoo Sangah, who was about to say something, wiped her bloody cheeks
and nodded. "…Yes."

A system message was floating in the air while the party members were in
tatters.

"The winner still hasn't been announced."

It was a situation I expected thanks to the last message of Yoo Joonghyuk
in the library. However, I didn't expect the situation to be so serious.

"Kuk…"

Lee Hyunsung suffered a serious injury on his side and staggered. I quickly
got off Lee Hyunsung's back and bought a few recovery items from the
Dokkaebi Bag.

I gave the Great Return Pill to Lee Hyunsung and Yoo Sangah, who were
the most seriously injured. Shin Yoosung had no wounds but her magic
power was depleted, so I gave her an advanced magic power recovery
medicine. Trauma medicine was given to Han Myungoh, Breaking the Sky
Master and Jang Hayoung. It cost over 400,000 coins but now wasn't the
time to worry about that.

"Ahjussi…"

Shin Yoosung drank the potion and looked up at me while leaning against
the rock. I looked at Shin Yoosung for a moment before saying, "You
should rest here. By the way…"
In a distance place, the deafening roar of the constellations was shaking the
earth. I could tell the number exceeded 12 just by the 'status'. At this
moment, I had an ominous feeling.

…The constellations were gathered so how could the party members flee to
here?

"Yoo Joonghyuk…"

None of the party members answered. I looked around the battlefield as an
explosion occurred. Everyone except for Yoo Joonghyuk was here. In
addition, someone was fighting the constellations.

[The 'Fourth Wall' is shaking faintly.]

"That stupid bastard…"

"Ahjussi! No!" Shin Yoosung clung to my waist when I tried to run
forward.
"Ahjussi will die. You'll die there."

She was an always straightforward and brave child. Fear was deeply
permeated in the child's eyes. Shin Yoosung burst into tears as I pulled
away from her. In the saturated battlefield, the tears scattered like dust.
Perhaps this child had seen it. It was the fear of a giant story that humans
could never overcome.

"Please take care of Yoosung."

I left Shin Yoosung to Jang Hayoung who was in a good condition and
activated Way of the Wind. I heard a voice calling out to me from behind
but had no time to turn around.

I moved forward and the pressure of the 'status' bursting from the center of
the battlefield became stronger. It was a fearsome storm of magic that I had
never experienced before. The center definitely contained Yoo Joonghyuk.
「 Kim Dokja thought: Is there a way? 」

The pages of Ways of Survival flashed in my head.

「It isn't possible. 」

「That method is too unreasonable. 」

I bit my lips. I predicted that this situation might happen. However, the time
passed too quickly and I had been asleep for too long.

I was late. Yoo Joonghyuk was still far away and the wind wasn't on my
side. I could buy a new skill from the Dokkaebi Bag but I can't guarantee its
utilization.

In the end, I made a decision.

"I will invest three million coins into my strength, physique, agility and
magic power."

[Your total stats have grown abnormally!]

[The coins you invested have allowed you to cross the stats limit of the
scenario.]

[A fuller probability will release some of the stat constraints for this
scenario.]

[The growth of the stats value compared to the invested coins will be
randomly adjusted.]

A tremendous amount of sparks jumped from my body. It felt like my
muscles were tearing and growing bigger. There was the feeling of my bone
density changing and a terrible pain came over me.

"Cough…"
I had put it off until now due to the poor cost to value ratio but there was no
other way.

[Your mind can't cope with your evolving incarnation body.]

[The exclusive skill 'Fourth Wall' is activated!]

[Your incarnation body is evolving to a new level!]

Since the early scenarios, the 'overall stats' didn't have a big influence on
combat. It was because stories, stigmas and skills had much more influence.

In addition, since the number of coins per level after level 100 was
exponentially larger, it was more advantageous to buy a skill using the
same amount of coins. Now the situation was different.

[All your stats have exceeded 200!]

[Your incarnation body can handle a bigger

'status'.] I needed a strong body, not a powerful

skill.

[Your agility has reduced the air resistance.]

[Magic power is opening up the blocked bloodstream.]

A huge amount of coins was transforming my incarnation body.

[Your strength is causing an explosive change!]

The frequency of my footsteps and the speed at which the landscape passed
in my vision changed drastically.

"Yoo Joonghyuk!"
Of course, it was impossible to surpass the constellations or transcendents.
Still, it was enough to confront them for a while.

[Many constellations are envying your incarnation body.]

I crossed the wilderness at a tremendous speed and the center of the
battlefield finally entered my eyes. At the center, I could see a dying
person.

"You idiot! What are you doing?"

In front of Surya's radiant light, Yoo Joonghyuk was dying. I didn't know
where his left arm had gone and steam was rising from his charred body.
Even so, Yoo Joonghyuk was gripping the Black Heavenly Demon Sword
without moving an inch. Yoo Joonghyuk's head moved slowly towards me.
His voice wasn't heard, as if he had no strength to open his lips.

[The 'Fourth Wall' is greatly shaken.]

The words of the Mass Production Maker came to mind. The constellations
were also just part of this great story. They were also lonely and had to do
these things.

…Bullshit.

[Get lost!]

The Founder of Humanity stood in front of me and wielded the Primitive
Spear.

[The exclusive skill 'Electrification' Lv. 12 (+2) has been activated.]

White lightning exploded from my fist and the battlefield filled with a blue
light.

[Kuaaack!]
The confused constellations supported the thrown back Manu and raised
their status. The magic power poured towards me like a tsunami. My
strengthened body withstood the mighty power of the constellations.

The flesh of my fist cracked and blood flowed down but it was still
bearable. The constellations blinked as the dust settled down. They didn't
know I had this much power and were shocked.

[Stop him!]

A blue-white energy flew towards the constellations. In an instant, there
were abrasions on my back and thighs as well as a long stab in my side.

"Yoo Joonghyuk!"

My cry didn't reach him properly. Yoo Joonghyuk had fallen to his knees
and his life was now flickering. No magic power could be felt from him.
Yoo Joonghyuk was dying.

I held my breath and then shouted with the greatest true voice possible.
[Asmodeus!]

The true voice burst out and the constellations blocked their ears for a
moment. The historical-grade constellations couldn't stop and tears poured
from my eyes. I shouted again.

[If you are a demon king, keep your promise!]

The situation was so big that I didn't expect much. He was a shrewd guy
and should know how dangerous it was to take my side right now.
However, it was Asmodeus…

As if waiting, one star in the sky flashed. There was a storm coming in and
something was descending.

[The demon king 'Devil of Lust and Wrath' has appeared in this world!]
A tremendous probability was flowing and a colossal presence was
manifesting before my eyes as an incarnation body. A little girl surrounded
by a dark aura raised her head.

It was the king of the Demon Realm who immediately subdued the
transcendent Yoo Joonghyuk. Later, he would join one of the worst
organizations in the world, the 'Seekers of the End'.

[D-Demon king!]

The 32nd demon king, Asmodeus started running wild.

[Ahahahahaha!]

He laughed and a huge rake appeared at the fingers of the demon king.
Asmodeus' 'Bloody Grip' scraped through the area and tore at the
constellations.

[Kuaaaack!]

[The mad demon king!]

[What the hell is this?]

The constellations turned their gaze towards me and I triggered Way of the
Wind to snatch Yoo Joonghyuk.

[Chase him!]

The constellations started running but my strengthened incarnation body
was a bit faster than them. I ran with all my strength while carrying Yoo
Joonghyuk on my shoulder. "Wake up please."

Yoo Joonghyuk was barely breathing. The weight of his body was lighter
than usual. He had suffered such severe pain that even the skeleton of his
body seemed changed. I listened to his gradually fading heart beat and cried
out, "Hey, don't mess around! You can recover! Do something!"
However, Yoo Joonghyuk didn't move. I called out to Biyoo and bought a
few more Great Return Pills. My left hand supported his body while my
right hand poured the pills into Yoo Joonghyuk's mouth.

No effect was visible. He didn't have the strength to swallow it. His
breathing slowed and became distant. The tips of Yoo Joonghyuk's toes
were breaking and his body was disappearing.

I used Way of the Wind to wrap around the debris and prevent them from
escaping. Even so, I couldn't prevent the dim light from emerging from his
heart.

I was well aware of this phenomenon. I had read the scene a few hundred
times and had to know what it was.

「 Yoo Joonghyuk had a thought. 」

"Don't think about it."

「 This life ends here. 」

"Dammit! Don't think about it!"

Story fragments were falling from Yoo Joonghyuk's cheeks. I was scared of
this story and slapped his cheek before crying out to the air.

"Shit! Don't go back! You jerk, leave him alone!"

[The sponsor of incarnation 'Yoo Joonghyuk' is looking at you.]

"You can still survive! This round isn't over! You can fight back against
this guy! I can save you!"

Yoo Joonghyuk's sponsor was silent. This guy always did the same thing.
He watched Yoo Joonghyuk suffering from death. He placed the soul of a
hopelessly broken man back into the world line of the past.
[The stigma 'Regression Lv. 3' has been activated!]

It was cruel. Was this really how it ended? How did I get here? Would Yoo
Joonghyuk really die here?

Then a single line emerged.

[Incarnation 'Yoo Joonghyuk' is looking at his sponsor.]

"…Yoo Joonghyuk?"

Yoo Joonghyuk, who became so ragged that his shape couldn't be
recognized, stared at his sponsor with a single bloody eye. Sparks appeared
around his disappearing body.

[Incarnation 'Yoo Joonghyuk' is resisting his sponsor.]

[All of the stories of incarnation 'Yoo Joonghyuk' is resisting death.]

This was something I had never seen in any round.

[The incarnation 'Yoo Joonghyuk' has refused to regress.]
              Chapter 270: Ep. 50 - Dokja's Story, VII


Yoo Joonghyuk's entire body was trembling.

「…I can't die. 」

「 I will never die here. 」

Yoo Joonghyuk's desperate will was being conveyed through Omniscient
Reader's Viewpoint.

"Hey, you…"

This Yoo Joonghyuk refused to 'regress'.

[The sponsor of incarnation 'Yoo Joonghyuk' is looking at his incarnation.]

Yoo Joonghyuk's sponsor was silent as this situation occurred for the first
time. It was a mysterious silence. It seemed to be both angry and sad. Or
perhaps there was no response. Not long after that, the gaze on Yoo
Joonghyuk disappeared.

[The stigma 'Regression Lv. 3' has been cancelled.]

Crazy, something like this was possible. The light of the stigma disappeared
and Yoo Joonghyuk once again sagged down. His barely opened eyes
closed and his mouth was mumbling something. I felt his desperate will to
live. It was Yoo Joonghyuk's unique commitment to somehow survive.

Yoo Joonghyuk's thoughts were heard in my head.

「 Break it down. So I can eat. 」

I pulled out another Great Return Pill, turned it to powder and poured it into
his mouth. The stories of the fallen man slowly stopped collapsing.

"…It's fine."

Yoo Joonghyuk was betting everything into this round. He decided to
forsake the premise that it was okay to fail a few times and to remain in this
world. Perhaps he had lost consciousness but Yoo Joonghyuk didn't say
anything else. Instead, the stories wrapped around Yoo Joonghyuk's body
shone brightly.

[The story 'Life and Death Companions' wants to continue.]

Life and Death Companions. It was a story that didn't exist for Yoo
Joonghyuk in the original novel.

「 "What is your relationship with Yoo Joonghyuk?"

"We are life and death companions. 」

It was at Chungmuro. It was clearly the conversation I had with Gong
Pildu. I couldn't help laughing. Now we would really live together or die
together.
I ran while holding on tightly to Yoo Joonghyuk. My party members
shouting in the distance could be seen.

I felt a hot heat behind me. Together with a fierce wind, fireballs narrowly
brushed over my head. The chasing constellations were already right behind
me.

[Did you call the demon king? Do you know what you have done?]

The constellations roared as a formidable aura poured towards me.

[Stupid bastard. Now the 73rd Demon Realm will perish!]

I shouted at Lee Hyunsung in front of me instead of replying to them. "Lee
Hyunsung-ssi!"

Yoo Joonghyuk's body flew through the air and Lee Hyunsung caught him.
At the same time, I turned around and reflexively punched out. A running
constellation collided with me and screamed.

Electrification struck the tail of the Scorpion Goddess and then Unbroken
Faith slashed at the Thunder Eating Bird. The Blade of Faith absorbed
power and shone brightly. Blood splashed and I unleashed with all the
power of Electrification.

The number of constellations that followed me was seven. It was a number
I couldn't afford by myself. The bigger problem was that the dark clouds in
the air were thickening. Dark clouds flocked like a sinister omen and the
stars shining towards the 73rd Demon Realm disappeared one by one.

In fact, this was why I didn't call Asmodeus until now. A series of dark
lightning fell from the sky and the frightened constellations jumped back.
Sparks flew in the air and the demon kings descended.

Now that Asmodeus was here, nothing was holding back the other demon
kings. Unfortunately, the demon kings weren't on my side.
[The demon king 'Maker of Discord' has appeared in the Demon Realm!]

[The demon king 'Monarch who is a Philosopher about Corpses' has
appeared in the Demon Realm!]

The summoning of the incarnation bodies alone seemed to surpass the other
constellations. Now there was no one who could help me.

[The 73rd Demon Realm is responding to your story.]

The only thing I could believe in was the stories I had built.

"Everybody, step back! Maintain your strength as much as possible while I
buy time!"

Then one of the party members went wild. There was a roaring sound from
my side.

"Department Head-nim? What…"

Han Myungoh activated One-Legged Swift Runner and started running
somewhere at a tremendous speed. It was the direction I came from. It was
the place that contained Demon King Asmodeus.




[Ahahahahaha!]

Demon King Asmodeus laughed cheerfully. Arrows of light struck all over
his body and blood flowed from his torn arm. However, only feelings of
pleasure and joy could be seen on the face of the little girl.

[I'm happy! This is fun!]
Many constellations lost their incarnation bodies due to the Bloody Grip.
However, there were still many constellations remaining.

The demon kings were basically existences equal to narrative-grade
constellations. Normal constellations were unknown but there was no
chance for Asmodeus to win against one of the Lokapala, Surya.

Surya opened his mouth like he couldn't understand. [I wonder why, Devil
of Lust and Wrath.]

There was the sound of a giant drum bursting in the distance. Perhaps the
constellations chasing the Demon King of Salvation were having the final
showdown.

Surya couldn't understand it.

Why were these humans still resisting? Why was a demon king taking sides
with a human?

Asmodeus smiled like he was slightly exhausted. Surya raised his left hand
and the attacks of the constellations ceased.

[Asmodeus, why are you siding with trivial humans?]

[Siding… I'm not siding with anyone.] Asmodeus grinned while licking the
blood on his hands. [It just seems fun.]

[…Fun?]

[You don't know. What is the story of the Demon King of Salvation?]

[I also saw it. It is a common story.]

Asmodeus made a big fuss at the words.
[Hahahaha! Surya! You must've lost your eyes from all the light pouring
out! I told you before. If you want to enjoy the stories for a long time, take
good care of your eyesight.]

[…I admit that the child is a good one among the new stars. However, it is
a normal level in the Star Stream. He doesn't yet have a myth-grade story.]
Surya frowned as his status spread out.

Asmodeus was still laughing. [A myth-grade story… you have lived for
a long time but you are still judging the stories by that?] [It is only
human history. No evaluation is needed.]

[All stories eventually depart from history.]

[…Asmodeus, you played around in the Gourmet Association and now
you're saying this. Then do you want to keep going? You will eventually
lose your incarnation body.]

[Well, I suppose. But before that…] The constellation was narrowing the
distance one step at a time and Asmodeus suddenly opened his mouth. [By
the way Surya, why are you obsessed with the Demon King of Salvation?]

[…Obsessed? What do you mean?]

[It isn't just you but the nebulae. Isn't that right?]

[It seems you are the one who is blind.]

[At best, it is human history as you said. Yet you and Vedas keep trying to
recruit the Demon King of Salvation. You failed and now you're trying to
kill him. This isn't exactly like a giant nebula.]

[…]
[At this point, I want to ask something. Why are you doing this?]

Surya had no words for a moment. There was a subtle emotion on his face.
Surya hurriedly raised his right hand as if to hide his feelings. It was a sign
for the constellations to attack. At this moment,

Asmodeus said, [Wait, ahaha… hahaha. I see. Surya…]

[…]

[You… I heard about what happened at the Gourmet Association.

Surya's raised hand stopped.

[The Demon King of Salvation is pursuing the 'last scenario'. That's why
you hate him. Right?]

Surya's fingers trembled, showing his agitation. Asmodeus scoffed at the
shaking.

[It is because you can't get the qualification of the end.]

A spear of light pierced Asmodeus' body. Asmodeus' lips held a deep
ridicule as he was constantly pierced by spears of light.

Blood dripped down. The urgently implemented incarnation body was
much weaker than usual. Asmodeus held the intestines that were flowing
from his torn skin.

[…The human body is really uncomfortable.]

Asmodeus ignored the incoming constellations and looked up at the sky.
Stars could be seen through the dark cloud. The light and darkness in the
sky were competing against each other.
The strong existences surrounding the 73rd Demon Realm were moving.
Asmodeus had lived for a long time but he hadn't seen something like this
before.

Today, something tremendous was happening in the Demon Realm.

Surya's spear of light moved and the constellations poured magic power
towards Asmodeus. The moment that Asmodeus' incarnation body was
going to die.

Dududududu!

A cloud of dust obscured the view of the constellation. The astonished
constellations paused for a moment and someone embraced Asmodeus'
small body. Even Asmodeus was surprised this time. He had lived for many
years but had never been saved by anyone.

[You…?]

Han Myungoh was running while carrying him. One arm and a part of Han
Myungoh's left arm had disappeared from the constellations' attacks.

Asmodeus muttered with a bemused expression. [Why…]

He knew the identity of this person but Asmodeus couldn't understand why
this person came here. Han Myungoh might be a member of his household
but this loyalty…

Han Myungoh strongly hugged Asmodeus without answering. A blind and
big heart could be felt. The emotions weren't directed at Asmodeus.

Asmodeus smiled as he was held in Han Myungoh's arms.

[Really, this scenario is truly interesting…]
"I'm sorry everyone. I think you have to come with me."

The moment Kim Dokja said, this, Lee Hyunsung was the first to stand up.

"I was waiting."

Yoo Sangah and the Breaking the Sky Master followed while the frightened
Shin Yoosung clenched her fists. Osu, who was the size of a guinea pig,
barked.

It was a humbling power but they were determined. Humans didn't back
down in front of the 'status' of the constellations.

There was an explosion and the battle began. One blow broke bones, two
blows caused a deep wound and three blows couldn't guarantee their life.

The demon kings were making things more and more chaotic. The demon
kings flew through the air like released strings.

"Kuheeok!" It was Lee Hyunsung who flopped down first.

The chimera dragon screamed as its wings were broken.

Jang Hayoung sat down and watched all of it. "Ah, ahh. Ah…"

Jang Hayoung was overcome by overwhelming helplessness and couldn't
move. The Breaking the Sky Swordsmanship that Jang Hayoung learnt was
too weak. The techniques he learnt through the wall weren't enough to deal
with the constellations.

Jang Hayoung held the place that was hit by the demon king and gazed at
the fighting Kim Dokja.
The Demon King of Salvation he had long wanted to meet was struggling.

His ribs and right arm were broken. Jang Hayoung wanted to fight together.
Only the stars in the sky were shining without mercy. There were so many
stars so why wasn't anyone helping them?

[The exclusive skill 'Unidentified Wall' is activated!]

In fact, he had done it many times already. He sent messages several times
to the modifiers Kim Dokja mentioned but there was no reply.
Nevertheless, Jang Hayoung kept sending unanswered prayers to the
constellations.

'Please, please just one person'.

[The Unidentified Wall asks, "Do you really want to help?]

The wall was slightly vibrating.

[The Unidentified Wall asks, "Do you really want to help?]

He nodded. 'I want to help. I can accept any price. Please'.

The next moment, numerous messages appeared in front of Jang Hayoung's
eyes.

–Hello. Do you perhaps know Kim Dokja? He is looking for
constellations…

–Hello constellation. You don't know me but I have to ask a favour… if
Kim
Dokja…

–Constellation, please help me. Kim Dokja is in danger.

–Please help. Please…
…

Jang Hayoung read the hundreds of messages that surfaced in front of him
with a blank expression.

They were all messages from himself.

[There are currently 124 messages waiting to be sent.]

To be exact, they were messages he thought he had sent.

"W-Why…?"

Goosebumps covered his entire body. It was the reason why a reply didn't
come from numerous constellations.

[The Unidentified Wall said, "I was told not to send it"]

"Who?"

[The Unidentified Wall says, "It is an existence higher than me."]

He didn't know who it was. However, Jang Hayoung could see what he
had to do now. "Send them. Right now! Send all of them!" The
Unidentified Wall was silent for a moment.

[The Unidentified Wall is sighing. "Don't regret it."]

The next moment, his head was going to burst from the pain.

[124 messages have been sent.]

Like water being discharged from a damn, numerous messages were
released from Jang Hayoung and flew through the sky. Time passed. One
minute, two minutes… Jang Hayoung stared up at the sky without releasing
the string of hope.
[The constellation 'One-Eyed Maitreya' has entered the channel.]

Then somebody answered. Similar to a meteor shower, the sound of people
entering the channel didn't stop.

[The constellation 'Brash Swamp Predator' has entered the channel.]

[The constellation 'Seo Ae Il Pil' has entered the channel.]

[The constellation 'First Spiritualist of Joseon' has entered the channel.]

[The constellation 'Goryeo's First Sword' has entered the channel.]

[The constellation of a small planet has entered the channel.]

The distorted balance of the sky changed and Jang Hayoung listened to all
the messages with joy and despair.

[The constellation 'Secretive Plotter' has entered the channel.]
              Chapter 271: Ep. 50 - Dokja's Story, VIII


I raised my head at the entrance of the constellations.

[Constellations who favour you are looking at you.]

All of them were constellations who had once sided with me.

[The constellation 'Seo Ae Il Pil' is looking at you.]

[The constellation 'First Spiritualist of Joseon' is looking at you.]

Among them were constellations of Earth.

[The constellation 'Goryeo's First Sword' is looking at you.]

There was also Cheok Jungyeong who I couldn't contact for a while.
However, there was an even more welcome existence.

[The constellation 'Secretive Plotter' is looking at you.]
Secretive Plotter. I didn't know his exact identity. All I knew was that he
favoured me and watched my scenarios.

[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' is clasping both hands
together gently.]

[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' is forming fists.]

[The constellation 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' is grunting and looking at
you.]

All four of my early constellations had now gathered.

[Your story is being created in the 73rd Demon Realm.]

All the gazes poured towards me and I felt like I had returned to the
beginning of the story.

Surya spoke.

[Child, I know your expectations but they won't help you. The
constellations are clever and won't make foolish choices like you humans.]

I saw my colleagues who were barely standing. My colleagues were
centered around the fallen Yoo Joonghyuk.

Surya laughed. [None of them will want to be the enemy of a nebula…]

As soon as he spoke, an earthquake occurred between Surya and I. The
ground quickly became damp and turned into a sticky swamp. In the swamp
where I would be sucked in if I took a step, someone was waking up.

I immediately noticed who it was.

[The constellation 'Brash Swamp Predator' has appeared in the Demon
Realm!]
The Brash Swamp Predator. He was a constellation of the Gourmet
Association. He had fallen into debt and was dragged away by the
Executive Branch.

It was a lizard that was over 30 meters. The ancient lizard that awakened
from the swamp let out a resounding roar. The Breaking the Sky Master
recognized the Brash Swamp Predator and growled.

If I was right, this time he wasn't my enemy.

I smiled and asked, "Have you come to pay off your debts?"

In the past, the Mass Production Maker had advised me: Don't make too
many enemies.

[…I could've paid them back if you hadn't helped me!]

The giant lizard turned his head and showed hostility towards the
constellations.

[I don't like them very much. That's why I came!]

The giant lizard finished the short conversation and rushed to the
constellations. The constellations shouted at the monster who was running
towards them.

The Brash Swamp Predator was a narrative-grade constellation. He was
scary when he was an enemy but I couldn't feel reassured now that he was
on the same side. The angry Surya cried out,

[Lackey of the Gourmet Association… aren't you afraid of the nebula?]

[Nebula? Hahahaha! Since when has the Gourmet Association cared for
such a thing?]

Many members of the Gourmet Association were heretics of the Star
Stream. They were those who practiced their will, regardless of whether
they belonged to a nebula or not. The Brash Swamp Predator wasn't part of
a nebula and was one of the most free-spirited in the Gourmet Association.

[Kuaaack!]

The giant lizard swung his tail and the surface of the ground split apart
while fragments shot up. The Thunder Eating Bird and Mysterious Bird of
the Nile rushed towards him. The huge monsters started to fight and the
surroundings quickly became a mess. In the center of the mess, Surya rose
to the sky and looked down at me.

[One garbage doesn't change the result.]

Surya's light flooded towards me. It wasn't easy to avoid even if I used Way
of the Wind and Electrification. I couldn't contend with a Lokapala but I
didn't give up. My skin was torn and my bones were exposed. In the middle
of this pain, I somehow tried to buy time.

My nerves were focused on the system message in the air.

[The winner of the second game will soon be announced.]

The winner of the game was decided. No matter how strong the presence
that delayed the scenario, there was a limit. In other words, I only needed to
buy time and we would win this game.

[Child, it won't work out as you wish.]

I could feel a lot of probability moving. It was a probability originally not
allowed for this scenario. The probability offered by Vedas was moving.
The balance in the sky changed and the scales of probability were leaning.

[Vedas' will has come here.]

A bright sun shone behind Surya. Sweat flowed as my body felt like it was
melting. One, two, three, four… the light sources burnt the ground. I was
unable to look at Surya since I would be blinded so I focused on his
shadow.

[The story 'King of the Twelve Suns' is shining.]

This was Surya of Vedas. He was a king who united the twelve sun gods.

[Do you see the difference in status now?]

My exhausted party members fell down and groaned.

"U-Uhhhh…"

The Brash Swamp Predator struggled painfully and the only constellations
looked up at Surya with awe. Surya was powerful but he became even more
powerful when the 'Destruction Scenario' of Vedas ended. Surya, the sun
god who absorbed all the power of Vivasvat and Savitr, became a monster
who turned the Earth of the 265th round of Ways of Survival into a hell of
fire.

Still, no matter how strong the enemy, I had to struggle.

[The stigma 'Song of the Sword Lv. 3' has been used.]

[Your sword is filled with the words left by the Duke of Loyalty and
Warfare.]

「 In the night, a god appeared in his dream and said, "You will win big if
you do this. Otherwise, you will lose." 」

It was a verse I heard when dealing with the lesser dragon.

[It is the stigma of a historical-grade constellation. You are using a petty
trick.]

Thanks to the effect of the skill, it was like I wore sunglasses and could see
the light source in front of me. As I recalled, this verse had the effect of
telling the enemy's weakness through colour. The green showed the strong
areas and the red showed the weak areas. I stared at Surya with my eyes
wide open.

I stared and stared again. Cold sweat flowed down my back.

[Yes, what are you seeing?]

The smiling Surya was slowly approaching me.

[You can keep stealing stigmas. You might have risen to become a
constellation but you were born human.]

Surya's whole body was green. I couldn't see any weaknesses.

[A human history can't transcend a god. There is no such thing in the Star
Stream.]

I couldn't deal with Surya alone. It was impossible even with the Brash
Swamp Predator's help. I threw my torn coat and spoke.

"…The balance of probability is tilted. This means I can put more weights
on it."

[The balance won't tilt, no matter how comes.]

My story wasn't a myth. I wasn't a god or a hero. My story might be a
common one in the Star Stream.

[Constellations in the night sky are making a decision.]

Even so, someone in this world was listening intently to my story.

"That remains to be seen! Come, Goryeo's First Sword!"

There were explosive sparks and a meteor fell through the dark clouds.
[The constellation 'Goryeo's First Sword' is responding to your call.]

A spectacular sword energy tore through the sky. It was the Three Sword
Style I had previously seen.

[Who called me, Cheok Jungyeong?}

The sword struck like a thunderbolt and deeply wounded one of Surya's
suns. Along with the blinding explosion, Surya's voice was heard.

[A trivial historical-grade constellation dares…!]

A hot flash flooded towards the ground and something thumped against the
ground, sending me and my colleagues back. Once I came to my senses, I
was in the arms of a man. In terms of size, he was no smaller than the
Breaking the Sky Sword Saint.

[It has been a long time, Descendant.]

The magnificent sight of Goryeo's First Sword was in front of me.

"It's been a long time, old man. Your status has changed."

The historical-grade Cheok Jungyeong was now narrative-grade.

[It is all thanks to you. Several things happened.]

I had expected it. Cheok Jungyeong had joined in the fight against the outer
god. He would've gained a powerful story and risen to a higher level.

[The debt can finally be repaid.]

Cheok Jungyeong stared up at the sky and the indirect messages of the
constellations followed.

[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' is murmuring to
himself in anger.]
[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' is started gloomily.]

Perhaps the other constellations also wanted to come here. However, there
were constraints on probability and they couldn't move in front of the
nebula's eyes.

In particular, Uriel belonged to Eden and the problem was more
complicated. If she did something wrong, a great war between good and
evil might occur…

I wasn't disappointed despite not receiving help from Uriel.

"It's coming."

Surya's beams of light were coming in waves.

[…I knew that the gods on the Indian side don't play around but they are
truly monsters.]

Cheok Jungyeong protected me and cut down the waves of light. However,
Cheok Jungyeong's blade was slightly corroded.

[I might be able to cut the great mountain and the sea but I haven't cut the
sun yet. If I knew there was such a monster, I would've brought 'Ye'.]

'Ye' was probably the sun hunter in Chinese mythology. He seemed to be an
acquaintance of Cheok Jungyeong. Even so, Ye wouldn't be able to deal
with Surya, a constellation with the constitution of an 'emperor'.

[I'll deal with you!]

The Founder of Humanity rushed towards Cheok Jungyeong. The great
men fought and the surrounding area was devastated by the sword energy.

[The 73rd Demon Realm is snooping around your story.]
Then something flowed from my chest up towards the sky. They were the
'sentences' I obtained from the last game. Surya shouted with a thunderous
voice.

[What are you doing? There is no time left! Kill them quickly!]

These sentences were materials that made up the giant story. Finally, the
giant story of this world started to fluctuate.

[The demon king 'Maker of Discord' is showing hostility towards you.]

The passive demon kings finally started moving. The heat sent from the
Maker of Discord blew me through the air and I felt the pain of my entire
body tearing apart.

I had two allies but the battlefield was outrageously disadvantageous. The
demon kings released their strength and the scales of probability once again
creaked.

I needed the help of more people but who could deal with these powerful
demon kings? I thought hard but couldn't figure out a constellation who
would help. Suddenly, the approaching demon kings slowed down.

"Fire with full force!"

There was the sound of cannon fire along with a familiar girl's voice.

"Ahjussi! It's me!"

[The constellation 'Maritime War God' is looking at you.]

"I'm sorry I'm late!"

On the moat in a distant part of the industrial complex, Lee Jihye's ghost
fleet was firing towards this side. The indirect messages of the angry demon
kings filled the air. Two demon kings turned towards Lee Jihye.
"Jihye!"

It was good that she came to help but it was unreasonable with only Lee
Jihye. Her opponents were two demon kings. If she did something reckless,
she would be killed immediately.

"Run away!"

I quickly moved but it wasn't easy due to all the injuries I had suffered. The
demon kings were entering Lee Jihye's vicinity. This couldn't continue.
This… if I used Way of the Wind…

Then someone grabbed my shoulder. "Dokja-ssi, doing things alone
again… I told you not to be like this."

Was it because I had been burnt by Surya's light for too long? I couldn't see
the woman's face properly. However, I knew who she was from her voice
alone.

"I'm late because I lost the coin toss. Don't be too upset."

The woman walked towards the demon kings.

"Wait a minute! Heewon-ssi!"

Jung Heewon was strong. She probably became stronger after doing the
personal scenarios. Nevertheless, it was too unreasonable for her to deal
with a demon king. Even if she used Judgment Time against the demon
king…

"I know what you're thinking but don't worry."

Was I mistaken? Angelic wings seemed to overlap on her back.

"It is because I'm not fighting."
It was a huge 'status' I had never felt before. The demon king rushing
towards Lee Jihye looked over with an astonished expression. The power of
the constellation descended towards Jung Heewon, covering the entire
Demon Realm and turning it silver for a moment.

[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' has appeared in the 73rd
Demon Realm.]
                 Chapter 272: Ep. 51 - Giant Story, I


Archangel Uriel had appeared in the 73rd Demon Realm. In the latter half
of the original novel, Uriel had descended directly in an incarnation body.
However, now it was only the 25th scenario.

The confused mutters of the demon kings and constellations could be heard.

[W-What ridiculous…]

The transparent shape of Uriel appeared behind Jung Heewon, who had
closed her eyes. Along with a splendid aura, Uriel's long golden hair waved
in the air.

The balance of probability was leaning again. The completely out of
equilibrium balance was gradually being restored with the appearance of
Uriel. No, now it felt like this side was becoming heavier.

The even more surprising thing wasn't Uriel's power. All fights on the
battlefield ceased. Surya watched with tense eyes while all the fighting
constellations stopped. The descent of an archangel was also a tremendous
event for the constellations.

The first one to speak with a demon king with an owl's face who was
holding a burning sword. [Archangel! You dare… you dare appear here?]

I knew who he was. Maker of Discord. The demon king of the 63rd Demon
Realm, Andras. He had cursed Han Sooyoung who once killed his
subordinate.

Then the demon king beside him also opened his mouth. [D-D-Do you want
to be a corpse, archangel?]

A skeleton wearing a crown and green armor. The Monarch who is a
Philosopher about Corpses. He was the demon king of the 54th Demon
realm, Murmur.

They might be lower ranked demon kings but they were both stronger than
me. Even so, there was a strange feeling in the expressions of these two
strong existences. It was fear.

After her descent, Uriel slowly opened her eyes. Her stunning emerald eyes
took in the world and the colour of the world changed. I felt like my heart
was frozen despite not even making eye contact with her.

[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' is looking at the 73rd Demon
Realm.]

The archangel's gaze implied 'destruction'. It was a gaze that looked at the
last mountain of the world for the sake of purifying the world. The 73rd
Demon Realm trembled at her gaze.

[■■. Hasn't it been a while?]

The two demon kings took a few steps back. Jung Heewon's mouth curved
subtly.
[You… didn't I previously tell you not to carry that blade before me? I'm
annoyed because of the overlapping characteristics.]

At the words, Andras slightly lowered the burning sword. Andras' owl eyes
blinked rapidly and Murmur's skeletal jaw shook violently. It was Murmur
who stepped forward first.

[Foolish archangel! Do you know what your action means? Or… has Eden
decided to intervene in the selection…]

[■. I came on my own.]

I was reminded of Uriel's setting. I had forgotten due to Uriel's kindness
towards me but she was one of the most fearsome archangels of Eden.

The Demon-like Judge of Fire. She was crueler than any archangel and
slaughtered the most demons. She raised her hand towards the air and a
white flame sword appeared. In front of her sword, all flames extinguished
like a tribute.

It was the sword containing the flames of hell. This was Uriel's star relic.
The moment she pulled out her sword, the demon kings made an urgent
expression.

[Did you forget the agreement?]

[Eat ■. ■ ■■ like you.]

[What?]

[Ah, ■ hit. The ■ filtering…]

The archangels of Eden had their own filtering in order to preserve the
dignity of their nebula. Then Uriel glanced at me.

[Kim Dokja?]
Did I look too nervous? Uriel smiled awkwardly at me.

[…Ah, hello?]

It was an embarrassing and awkward greeting compared to her former
appearance.

[Many constellations are speechless.]

[The constellation 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' is pointing out that it
doesn't match.]

The demon kings, who had just been threatened, watched with an absurd
expression. I regained my senses and bowed. "It has been a while, Uriel."

[Yes!]

Uriel laughed.

[You are loved by an archangel!]

[You have acquired a new story!]

[The story 'Person Who is Loved by an Archangel' has been acquired!]

Maybe she thought I was afraid and bombarded me with indirect messages
filled with caring. Frankly, I was a bit impressed. There were a few
constellations who favoured me so far. Even so, there was no one who
helped me as much as Uriel.

I didn't do anything for her. I was always the one on the receiving end.
Even so, Uriel came here today for me.

Uriel raised Jung Heewon's arms and exclaimed triumphantly. [Don't worry
Kim Dokja! I'll kill them all for you!]
I knew this was a performance. This was the Demon Realm. It was obvious
that something would happen if an archangel exerted their power here.
Nevertheless, for Uriel to say so…

"…Uriel?"

Kwaaaaaaah!

"Wait a minute! Uriel!"

Hell flames rose from Uriel's sword and continuously soared towards the
sky. This was the true Hell Flames Ignition. It was the real power of Uriel
that could turn the world into a sea of flames with one blow.

[T-The archangel is crazy! Run away!]

[Completely crazy!]

The freaked out constellations started to flee. I didn't think Uriel would
exert her real power. The hiding Dokgak finally appeared.

[W-Wait a minute. Archangel, please calm down!]

His cunning face was flushed. The scenario was delayed until
the announcement of the winner and now… Uriel spoke like she
had read my mind.

[■.]

[Y-Yes?]

[Scenario ■! Dokkaebi ■ck, ■ guys.]

Uriel had a really angry expression. The sky of the Demon Realm was
howling from her rage. The moment that the archangel's sword was going
to touch the ground.
[The demon king 'Immeasurable Austerity' is furious.]

The black magic power in the sky was raging wildly.

[The demon king 'Ruler of the East Hell' is staring at the archangel.]

[The demon king 'Devil of Principles' is raising his status.]

[The demon king 'Black Mane Lion' is heading towards Eden.]

The fearsome and highly ranked demon kings appeared one by one in the
channel. Dammit, there was going to be a war in the Demon Realm.

However, the demon kings weren't the only ones who appeared.

[The constellation 'Guardian of Youths and Travel' has entered the
channel.]

[The constellation 'Lily Blooming in Aquarius' has entered the channel.]

[The constellation 'Commander of the Red Cosmos' has entered the
channel.]

The highest level constellations who could make everyone nervous just by
appearing. The major constellations of Eden entered the channel and the
volume of the channel grew drastically. Biyoo trembled like it was painful.

[The constellation 'Scribe of Heaven' is watching the 'Demon-like Judge of
Fire' with severe eyes.]

Uriel's sword trembled. It felt like time had frozen. All the demon kings and
archangels were concentrating on Uriel's sword. The future of the Demon
Realm and Eden depended on the direction of this sword.

[The demon kings of the Demon Realm and the archangels of Eden have
opened an emergency meeting.]
[All this time, all demon kings and archangels in the scenario will be
urgently summoned.]

There was the sound of a great probability moving and Uriel's sword
disappeared in the air.

Jung Heewon's body shook as the energy of the archangel left the Demon
Realm. Uriel glanced at me with a light smile.

[I wanted to help you until the end.]

In hindsight, I realized Uriel's intentions.

[T-This! This can't be!]

It wasn't just Uriel who disappeared. The demon kings who descended
slowly disappeared in the sparks of probability. Uriel sacrificed herself to
tie up the hands and feet of all the demon kings here.

[…It is amazing.] Cheok Jungyeong muttered to himself with admiration.
[A majestic archangel making such a great sacrifice for you…]

I could easily predict the great punishment Uriel would face. An archangel
who broke the convention of the Good-Evil War with her own will. She
would probably receive harsh sanctions from Eden.

[Please win, Kim Dokja.]

I reached out to the disappearing Uriel but she had already scattered into
ashes. I quickly embraced the fallen Jung Heewon. Jung Heewon had just
taken on Uriel's status and fell asleep with an exhausted face.

I raised my head as I felt pressure from the sky and saw Surya watching
everything.

[My judgment was wrong. I didn't think you were a constellation who could
call an archangel here.]
Thanks to Uriel, there was no need to worry about the participation of the
demon kings. However, there was something worse.

A more serious light appeared in the eyes of the silent Surya. The same was
true for King Oedipus and Manu who were guarding the left and right of
Surya.

[From now on, I will be sincere.]

Surya's new energy shot through the sky. The surrounding air changed and
a huge wind pressure hit the area. After a while…

"W-What is that?"

My party members approached me one by one. The first one to speak was
the weary Jang Hayoung. "When will this hell end… what the hell is that?"
Beyond the radiant sun, something was flying through the distant universe.
Something was ripping through the air. It was like the sound of meteorites
colliding.

I looked closely and a huge carriage was flying towards this place.
Whenever the gigantic golden mare accelerated, the entire Demon Realm
shook like it was going to burst.

"…A carriage?"

Could this thing be called a carriage? No, should it be called a locomotive?
No words fit. The only thing certain was that the object that was a size that
couldn't be understood with common sense was heading towards this
direction. It would be a disaster for this world.

Yoo Sangah opened her mouth. "Surya's chariot. According to legend, it is
over 130,000 kilometers in length…"

"130,000? Does that make sense?"
Jang Hayoung asked and Yoo Sangah shook her head. "…That's why it's a
myth."

The Indian myths claimed that giant turtles and elephants held up the earth.
Thus, it wasn't strange if a locomotive of such a huge scale appeared. The
problem was that we had to deal with that disaster.

[You have watched a part of the giant story, Vedas.]

[Your story comprehension has increased.]

…Was this the 'sincerity' mentioned by Surya? I admired the 'status' that
caused chills to go through my body. I felt overwhelming despair just
because it approached this side. I had only watched 'some' of it but this
strength was different from an ordinary 'story'. It was the reason why I had
to get a giant story.

[Shit, run!]

Some constellations were already hiding from the rushing carriage. There
were no constellations who would be safe after being hit by it.

Cheok Jungyeong muttered, [Things are really difficult. He seems to truly
want to destroy this world.]

"…Are you scared?"

[No, it's interesting.]

Cheok Jungyeong laughed like he was truly having fun. The moment I tried
to say something to my party members, someone stood beside me. It wasn't
Cheok Jungyeong or a constellation.

"…You woke up?"

I looked over and saw Yoo Joonghyuk standing up with the Black
Heavenly Demon Sword.
[The character 'Yoo Joonghyuk' has used Recovery Lv. 10!]

Yoo Joonghyuk's body had finally healed to the point where he could use
Recovery. The last of Yoo Joonghyuk's vitality was burning on the dark
sword. The mouth and vocal cords were still slow to recover so Yoo
Joonghyuk didn't speak. Instead, I heard Yoo Joonghyuk's thoughts through
Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint.

「 Kim Dokja. 」

"Yes."

Perhaps this would be the last fight in the Demon Realm.

[The 73rd Demon Realm is focused on your choice.]

This time, I couldn't guarantee anything. Someone here could die. Maybe
Yoo Joonghyuk and I would die. Nevertheless, I declared, "Let's go."

Yoo Sangah and Lee Hyunsung nodded while Shin Yoosung climbed onto
the chimera dragon. Lee Jihye looked at the sky from the moat and also
nodded.

There were no longer any constellations to help us. Now there were only
humans here. This didn't mean it was a fight with no chance of winning. It
was because I had already bought enough time thanks to Uriel.

[The 73rd Demon Realm is responding to your choice.]

Perhaps it was a mistake for Surya to show his sincerity. In the face of the
coming calamity, we wouldn't be the only ones who would come to an end.
Just like First Murim in the Destruction Scenario, the 73rd Demon Realm
approached the time of choice.

[Giant Story of the 73rd Demon Realm is germinating.]
There was no world that wanted its master to be the one that destroyed
itself.

[The 73rd Demon Realm has chosen its master.]

The perplexed dokkaebis and constellations let out exclamations at this
message. However, I didn't hear any of them. It was because now I wasn't
listening to the story, I was talking to the story.

[Your 'giant story' has started talking.]
                Chapter 273: Ep. 51 - Giant Story, II


Surya floated in the air and looked down at the ground with a complicated
gaze.

The 73rd Demon Realm was surrounded by a bright light as sentences were
woven into one being.

It was the sight of the world choosing its master before the enormous
destruction flying from the universe.

Surya muttered, [It is only the 25th scenario yet a giant story has been
obtained… There is such a thing in the Star Stream.]

Surya had lived for a long time but he couldn't come up with a name. There
was Heracles of Olympus but he was a half-god, not a pure human. King
Oedipus exclaimed, [Surya, it's fine. It is still germinating and you can
crush
it!]
The 'giant story' was unlike any other story. It was the sum total of
numerous tales and a story that guaranteed a tremendous probability by
itself. However, it might be a giant story but it was only beginning. The
Demon King of Salvation was just a superficial being who fortunately rose
to the status of a constellation.

Nevertheless, why couldn't Surya easily feel confident?

[Surya, what's wrong with you? Let's finish it…]

All giant stories were the 'beginning of the end'. The story that headed
towards the end of this epic scenario. Even so, getting a giant story didn't
mean that everyone would get the 'qualification of the end'. Some giant
stories were connected with ■■ but others didn't go near the vicinity of ■■
before disappearing.

–Surya, it is because you can't get the qualification of the end.

He didn't forget Asmodeus' words. In his tranquil rage, a message entered
Surya's ears.

[A new scenario has been given to you!]

[You will be the destruction of the 73rd Demon Realm.]

Surya frowned at the undesirable role assignment.

'The Star Stream. What do you want from this old body?'

He lost one of his 12 suns to Cheok Jungyeong and wasted a great deal of
energy against Asmodeus. In addition, he had exhausted most of the
probability given to him.

[Surya. You don't have to go by the book. I have an idea. There is a way
to subdue them without fighting.] Surya frowned.
[Oedipus. Are you going to use a despicable trick again? Against humans?]

[T-That isn't it…]

[I am the Supreme God of Light, Surya.]

The great sentences of Vedas were shining in Surya's halo.

[Even if I can't use my full strength, I will never lose to humans.]

Oedipus shut his mouth in front of the overwhelming 'status'. Surya raised
his hand and the paused carriage started the violent charge again.




The locomotive made a deafening sound as it crashed through the
atmosphere. Red and blue flames sparked from the head. The first one to
speak was Yoo Joonghyuk. "It doesn't seem like 135,000 kilometers."

If a train of that size really appeared, it would seem like a giant planet was
falling. Cheok Jungyeong told me, [His words are correct. It is around 30
kilometers long. Still, that is enough to destroy this place. Demon King of
Salvation, what happened to the giant story?]

"It has just started talking. The sentences are slow to gather."

The giant story of the 73rd Demon Realm was safely obtained but things
weren't over just by receiving it.

"It needs more time to work properly. We have to slow down the train."

Perhaps this 'train' was all that the present Surya could mobilize. There was
a chance for us if we managed to block that train. I looked back and saw
Cheok Jungyeong already prepared to jump forward. "Please, Goryeo's
First Sword."
[Believe in me.]

Cheok Jungyeong shot forward towards the sky. Yoo Joonghyuk and I
chased after him and the rest of the group followed on Shin Yoosung's
chimera dragon. The Thunder Eating Bird and Mysterious Bird of the Nile
flew to interfere with us but the Brash Swamp Predator bit at their wings.

[Leave these guys to me!]

The closer we got to the head of the train, the more I realized the enormous
scale of Vedas. The width of the head of the train was a few hundreds
meters and it was at the level of an outer god.

[Haaaaaap!]

Cheok Jungyeong shouted and showed his Three Sword Style.

Two Swords Style, Two Sword Mountain Chop.

Cheok Jungyeong's slash that cut through a mountain hit the train. The head
of the train met Cheok Jungyeong's status and let out a strange sound. It
deviated from its course but the speed of the train didn't slow.

In the formidable heat, it was Cheok Jungyeong's sword slash that was
melted away. However, Cheok Jungyeong didn't stop.

Three Swords Style, Three Sword Ocean Chop.

A strike that cut the sea. It felt like there was a tsunami and the speed of the
train was reduced to a slight degree. The biggest achievement was the
explosion to the lead car, creating an internal access point.

[It will be easier to move inside! I will slow it down from outside!]

Cheok Jungyeong emitted a strong magic power from the head of the train.
Still, it was hard for Cheok Jungyeong to deal with an object of this speed
alone. "I'll help you ahjussi!"
Shin Yoosung's chimera dragon moved to the head of the train with Cheok
Jungyeong. The second-grade monster, the chimera dragon created intense
wind pressure and the speed of the train was further reduced. Cheok
Jungyeong cried out, [I have somehow bought 20 minutes. Surya will be in
the car at the end. Knock him down and this story will disappear! Go!]

We nodded and entered the interior of the train. The train looked like a
subway built for a giant. We adapted to the inertia to a certain extent and
pressed the button to go to the next compartment of the train.

[The door won't open.]

[This train is only available to the constellations of Vedas.]

Yoo Joonghyuk didn't hesitate to activate the Breaking the Sky
Swordsmanship and hit the door. There was a dent in the door but it didn't
open.

"…Amazing'.

Unlike Cheok Jungyeong's expectations, the train's internal strength was
formidable. It wouldn't be hard to break if Yoo Joonghyuk and I were in
good shape but the train was 30 kilometers long. In other words, we had to
consider the distribution of power.

Then the first sentence of the giant story was heard.

「 The story started on the subway. 」

Sparks surged and my stories were released into the air. I felt waves surging
from a distant place. It was the sign of a very old story. I looked back and
the party members seemed to be feeling something similar.

[The first story of your 'giant story' has begun.]
Yoo Joonghyuk, Lee Hyunsung and Yoo Sangah looked at me. The sparks
that flowed like the tide was transforming the scenery around us. Lee
Hyunsung murmured with astonishment, "T-This…"

Every giant story was a different story. Some involved the birth of a hero
while others told the birth of a world. Our story wasn't a hero's biography or
a creation story. This story was our survival record.

The number '3807' was on the back door of the train. I looked around and
sighed. "…It is the subway."

All stories invoked Stage Transformation when the place or person
involved in the story collided.

–The 3807 car of the 3434 Bulgwang train.

It was where Yoo Sangah and Lee Hyunsung became my colleagues and
where I met Yoo Joonghyuk.

All of our stories started here. Lee Hyunsung's fists were clenched as he
opened his mouth with a tense expression. "I remember that time."

"It isn't a good memory but…"

Yoo Sangah was watching me with a faint smile.

"Even so, I often think about it."

It wasn't a memory I could happily recall. Someone's death and the hell of
an absurd scenario. It wasn't a memory I could feel nostalgic about but it
was a history that we survived. Lee Hyunsung smiled and placed his hand
on the door. "I think I can do it somehow."

「 There was a soldier who wanted to be righteous. 」

Eventually, everything became a story. It was hard, sad and even something
I wanted to forget. After all, everything was a story.
"Haaaaaap!"

I didn't expect it would be comforting for us now. There was only one thing
we could know.

[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' is watching your
party.]

[The constellation 'Secretive Plotter' is listening to your story.]

In a world where sadness and joy were useless, we had to continue the
story.
The door, which didn't open to Yoo Joonghyuk's Breaking the Sky
Swordsmanship, started to open at Lee Hyunsung's power. The giant story
dwelling in Lee Hyunsung's body started exerting its strength.

[The character 'Lee Hyunsung' has used the stigma 'Great Mountain Push
Lv.
10'.]

When I thought about it, Lee Hyunsung was the one who opened the door
to escape.

"Go. Quickly!"

Lee Hyunsung opened the gap and our party ran. Nevertheless, it was only
one door and the train was still long. This time, it was Yoo Joonghyuk who
came forward.

"I will break through next."

I suddenly remembered a long time ago. The regressor who annihilated the
other incarnations on the train and rushed forward like a tank was now in
front of me.

「 There was the strongest and loneliest man in the world. 」
Yoo Joonghyuk put away his sword and concentrated all his magic power
on his fist. Then he slammed his bare fist into the door. The door of the car,
which was unharmed before the sword, was torn apart by his bare hands.

This was the effect of Stage Transformation. It was unfortunate for Surya
that his main story was this 'train'.

"Dokja-ssi! I don't think we need to break this car!" Yoo Sangah figured
something out and yelled. Just like when I found the opening device, Yoo
Sangah found a way to open the car door without force.

「 There was also a woman who hid herself for others. 」

One car, another car. We kept moving forward. It was as if we were living
history again. There was the sound of hammering from the outside of the
train. Lee Jihye was also struggling to reduce the speed of the train.

「 The sword demon wounded after losing a relationship was met.」

The chimera dragon's roar was heard. In my arms, Biyoo raised her head
and looked at the head of the train. To be exact, it was in Shin Yoosung's
direction.

「 A child born in the gap between past and future wept. 」

The next moment, the chimera dragon let out a formidable roar. The train
tilted and the speed of the train was further reduced. I didn't know but I
thought Biyoo might've given something to Shin Yoosung here.

"We aren't halfway yet. We have to hurry."

As Yoo Joonghyuk stated, we were still far away from the end of the train.
More than 10 minutes had already passed. The speed might be reduced but
the industrial complex would be completely destroyed at this pace. To
make matters worse, we faced a challenge when we reached the next car.
A ray of light shot towards us. Lee Hyunsung blocked it for me and held his
shoulder.

[You can't go any further.]

'Founder of Humanity' Manu and several other constellations were waiting
there. Yoo Joonghyuk directly used Breaking the Sky Swordsmanship
against them but it wasn't enough to break through the constellations on the
defense. They knew they had to drag out time here.

I was going to use the magic power I had saved when the ceiling of the
train started to be squeezed. Something was destroying the train with an
immense magic power from outside.

[W-What… what's going on?]

It was at least a narrative-grade constellation. They couldn't destroy the
shell of the train unless they had the power to match Cheok Jungyeong.

"Mooooove!"

Then Jang Hayoung's voice was heard outside the train. "Kim Dokja! They
came! They came!"

The next moment, the entire ceiling was torn off and two beings appeared
with Jang Hayoung.

[The constellation of a small planet is looking at you.]

It was a small person filled with a brilliant blue-white energy and a huge
woman releasing a blue aura. Funnily enough, my vision seemed to blur for
a moment. "Where is my disciple?"

「 There was the strongest small person in the world as a teacher. 」

"It seems that we're a bit late."
「 The world of the strongest giant was saved. 」

They were existences with enough power as Cheok Jungyeong who could
help us.

[Transcendent…!]

In front of Manu, the two transcendents of First Murim descended. The
Breaking the Sky Sword Saint, Namgung Minyoung. The Paradox
Baekchung, Kyrgios Rodgraim.

Namgung Minyoung glanced at us and said, "Do it properly until the end.
Otherwise, I'll kick your ass."

Kyrgios stared at me and declared, "You will pay the price for lying to me.
I won't allow your death until then."

Kyrgios and the Breaking the Sky Sword Saint fired their skills at the door
to the next car. The energy of Breaking the Sky Swordsmanship and
Electrification combined and caused a formidable wind pressure to rise.

The constellations shrank back at their momentum. The fearsome waves of
magic power advanced and crushed the doors blocking our way. It was a
straight road prepared for a short period of time. Yoo Joonghyuk met my
gaze and we started running.

[The exclusive skill 'Way of the Wind Lv. 11 (+1) is activated!]

Way of the Wind and Red Phoenix Shunpo assisted each other as we ran.
We soon reached the last car of the train.

「 Finally, there was a man who knew the ending of all these worlds. 」

This story didn't exist in Ways of Survival. It was a story that never existed
before. It was a story that would lead me to the ending I wanted.

I opened the last door of the train.
                 Chapter 274: Ep. 51 - Giant Story, III


Surya was beyond the last door. Yoo Joonghyuk's fist struck the door and
broke it down, revealing a pierced skyline with strong winds. The last train
car with Surya was cut apart, as if it had been ripped out by something.

[You came sooner than expected.]

Surya stared at the sky and spoke with his back to us. A square space was
visible beyond the cut train. The light of the divine being stretched out into
the darkness. It was like a palm gathering sand on a vast beach.

I deliberately spoke in a polite tone, "Surya, let's stop here."

The divine light that couldn't touch the providence of the universe looked at
me. Surya's eyes stared at me. They seemed to be saying that even if they
didn't understand the Star Stream, there was no way they couldn't read
everything about me.
[A man who knows the ending of all the worlds… it is a really wild story.]
Perhaps Surya had heard the sentence of my 'giant story'. Before I could
answer, King Oedipus stood by Surya's side and replied, [It is just a
metaphor. A pun.]

It was rather fortunate if he thought so. I felt a bit uncomfortable since the
story contents came directly from me.

[The constellation 'Mass Production Maker' is questioning your sentences.]

[The constellation 'God of Wine and Ecstasy' is wondering about your giant
story.]

[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' is telling him to be
nervous.]

[The constellation 'Maritime War God' is forming clenched fists.]

[The constellation 'Secretive Plotter' is looking at you.]

Surya's gaze towards me was changing. I realized that no matter what I
said, I couldn't stop him.

[Come on child. The time given to you is 10 minutes.]

Surya's four arms were raised in a fighting posture. His size gradually
became bigger as he opened up his status. He didn't use any weapons. Surya
intended to exclude me simply using the pure power of stories.

[10 minutes later, this carriage will collide with the Demon Realm.]

There was no more need to delay and Yoo Joonghyuk rushed in first. A
blue aura reminiscent of the Breaking the Sky Sword Saint emerged from
Yoo Joonghyuk's body. The Breaking the Sky Swordsmanship was
spreading its light.
I wasn't the only one affected by the giant story. Yoo Joonghyuk also had a
stake in this story. Despite his injured body, Yoo Joonghyuk was now able
to exert a power equivalent to a constellation.

There was the sound of a blade and a pole colliding. It wasn't Surya who
received Yoo Joonghyuk's attack.

[Kuooh…!]

King Oedipus let out a pained groan as he confronted Yoo Joonghyuk.

[Kuaaack!]

Oedipus squeezed out power from an overheated incarnation body but he
seemed to be having a hard time dealing with Yoo Joonghyuk.

"Kim Dokja!" Along with Yoo Joonghyuk's cry, I leapt through Oedipus'
defenses and headed to Surya. In the air of the train, the several times larger
Surya greeted me.

[The exclusive skill 'Electrification' Lv. 12 (+2) has been activated.]

I was surrounded with the light of Electrification and a blue-white energy
struck Surya's chest. The other time, Surya stopped my Electrification with
one fist.

However, this time was different. Surya's skin was touched by the blue-
white energy and started burning. This was from a slight blow.

Surya's eyebrows twitched with surprise. I flew through the air and collided
with Surya's fists. The shock shook my heart but I endured it.

[The power of the 'giant story' is working for you.]

The world's sentences were swirling around me. The power allowed me to
compete with the mighty narrative-grade constellation. This was a great
story but Surya was still alive.
[I said it before. You can't win with the skills you have stolen.]

Maybe it was as Surya stated. I always struggled with the skills of others.

"This isn't something that I stole from others. I read it."

[Read?]

As Persephone told me, an existence was a story. Memories of sentences
that had been read for many years. Everything that I had read and seen now
became me.

[The exclusive skill, 'Fourth Wall' is strongly activated.]

On the Fourth Wall, the sentences of the giant story emerged.

「 This is the story of a reader. 」

I ran towards Surya. In the trail of my run was the countless hours I spent
alone reading. It was an ordinary life. I sat alone in a dark room and read
Ways of Survival. On the bus after my part time job was over, in the army,
in the classroom, on the subway home from work…

「 At the same time, it is the story of Dokja. 」

I lived in that world alone. I entered the mind of countless characters and
became different beings again and again.

[Only this story…]

Therefore, I was a regressor who had never regressed. [The

exclusive skill 'Way of the Wind Lv. 11 (+1) is activated!] A

returnee who had never returned.

[The number three bookmark has been activated.]
[The exclusive skill 'Beast King's Sensitivity Lv. 10 (+1)' has been
activated.]

Maybe I was a reincarnator.

Surya's face slightly distorted as he was confronted with my 'status'. Every
time our statuses clashes, I could feel our bodies being destroyed. Surya
was also pulling out all the power he could.

[This is too much! It is ridiculously insufficient to get the qualification of
the end!]

I shook my head. "It seems like you are mistaken about something. It isn't
only the giant stories that can reach the end."

Maybe Surya wouldn't understand. I had only received enlightenment after
learning from Yoo Joonghyuk's myriad failures.

Surya's face hardened and he concentrated his strength into his four arms.
Perhaps this would be Surya's last attack.

I didn't back down and stood up to him using the power of Electrification.
The glare of the sun that melted everything was fired towards me. The
bluewhite light couldn't overcome the high temperature and was pushed
little by little.

I had just taken a step or two back when a rough and solitary story wrapped
around me from behind. It wasn't necessary to see whose story it was.

The sparks between Surya and I became more intense. Slowly, the pushing
stopped.

[The constellation 'Master of Steel' is looking at you.]

[The constellation 'Master of the Skywalk' is looking at you.]
Lee Hyunsung and Yoo Sangah. There was also Jung Heewon's story. The
history of all those who struggled to survive was nestled inside me.

「 The woman who woke up from a long crouch and laughed while holding
a sword to destroy evil. 」

They weren't here but there were others who shared our history.

「 The boy who lost his mother and held the insect in his hand cried. 」

「 The man who built the castle roared for the family that wouldn't come
back. 」

Lee Gilyoung and Gong Pildu.

「 The woman who built up the truth by lying gladly became his shadow.

」 There was also Han Sooyoung.

[The exclusive attribute 'Scenario Interpreter' is activated!]

Everything I lived made their way into the story. Surya's incarnation body
was right in front of me. Surya's weakness was something that couldn't be
read with the Duke of Loyalty and Warfare's stigma. Yet strangely, at this
moment I knew where to stab Surya.

[The exclusive skill 'Reading Comprehension' is activated.]

Unbroken Faith shone brightly and an intense white light pierced Surya's
chest. There was the sound of something breaking as I poured out all my
magic power before flying through the sky.

Among the fragments of the story that poured through the air like a
fountain, the collapsed Surya could be seen.
[Surya! The Supreme God of Light!] Oedipus shouted and the situation
started falling apart.

Meteorites were oxidized in the atmosphere and Surya's train collapsed. I
was falling towards the ground.

"Kim Dokja!"

Yoo Joonghyuk flew like the wind and grabbed me while the chimera
dragon picked up my falling companions. It was truly a narrow escape. A
few fragments of the last car left a long trail as they fell towards the ground.
The shattered debris wept. Fortunately, the industrial complex wasn't going
to be hit.

Shin Yoosung was watching me from the head of the chimera dragon.
"Ahjussi!"

Joy could clearly be seen on the child's expression.

The next moment, a voice was heard from the cloud of dust on the ground.
[Not yet! Not yet!]

It was King Oedipus. The miserable looking existence shouted at us from
among the fallen constellations.

[The Demon King of Salvation! I know that the succession of the giant
story hasn't ended yet! If you give us the story, we will leave here.]

The game was already over but he still hadn't given up. It was Yoo
Joonghyuk who replied on my behalf. "Why should we?"

Yoo Joonghyuk landed on the ground, dropped me down and took out the
Black Heavenly Demon Sword. Then King Oedipus spoke. [Otherwise,
your precious world will disappear.]
"Do you want to talk about fate again? I know you don't have enough
probability left in the Demon Realm."

[What if it isn't the Demon Realm?]

He flicked his fingers and a huge panel appeared in the air. It showed a blue
planet that we knew well.

Yoo Joonghyuk frowned. "It seems you've sold your pride as a
constellation. Is this your last hurrah?"

At this point, it was impossible to destroy Earth even if all of Olympus'
probability was used. Yoo Joonghyuk was aware of this and wasn't
panicked at all. King Oedipus laughed.

[It's impossible to destroy Earth. But what about this?]

He flicked his fingers again and the screen changed. At this moment, the
faces of Yoo Joonghyuk and the party members hardened.

The Korean Peninsula was engulfed in flames.




"If I knew this, I would've gone to the Demon Realm."

Han Sooyoung frowned as she gazed at Gyeonggi-do burning with red and
blue flames. In fact, there was a reason why Han Sooyoung didn't go to the
Demon Realm.

[You are currently cursed by the demon king 'Andras'.]

Han Sooyoung had been caught in Kim Dokja's plot and cursed by the
demon king. Thanks to this, she would become the meal of the demon king
as soon as she visited the area. Lee Gilyoung stomped his feet beside her
and shouted, "Won't everyone be with Dokja hyung by now? I wish I was
Shin Yoosung…"

"I guess so. However, that place will be harder than here."

Han Sooyoung felt the disaster coming through the flames and gulped.
After Kim Dokja's group left for the personal scenario, the disaster scenario
had come to the Korean Peninsula.

[The time limit for the disaster scenario is 30 minutes.]

The problem was the disaster that came this time were constellations.

"Damn Olympus."

She didn't know what type of back-door dealings they made with the
dokkaebis of the bureau but the constellations of Olympus had come as the
'disasters' of this scenario. Due to the difficulty, the scenario would end
after 30 minutes. In these 30 minutes, the Korean Peninsula was likely to
disappear from Earth.

"What are you going to do now?" Gong Pildu asked while blowing out
cigarette smoke.

The reason the Gyeonggi-do area had lasted so far was thanks to Gong
Pildu's Armed Fortress. Han Sooyoung replied, "Just hold on a bit longer.
There is a way."

"The opponents are the incarnation bodies of constellations. There are more
than five of them. How are you going to win? You aren't Kim Dokja."

Their auras showed they were historical-grade constellations. Perhaps they
were ancient heroes or lesser gods of Olympus.

[There are only small people on this little land!]
Her head hurt from all the noise. Han Sooyoungcalmly pulled out a dark
stone.

[Abyss Stone.]

It was an item Kim Dokja told her to collect before they separated. Thanks
to this item, she could send the other party members to the Demon Realm
despite lacking probability. She had used three so far and there were six
remaining. The number was a bit lacking but this was the only way.

"This… I didn't know I would use them catching bugs."

As Lee Gilyoung's insects protected the fortress and Gong Pildu's fortress
continued firing, Han Sooyoung started the descent ceremony by offering
the Abyss Stone.

It was just for a short time but she could call an existence to balance this
twisted scale.

Sparks flew and the Abyss Stones started to disappear one by one as an
offering. It was a fearsome presence who could only use a portion of their
power through the six Abyss Stones.

The sky of Gyeonggi-do turned dark and filled with thunder. A huge
shadow was revealing itself behind Han Sooyoung. Han Sooyoung sighed
lightly and slowly opened her eyes. "Black dragon. You can do whatever
you like."

[The constellation 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' is grinning and revealing
white teeth.]
                Chapter 275: Ep. 51 - Giant Story, IV


The Olympians swept away Seongnam in an instant and slowly narrowed
the siege around Gong Pildu's fortress.

[Isn't this stage too small for us to come forward?]

The constellations thought it was disgraceful. It was natural. There were no
constellations who could build up anything from this scenario. Amidst these
unmotivated constellations, a constellation wearing a crown and holding an
ancient spear and shield spoke.

[Stop complaining. Once this is over, Father says he will suggest our
promotion to the 12 gods.]

[Oedipus? Really?]

The expressions of the constellations changed due to the words of the Blind
King's Heir. Promotion in the nebula meant their stakes in the giant stories
were increased.
[Haha, can we reach one decimal place?]

The stakes in a giant story were one of the measures of a constellation's
strength. More stakes meant more probability, which was a source of
escaping from the constraints of many scenarios.

[Let's finish it and go back.]

The constellations finally started to advance to the armed fortress. It
happened the moment their star relics were shining. The sky was covered
by a dark dome and light disappeared from it. The historical-grade
constellations approaching the armed fortress stopped at the appalling
darkness.

[…What?]

The lights in the area were turned off by the clouds that came. It wasn't just
this area. The darkness covered the entire Korean Peninsula. Even the
sparks of probability were covered by the deep darkness.

The Blind King's Heir stared up at the sky with bewildered eyes.

[Is it the queen of the Underworld?]

The only nebula that could descend to the Korean Peninsula today was
Olympus. In addition, there were few constellations of Olympus who could
use such a large amount of probability.

One of the constellations emitted a faint light to reveal the surroundings but
it quickly disappeared. It was like a black hole that sucked out all the light.

The anxious constellations shouted. [Your Majesty! If you have come then
please say it―]

One of the constellations suddenly gave a warning. [Something is
coming…!]
A dark object was fired from the sky and pierced the chest of one
constellation.

[Keeeeok…!]

It was an object like a dragon's claw. The confused constellation coughed
up blood and tried to pull out the claw, but the claw grew increasingly
larger and soon burst through the constellation's body. The constellation let
out a sound before becoming part of the darkness. The frightened
constellations screamed.

[U-Uhhhhh!]

They heard the sound but couldn't avoid it. It meant…

This existence had a completely different 'status' from them. The queen of
the underworld wasn't this much.

[Run away…!]

The Blind King's Heir discovered the situation and ordered a retreat. Then
an enormous amount of sparks burst from the armed fortress. The intense
light that the darkness couldn't swallow revealed the open door of the
fortress leading to the dark city. There was a woman with a small body.

The first one to discover her was the Blind King's Heir who trembled.

[W-Why are you…?]

The shadows of black flames were swirling around her body. The face of a
little boy with red eyes underneath black hair flashed. The boy with one
arm bandaged raised his hand and the shadow of a dragon covered the sky.
White fangs were bared.

As the boy laughed, the darkness of the world breathed. Then the massacre
began.
King Oedipus couldn't hide his astonishment as he stared at the scene on the
screen.

[The constellation 'Blind King's Heir' has been removed from the scenario.]

[The constellation 'Thebes' Gatekeeper' has been removed from the
scenario.]

The shadow of a dragon was tearing up the fleeing constellations on the
screen. Fortunately, Han Sooyoung wasn't too late.

[The constellation 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' is letting out wild
laughter.]

–Ahahahahaha!

Han Sooyoung had a bandage around one arm and half covered her face as
she burst out laughing. She was really a match for the black dragon. She
acted so well that I didn't know why she hated it so far.

King Oedipus stared at me and exclaimed, [How come… why is a
candidate of the apocalypse…]

Candidate of the apocalypse… Well, King Oedipus would have that type of
information. The Abyssal Black Flame Dragon was one of the candidates of
the apocalypse.

[Many constellations are astonished by your scheme.]

[The constellation 'Dragon Lying Down' is nodding.]

[The constellation 'Secretive Plotter' is feeling pure admiration.]
[You have acquired a new story!]

[The story 'Kill with a Borrowed Knife' has been acquired.]

I watched Gyeonggi-do covered in darkness and licked my lips. Attracting
the Abyssal Black Flame Dragon was a last resort. It could've brought about
a bigger disaster. However, there was Han Sooyoung and the promise made
with the black dragon. Thus, he wouldn't destroy the Korean Peninsula.
[Ku…ock…]

King Oedipus bowed his head and let out an unknown groan. We saw the
unusual appearance and Yoo Joonghyuk and I raised our swords at the
same time.

[You…!]

King Oedipus' son was among the constellations who suffered under the
black dragon. There was the possibility that the enraged Oedipus wouldn't
be able to control his emotions.

[I will kill you!]

As expected, the constellations who survived with Oedipus released their
status at the same time. I had a giant story but it wasn't enough power. The
moment I was about to trigger Electrification, something rose from the
ground and caught Oedipus' neck.

[Cough!]

The huge Surya moved one of his four arms and held onto Oedipus' neck.
King Oedipus stared at Surya with surprise.

[W-Why?]

[Stop it.]

Surya's heavy status pressed down on the other constellation.
[Don't look so ugly anymore.]

[I won't listen to the words of a dog who lost the fight! It can't end like
this…!]

The next moment, King Oedipus' body exploded. The brutally exploded
body scattered into ashes in front of Surya's eyes. The movements of the
constellations stiffened and they nervously stepped back.

Despite the severe injuries, Surya still had the power to stand up alone… it
was a phenomenal vitality.

I quickly calculated the power of my remaining companions. If we hit
Surya right now…

[It is our defeat.]

For a moment, I thought I heard wrong. However, the words had definitely
emerged from Surya's mouth. I bit my lips as joy boiled from deep inside
my heart. The great Lokapala had admitted defeat.

[The winner of the Demon King Selection has been determined.]

There were screams from afar as the ensuing system messages came. They
were the screams of the dukes defeated in the Demon King Selection.

One by one, the bodies of the constellations staring at us scattered. The
scenario ended and the Star Stream started to recall the probability that they
were allowed. Surya's body was also disappearing.

I opened my mouth before Surya's body completely disappeared. I wanted
to ask. Why did he suddenly change his mind?

[The Demon King of Salvation.]

However, I shut my mouth the moment I saw Surya's eyes. In retrospect,
Surya wasn't an ordinary constellation. He was one of the great Lokapala. It
was rather strange that such a constellation would use cowardly tricks
against us. Perhaps this 'selection' had dealt a significant blow to his
reputation and pride.

Surya slowly blinked and asked, [Did you get the qualification of the end?]

"I'll probably get it. And you also…"

Surya's eyes shone terribly, as if he was dismissing the trivial comfort.

[I will watch your story.]

Surya would also get the qualification of the end one day. Then the day
would come when we meet again. It wasn't here but in the later scenarios of
the Star Stream.

[And…]

In a short moment, Surya's gaze turned towards the fragments of the
destroyed train. They were fragments of the car where Surya and I faced
each other. However, the appearance of some fragments was a bit strange.
They weren't broken from the battle with me. They were scars carved on
the train from before.

"I know."

[That's right. You understand.]

Surya finally disappeared with these words. The pressure on the
surroundings vanished and a curious silence took its place. I didn't feel it
was real. I calmly practiced what I had planned and was lucky with several
things. Then I came all this way.

[The 25th main scenario has ended.]

I turned my head and saw Yoo Joonghyuk watching Surya's disappearance.
[The main scenario 'Demon King Selection' has been cleared.]

[The rewards for the selection are being prepared.]

[A new demon king has appeared in the Demon Realm!]

[You have become the master of the 73rd Demon Realm!]

There was the explosive system message and Yoo Joonghyuk and I
simultaneously looked up at the sky. The gazes of countless beings poured
towards me from the sky.

[The demon king 'Ruler of the East Hell' is looking at you.]

[The demon king 'Devil of Principles' is curious about you.]

[The demon king 'Black Mane Lion' is inviting you to his demon realm.]

.

.

[The constellation 'Mass Production Maker' is sending his congratulations.]

[The constellation 'Queen of the Darkest Spring' has sent you a gift.]

[The constellation 'God of Wine and Ecstasy' is proposing a toast.]

[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' is greatly pleased.]

[The constellation 'Commander of the Red Cosmos' is wary of you.]

It was an incomparable amount of attention. There were strong people
similar to me to distant beings who I couldn't even look at their toes.
There was a pause and then Jang Hayoung's voice was heard. "…It's
over." I nodded and looked around.
Lee Hyunsung carried Jung Heewon while watching the sky. Lee Jihye
supported the injured Yoo Sangah and waved at me while Shin Yoosung
held onto my sleeve and looked up at me. The Breaking the Sky Master
held the small Osu in her mouth and barked lightly. Han Myungoh held
Asmodeus' incarnation body in his arms and let out a weary breath. On the
rocky hill not far away, I could see the Breaking the Sky Sword Saint and
Kyrgios. The injured Brash Swamp Predator was curled up and Cheok
Jungyeong was sitting on his back.

It was an ordeal that couldn't be overcome without any of them.

[Your 'nebula' is well known in the Star Stream.]

[A large number of constellations remember the nebula 'Kim Dokja's
Company (Temporary)'.]

Yoo Joonghyuk heard the message and frowned. "…The name needs to be
changed."

I smiled at the guy who had his pride in a strange place. It wouldn't be bad
to brainstorm names for the nebula sooner or later.

It felt that the darkness was retreating from the sky. I could breathe for a
moment from the seemingly endless trials.

[Your first 'giant story' is fully blooming.]

[Giant Story 'Demon Realm's Spring' has been acquired.]

Citizens started emerging from the ruined industrial complex. People were
intoxicated by the unbelievable victory. Some people shouted while others
called out mine and Yoo Joonghyuk's names. I could also see Aileen and
Mark.

[The Star Stream is satisfied with your giant story.]
[You have earned the qualification of the end.]

Finally, there were the messages I had been waiting for.

[The hidden scenario - 'A Single Story' has begun!]

[Your legendary stories has formed an opening act.]

[The 'initial' portion of your first giant story has been completed!]

After a long period of enduring, the first footstep towards the final scenario
was taken.

[You have been given the authority of ■■.]

[The ■■ filtering is turned off.]

It was the moment when the information of the last chapter, which had long
been covered with a veil, finally appeared in front of my eyes.
                       Chapter 276: Ep. 52. ■■, I


After the Demon King Selection, the Yoo Joonghyuk - Kim Dokja
Industrial Complex became busy with reconstruction. The citizens'
expressions were dark from the dangers of war. The atmosphere would've
been harsher if it wasn't for the relief resources that I persuaded Bihyung to
give.

"The clock tower is over there! Hey, watch out over there!"

Due to the deaths of the dukes, the citizens of other industrial complexes
came over and I wasn't lacking manpower. I spent two days helping the
citizens rebuild and the city was gradually regaining a lively atmosphere.

"Thank you for the help, Yoo Sangah-ssi."

The foundation reconstruction would've taken a longer time if it wasn't for
Yoo Sangah's Arachne's Web. Yoo Sangah wiped the sweat off her
forehead and replied, "You should take a break Dokja-ssi."
"I'm fine. What about Yoo Sangah-ssi?"

Yoo Sangah looked closely at the bandage wrapped around my chest while
answering, "I'm good as well."

Good… It was a word used by Yoo Sangah.

I stopped working as I climbed up the clock tower with Yoo Sangah and
looked down at the square.

Yoo Joonghyuk and the other seriously injured party members were
hospitalized in Aileen's ward. Jung Heewon and Lee Jihye were relatively
well and helped with the reconstruction of the industrial complex.
Meanwhile, Lee Hyunsung was demanding to be discharged from the ward
because he was all better.

Thanks to the hard work over the past two days, the square area started to
feel like a place where people lived. The schedule was tight but the things I
were doing now would be returned to me as a reward.

"They came."

A portal had appeared in the air. There was a kid running at great speed
from one side of the square.

I lightly jumped down the clock tower and greeted him.

"Dokja hyung! Uwaaaaah!" Lee Gilyoung struggled in my arms. I smiled
and patted his head.

"Have you been well? You seem a bit taller."

"Really?"

"Yes, you're almost around Yoosung's height now?"

"I'll be bigger soon!"
It wasn't just Lee Gilyoung who came through the portal. A large man fell
to the floor of the square with a thud.

"It has been a long time, Gong Pildu-ssi."

"Bah!" Gong Pildu stared at me like he didn't care about my safety and then
waved to Yoo Sangah. Yoo Sangah bowed her head with a slight smile and
Gong Pildu spoke in a slightly more relaxed tone. "I didn't come to see
you."

During this time, Gong Pildu had changed a lot. Who could call him one of
the 10 Evils now?

"Han Sooyoung?"

"I think she needs some time to recuperate." Lee Gilyoung answered with
his head against my stomach.

Recuperate… She had offered the Abyss Stones as a sacrifice but the
damage wouldn't be small because she took the black dragon into her body.
However, to not come here…

"Ah, Sooyoung noona told me to give this to you." Lee Gilyoung
rummaged through his pockets and handed me a note.

It was a crumpled piece of paper that gave off an obstinate impression
similar to Han Sooyoung. I carefully opened the note while avoiding Lee
Gilyoung's glistening eyes.

–I will kill you if you make me do it again next time.

I couldn't help laughing. Indeed, there was a reason she hadn't come. If I
closed my eyes, I could still see the bandaged Han Sooyoung laughing like
crazy.

–There are still a few problems left.
The note contained some other information. There were things about the
Korean Peninsula and the nebulae that could only be heard on Earth.
Fortunately, the situation on Earth didn't deviate much from the original
cycle I knew. In fact, most of the information were things I already knew
and didn't need to be conveyed.

Han Sooyoung knew this and struggled with eloquence.

–Anyway, that's it… well… goodbye, idiot. See you when you come to
Earth.

It was too bad. I was going to tease her properly if we met this time. I put
the note in my coat and told Lee Gilyoung and Gong Pildu.

"There will be a party at night. Go wash up and prepare."

"Party?"

"Guests are coming."

I've passed one crisis but the crisis of this industrial complex was just
beginning.

[The constellation 'God of Wine and Ecstasy' has accepted your invitation.]

[The constellation 'Queen of the Darkest Spring' has accepted your
invitation.]

…

I saw numerous indirect messages pouring in and sighed lightly.




Since the selection, Yoo Joonghyuk hadn't woken up.
"How long will it take for him to recover?"

"It should take two more weeks." Aileen checked Yoo Joonghyuk's pulse,
wlaked out of the hospital room and glanced at me. "You need to rest as
well. Do you know?"

"Don't worry."

Aileen left but I stayed in Yoo Joonghyuk's hospital room. The sleeping
man's complexion was paler than any 'Yoo Joonghyuk' I had ever seen. It
was natural. This was the first time that Yoo Joonghyuk didn't regress
despite suffering injuries serious enough to trigger 'regression'.

I stood up and checked the story packs that were stuck to him. Sometimes,
a story pack being inserted incorrectly could cause death from side effects.
It might be different if he had Lamarck's Giraffe like me…

"…Packs like these are being plugged in."

「 I am going to a lonely world. 」

「 The sword master was the easiest. 」

「 I was a genius since receiving the sword at 5 years old. 」

Fortunately, Aileen was a story expert and had a good grasp on the
composition. In fact, Yoo Joonghyuk of the 144th round briefly went crazy
after wrongly receiving Lee Hyunsung's army story.

"He is a picky guy."

I was almost shocked by the voice suddenly heard behind me. I looked back
and saw a handsome giant leaning against the wall.

"Since when were you there?"

"From before you come in."
The Breaking the Sky Sword Saint stared down at me with calm eyes
before indicating Yoo Joonghyuk.

"It is too much healing. Just throw a few Murim dumplings at him and he
will get better soon."

"It is because there are no Murim dumplings here."

Despite the words, the eyes of the Breaking the Sky Sword Saint were still
very mild. Then the terrible man's voice was heard.

"So he is the one who beat you up?"

Something the size of a frog was hanging upside down from the ceiling
opposite the Breaking the Sky Sword Saint. It was Kyrgios Rodgraim.

"Master."

"Tell me. Is it this guy?"

I was reminded of the nonsense I spoke to send Kyrgios to Murim. I was
beat up by the Breaking the Sky Sword Saint's disciple. Kyrgios' handsome
eyebrows curved and the aura of Electrification appeared around his entire
body. "Was it all a lie?"

I gulped and opened my mouth. "It wasn't completely a lie! In fact, I'm not
on good terms with this guy. I was actually beaten up…"

"You were just beaten up?"

"Of course, I hit back…"

It was a loophole in the system but I didn't lie because I had beaten up Yoo
Joonghyuk in the Absolute Throne battle. The Breaking the Sky Sword
Saint made an intrigued expression as she listened to the story. "Hrmm.
You beat my disciple?"
"Then who won?"

The gazes of the new teachers met in the air. It was only their gazes
collided but the sense of space seemed to distort and sparks flew. I thought
the two of them were getting along better with each other but it seemed to
be my mistake. The Breaking the Sky Sword Saint's voice was cold. "That
is a stupid question. Just looking at the face, it is obvious that my disciple is
better than yours."

"My disciple can't be weaker than an aura parasite who only raises muscle.
Don't look down on my vision of my martial artists…"

"Your martial artists are getting smaller."

I thought the hospital room would explode if this continued and quickly
stepped in between the two of them.

"I have something to ask you."

The fearsome gazes shot towards me at the same time. I raised my status
and barely endured the pressure.

"What happened to First Murim?" I was curious. The Breaking the Sky
Sword Saint and Kyrgios were here so I knew Murim was likely to be safe.
However, the opponent was an outer god.

The first one to speak was Kyrgios. "Hmph, this body moved personally
and you think I can't save one world?"

Kyrgios flew out the window like he was offended.

…What was wrong with him? The Breaking the Sky Sword Saint gazed at
the window that Kyrgios had disappeared through and replied, "We stopped
it but it is hard to say that we stopped it."

"Did you defeat the outer god?"
The aura of a giant story could be felt from the Breaking the Sky Sword
Saint's body. It was clearly a giant story associated with First Murim.

The Breaking the Sky Sword Saint nodded. "It was a daunting opponent but
it wasn't something I couldn't fight. That unlucky paradox was also
present."

Only the Breaking the Sky Sword Saint could describe an outer god as a
'daunting opponent'.

"The problem was the next guy."




The outer gods also had ranks. So to speak, there were different names for
them. For example, 'old one' and 'great old ones'.

–He was neither 'old' or a 'great old'.

However, there were also distant beings beyond such categories.

–I have never seen such an existence before so I can't explain it clearly. The
only thing certain is that Paradox and I together couldn't beat it. In fact, it
wasn't even a fight. If it hadn't withdrawn itself, we would've disappeared
from the universe along with Murim.

The words of the Breaking the Sky Sword Saint were strange. According to
the development of the original novel, there was no such possibility that
such an outer god would appear in First Murim that day. Yet such a great
outer god appeared and withdrew.

–It disappeared like it found another delicious prey.
A being that was neither old or a great old one. An outer god that forced
strong people such as the Breaking the Sky Sword Saint and Kyrgios to
freeze…

Waaaaaah!

A small party was currently in progress in the central hall of the industrial
complex. The recovered party members had gathered. The symbolic bodies
of some invited constellations could be seen.

[Hmm, Demon King of Salvation. Did you receive the gift I sent?]

Persephone approached with a mischievous smile. Once again, her
symbolic body took Yoo Sangah's appearance. The party members stared at
her symbolic body with surprise. In particular, Yoo Sangah's expression
was a delight to see.

"…I don't like garter belts anymore."

Persephone wore a Chinese dress and waved her fan while laughing.

[Is that so? It was a pretty good performance.]

Lee Hyunsung's ears pricked up at the word 'performance'. I spoke quickly
before the wrong words could come out. "I am indebted to you regarding
the selection game."

[Hmm, I didn't do anything?]

"I know that you persuaded the Master of the Skywalk."

Now Olympus was in a divisive state. If she hadn't persuaded Hermes, I
might've had to fight more Olympus constellations in the competition.

[Think of it as an investment in the future.]
The smiling Persephone headed to the center of the hall and started
dancing. She even pulled Yoo Sangah over as her partner. At first, Yoo
Sangah was embarrassed but then she kept a cool expression. Jung Heewon
whistled. "Yoo Sangah-ssi is cool!"

Dionysus had already finished his tenth drink in the corner while Cheok
Jungyeong was sharing a cup of soju with the Brash Swamp Predator. It
was a small party but it was more relaxed than any other party I had
attended. [It is a precious break. Congratulations, Demon King of
Salvation.]

I turned back and saw an old man in a formal suit. "You came, Mass
Production Maker."

He was also one of the constellations who helped in this selection.

[I saw your story well. The Gourmet Association is making a huge fuss.]

"You're overpraising me."

I grabbed a glass from the table and bumped cups with the Mass Production
Maker. It was pretty strong alcohol based on the smell and I poured it into
my mouth. We were silent for a moment. Perhaps the Mass Production
Maker was choosing his question. The question was why he and the other
constellations attended this party and why I held it.

The Mass Production Maker sipped the alcohol before speaking. [You got
the qualification of the end so the filtering should be turned off.]

I could feel a fine change in the atmosphere. I nodded. "That's right."

The hall was still buzzing but the eyes of the constellations gathered one by
one on me. Persephone, Cheok Jungyeong, Dionysus… Everyone was
pretending not to care but they were listening to this story.
The gazes of all the constellations focused on me and the Mass Production
Maker asked, [Can I ask what your ■■ was?]
                      Chapter 277: Ep. 52. ■■, II


What was my ■■? I knew that the Mass Production Maker would ask that
question. "Are you curious?"

[Is there anyone here who isn't curious?]

The Mass Production Maker laughed lightly and several constellations
coughed. The atmosphere grew unusual and the other party members who
weren't aware of the situation started to pay attention to me.

"Why is everyone suddenly…?"

"Shhh."

Lee Hyunsung tried to intrude only to be stopped by Jung Heewon.

I slowly looked around at all the people in the room. All of a sudden,
everyone in the hall was watching me.
■■…

There were various names for it in Ways of Survival. For example, the
Dokkaebi King said:

「 The end of every story and the beginning. 」

However, this was what Yoo Joonghyuk had to say:

「 The damn Star Stream. 」

Lee Hyunsung would describe it as the 'whole region' while Yoo Sangah
might say 'old design'. It would be 'graduation' for Lee Jihye. Surprisingly,
all these interpretations of ■■ weren't wrong.

The Mass Production Maker asked, [All those who have earned the
qualification of the end have received a different name of the 'end'. Do you
know?]

"It is natural since all your stories are different."

In the first place, there wasn't a proper noun capable of communicating ■■
in the proper sense. The fact that the filtering was resolved meant that I
could 'read' it. Perhaps the constellations who received a hidden scenario
like me were probably in a similar position.
  [Hidden scenario - 'A Single Story']

  Category: Hidden

  Difficulty: ???

  Clear Condition: Complete one story to reach ■■.

  Time Limit: ―

  Compensation: ???

  Failure: ???

  * Currently, you have completed the 'initial' portion.

  * See the additional scenario description for details.




The hidden scenario 'A Single Story'. This scenario was given to all those
who obtained the qualification of the end. In the galaxy of the distant Star
Stream, we went through numerous stories and completed a single 'perfect'
story.

The legendary stories, the mythical stories and even the giant story that I
got were just a journey towards the 'single story'. The Mass Production
Maker in front of me and Persephone over there would've received this
scenario. Of course, the place where they finally arrived was different from
me.

[Baat!]
Biyoo blocked the channel of the hall before I even directed her. Perhaps
Biyoo instinctively realized that the story to be told from now on was
important. The protests of the constellations flowed through the air and the
Mass Production Maker spoke in a heavy tone.

[My ■■ is 'dried up'.]

I was a bit surprised because I didn't think he would reveal his hand so
easily. Then the dancing Persephone also spoke. [I am 'death'.]

Dried up and death. Both were words that could symbolize the 'end' of
something. It was a paradoxical end for the Mass Production Maker who
liked to make something and for Persephone who governed the world of the
dead.

Now that they revealed their cards, I had nowhere to retreat. "Everybody,
please swear by your modifiers. You will never speak of what you heard
here."

The constellations glanced at each other.

[Of course…]

[Hum, what is this? Why would we go somewhere and say it…]

[How great is your ■■ that you are feeling such pressure?]

I didn't answer immediately and just smiled. Then a ripple started among
the constellations.

[Don't tell me?]

The thoughts in the constellations' heads seemed to be visible. I looked at
their expressions and thought.

Yes, think about it. Be worried and suspicious. That way I would get the
picture I desired.
As the agitation of the drunk constellations reached the peak, I slowly
opened my mouth.




Han Sooyoung walked down the street. They were the ruins of Seoul. There
were no survivors on the streets and she was walking alone. All types of
delusions passed through her head.

Why was she here now? She had obviously been fighting with the
constellations using the black dragon. No, rather, Seoul had been closed off.
Why…

–Black dragon?

The Abyssal Black Flame Dragon didn't answer.

–Hey, is anybody there?

Han Sooyoung wandered between the ruined buildings and shouted. The
corpses of monsters hung between the familiar buildings of
Gwanghwamun. Han Sooyoung shuddered every time she passed between
nasty smelling corpses. Every one of them was a monster she couldn't face
right now. How? What happened?

There was no one to answer her questions. No, she thought it would be
better not to have answers, even if someone was here. If there was a living
being here, they would be the terrifying monster who killed these monsters.

If this was a dream, please wake up…

Then a shadow of a person could be seen in the distance. It was a familiar
humanoid form dressed in a white coat. Her heart was full of complicated
emotions.
–Kim Dokja!

The moment the person looked back. There was the sound of flesh being
pierced and a knife suddenly burst out of the coat. The white coat was dyed
red.

Han Sooyoung screamed as she woke up from her sleep.

"Haack, haack…"

She blinked a few times and her sense of reality slowly returned.

"What…?"

She couldn't help talking to herself. Her back was wet with sweat.

[The constellation 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' is satisfied with your
soliloquy.]

[The constellation 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' believes that you have
now truly become his successor…]

"Shut up."

The black dragon was speaking bullshit so this seemed to be reality. Han
Sooyoung placed a hand against her temple. Why was that person in her
dream?

Han Sooyoung would've usually passed over the dream but it was a world
where superstition became reality. Thus, this dream couldn't be overlooked.
Shortly afterwards, she noticed the bandage around her arm.

"God dammit. It hasn't been solved yet."

"Don't loosen it. You are still wounded."

She looked back with astonishment and saw a woman standing there.
"…Kim Dokja's mother?"

"You are the only one who still calls me that." Lee Sookyung wiped Han
Sooyoung's back and forehead with a towel.

Han Sooyoung asked, "Why didn't you go to the Demon Realm?"

"What type of face would I have to go there?"

"Kim Dokja would've liked it."

"He would've liked it more if you went."

"…You don't know your son very well."

Han Sooyoung stuck out her small lips. Lee Sookyung laughed lightly and
replaced the wet pillow with a new one. Han Sooyoung sniffed the new
pillow and said,

"It seems to be resolved well."

"What are you talking about?"

"Kim Dokja's big disaster."

Seeing the black dragon's ecstatic state, things on the Demon Realm side
seemed well. The damage on the Korean Peninsula wasn't greater than
expected. There was a blow to the area but the citizens were safely
evacuated…

The dream troubled her but a dream was just a dream…

"It isn't over."

"…Eh?"

Lee Sookyung brought over a plate without speaking and pointed to the
Good or Bad Luck, Disaster or Happiness Fortune floating on it. Han
Sooyoung read the characters rising to the surface of the water. She couldn't
believe it. Thus, she asked Lee Sookyung to repeat the divination many
times. They were all the same. Han Sooyoung looked down at the arm
wrapped with a bandage and declared, "Please contact Kim Dokja."




The night after the party ended, I sat alone in the office. Normally, it would
be a good time to read Ways of Survival while relaxing with a cup of hot
chocolate. However, I couldn't afford it now.

I was staring at a huge debris lying on the table. It was a pierce that came
off from the last car that Surya and I fought in. I closed my eyes and tried to
reconstruct my memories of the time.

Surya's train was much shorter than the mythical train. In addition, the last
car had a hole in the back. It was as if part of the train had been ripped off.

In other words, that space wasn't the original last car. I opened my eyes and
examined the wounds on the debris fragment again. There was something
powerful enough to pull off part of Surya's train that my party members and
teachers barely broke.

…It was also 'that'.

Knock knock knock.

I looked up at the sound of knocking and saw Yoo Sangah watching me
from the door. "I'm sorry Dokja-ssi. Am I disturbing you?"

"No. I called you."
I urgently arranged the table and greeted Yoo Sangah. Yoo Sangah looked
around with a slightly shaky expression and then sat carefully on the other
side of the table where I was sitting.

"Would you like some tea?"

"Nope. It's fine."

"Then do you want water…?"

"Okay."

We silently faced each other across the small table. I called her but I
couldn't easily bring up the topic. Yoo Sangah must have many questions
for me as well. I told her, "Just ask."

"In fact, I've been thinking about Dokja-ssi for quite some time." Her tone
sounded like she had been waiting. "Why do you know the future that
others don't know? How could you be so calm in such situations and always
find answers that others haven't thought of?"

"Then did you find out something?"

"I seem to know some things while others don't feel right."

Perhaps Yoo Sangah had been studying me. Just as she studied Spanish
with the app, Yoo Sangah would've studied people. As always, she reached
meaningful results before anyone else.

"To Dokja-ssi, is this world like a novel?"

"Why do you think that?"

"It is because of what you said at the party."

…As expected from Yoo Sangah. Really, that was the only thing I could
say.
–I'm heading towards the final chapter.

That was my answer to what ■■ I received. The final chapter. The end of
every book that needed to be reached by turning over the pages.

Yoo Sangah continued speaking, "The constellations were greatly
surprised. There were some who were amazed and some who were
shocked."

The constellations had to feel surprised. It was a statement I gave with such
intentions.

"After Dokja-ssi left, I asked the queen of the underworld. Why are you so
surprised?"

"What did she say?"

"She said Dokja-ssi is very special." Yoo Sangah moistened her lips with
the water and continued, "I heard that every being is given a different form
of ■■. In addition, most of them are very personal words. There are
numerous ■■ in the world but I heard that words that imply the 'end' are
extremely rare."

Anyone who heard it would understand it meant an obvious 'end'. It was a
word that had excellent versatility for all beings.

"In addition, all beings who received such a clear 'end' were great
constellations like Olympus, Vedas and Papyrus… the top deities of the
massive nebulae'.

"…"

Now… Dokja-ssi has become one of them."

Yoo Sangah was staring at me with complicated eyes. Her trembling eyes
held feelings that she herself couldn't measure.
I replied, "It is a good thing."

"…It is good?"

"Now I can finally try something." I smiled. However, Yoo Sangah didn't
smile back.

"After the destruction of the world, I thought Dokja-ssi was happier. You
laughed more often than before and seemed more vigorous… thus, you
looked good. By the way…" Yoo Sangah bowed her head. "Dokja-ssi, why
do you think this world is fiction?"

Yoo Sangah didn't know me. What was 'fiction' to me? What did this world
mean to me? I couldn't explain or describe it.

"Ah, I'm sorry Dokja-ssi. I was presumptuous…"

Nevetheless, the only person who could tell me such things was Yoo
Sangah. She was a person who noticed things that nobody cared about.

[The exclusive skill 'Character List' is activated!]

She was the first colleague I met. Maybe it was before this world began.

[The person's information can't be accessed through Character List.]

There was an unexpected sense of relief from the rising message.

[Currently collecting information about the corresponding figure.]

When I first used Character List on Yoo Sangah, I had been very anxious
because I couldn't read her information. Why was it now the opposite?

I sighed lightly and looked out the window. It was a clear sky. This was a
world where nothing had happened yet.
"Yoo Sangah-ssi, I'd like to ask you to do something."

Thus, now was the only time to prepare.
                     Chapter 278: Ep. 52. ■■, III


The nebula Eden. This nebula was composed of the angels of the
apocalypse, was the scourge of the demons and the eternal enemies of the
Demon Realm. The guardians of the Celestial World, the angels who didn't
fear any evil in this world.

However, there was something that the angels of this fearsome Eden hated.

[Elder, in Eden you are fully prepared and bid your time before the
battle…]

It was Metatron's ordinance time. Today, the one in charge of the lecture
was the Commander of the Red Cosmos, Jophiel.

[We urge you not to fall for the demon's two-faced war tactics…]

Gabriel tapped the floor with his heel and frowned.

–Oh, why must it be that person today?
There were thousands of low-ranked angels in the training ground of Eden.
The archangels like Gabriel were positioned at the forefront as teaching
assistants.

Lily Blooming in Aquarius, Gabriel.

Guardian of Youths and Travel, Raphael.

Friend of Justice and Harmony, Raguel.

Apart from the archangel on duty, most of the top-ranking constellations of
Eden were assembled.

Jophiel's mental training had already been going on for an hour. Gabriel
secretly yawned and looked around at his colleagues with languid eyes,
only to notice something strange.

–Hey, where's Uriel?

Raphael, who was nodding off on the cloud, replied while fixing his curly
hair.

–She is being detained.

–Detained?

–She is being told off by the scribe. Don't you know?

…What did she do? Raphael borrowed the power of the wind to speak like
it was annoying. Gabriel's eyes widened.

–What? Really? Uriel?

–Yes yes. She is banned from broadcasting for three years.

…That Uriel was going to be confined for three years?
Gabriel laughed at the unexpected news.

–For the time being, the broadcast bulletin board will be clean.

The ordinance ended after 30 minutes. Metatron dismissed the low-grade
angels and called the archangels separately. 'Scribe of Heaven' Metatron
had grey hair that went down to his waist and his expression seemed tired
today. It was because he was busy trying to prevent the possibility of
Armageddon.

Metatron pushed up his thin frame glasses and spoke, [Thank you for the
trouble Jophiel. It was a good presentation.]

Jophiel nodded. Metatron looked around at the archangels and asked,

[Uriel didn't come?]

[Didn't you detain her? Otherwise, she would be here.]

The other archangels giggled at Gabriel's words. However, Metatron didn't
laugh. The archangels exchanged looks with each other. There was no angel
here who didn't know that Uriel was a headache for the scribe. The first one
to speak was Archangel Raguel, who had faint freckles on his cheeks.

[Excuse me, Scribe. Isn't three years of detainment too much? Recently
Uriel has become quite bright due to the broadcast…]

For the constellations who had to endure the boring years, the meaning of
the live broadcast was immense. Some angels called the 'livestream
broadcasting' the only drug allowed in Eden…

[What are you saying Raguel? Do you know how many times the scribe let
that ■ watch?]

Raguel's expression hardened at Gabriel's words.

[Gabriel. Insulting a fellow angel is a felony.]
[Did I say something wrong? When she was bored, she picked up a demon's
neck and did something strange…]

[Gabriel!]

It was Metatron who calmed down the tense atmosphere.

[I will decide how to deal with Uriel.]

The sublime aura rising from Metatron caused all the excited angels to
close their mouths. As the surroundings became silent, Metatron brought up
the main point.

[In connection to the Demon Realm Convention, I'm going to give you a
new assignment.]

The Demon Realm Convention. The expressions of the archangels became
tense. The balance between Eden and the Demon Realm had been shaken
by the recent armed conflict in the 73rd Demon Realm.

[We need an archangel to monitor the ruler of the 73rd Demon Realm, the
Demon King of Salvation.]

Confusion filled the angels' faces. Gabriel asked in a sharp voice, [Wait,
isn't that originally Uriel's mission? And what does it have to do with the
Demon Realm Convention…]

[It is relevant. Now that Uriel is being detained, other archangels need to do
her work.]

Metatron's gaze moved across the archangels.

[Raphael had a doctrines tour next week and Raguel is scheduled to visit
Vedas so the mission…]

The scribe's eyes finally stopped on one archangel.
[…Me?]




In the days after the party, the party members enjoyed a sudden luxury.

"Dokja-ssi, can I accept something like this?"

"I bought it for Hyunsung-ssi."

Kim Dokja bought clothes or items for the party members every day from
the Dokkaebi Bad, as if compensation for his absence in the meantime. The
kids were particularly excited.

"Hey, look at this Shin Yoosung!"

"I received it as well?"

Shin Yoosung and Lee Gilyoung laughed and ran through the streets while
covered with accessories bought by Kim Dokja. Jung Heewon saw the
scene and laughed. "The kids look like a Christmas tree."

The two children were sitting on Lee Hyunsung's big shoulders. The same
was true for Lee Hyunsung. He was excited about the new shield he
received from Kim Dokja.

"…Three fools."

She muttered as she looked around and saw Lee Jihye approaching while
wearing a triangular gimbap-like helmet on her head. If the other three were
like a Christmas tree, she was a three-tier cake.

"Do you have a good relationship with Dokja ahjussi these days?"

"I have belatedly realized the importance of colleagues."
Lee Jihye narrowed her eyes at Jung Heewon's reaction. "Unni… perhaps
you haven't received anything?"

"I don't need it."

In fact, Kim Dokja had visited Jung Heewon several times. However, he
didn't give her any items and only taught her a few training methods as well
as telling her about hidden pieces. She told him that they were things she
could do without him and Kim Dokja's expression was still vivid in her
mind.

She was going to give Lee Jihye some honey when someone poked her
shoulder. She looked back and saw the tired Kim Dokja.

"Ah, Dokja-ssi…"

Kim Dokja had dark circles on his face as he held out something towards
Jung Heewon.

"This…"

"It is a new suit. It will be more comfortable for you."

Jung Heewon accepted the clothes in a daze. It was a blue-black special suit
with a large cloak. She had seen it at the exchange but gave up because it
was too expensive.

"The clothes are too expensive. I still have enough…"

Kim Dokja silently shook his head. Jung Heewon saw his unknown facial
expression and recalled a memory from a long time ago. During the days at
Chungmuro, she received an outfit from Kim Dokja. At the time, it was a
rag…

[The constellation 'Bald General of Justice' is disappointed with incarnation
'Jung Heewon'.]
"You agreed to be my sword. I should do at least this much for you." Kim
Dokja said these words and instantly walked away like he had something
else happening. Jung Heewon stared at Kim Dokja's back and touched the
special uniform in her hands.

Lee Jihye grinned from next to her. "Unni's mouth…"

"What?"

"Nothing, I just found something from the corners of your mouth. Unni, if
you don't like it then exchange it with my helmet. That suit is really
romantic."

"I don't want to."

She looked closer and saw a pattern on the suit that was similar to Lee
Hyunsung's shield. Made bai… Yangu… san…? Jung Heewon wasn't
fluent in English, scratched her head and gave up reading. In any case, it
was good.

"By the way, why is ahjussi suddenly doing this? The person who sold food
for money…"

"I don't know. He might be plotting something strange like before."

It certainly wasn't strange if it was Kim Dokja. He gave her such a good
item that he would definitely put her to tremendous use.

Jung Heewon looked at the suit and felt like an office worker who received
a salary advance. She was discussing with Lee Jihye how to wear the coat
more stylishly when someone appeared and passed her like a ghost.

"Sangah-ssi, what's going on?"

"Huh? Ah, yes. It's nothing.
Yoo Sangah, who was staring blankly into space, reacted with surprise. Her
pupils were empty. Jung Heewon realized that something was strange and
tried to speak but Lee Jihye was one step faster.

"Aha, I understand. Sangah unni hasn't received an item?"

Jung Heewon poked Lee Jihye's ribs and she let out a light shriek. Yoo
Sangah smiled helplessly. "I just have many thoughts these days…
Heewonssi, that is a wonderful outfit."

"Ah, yes. Dokja-ssi gave it… I think it is too much to wear it."

"I think it suits you very well."

"Is that so? Thank you." Jung Heewon scratched his head. There was a
shining bracelet that hadn't been seen before on Yoo Sangah's wrist.

The mood became awkward and Jung Heewon asked awkwardly, "Ah right,
how is Dokja-ssi lately?"

"Dokja-ssi?"

Yoo Sangah's expression asked what she meant. Jung Heewon, who
might've been misinformed, started speaking gibberish. "Eh, er, I mean… I
just wanted to know if the two of you are doing well…"

Yoo Sangah cocked her head to one side and muttered, "Umm, I think it is
the same as when we were in the company…"

was similar to when they were at the company. It was a difficult response
for a hopeful observer. Lee Jihye whispered to Jung Heewon.

"Didn't I tell you before? There is nothing between them. Dokja ahjussi's
taste doesn't go that way. We…"

"I understand why my sponsor likes you. By the way, has your master
woken up?"
"Not yet. I heard it would take a few more days."

In the distance, Kim Dokja seemed to be talking to himself as he headed
towards the ward.

"Is there something to give…"

The clock tower was on the verge of completion. The boisterous laughter of
the party members could be heard. Gong Pildu was dissecting something
like a machine gun while Han Myungoh was testing a new prosthetic leg.

Without knowing why, Jung Heewon felt overwhelmed. In any case, the
party was all gathered now. They would soon return to Earth and go
through the hellish scenarios again. Even so, Jung Heewon was afraid. Jung
Heewon watched the sunset from the clock tower and recalled the words
she heard in the Theatre Dungeon.

–I wish to see the novel's epilogue.

At the time, the Kim Dokja who said these words seemed very lonely. She
didn't know what he meant at the time but now she felt like she knew a bit.
Now one thing was clear.

When the 'epilogue' came, Kim Dokja wouldn't be alone.




It was a few days after the part ended. The constellations present in the
industrial complex started to leave one by one. I went to see the
constellations off and found two flowers in the chest pocket of my coat.

"What is this?"
It was a pair of red cosmos and a lily. It wasn't a very suitable
combination… did the kids do it? I took care of the flowers and headed
towards the square. Some constellations had already passed through the
portal. Among those leaving were constellations who signed a special
contract with the Kim Dokja's Company nebula, including the old man in
front of me.

[It looks like you're preparing for war. You don't have to be so impatient.]

"In the scenario, it is always war."

The Mass Production Maker chuckled at my words.

[Don't be senseless. I want you to be different from the other
constellations.]

"Thank you for the help."

I smiled and bowed my head. The Mass Production Maker opened the door
of the car before stopping and looking at me. [There is one final thing I
want to ask…]

"Yes. Feel free to ask."

The Mass Production Maker didn't immediately ask the question. Instead,
he pulled out a cigarette and mumbled. […Have you ever thought about
what exactly ■■ is?]

He turned on his lighter and touched the end of the cigarette to the flame.
The Mass Production Maker sighed and blew out smoke before continuing.

[Is it the place we want to reach or the place destiny is leading us to? Is it a
place, a life or a space?]

Perhaps the Mass Production Maker had thought about this question
countless times. Finally, he wouldn't have found the answer.
"The certain thing is that it is the end of the story."

[Sometimes I find your calmness amazing.]

"I'm nervous as well."

[I felt it at the time of the Gourmet Association but you're not as good at
lying as you think.]

The Mass Production Maker laughed like a child.

[Then I'm asking you… is your ■■ really the 'final chapter'?]

The words broke through my guard. I reflexively shut my lips. The Mass
Production Maker waited patiently for my answer. I finally opened my
mouth once the Mass Production Maker's cigarette was burned halfway
through.

"I don't know where the story will take me. However… I'm sure that the
place I want to go is the final chapter."

He continued to listen after I finished. It was as if my story was still
ongoing. Once the remaining cigarette had been burned, the Mass
Production Maker laughed.

[I hope that I'm on the last page with you.]

"Go carefully, old man."

[Be careful.]

There was a light engine sound and the Mass Production Maker's car
slipped into the portal. The other constellations also disappeared into the
portal. The portal closed and ominous sparks filled the empty sky.
I watched the sparks and touched the petals in my pocket. Now the
remaining time was three days. Soon, the most important story of the
industrial complex would begin.
         Chapter 279: Ep. 53 - Demon King of Salvation, I


A door with an image of two baby angels blushing. Gabriel's lips twitched
as he saw the [Uriel ☆] written on the nameplate.
[Hey.]

There was no answer when he knocked on the door. Thus, he did it again.

[Hey Uriel!]

He knocked harder on the door and there was a groan from beside it.

[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' says to get lost.]

Gabriel frowned at the indirect message.

[Do you think I'm happy to come here? I'm here because of my mission.]
Gabriel sounded like it was annoying just to speak. It had been two days
since he received the unreasonable assignment from Metatron. He was
planning to play around but Metatron got in front of him.

–Gabriel, please take over Uriel's mission. In addition, Jophiel will watch
Gabriel to ensure he isn't being lazy.

–Leave it to me.

He was placed in a team with the upright Jophiel. Gabriel would rather be
in a team with Uriel.

[Didn't you record your observations of the Demon King of Salvation? I
came here to grab it. Open the door!]

There was a rustling sound from beyond the door.

[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' is asking why you are her
successor.]

[Yes you ■.]

Once again, an indirect message rang like a thunderbolt.

[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' says '■■■■'.]

[Do you want to come out and say it yourself?]

[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' is asking if you are her only
successor.]

[Me and Jophiel.]

A deep sigh was heard beyond the door. After a while, there was a gap in
the door and long fingertips emerged. Looking closer, the white fingertips
were holding onto something. Gabriel realized its identity and clicked his
tongue.
[…USB? Who uses a USB these days? Are you a human?]

[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' is warning you not to speak
nonsense and take it.]

Gabriel received the USB and Uriel added.

[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' says it is a secret from the
Red Cosmos.]

[Jophiel? Why?]

Uriel didn't respond and shut the door. Then intermittent sniffling was
heard in the distance. Gabriel was about to say something only to end up
pouting. They usually didn't get along but he became worried when he saw
'Demon Hunter Uriel' like this.

[Hey, don't tremble. The detainment will be released soon. It's only three
years…]

[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' is shouting at you to get lost!]

[Crazy ■. I was only trying to comfort ■.]

After a while, Gabriel opened the USB in his room. Then…

[What the hell did you do on this mission?]

Despite his mutters, Gabriel couldn't take his eyes off the footage on the
screen.




[The constellation 'Lily Blooming in Aquarius' is curious about you.]
[The constellation 'Lily Blooming in Aquarius' likes looking at you.]

Jung Heewon frowned as she heard the voice in the air. Uriel disappeared
and this time a strange constellation clung to her. This wasn't her only
concern. Jung Heewon looked at Kim Dokja who was wandering in the
distance.

"…Why isn't he saying anything?"

"What do you mean?"

Jung Heewon turned around and see Lee Jihye closely stuck to her.

"Never mind."

"Why, what is it?"

"It's nothing."

"Unni, are you going to join Kim Dokja's Company?"

Jung Heewon, who was swallowing the drink she bought from a street
vendor, gasped as she choked. "W-What? No! The name is too strange. Isn't
it embarrassing to join a place like that?"

"I'm looking forward to it. The company name is a bit strange but it feels
like I'm experiencing the workplace. Perhaps I will even receive a salary?"
"If you know what a real workplace is like, you'll think differently."

Lee Jihye pouted. "In any case, I'm looking for a chance to join. Master is
also there."

"Yoo Joonghyuk-ssi has already joined?"

"Dokja ahjussi said so. This is Yoo Joonghyuk and my nebula!"
Of course, he never said anything like that but Jung Heewon reflexively
looked up at the sky. However, she didn't hear the indirect message she was
waiting for. She felt strangely uncomfortable.

[The constellation 'Lily Blooming in Aquarius' dislikes the humour of
incarnation 'Lee Jihye'.]

Jung Heewon shook her head and looked at Kim Dokja who was busy in
the square. He was so busy she hadn't seen his face for a few days and she
didn't know what he was working so hard on.

Then Yoo Sangah's appearance caught Jung Heewon's eyes. Jung Heewon
waved at Yoo Sangah who was sitting on a bench and staring blankly into
empty air.

"Sangah-ssi! Are you going to join Dokja-ssi's nebula?"

Yoo Sangah discovered Jung Heewon and looked up with surprise. What
was this woman thinking about that she lost her soul for a few days…

"My situation is a bit…"

"Ah, that's right. It is tough for Sangah-ssi."

Yoo Sangah was an incarnation of Olympus. It was a special case where
she was supported by an entire nebula and it would be hard to join Kim
Dokja's nebula. It was obvious what would happen if she received the
sponsorship only to choose another nebula.

"Instead, I made an alliance offer. Some of the constellations have a
friendly relationship with Dokja-ssi through me."

"Don't all the constellations of Olympus hate Dokja-ssi?"

"Not all of them. Heewon-ssi, did you join the nebula?"

"I'm still thinking about it." Jung Heewon looked back at the square again.
"In fact, I'm not sure about joining. There is a problem with my sponsor
and…"

Jung Heewon's high self-esteem seemed hurt and Yoo Sangah smiled
gently.

"I think you will be a great help to Dokja-ssi if you join his nebula."

"I want to help if possible."

Fortunately or unfortunately, Jung Heewon wasn't the only one in a
complicated situation.

In the middle of the distant square, Lee Hyunsung sat down like a dull big
dog. Next to him were Shin Yoosung and Lee Gilyoung, who were
squatting like baby cats as the three of them stared at Kim Dokja. To be
exact, their eyes chased after him every time he moved. It was obvious
what they were waiting for. Kim Dokja ignored them to the end.

"…There is still no word."

Jung Heewon nodded at Lee Jihye's words. "He will speak when the time
comes. It is because he is a secretly introverted person."

Well, she also wanted to know what was going on. A long-awaited peace
had come to the party but Kim Dokja was still thinking about something.
Thus, they could only wait while doing nothing.

[The constellation 'Lily Blooming in Aquarius' is looking at you
approvingly.]

[The constellation 'Commander of the Red Cosmos' is wary of the Demon
King of Salvation.]

…There were strange angels so Jung Heewon wouldn't be bored for a
while. Jung Heewon reluctantly put down her worries.
Then… the work suddenly began.




"Really? There is no way to contact them?"

"The channels leading to the Demon Realm are blocked. It is a powerful
enchantment…"

Han Sooyoung's expression became grim at Lee Sookyung's words. She
had been calling the dokkaebis since a while ago but none responded. Han
Sooyoung looked down at the water bowl that contained the Good or Bad
Luck, Disaster or Happiness Fortune.

Misfortune, misfortune, misfortune, misfortune, misfortune, misfortune,
misfortune…

She couldn't count how many times 'misfortune' emerged.

"What the hell is going on?"

The last time 'great misfortune' appeared, Kim Dokja had to face a
Lokapala of Vedas. However, now there were so many 'misfortunes'… it
wasn't a great misfortune but it should be an extensive misfortune. The
water in the bowl trembled and faint sparks appeared.

[The constellation 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' is raising his head.]

"Black dragon?"

[The constellation 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' is looking at the 73rd
Demon Realm.]

"Do you know something?"
[The constellation 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' is letting out a threatening
cry.]

Her arm wrapped with a bandage was tingling and sparks appeared around
the body that was in sync with the black dragon.

"Hey dude!"

The feelings of the black flame dragon were transmitted. The black
dragon had never acted like this whenever he encountered an opponent.
[The constellation 'Expert at Playing Both Sides' has pale lips.]

[The constellation 'Guam Divine Doctor' is dripping saliva.]

[The constellation 'Great King Heoncheon Hongdo Gyungmun Wimu' is
quietly putting down his

sword.]

[The constellation 'First Spiritualist of Joseon' is clearing his traces.]

The constellations of the Korean Peninsula were turning off their lights. It
was as if they were hiding from a predator. Her bandaged arm kept tingling.

Han Sooyoung scattered Lee Sookyung's divination and unraveled the
bandage to reveal the tattoo of the black dragon that was shining. Sparks
burst and Han Sooyoung's right arm wrote letters in the air.

–A disaster of the stars is coming.

"Disaster of the stars? What is that?"

The arrogant 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' thought this situation was so
urgent he had to manually write. She felt the will of the Abyssal Black
Flame Dragon that wanted to stop her from going to the Demon Realm no
matter what.
"Hey, don't make me nervous. Are you doing this again?"

She had been fooled by the Abyssal Black Flame Dragon more than once or
twice. She didn't know what the black dragon was talking about but Kim
Dokja had predicted Olympus' invasion of the Korean Peninsula. Thus,
maybe he knew about this situation. No matter what came…

There were faint sparks as Han Sooyoung's hand moved through the air like
a brush.

–The 73rd Demon Realm will perish.




It was the Breaking the Sky Sword Saint who noticed it first. She was lying
on the wall of the industrial complex and dropped the smoking pipe in her
mouth.

"…That guy was right."

The Breaking the Sky Sword Saint mumbled while the Breaking the Sky
Sword emitted a blinding light as it was pulled out. After obtaining the
name Breaking the Sky Sword, she held this sword less than 10 times.

It was a sword that made her be called the disaster of Murim. The Breaking
the Sky Sword Saint felt the texture of the sword against her palm and felt
funny.

A disaster. What could be called a disaster? For human beings, disasters
were natural phenomenon on a large scale. For examples, landslides,
tsunamis and earthquakes. They were huge phenomenon that the power of
humans couldn't resist.
For transcendents, it was nothing more than a manipulation of physical
phenomena. They were existences far beyond human standards. They could
cause landslides and tsunamis with a blade and could quiet them. For
transcendents like the Breaking the Sky Sword Saint, the word disaster
meant something different from the standards of ordinary humans.

Perhaps the Breaking the Sky Sword Saint was facing the answer now.

Small sparks bounced and Kyrgios was suddenly by her side. The aura of
Electrification was already rising from Kyrgios' body. The Breaking the
Sky Sword Saint slowly raised her magic power. The two transcendents
looked at the distant end of the void. Kyrgios asked, "It is him?"

It wasn't yet visible to the naked eye but a presence was clearly heading
towards this place. The Breaking the Sky Sword Saint replied in a heavy
voice, "There is no doubt. It is the guy who tried to devour the First
Murim."

Darkness was entering the atmosphere. From the other side of the universe
that swallowed up even light, something was approaching while devouring
the scattered probability.
        Chapter 280: Ep. 53 - Demon King of Salvation, II


[Hidden scenario ― Escape the Demon Realm has begun!]

At this time, all dokkaebis of the bureau were concentrating on the panel.

"Are you kidding me? Why is there no dokkaebi to proceed when the
scenario is released?"

It was the other dokkaebis who blocked Bihyung rioting alone. After the
Demon King Selection, all dokkaebis who operated the channels were
withdrawn from the 73rd Demon Realm.

"Where is Baram? Shit, that Dokgak jerk!"

"…"

"What are you doing here why the Demon Realm channels are running out
of control? If you're going to do this, let me go there!"
"Bihyung, do you think it is possible to broadcast now?"

Even the prideful Dokgak had given up on this scenario. The bureau had
exhausted all the available probability during the Demon King Selection.
Of course, that wasn't the only problem.

–Baat!

There was the cry of a baby dokkaebi who knew nothing. Some dokkaebis
sighed and turned their eyes away while others couldn't take their eyes off
the screen to the end.

The distant presence had crossed the Star Stream and was covering the sky
of the 73rd Demon Realm.

Not all beings lived in the scenario. If the constellations were living in a
'story', the outer gods were based on a confused 'story'. They were beings
born from the subconscious of the story. A monster roaming the deep sea of
the scenario that wasn't possible for the dokkaebis.

'This isn't the right scenario'.

Bihyung looked at 'it' that was opening its massive mouth and prayed with a
gloomy heart.

'Run away Kim Dokja'.




"What is this?"

It was only a few minutes after Jung Heewon had noticed 'it'. Suddenly, the
hairs on her body rose and sweat flowed down. She looked around and saw
the citizens who lost consciousness or were vomiting up blood on the
ground. Lee Jihye stood beside her and was squeezing her shoulders with
dim eyes.

"Jihye! Wake up!"

Her shoulders shook several times before Lee Jihye barely managed to look
up. "U-Uh, uhhh… unni…"

Her nails dug into her shoulders and blood was flowing.

Jung Heewon looked around the square. Yoo Sangah was already moving.
"Everyone, gather this way!"

Her voice was filled with magic power and the party members came to their
senses one by one.

"W-What is that?"

Lee Hyunsung and the children looked up at the sky. Lee Gilyoung
staggered while Shin Yoosung grabbed onto Lee Hyunsung and trembled.

At this moment, all the party members in the square were thinking the same
thing. It didn't matter how many books they read or how many words they
knew.

'It can't be described'.

Yoo Sangah, Lee Hyunsung and Jung Heewon were the same. All human
words were helpless in front of the coming existence. The entire sky was
covered by the darkness of this being.

The party members couldn't understand what they were seeing. Thanks to
this, they lost their means to cope.

If a typhoon blew, they could place newspapers against the window. If
a tsunami occurred, they could enter sturdy high-rise buildings. If a
fallout started, they could hide in a basement with thick barriers. But
this… How the hell could they stop it? Was it possible to stop it?

Then a man appeared in the sky where the light had disappeared. He
exhausted his probability as he shone brightly.

Jung Heewon discovered his appearance and was filled with relief. Most of
the constellations who attended the banquet left the Demon Realm two days
ago. However, it wasn't everyone.

Surrounding by brilliant sparks, the man stood on the walls. He shouted
loudly, [Everyone, wake up!]

Goryeo's First Sword, Cheok Jungyeong. The huge roar echoed from the
walls and the incarnations with the strongest minds barely regained their
sanity. They watched Cheok Jungyeong. They didn't know what was
coming but there was Cheok Jungyeong on this side. Cheok Jungyeong also
had experience fighting against an outer god.

[Outer god! Why did you come here? This isn't your scenario!]

It was a resounding yell towards the sky. A light of hope emerged in the
faces of the incarnations after they heard this voice. Cheok Jungyeong
shouted once again.

[What a great foreign power, eating up the extra probability!]

Despite the repeated calls, there was no response from the sky. Just like an
elephant didn't see an ant, 'it' didn't even look at Cheok Jungyeong. Cheok
Jungyeong's expression hardened. If the elephant didn't see an ant then he
would make it look.

[■■■■■! Indescribable Distance!]

At this moment, something stared at Cheok Jungyeong. Sparks exploded
from Cheok Jungyeong's body. His outer skin was charred black. Cheok
Jungyeong's tight muscles were ruptured and blood flowed as a broken star
relic flew through the air as ashes. It was the price for merely calling the
name. Nevertheless, Cheok Jungyeong raised his sword without backing
down.

[It is a sword that cuts the mountains, the sea and even the sun. With this
sword, I'll cut you this time.]

The enormity that couldn't be grouped into 'one' description filled Cheok
Jungyeong's eyes.

He didn't know where to cut because he couldn't see where it started or
ended. In the infinity that even a handful of possibilities didn't exist, Cheok
Jungyeong moved.

[Ohhhhhh!]

A beam of light shot from Cheok Jungyeong.

Cutting 1,000 people with one sword. Cutting a great mountain with two
swords. Separating the sea with three swords.

The sword shone like a meteor shower as it moved through the vast
darkness. For a moment, a ray of light was drawn into the depths of the sky.
The incarnations saw the light and were thrilled.

Goryeo's First Sword was fighting the outer god. The next moment, they
heard a strange noise in the sky. It was the sound of a star that had finished
its life cycle in a distant galaxy. Then something fell from the sky.

"A-Ahh, ah…"

Someone with good vision discovered it first. The cut off arms and legs.
Only half of the incarnation body was left and the areas cut off were falling
to the ground. Surprise and disbelief. Even those who couldn't see Cheok
Jungyeong's expression knew what he was feeling.
A sword that cut a mountain, a sea and even the sun. There was something
that this swordsmanship couldn't cut. It was 'unbreakable' from the
beginning. It was the Breaking the Sky Sword Saint who caught Cheok
Jungyeong's ruined body.

[…Remember the sword.]

Cheok Jungyeong's incarnation body died and he left. It was the incarnation
body of a narrative-grade constellation. He broke Surya's train and cut off
the legs of an outer god. Yet such a constellation lost his incarnation body
in a single moment of battle.

"U-Uwaaaaack!"

The screams of the citizens were heard as fear encroached on their mind.
The darkness filled the horizon in all directions. The ground wriggled and
moved like a fetus. It was the sound of a giant worm eating its prey. It
seemed that the horizon was getting closer. The intensity of the light
shining on the ground gradually decreased.

[The 73rd Demon Realm is groaning with pain!]

The Breaking the Sky Sword Saint and Kyrgios had already seen this scene
in the First Murim.

Kyrgios spoke, "…I'm going to die here because of my crazy disciple."

"Neither you or I have any luck with our disciples."

The world let out a scream. The darkness filled with greet was approaching
and eating the 73rd Demon Realm. Kyrgios concentrated all the magic
power of the Purest Sword Force.

"This is why we have to stick to probability."
The Indescribable Distance. The outer god, called the disaster of the stars,
was in a sense, a probability storm itself. It was the janitor who came from
chaos caused by rules of the Star Stream being broken.

"Things have already gone wrong so it can't be helped. I twist it with all my
strength!"

The Breaking the Sky Sword Saint cried out and two transcendent lights
shone brightly.

The sword of Breaking the Sky that split apart the sky. She held the power
of First Murim in her arms as the Breaking the Sky Sword Saint shot
towards the sky.

Breaking the Sky Swordsmanship.

Destruction skill.

Breaking the Sky Meteor.

It was the sword technique that Yoo Joonghyuk had used in the past. It was
the Breaking the Sky Swordsmanship that defeated countless constellations.
The first Breaking the Sky Sword shot towards the sky. The explosive
magic power was radiant in the air and the meteor sword drew colourful
shapes.

However, 'it' didn't even receive a scratch. Like dust drifting in space, the
sword disappeared into the void. Her swordsmanship that broke the sky
couldn't destroy the universe.

"Kyrgios!"

Kyrgios received the signal and stepped on the Breaking the Sky Sword
Saint's shoulder before jumping. Kyrgios accelerated with the power of
Electrification, penetrating through the atmosphere and flying into the
expanse.
An unending universe. In the shadow of the darkness, Kyrgios felt the
darkness covering the sky and the gaze of the stars looking from beyond the
darkness.

[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' is emitting a golden
light.]

[The constellation 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' is roaring!]

It was a place where stars stayed. It was a place that could never be reached
with short human arms. Kyrgios also knew it. Thus, he tried. He tried and
tried again.

He stepped on the meteor fragments left behind by the Breaking the Sky
Sword Saint and Kyrgios jumped higher and higher. He rushed towards the
unreachable stars and the mortal existence who build his history through
hard work finally reached the stars.

He reached the universe. Kyrgios finally reached a position where he could
see 'it'. It was reminiscent of a huge fog. The fog without a definite shape
was greedily devouring the 73rd Demon Realm. The center of the fog
contained a thread left behind by Cheok Jungyeong.

The blue-white power climbed to the limit and was concentrated in
Kyrgios's right hand.

[From the smallest particle, the universe began.]

Kyrgios' right hand moved along with his fierce cry. Like a big bang, the
blue-white energy struck the center of the fog. There was a white flash and
all citizens closed their eyes.

It was the moment the two transcendent forces overwhelmed the darkness
covering the universe. The moment the light was turned off, there was a
huge crack in the darkness that covered the sky.
The citizens shouted, "H-He did it."

"He did it! The transcendent did it!"

However, the Breaking the Sky Sword Saint's expression wasn't good. The
Breaking the Sky Sword Saint looked at Kyrgios piercing through the
expanse and laughed faintly.

'It is up to here'.

Beyond the falling Kyrgios, the sky was splitting. Something in the
darkness was awakening. It was a pupil. A huge eye had come to the world.
The white lens and black pupils followed the falling Kyrgios. The Breaking
the Sky Sword Sword Saint moved and Kyrgios turned around. The
transcendent power collided with an irresistible atmosphere.

Kyrgios' long hair turned white. The Breaking the Sky Sword Saint's
muscles swelled up until they seemed like they were going to burst. As if
suffering from aging, the two transcendent bodies were dying in front of the
distant time.

The 'status' of the universe was different. They became transcendent
beyond mortals and gained the power to destroy constellations. However,
the history of the grueling training they went through was dust compared to
the 'history' of the universe.

[The 'Indescribable Distance' is looking at the 73rd Demon Realm.]

The citizens became crazy and rushed around. "Escape! Escape!"

"Kieeeeeek!"

The citizens wept like wild beasts without knowing what they were saying.

[The portal can't be used due to the intervention of a strong presence.]

"What, what, what?"
"W-W-W-What?"

"Wwwwwwhat…"

The bodies of the citizens burst all over. Some of them turned into bizarre
beings and others had tentacles emerge from their mouths.

The world was going crazy. However, it wasn't everyone. Before the gaze
of that absurd being, there were those who didn't lay down their swords.

"…Not yet. We can fight."

It was Jung Heewon. Jung Heewon gasped but didn't kneel down as she
controlled her nausea. One by one, the party members stood beside her. The
reason they were able to endure was simple.

[Giant Story 'Demon Realm's Spring' is protecting the incarnations.]

It was because this world was refusing to perish. They were the history of
this 73rd Demon Realm.

[The constellation 'Queen of the Darkest Spring' is shouting to flee!]

[The constellation 'Abandoned Lover of the Labyrinth' is screaming.]

[The constellation 'Seo Ae Il Pil' is closing his eyes in pain.]

The party members also knew it. Any power they had was shabby in front
of that mighty being. Jung Heewon grabbed the Sword of Judgment and
coughed up blood as she shouted.

"Uriel! Please!"

There was no reaction from the Demon-like Judge of Fire. It was the same
for Gong Pildu's Defense Master and Lee Hyunsung's Master of Steel. This
time, they didn't respond to the request of the incarnations. No, they
couldn't respond.
[All the stars in the night sky are silent.]

The constellations in the sky didn't offer anything. Just as thunder and
lightning couldn't be controlled, 'that' wasn't something that could be
received.

The terrified Osu pissed. Jang Hayoung collapsed on the ground and
vomited. The senseless Gong Pildu started to build meaningless walls. Han
Myungoh shivered and looked around for a place for his one leg. However,
his foot didn't move. In front of the creature that devoured the world, there
was no straw for his foot.

"Dokja-ssi!"

Then there was Kim Dokja. Yoo Sangah cried out and everyone looked at
the same place. It was the top of the unfinished clock tower. As time flowed
slowly, Kim Dokja stood on the edge of the tower.

[The constellation 'Demon King of Salvation' is looking at the night sky.]

A star that uniquely illuminated the night sky that had its light turned off. It
was the Demon King of Salvation.
        Chapter 281: Ep. 53 - Demon King of Salvation, III


Jung Heewon muttered, "…Dokja-ssi?"

Beyond the glare of Kim Dokja's light, the huge eye was looking down at
the world. The moment she faced this eye, Jung Heewon's entire body
trembled. The ground was distorted and shook like a tsunami was
approaching.

[The 73rd Demon Realm is crying out with pain!]

Lava burst from the broken crust and the overflowing heat once again
disappeared into the empty stomach. The whole world was becoming
narrower around the industrial complex. Then it was obvious what would've
happened to the other industrial complexes.

The transcendent magic power amplified by the story moved. It was
unreasonable to directly oppose that 'eye' but the seismic waves could be
slowed.
"Quickly, you stupid disciple!"

Kyrgios shouted and the space beyond the walls of the industrial complex
distorted. The horizon was swallowed up by a huge fog and disappeared
into the darkness. No, it wasn't the horizon any longer.

Nevertheless, Jung Heewon didn't release her string of hope. If what she
heard was right, the teachers and Kim Dokja had already predicted this
situation.

"Ahjussi! What the hell is this?"

Cheok Jungyeong's body disappeared and Kyrgios and the Breaking the
Sky Sword Saint were in a poor state. However, Kim Dokja hadn't acted
until the situation became this bad.

Kim Dokja's lips moved as he constantly muttered something. His eyes
moved quickly as he looked for something in the distant universe.

Jung Heewon realized it. Just as they hadn't given up, Kim Dokja hadn't
given up either. Kim Dokja slowly came down towards the ground. Jung
Heewon shouted as a signal, "Get ready!"

Lee Hyunsung used Steel Transformation and asked, "Dokja-ssi! What
should we do?"

Everyone was watching Kim Dokja. They didn't know what but Kim Dokja
would have something in mind.

Kim Dokja slowly blinked and looked at the party members. Over the past
few days, Kim Dokja gave many things to the party members. Lee
Hyunsung gained a new shield and Jung Heewon got a new skill. Lee
Jihye's magic power was strengthened and Shin Yoosung and Lee Gilyoung
learnt a large number of control skills. The party members believed it.

[Giant Story 'Demon Realm's Spring' is moving for the owner of the story.]
If they had this giant story that they built together and the plan prepared by
Kim Dokja, they would be able to knock down even the strongest enemy.
They even destroyed Surya's train. Even if this enemy came…
"Ah…jussi…?"

The earliest one to sense something unusual was Shin Yoosung. There were
rough sparks as Shin Yoosung's knees sank downwards. Her body couldn't
move, like there was a chain tied around her.

「 This is the story of Dokja. 」

The giant story that flowed from Kim Dokja's body became powerful
shackles around the party members. Lee Hyunsung was slowly sinking to
the ground. His face was blank as he asked, "Dokja-ssi? What is this…?"

Kim Dokja's expression was still unreadable. He was there but he didn't
seem together with them. The party members thought they were all in this
together so why?

Why did Kim Dokja seem to be there alone? There was no 'story' that
existed alone. Kim Dokja's 'King of a Kingless World' was linked to Yoo
Joonghyuk's 'One Who Succeeded the Name of the King' while Jung
Heewon's 'Exclusion of Future Evil' was linked to Kim Dokja's One Who
Showed Contempt for a Streamer.

Not to mention the giant story that was a share in a larger story. The giant
story 'Demon Realm's Spring' was of everyone who participated in the
terrible battlefield. Nevertheless, at this moment, the Demon Realm's
Spring was only for Kim Dokja.

[The chief narrator of the giant story 'Demon Realm's Spring' has started his
story.]

All the stakes in the giant story given to the party members were being
controlled. The party members resisted using their stake in the giant story.
Jung Heewon, Yoo Sangah, Lee Hyunsung, Lee Gilyoung, Shin Yoosung…
Even with all the shares they had, they couldn't defeat the gigantic will of a
single person. It might've been different if Yoo Joonghyuk was awake but
Yoo Joonghyuk wasn't here now.

Jung Heewon sat on the ground and cried out painfully, "Wait! What is
this? What the hell is this?"

Jung Heewon stared at Kim Dokja's expression and finally realized
something.

Before a looming crisis, Kim Dokja always made a certain expression. The
corners of his lips curved slightly and he looked a bit unlucky, but it
reassured the members. Now Kim Dokja's expression…

Why?

"If you were going to do this anyway, why have you been preparing us for
the past few days? Why give me these skills?"

At Jung Heewon's desperate cry, Kim Dokja opened his mouth for the first
time. "I told you how to deal with the sasquatch in the 28th scenario."

"T-Then my shield…"

"It will be useful for catching the 'algonkin snake' in the 35th scenario.
Don't forget your skills. Didn't I tell you all how to use it?"

As always, there was a reason for the arrangement. To the companions who
were looking bewildered, Kim Dokja gave reasons one by one.

"Then this… this scenario…"

However, none of the arrangements were for this situation.

The darkness was covering the horizon. Kim Dokja watched the darkness
and spoke, "I'll handle this situation."
"Shit! Don't talk nonsense!"

Jung Heewon shouted. "I can't let you go! Don't go alone again! Please!"

It was impossible for Kim Dokja to deal with that thing alone. The two
transcendents and Cheok Jungyeong couldn't block it. There was no way
Kim Dokja alone could face such a thing.

"Aaaaaaack! I don't like this! Dokja hyung!"

She grew stronger because she didn't want to be in debt to him like last
time. She performed the hellish personal scenarios and frantically defeated
monsters. Jung Heewon shouted as she coughed up blood. "It is you who
said we couldn't do this alone! You were the one who gathered us! You told
me all of this!"

An unfamiliar true voice flowed from the lips of the smiling Kim Dokja. [I
know.]

"What do you know? The person who knows, how…?"

[Still, not now.]

Lee Hyunsung screamed, "I don't want this! I don't need this type of help.
I'll die here! I'll die here with Dokja-ssi!"

Dying here. Kim Dokja, who was staring at the sky, lowered his gaze
towards the party members.

[The constellation 'Demon King of Salvation' is looking at the party.]

The party members heard the message. They looked at Kim Dokja's
fluttering hair. They saw his long eyelashes, his eyes, his white cheeks and
sadly distorted lips. Suddenly, they realized that Kim Dokja could exist in
this world with such an expression.

[Please live.]
They listened helplessly like the true voice was a command.

[The demon king 'Demon King of Salvation' is looking out.]

Kim Dokja's expression was changing. The sleeping power of the demon
king was awakening.

[The story 'Demon King of Salvation' has begun.]

The stories of the 73rd Demon Realm started to gather around him. The
white coat was stained black from the demonic energy and two horns rose
from Kim Dokja's head. It was the power of the 'Demon King
Transformation' that only a demon king could use.

[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' is looking at his
friend.]

[The constellation 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' is paying homage to his
adversary.]

[The constellation 'Goryeo's First Sword' is making a furious yell.]

[The constellation 'Supreme God of Light' is watching the end of the 73rd
Demon Realm.]

Dark feathers stretched from Kim Dokja's shoulders and reached towards
the night sky. The second hand of the clock tower moved slowly and Kim
Dokja soared. As if leaving this time, the Demon King of Salvation became
a light and flew towards the sky.

The moment Kim Dokja penetrated the expanse, thunder struck. A few
thunderbolts poured down and the fog coming from the horizon stopped.

It was as if time had stopped. The party members looked up at the night sky
where Kim Dokja disappeared and couldn't breathe properly. Time
continued passing on the incomplete clock tower. One minute, two minutes,
three minutes…

No matter how much time passed, Kim Dokja didn't come back. Jung
Heewon screamed, "Kim Dokjaaaaa!"

At almost the same time, the transcendents were thrown from the wall. The
ragged Breaking the Sky Sword Saint and Kyrgios staggered and rose from
their spot.

The fog started eating the world again. It ate everything on the horizon and
was nearing the walls. The walls were disintegrating. People screamed.

Jung Heewon was busy thinking. 'He can't stop it. Kim Dokja can't stop
that'.

Fog covered the entire industrial complex. The next moment, Jung Heewon
felt her body being transmitted elsewhere.

Yoo Sangah closed her eyes like she had given up and Lee Hyunsung
howled as he watched the sky.

Han Myungoh sat down and Gong Pildu guarded the destroyed castle.

Everyone was leaking white sparks. Then everyone in the Yoo Joonghyuk
Kim Dokja Industrial Complex were sent somewhere else.

A threatening cry was heard from the fog like it was furious.

[■■■■… ■■■■■■!]

Soon, the darkness swallowed up everything.
In the faint uproar, Yoo Joonghyuk opened his eyes. The muscles of his
body didn't move well. The aftereffects of Recovery were big.

He stared up at the cracked ceiling and took deep breaths to calm himself.
Then he remembered what happened.

There was the Demon King Selection. He refused to regress. He fought
with Kim Dokja and won against Surya. He thought about it and energy
filled his head.

They won. They had won.

Magic power moved roughly through his body and he felt a bit dizzy. His
senses slowly returned. He blinked once again and the scene around him
gradually entered his eyes.

It was a hospital room. He could feel the texture of a soft bed and his right
hand touched something hard.

Yoo Joonghyuk raised his upper body with a groan and saw a small pocket
watch wrapped around his arm with a watch strap. The moving hands of the
clock were like his heartbeat. Yoo Joonghyuk looked down at his watch.

There was the faint glimmer of sunshine outside the window. The sunshine
was too bright for the Demon Realm.

Yoo Joonghyuk slowly rose and went to the window. Beyond the walls of
the collapsed industrial complex, he saw a strange but familiar scene. The
broken statue of Admiral Yi Sunsin and the ruined Gyeongbok Palace.
Smoke was coming from the collapsed buildings of Gwanghwamun.

It was Seoul.

He could see the party members sitting down outside the window. Yoo
Joonghyuk's head was confused.
Why… they were in Seoul? It was the entire industrial complex.

Yoo Joonghyuk looked at the party members with bewildered eyes. He
didn't see a familiar face. "…Kim Dokja?"

The moment he muttered this, a message was heard.

[The story 'Life and Death Companions' is silent.]

Yoo Joonghyuk heard the message with a blank expression and stared at the
window again.

…Not there. He couldn't be seen anywhere.

Yoo Joonghyuk looked up at the sky. The sky was bright enough that the
light of the stars wasn't needed. He counted the light of the constellation
beyond them. He counted and counted again. He didn't know. There were
so many stars that he couldn't find the person.

Yoo Joonghyuk opened his mouth and spoke in a trembling voice.

[The item Midday Tryst has been used.]

The message window that hadn't been used for a while was opened and a
message was sent.

[The message has been returned.]

It must be an error. He sent the message repeatedly, several times over and
over. He sent it, sent it and sent it again. As the messages kept being
returned, Yoo Joonghyuk's gaze slowly lowered. Then finally.

[You have exhausted the quota for today's messages.]

There was a ticking pocket watch in the foreground while messages filled

        Chapter 282: Ep. 53 - Demon King of Salvation, IV


[The exclusive skill 'Fourth Wall' is shaking violently.]

I didn't mean to do this in the beginning. The start was shortly after the
battle with Surya. The day he gained a giant story and protected the Demon
Realm with his companions.

–Three Ways to Survive in a Ruined World (3rd

Revision).txt I received the third revision of Ways of

Survival.

「 When he opened his eyes, Yoo Joonghyuk thought, 'It is the fourth
regression'. 」

At first, I read it with a light heart. I was looking forward to it. The current
'third turn' was more perfect than any of the turns that Yoo Joonghyuk
experienced. In the 25th scenario, I became a demon king and got a giant
story. Maybe in this revision, the ending I wanted would be recorded. By
the way.

「 I thought it was going well. That's what that person said. Everyone was
fine until the 'outer god' appeared. 」

「 Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why?
Why? Why? Why? Why? 」

Yoo Joonghyuk was different from the first and second revisions. He lost
his reason, was hasty and didn't make plans. Yoo Joonghyuk was seriously
broken by something that happened in the third round.

「 On that day, everything in the third round was over. 」

I read this part and realized what was wrong. I looked at the black fog
coming over the walls and bit my lips. The Fourth Wall wriggled in my
head and spewed out sentences.

「 Kim Dokja thought: It might fail. 」

I couldn't survive if I died this time. Now I didn't have my resurrection
attribute. Once I was swallowed up by the outer god, I would be entirely
wiped out. However, if I could stop him…

「 I can't beat him no matter how I look through Ways of Survival. 」

Han Sooyoung had told me that the Earth scenarios faithfully followed the
original trajectory. If we passed this crisis safely, we could aim for areas of
the original novel and head for the desired ending.

Below the clock tower, my colleagues were looking up at me.

「 No, there is one way. The 'failed' method in the original.

」 I just had to do it well.
「 They have to live. They might not like it but they have to live. 」

I couldn't let anyone die.

「 Only then will everyone be able to reach the ending. 」

The night sky split apart and I saw a giant eye looking down at the ground.
The transcendents sank down while coughing up blood.

Kyrgios was already told the story in advance and shouted, "Quickly, you
stupid disciple!"

I nodded and descended from the clock tower. I couldn't waste the time that
Cheok Jungyeong and the masters had earned.

"I can't let you go! Don't go alone again! Please!"

"Aaaaaaack! I don't like this! Dokja hyung!"

"It is you who said we couldn't do this alone! You were the one who
gathered us! You told me all of this!"

I heard the cries of the party members and told them the necessary stories.
Really. I really only told them what they needed.

[Please live.]

My head tickled as horns emerged from it. My back was sore from the
wings. I could hear the screams of Jung Heewon and cries of Lee
Hyunsung. The children reached out for me. Yoo Sangah, who heard the
story from me in advance, couldn't take her eyes off me while crying. Yoo
Sangah would do things well.

The moment I pushed off from the ground, my panoramic view changed.
The grieving voices of the party members drifted away. Maybe I wanted to
tell them something.
「 I want to see the ending with you. 」

There was a sound as I pierced through the atmosphere and the fog let out a
pained scream.

[The constellation 'God of Wine and Ecstasy' has dropped his glass.]

[The constellation 'Queen of the Darkest Spring' is letting out a deep sigh.]

[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' wishes you good

luck.] Some constellations were worried about me.

[The constellation 'Commander of the Red Cosmos' dislikes you.]

[Some constellations are denouncing your actions.]

Some constellations criticized me. No one sponsored me any coins. Perhaps
even the constellations knew. This wasn't a story for coins.

「 Wiping his cheeks, Kim Dokja looked at the vast universe. 」

The center of the fog. I could see the small scar made by Cheok Jungyeong,
the Breaking the Sky Sword Saint and Kyrgios. I activated Electrification
and threw myself towards the scar. It was a method I would've never
attempted if it was the original novel.

However, now there was no other way. The outer gods didn't share their
language with unqualified beings. The Purest Sword Force rose in my right
hand while I raised Unbroken Faith.

Demonic energy moved through the blood vessels in my body and the black
aura overlaid with the blue-white energy. A powerful shock wave burst
from the center of the fog as the magic power in my right hand exploded. A
very small gap opened for a moment and I didn't hesitate.
I entered the dark fog and the outer god was revealed. Like white blood
cells that caught infecting bacteria, thousands, tens of thousands, hundreds
of millions… countless particles looked at me at the same time. It was as if
they were eyes.

Indescribable Distance, the Nameless Mist. It was the name of the disaster
that drifted in the Star Stream. I opened my mouth towards that being.

[ The great outer god.]

Strictly speaking, this mist wasn't the original form of the outer god. It was
a terrible prototype. However, this alter ego contained enormous power.
[Please. Please leave.]

The particles pulsed at my words. Of course, I didn't expect words to work.
The fog particles gathered around me started to eat at me.

[Giant Story 'Demon Realm's Spring' is protecting your incarnation body!]

[The Fourth Wall is protecting your spirit!]

The influence of the Fourth Wall kept me from falling in front of this vast
existence. However, it was impossible to stop the 'giant story' from being
damaged little by little.

[■■■■······■■■■]

The fog was talking in an unknown language. Perhaps I couldn't hear it
properly even if it was interpreted. The Indescribable Distance was closer
to an unconscious thing. It was a hungry predator that only used its instincts
to follow the story.

My presence grew thinner in the choking fog.

[…Damn son of a bitch.]
Even Uriel descending couldn't stop this guy. It was the same for the
current the Great Sage, Heaven's Equal and the Abyssal Black Flame
Dragon. It might be possible if all three came but that wouldn't happen.

「 There is only one thing that can help Kim Dokja now. 」

An existence that didn't appear in Ways of Survival. There was only one
thing that could possibly help me against this fog. The starlight could be
dimly seen between the fog particles. I came all this way just to give him
the 'right' voice.

[Secretive Plotter!]

The voice that was released with all its might penetrated the fog and
crossed the interstellar space. The fog wriggled and roared as something
shone from across the distant galaxy.

I once again shouted, [I will make a 'Outer World Covenant' with you!]




Yoo Joonghyuk was unhappy every time he made an Outer World
Covenant. It was because he couldn't afford it or had to fulfill a ridiculous
contract. But this was the only way. This was the first and last way for me
to live.

The fog didn't start eating. It didn't stop eating me or the 73rd Demon
Realm. I got a bad feeling as I saw the stories being broken. Could
Secretive Plotter stop this guy?

Time and space creaked and everything started slowing down. The
overwhelming power was controlling all the time and space in the area. The
fog cried out and the life activities of everything around me suddenly
stopped. Like living creatures frozen in a glacier, they were trapped in that
time forever.

The next moment, I stood in an unknown galaxy. I looked down at my feet
and saw the scene of the Star Stream. It was outside the Star Stream, the
furthest place of the nebulae of stars. The numerous stars were shining
beautifully at my feet.

[ It is a boring sight. ]

Unlike other outer gods, this voice was very sharp and clear. A shadow
with a man's shape was wavering.

[ I waited for you, the one pursuing the 'final chapter'. ]

A whiteness could be seen as I looked into that gaping mouth. I just listened
to him but my body was shaking. An endless unknown darkness. The evil
that stood in the center of the darkness was staring at me. I wasn't trembling
just because of the ominous status of Secretive Plotter.

[ No, perhaps I should say that you are pursuing eternity. ]

I stared at him and was silent for a moment. "…How did you know?"

[ ■■. ]

His words had two meanings for me.

Eternity. Final chapter. Two opposing meanings were implied in one word.
It was like the messages I heard when I got a giant story.

–You have obtained the qualification of 'eternity'.

–You have obtained the qualification of 'final chapter'.

Oddly, my 'end' had two meanings. When the constellations, including the
Mass Production Maker, asked me about the filtering, I replied with 'final
chapter' because it was easier to persuade the constellations. I never told
anyone that my ■■ had two meanings.

[ Once you live for many years, the things that aren't said are heard louder. ]

[The exclusive skill, 'Fourth Wall' is shaking ominously!]

[The Fourth Wall is protecting you by bulking up.]

[The Fourth Wall is baring its teeth towards the Secretive Plotter.] [

Fragment of the 'Last Wall'… don't worry. I don't intend to hurt you. ]

Unknown laughter emerged from the shadow's mouth.

Secretive Plotter. Along with the Great Sage, Heaven's Equal, the Abyssal
Black Flame Dragon and Uriel, he was a constellation who had been
watching me the longest. An existence I hadn't read about in Ways of
Survival.

I took a deep breath. I practiced my meeting with him several times but I
didn't know it would be like this.

"Nice to meet you, Secretive Plotter."

I didn't know him. However, that didn't mean I couldn't make any guesses.

"The 'crawling chaos' in the depths of the scenario."
         Chapter 283: Ep. 53 - Demon King of Salvation, V


The Crawling Chaos. One of the outer gods that was closest to the 'origin'
of the universe and favourable to humans… this was according to
mythology. In fact, there was no mention of him in Ways of Survival.

[ The Crawling Chaos… did the 'Last Wall' call me that? ]

"It's just my guess."

[ It is literature left by the 'recorders of fear'. Believing in records that aren't
even 100 years old, you are more naive than I thought. The unknown can't
be revealed in human language. ]

I bit my lips. There wasn't much known about the outer gods in the myths
that were the prototypes for Ways of Survival. In the 74th turn of Ways of
Survival, one of the 'recorders of fear' left the following remark:「
"Everything we wrote was a lie. It was the only lie we could use to explain
the unknown horrors." 」
I was a bit daunted as I asked, "…Are the myths on Earth wrong?"

[ I am Secretive Plotter. That is enough. ]

It was an ambiguous answer but also a sufficient one. I didn't know if he
was the 'Crawling Chaos' or not. At the very least, it was clear that
Secretive Plotter was undoubtedly a strong outer god.

"I have a request."

[ You want to ask me to stop that. ]

"That's right."

The Secretive Plotter looked down as the mass of fog swallowed a planet.
The time of the world was slowed down by the power of Secretive Plotter
but it wasn't completely halted. The Secretive Plotter kept looking down as
he spoke.

[ The fog is a disaster originating from the beginning. It is impossible to
eliminate it completely. ]

"I know that there are ways."

The Secretive Plotter just looked down at the universe while disregarding
my words. I waited nervously for what he would say next.

The shimmering shadow made a disturbing sound. I didn't think it would
feel like this when I heard the indirect messages on the channel. I thought
he was a good constellation with lots of playfulness and friendliness…

The shadow currently in front of me only gave off a cold and frightening
sensation. I didn't know what happened but the appearance of the 73rd
Demon Realm suddenly seemed close. It was as if I was looking through a
telescope of enormous magnification as I saw the people of the industrial
complex.
–Kim Dokjaaaaa!

Jung Heewon's voice seemed like an auditory hallucination. I saw the party
members screaming in despair.

[ Why are you trying to save them? You can see the ending even if you live
alone. ]

"The ending is only meaningful if they are there."

As I spoke, I stimulated dozens of questions and answers in my head. Both
my hands were sweating. I couldn't fail here. No matter what, I had to
convince the Secretive Plotter in this conversation.

[ What if they don't want it? ]

I slowly opened my mouth.

「 Dammit, Kim Dokja! Stop! Please! Come back! 」

「 I don't want this! I don't want to survive this way. 」

「 I'll do anything. If you die, I'll die. If you are going to sit still, I'll sit still.
Please don't do this!

Please! 」

The voices of my party members were heard using Omniscient Reader's
Viewpoint. They didn't say it but I heard the words.

[ What if the ending they wanted was to die with you there? Do you still
want to save them? ]

I barely managed to open my mouth. "…Yes."

[ It isn't salvation. It is a curse. ]
I couldn't come up with an excuse. It was my story that answered on my
behalf.

[ The story 'Demon King of Salvation' is continuing. ]

The Secretive Plotter watched the story coming from me and kept asking,

[ Using those who should've died, changing the world line, hurting
everyone and reaching the ending you desire… what is the meaning? ]

The empty eyes of the shadow were shining. An eerie chill went down my
spine.

[ No matter what you do or what story you make, you can't truly reach
them.
]

The indirect messages didn't reveal the essence of the constellations. Just as
I couldn't fully understand the characters from reading the books. Maybe it
was a mistake to see the Secretive Plotter.

However, it was too late to back down. I opened my mouth after a moment.
"…I heard that once in my childhood. Still, there is still the 'wall' left
behind."

They were words that Jang Hayoung once said.

"Even if there is an insurmountable wall between me and then, even if it
isn't heard by the person beyond the wall, I can write something on the wall
and at the very least, the wall will change."

I wasn't able to say a proper goodbye to Jang Hayoung. Perhaps he was in
the ward like Yoo Joonghyuk. "Maybe after a very long time, somebody
might look at the wall."
There were no words from Secretive Plotter for a while. Every sentence had
a different meaning to the interpreter. To the Secretive Plotter who lived for
a very long time, my words might sound completely different. Even so,
these were the only words I could squeeze out with my 28 years of wisdom.
I just hoped that these words would move something in the Secretive
Plotter.

[ I don't agree with your method but I'm curious. ]

Finally, the Secretive Plotter opened his mouth.

[ Let's say you reach the end of everything using your method and save the
world. Then what about the other worlds? ]

"Huh?"

…Other worlds? The moment I was about to speak, the universe at my feet
flipped over like a card. The cards that were divided into dozens and
hundreds of pieces were shining in their own way with different colours
and shapes.

It was a dimension more distant than the Star Stream. A world that was
blurry but clearly existed. It contained the world of Ways of Survival that I
had read.

There was Yoo Joonghyuk who died in the Theater Dungeon in the eighth
round.

There was the Yoo Joonghyuk who went to the Breaking the Sky Sword
Saint in the 18th round.

There was the 41st round Yoo Joonghyuk who made the choice to sacrifice
his colleagues.

There was the 181st round Yoo Joonghyuk who stood up from despair.
…

The stories of the Yoo Joonghyuk who once saved me were on display in
front of me. In addition, I knew the ending of all the regressions.

[ What about all the worlds you didn't save? ]

It was an unthinkable question. No, it was a question I didn't want to think
about. In order to stop that story, I changed Yoo Joonghyuk's third turn.

All the events of the original Ways of Survival and all the worlds that
protected me in my childhood…

Were they going to be nonexistent now? The Secretive Plotter looked at me
like it was interesting.

[ I will fulfill your request. ]

Suddenly, the screen on the floor changed to the 73rd Demon Realm. I
didn't understand this whim but Secretive Plotter decided to accept the deal
with me.

[ However, there is a condition. ]

I had expected it. All Outer World Covenants were subject to severe
conditions. "Anything is fine, unless it requires me to be subordinate to you
or my death."

The mouth of the Secretive Plotter opened and revealed something white. It
was as if the conditions I mentioned were ridiculous.

[ Sometimes you might have to risk your life. It is all up to you. ]

"Okay. However, please save my party members first before speaking the
terms."

[ As I said before, I can't eliminate the fog. ]
"Then…?"

[ I can only save the mortals in the industrial complex. Is that okay? ]

I paused for a moment before nodding. I thought I knew what the Secretive
Plotter was going to do. "Can you move them to a safe place?"

[ Where do you want to move them? ]

"Earth. If possible, I would prefer Seoul."

[ It is a closed scenario area but there is hope. ]

There was a sound and one of his long fingers was cut off. The small finger
of the shadow rose in the air, turning into tens of thousands of points that
flew into the universe. The points crossed the galaxy in an instant and dug
into the 73rd Demon Realm.

The screen under my feet showed the people of the industrial complex. The
people were being transported somewhere with a new scenario. The
population of the industrial complex was close to 100,000.

Now the Secretive Plotter would send out personal scenarios to all the
incarnations. A great amount of probability was exhausted but Secretive
Plotter replaced the probability with the sacrifice of one finger.

The people who received the scenario were hiding in the Demon Realm.
Indescribable Distance was released from the bondage of time and started
to belatedly devour the planet, but it was already empty. The fog missed the
party members and cried out.

[ Now it's my turn. ]

"Speak."

[ You must kill someone. ]
"Can I ask who I have to kill?"

My heart was heavy. Maybe there would be special constraints. Or it might
be a tangle of probability that not even the Secretive Plotter could touch.

[ Accept the covenant and you will know. ]

"…What happens if I refuse?"

In the end, I saw the group of people who had been moved to Earth by the
Secretive Plotter.

[ I still have nine fingers left. ]

"I accept."

In any case, the worst situation was escaped. The party members safely
returned to Earth and everything was as planned.

[A new sub scenario has been acquired!]

[The Star Stream's scenario system has encountered an error.]

[The information of this scenario is being reconstructed.]

[You have acquired the possibility of a new story!]

[A story that can't be understood by the Star Stream is germinating.]

I was the only one left. If I did this well, everything would end smoothly.

The Secretive Plotter lifted his right hand, the darkness of the universe
distorted and a small portal started to open.

[ Actually, there was another person beside you who made a covenant. ]
…Besides me? I looked through my memories of the original novel but
couldn't come up with a person who would make an Outer World Covenant
at this time. "What happened to them?"

[ I'm expecting much bigger things from you. If you safely complete
the scenario, you'll be able to come back without any problems. ] The
portal increased to a size I could go through.

[ Another outer god will transfer you. Be careful not to disobey him. ]

At the end, I was sucked into the portal. The foundations were built up and
the whole world spread out like a post-modern oil painting where the
intention couldn't be read. The brilliant colours caused me to feel nauseated
and once I lifted my head again, there was a huge door in front of me.

Facing me was a giant bubble that filled the endless universe and a circular
door occupied the center. The moment the door opened its big eyes at me,
the Fourth Wall was triggered.

[The Fourth Wall is issuing a warning!]

There was only one such gigantic door in Ways of Survival.

[ An exis tence se nt by the plot ter. ]

I nodded. The door looked down at me with its own will.

[ Frag ment of the La st Wall… and… ]

It was a stuffy voice that sounded like it was coming from water.

[ … Ser vant jour ney ing to end of life… ]

"…Where am I going?"

[ Every thing is wri tten and exist at the sa me ti me. ]
…Well, I never thought a normal conversation would work. It was usually
the case with an outer god. Only the Secretive Plotter was an exceptional
case.

[ The past and pre sent aren't dif fe rent from the fu ture. On ly free will is
le
ft. ]

The door opened with a loud noise. A door that linked the past, present and
future. If I stepped in there, I wouldn't be able to go back.

Before that, there was something I had to do. I hesitated before placing my
hand into my clothes. I pulled out a warm and tiny cotton ball.

[Baat!]

Biyoo was crying as she shouted at me.
        Chapter 284: Ep. 53 - Demon King of Salvation, VI


[Baat, baaat!]

"No."

[Baaat!]

"Go back."

The world inside the open door couldn't be seen properly. After all, it was
clearly a dangerous place. "Take care of the people."

Perhaps this moment had been scheduled from the moment I found traces
of 'Indescribable Distrance' from Surya's train fragments. Perhaps I would
receive little help from Ways of Survival in the place where I was going
now.
Still, I had to go. If I endured it well this one time, I could return to the
party members. With them, I could reach the end of all the scenarios. I
slowly moved my feet and Biyoo screamed.

[Baat, baat… baaaat…! Ah, ba, at…]

I stepped through the boundaries of the door and Biyoo's voice suddenly
faded away. I looked towards Biyoo's fuzzy face and spoke words that
couldn't be conveyed.

「 I'll come back. 」

[The Outer World Covenant is activated!]

[You have been deported from the Star Stream.]

[Your modifier will disappear from the "Star Stream>.]




Even after Kim Dokja disappeared into the portal, Secretive Plotter stared
at the portal for a long time. An elderly man with two abnormally large
lumps stood beside the Secretive Plotter.

[Great plotter. He is already gone?]

[ He just left. ]

[Too bad. I wanted to see what type of person he was… well, you must like
him a lot. You sacrificed three fingers for him.]

Three fingers on Secretive Plotter's left hand had disappeared. It was the
price of the probability.
[No matter your identity, it would've been a burden to borrow the Viceroy's
Dimensional Gate. Why didn't you ask us?]

[ It is a fraudulent transaction that the probability of the wenny people can't
handle.]

The elderly man clicked his tongue.

[I can't understand it at all. No matter the story, I wouldn't do something
like this.]

[ You can't understand it. ]

In the shadow of Secretive Plotter, white eyes flashed in the air. The elderly
man followed the gaze. It was as if he discovered something in the air.

[That troublesome person… did you intentionally send him?]

[ There will be no harmful effect anyway. ]

The old man laughed.

[Well, it doesn't matter. If only I can deal one blow to that damn Star
Stream.
But is there a chance?]

[ If he succeeds, he will be closer to the 'result' than anyone else. ]

[…Than anyone else? It is funny you are saying that when you have already
seen the 'result'.]

The old man grumbled.

[Whether he succeeds or fail, it will be a loss for you anyway.]

Secretive Plotter shook his head and replied, [ It isn't me who will judge it. ]
[The 'Fourth Wall' is shaking violently.]

As my consciousness flickered, a chill went down my spine.

[The Outer World Covenant is protecting your existence.]

I felt like I was going somewhere as I had a few dreams. It was a dream
about the party members.

–Dokja-ssi is always looking at the smartphone. What is Dokja-ssi's
number?

–…We can't call him anyway so what is the point?

–Just let me know. I'll send him a game invitation later.

A game invitation. I really hoped I would get it in the future.

–Dokja-ssi seems to laugh more often after the fall.

–By the way, ahjussi is a bit unlucky when he smiles.

–Isn't it worth changing his mouth shape.

–I wish Dokja-ssi could've been my senior.

The second hand of a clock was ticking somewhere.

–I never hated Dokja-ssi like I do today. Come back.

The beginning and end of the unknown story were pushing me. I relied on
my memories like a small raft moving through a vicious current. In the
endless void of the universe, only my memories were floating. Maybe this
was how Biyoo… Shin Yoosung of the 41st regression felt.
Not longer afterwards, a message was heard.

[The Viceroy's Dimensional Door is closed.]

[The Star Stream has noticed your presence.]

By the time I came to my senses, I was crouched on the floor and vomiting.
I felt the touch of the hard ground and slowly opened my eyes.

[You have entered the new scenario area!]

[The dokkaebis of the bureau have doubts about your existence.]

The stiffened joints of my incarnation body screamed. I used Hit a Pressure
Point to restore my body as quickly as possible. I didn't know where this
was but I had to be nervous from now on.

Secretive Plotter himself wasn't in the original novel so Ways of Survival
couldn't help me with the things that happened here.

"Kuk…"

The places eaten by the Indescribable Distance were painful but I somehow
recovered with a Great Return Pill. My horns and wings disappeared
because the Demon King Transformation was over.

[It is impossible to use Demon King Transformation at the present time.]

I didn't forget to thoroughly check the equipment and placed the necessary
items in a position where I could use them immediately. The first thing I
checked was the personal scenario window.

[You can't launch the sub-scenario window.]

[The information for this scenario hasn't been updated yet.]

…The scenario update wasn't applied yet.
I looked around at the wreckage of the broken buildings. The collapsed
highrise buildings and the debris of the logos between them. The characters
that made up the logo were familiar. There was Hangul and also English.
The languages of second-grade tribes were also found.

I stopped for a moment and read them. Slowly, an uncomfortable
feeling rose from the tip of my feet. Where was this place? [The Star
Stream has recognized your modifier.]

[Your position in the night sky will be refreshed!]

[The bureau is wary of your presence.]

[You have been assigned a hidden scenario!]

[Hidden Scenario - World Adaptation has been acquired!]

[You have acquired a new story!]

…Don't tell me? I started running through the streets. An unrecognizable
ruined city. Even so, I was able to recognize this place. It was strange if I
couldn't recognize it. It was because my nightmares originated from this
city.

The status of Yi Sunsin that only had the legs remaining and the destroyed
Absolute Throne. The carcasses of beasts scattered everywhere and the
remnants of giant tentacles gave off a terrible stench.

"…Seoul?"

Nevertheless, there was no time to think. I heard the sound of an explosion
and hide among the ruins in my area. A loud shout was heard. People were
fleeing from something. No, looking closer, it wasn't people.

They were constellations in incarnation bodies. The considerable number of
constellations were shouting in their true voices.
[Run away!]

[Dammit…!]

Their words didn't finish. The feet of an elephant descended from the air
and the incarnation bodies burst like worms. I watched the scene
breathlessly. The elephant's feet contained an irresistible 'status' and
dragged the dead incarnation bodies somewhere.

Crazy, what the hell was this?

After the elephant disappeared, I carefully escaped through the ruins and
headed cautiously towards the bodies. There were a few items to collect on
the floor. I looked at the items and controlled my mind.

Stay calm. No matter how dangerous this place was, there was a chance of
winning if I obtained information. If this was still a scenario area, Ways of
Survival was still valid.

[The attribute effect has improved your memories of the pages already
read.]

What type of scenario was this? The incarnation bodies of the constellations
were present and the fragments of the outer god were scattered…

[The 95th main scenario is in progress.]

[The Outer World Covenant has replaced your lacking probability.]

[You aren't a formal participant of the scenario.]

[The Star Stream doubts your eligibility.]

Their hairs on my arm stood up.

…How many?
[The item 'Arondight' has been acquired.]

I stared blankly down at the item I had collected. A constellation's star relic
was rolling around on the streets. I… skipped a few years? I wondered how
the party members were doing.

[The exclusive skill, 'Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint' has been activated!]

Jung Heewon. Lee Hyunsung. Shin Yoosung.

[The exclusive skill, 'Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint' is cancelled.]

[You can't connect with the current target.]

[The 'character' can't be found.]

I tried to calm my trembling heart. I needed to be calm. Nothing was certain
yet. I took deep breaths to control my mind and expressed the power of a
constellation. I planned to explore the surroundings through a channel, if
there was one nearby.

At this moment, a sound was heard in the area. It was the sound of a
powerful strike along with the constellations' screams. The moment I
reflexively tried to hide between the buildings, I could see a black coat
fluttering.

For a brief second, I felt my heart stop. Scarred muscles could be seen
through the torn sleeves of the coat. I looked at the trajectory of the sword
against the ground and emotions filled my heart.

He was alive, although he wasn't exactly the same as what I remembered.
His physique was a bit bigger, his impression was a bit sharper and there
was a large scar on his cheek. There was no way I couldn't know him.

"Yoo―!"
I opened my mouth but something faster than sound flew at me. I would've
died instantly if I hadn't invoked Bookmark and Way of the Wind. Even
though I dodged, there was a big stab wound in my side. I covered the
wound and looked at him with a confused expression. By the time I looked
up, he was already in front of my eyes.

I was suffocated as he gripped my neck. My voice didn't come out so I had
to use my true voice.

[Hey! Yoo Joonghyuk, it's me!]

Maybe too much time had passed. It took me longer than I thought so he
might've forgotten about me.

[Let me go. It's me! You already forgot…]

A terrible pain hit my belly and I felt like I was going to fall unconscious. I
thought it was a terrible joke. Or perhaps he was so angry that he was
acting like this. Then Yoo Joonghyuk's cold voice was heard.

"Where is Arondight? Do you have it?"

At this moment, a cool sensation grazed my neck. The moment I first met
Yoo Joonghyuk on Dongho Bridge came to mind. He had similar eyes. It
was the eyes of a person who didn't know me.

"I will kill you if you don't answer within five seconds. Oh."

Really, it was the eyes of a person who could kill me.

However, there was only one. There was one regression where I didn't
know the end. A man who lost all his colleagues and finally saw the final
chapter of the story in front of him.

"Two."
The monster whose emotions were worn out by countless betrayals and
numerous regressions were watching me. Along with the pain that pierced
deep into my chest, the words left by Secretive Plotter revolved in my ears.

[ Let's say you reach the end of everything using your method and save the
world. Then what about the other worlds? ]

[ What about all the worlds you didn't save? ]

In the sky of the ruined Gwanghwamun, the dying stars were shining. This
wasn't the third round of the Star Stream that I changed. I changed the
future and the worlds of the original novel were abandoned. Yoo
Joonghyuk's blade moved through the air.

"It looks like you aren't going to answer. Then die."

It was the 1863rd regression of Ways of Survival. This world was the last
round of Yoo Joonghyuk that I knew about.
            Chapter 285: Ep. 54 - Demon King Slayer, I


The most imaginative thing I've ever read was Three Ways to Survive in a
Ruined World.

–What if Ways of Survival became a reality?

Perhaps anyone would've imagined such a thing with their favourite novel.
I did as well. Maybe it was due to the endless imaginations in my youth that
I was able to adapt to Ways of Survival. Once the scenario started, I would
do this first and then do this. This hidden piece would be obtained…

During middle school, I even drew charts in the corner of my textbook.

–Yoo Joonghyuk: A professional gamer, an awful personality, a
psychopath, kills if words don't work (sometimes just kills), have to
unconditionally bring him to my side, humanity still remains in the third
round…
I had been glad when I first realized I had fallen into the third round of
Ways of Survival.

I came to a world I could change and thought it was really fortunate. If I
had fallen into the last round…

「 Kim Dok ja thou ght. 」

There was no existence that could stop him.

「 Sh―it. 」

I shouted with all my straight as I saw the blade flying towards me.

[Wait! Stop! I said stop!]

A person who regressed more than a thousand times. A spirit that had
become insensitive from the hundreds of suicides and tragedies that an
individual could suffer. The extremely widespread regression depression…
「 Yoo Joonghyuk of the 1863rd round is the despair of the world itself.
」 I acted the moment the blade was about to pass through my neck.

[The special skill 'Miniaturization Lv. 10' is activated!]

My body shrank in an instant and the blade passed through the air. The
man's startled eyes were seen from over the blade. This damn guy. Did he
think I came here to die? This might be the 1863rd round but he was
mistaken if he thought I would obediently die.

[The exclusive skill 'Bookmark' is activated!]

[The exclusive skill 'Electrification' Lv. 12 (+2) has been activated.]
I knew I wasn't his opponent. However, I still had to try my best. My body
moved at lightning speed as I yelled, "Son of a bitch! You have to let me
talk to you!"

The indirect messages poured from the air along with my cry.

[Some constellations have noticed your presence!]

[The constellation 'Adventurer who Stands Up an Egg' is interested in your
appearance.]

[Constellations 'King of Ephemera' is interested in the fight between you
and 'Iron Blood Supreme King'.]

[Some constellations feel strong jealousy towards you.]

[1,000 coins have been sponsored.]

The 95th scenario of the 1863rd regression. The world might be like this
but there were still constellations giving donations. The nature of the
sponsorship was a bit different but…

Yoo Joonghyuk glared at me with a stiff expression. "The Baekchung
School? Strange. I'm sure he is out of action in this round…"

This person's brain circuits had become twisted after over 1,000
regressions. He would've finished judging whether to kill or spare me based
on the actions I had shown so far. It was scary.

[The exclusive skill, 'Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint' has been activated!]

It was because I was afraid that I had to read it now. Thus, I could get out
of this situation.

[You have an insufficient understanding of the person and can't activate the
second stage!]
[The exclusive skill, 'Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint' stage 1 has been
activated!]

…I lacked understanding. My pride was a bit hurt but I thought it would be
like this. This was Yoo Joonghyuk of the 1863rd round, not the Yoo
Joonghyuk I knew. It might just be the first stage but I had to invoke it. I
might not be able to read the details but even knowing the attack direction
would help.

「 Neck. 」

The moment that Yoo Joonghyuk's thought was transmitted, I withdrew
with all my might.

Even this guy wouldn't be able to easily catch me. It was because I was now
using Way of the Wind and Electrification.

"…Keok?"

I didn't know if I had turned my body first or the dark shadow had moved
ahead of me first. My breath was blocked and my vision darkened. It was a
feast of magic power that seemed to hurt my whole body. I flew through the
air like an electrocuted fish. A tremendous amount of magic power shook
my body.

[Some constellations are laughing at you.]

It was the face of Yoo Joonghyuk that was seen in front of me. His hands
were crushing my torso. My neck hurt like it was broken as it was held
between thumb and index finger.

I couldn't believe it. This might be the Yoo Joonghyuk of the last regression
but how could he catch me so easily when I used Electrification?

"I will ask you a final time."
I realized the moment I heard his cold and apathetic voice. It was stupid to
think I could avoid it by knowing the direction in advance. The person in
front of me wasn't the young Yoo Joonghyuk of the third round.

"Where is the dragon sword, Arondight?"

…How could I speak when he was holding my neck?

"I see Lancelot's incarnation body here so you must surely know…"

Ah, the constellation who just died was Lancelot? Shit.

"If you don't answer, I will it out of you."

Yoo Joonghyuk's eyes shone with a golden light. As a matter of fact, Yoo
Joonghyuk's foundations remained unchanged, whether it was the third or
1863rd regression.

[The character 'Yoo Joonghyuk' has used Sage's Eye Lv. ???!]

After over one thousand regressions, his Sage's Eye had reached a
formidable level. Perhaps the presence that wasn't visible now in Yoo
Joonghyuk's eyes was the outer god that had lived for a long time.

[The exclusive skill Fourth Wall has blocked Sage's Eye!]

[The exclusive skill 'Fourth Wall' is strongly activated!]

The moment Yoo Joonghyuk's Sage's Eye focused on my body, the wall
moved. The Fourth Wall stood firmly in front of the persistent gaze that
didn't want to miss a single piece of information. There were stronger
sparks than when I had encountered the Unidentified Wall.

「 No t bad. 」

This time, the Fourth Wall looked formidable. At this point, I couldn't tell if
the Fourth Wall or Yoo Joonghyuk was the great one. The Fourth Wall
didn't back down and Yoo Joonghyuk didn't give up. It was me who was
fried between them. It was so painful that I couldn't scream, even with my
true voice.

"Kuek…?"

Yoo Joonghyuk raised his power first. The collision was so strong that
golden circles swirled in his eyes.

[The character 'Yoo Joonghyuk' is feeling a competitive spirit.]

[The character 'Yoo Joonghyuk' is showing great hostility towards you!]

This was a barrier that couldn't be penetrated even with Sage's Eye. Once
again, I realized what a great skill Fourth Wall was.

Then something strange happened. The Fourth Wall was able to prevent
Sage's Eye and started to flow like water over Yoo Joonghyuk's hand. The
typed letters covered his body like insects and for the first time, Yoo
Joonghyuk sounded disconcerted. "What?"

The wriggling letters became memories that flowed like a panorama. They
were my memories of the third round that were recorded on the Fourth
Wall.

「 "Get your hand off me and get lost, you damn jerk!" 」

「 "Maybe not. In any case, I am hopeful about the situation."

"…What is so hopeful about it?"

"Joonghyuk-ah, we can save the world. You know that, right?" 」

「 The name of our nebula is… Kim Dokja's Company…"

"There isn't a name yet. In addition, we will gain the supporters now." 」
Yoo Joonghyuk couldn't comprehend the memories in front of him. They
were all things that didn't exist in this round. The sparks that almost blinded
me eased and Yoo Joonghyuk's expression became clearer.

"What are you…?"

The '1863rd round' made an astonished expression. I heard the voice of the
Fourth Wall in my head, as if it thought this round was interesting.

「 I did we ll Kim Dok ja. 」

Did it do well?

"Tell me. What is this? I'll tear you apart if you don't say it."

What did it do well? Shit.

[Kuek… no, wait! I need some time to answer!]

I exploded the blue-white energy as I was held in Yoo Joonghyuk's hands. I
was struggling to escape from him. This might not be enough but I would at
least buy some time until I could borrow the power of the 'giant story…'

Then something unexpected happened. There was an explosion and Yoo
Joonghyuk missed me. There was a surprised and confused expression. Yoo
Joonghyuk reached out with sluggish movements. I wanted to know what
happened but I couldn't miss the opportunity I had just gained.

[The exclusive skill 'Way of the Wind Lv. 11 (+1) is activated!]

Way of the Wind was activated and the blue-white energy made a trail
through the air. I thought he would chase after me quickly but I didn't feel
Yoo Joonghyuk right away. I looked back and saw an unexpected sight.

…What was this?
The moment I had the question, a deafening true voice echoed in the
expanse.

[Yoo Joonghyuk! I will repay the grudge of Immeasurable Austerity!]

Red and blue eyes glared from the roof of a nearby building. Two black
leopards with streamlined buildings emanated a strong energy as they fell
towards Yoo Joonghyuk.

[The demon king 'Devil of Easiness and Atrocity' is showing hostility
towards incarnation 'Yoo Joonghyuk'.]

[The demon king 'Eyes that See the Forbidden' is showing his teeth to
incarnation 'Yoo Joonghyuk'.]

Yoo Joonghyuk of the 1863rd round was stronger than anyone else but he
had many enemies. Thanks to this, I could identify the two leopards without
much difficulty.

Devil of Easiness and Atrocity, Ose. Eyes that See the Forbidden, Flauros.
They were the 57th and 64th demon kings of the Demon Realm.

The prideful demon kings forgot their shame and unleashed a pincer attack
towards an incarnation.

However, it wasn't shameful.

[Demon King Slayer! Your story will end here!]

Right now, Yoo Joonghyuk was an existence full of value. I buried myself
in the rubble as there was a deafening roar. Then I carefully watched the
situation. It was a clash I couldn't afford and I thought I should move away,
but I had a desire to watch the fight a bit more.

It wasn't another fight but the fight of the 1863rd round Yoo Joonghyuk. It
wasn't easy to see. My ears seemed to burst and the battle began.
[Many constellations are enthusiastic about the battle of incarnation 'Yoo
Joonghyuk'.]

Indirect messages poured out as Yoo Joonghyuk pulled out his sword. It
was the Splitting the Sky Sword that was already broken in the third round.
The blade had gone through a number of scenarios and had been upgraded
to a completely new level, shining brightly in the darkness.

The demon kings facing him also revealed their power.

[Creatures, rise from death!]

The dead earls and dukes of the Demon Realm became undead and
emerged from the ground. They held elite objects that preserved the combat
power of their lives.

However, Yoo Joonghyuk wasn't panicked at all. "It is Summoning
the Dead? The Devil of Principles also used it." Yoo Joonghyuk was
smiling.

"That bastard's body is now hanging among the dead constellations."

[Shut up!]

A light flashed and Yoo Joonghyuk's sword moved. What should I call this
swordsmanship?

…Breaking the Sky Swordsmanship? I didn't know. The certain thing was
that it was an amazingly beautiful swordsmanship. It was also a
surprisingly cruel swordsmanship.

The nobles of the demon world were cut by the sword and screamed as they
turned to ash. They were high-ranking dukes comparable to historical-grade
constellations. Such beings exploded with a few swings of the sword.
In less than a minute, Yoo Joonghyuk killed dozens of undead nobles and
reached the nose of Flauros.

[How…]

Like a toy, the head of Demon King Flauros exploded.

There were no emotions in his eyes. There was a single blow with a sweet
smile. Yoo Joonghyuk killed a demon king.

[This… this crazy bastard!]

The Demon King Ose shouted angrily.

[Constellations! Why are you hesitating?]

The moment the call was heard, the constellations hiding in the ruins came
out. Most of them were constellations of the absolute evil system. They
ranged from historical-grade to narrative-grade. Every constellation rushed
to get rid of one incarnation, Yoo Joonghyuk.

[The character 'Yoo Joonghyuk' is talking about the story of 'Hell of
Eternity…']

However, Yoo Joonghyuk wasn't pushed at all. A bloody aura overflowed
from his body and collided with the constellations. It was a scary and
powerful force but the blow was calm and full of moderation. Every time
Yoo Joonghyuk's sword moved, the ranks of the constellations shook
helplessly.

[Constellations of the absolute evil system hate the incarnation 'Yoo
Joonghyuk'.]

The incarnation bodies of the constellations exploded one by one. The
highranking constellations could look so shabby. There were no signs of
impatience as Yoo Joonghyuk continued the battle.
[The character 'Yoo Joonghyuk' is talking about the giant story 'Lonely
Pilgrim of Destruction'.]

Yoo Joonghyuk was only using his 'left arm' to destroy the constellations.
Every time a constellation fell, my arms trembled.

[Constellations of the absolute evil system are shocked by the combat
ability of incarnation 'Yoo Joonghyuk'.] Hatred became shock.

[Some constellations of the absolute evil system are afraid of the
incarnation 'Yoo Joonghyuk'.]

Shock became fear.

[Many constellations are trembling at the power of incarnation 'Yoo
Joonghyuk'.]

It was thrilling. Crazy guy… he was a really crazy guy.

No matter how I thought about it, there was no way to bring down the
current Yoo Joonghyuk.

I didn't know what scenario Secretive Plotter gave me but I must never
become enemies with this guy until it was over.

Then a message was heard.

[The sub scenario commissioned by 'Secretive Plotter' has arrived!]
            Chapter 286: Ep. 54 - Demon King Slayer, II

Finally, the message I had been waiting for had arrived. Secretive Plotter's
personal scenario.


 [Sub Scenario (Secretive Plotter) - ???]
 Category: Sub (Personal)

 Difficulty: ???

 Clear Conditions: ???

 Time Limit: ―

 Compensation: Can return to the original round with a legendary story
 (1), a skill (1) and an item (1) (The probability required will be born by
 the scenario proponent).

 Failure: Unable to return to the original turn, your incarnation body will
 be destroyed.
The moment I opened the scenario window, the thing that caught my eyes
was the 'compensation'.

[The bureau is currently suspicious of your probability.]

I wasn't a member of this 'regression'. Therefore, even if I got an item, skill
or story in this turn, I wouldn't be able to preserve it after returning to my
original world. It was just like how the 41st regression Shin Yoosung was
weakened so badly that she could be hit.

However, if the reward was true… I could take the things obtained in this
round because to my original world.

It was a tremendous reward. No matter how much the probability was
constrained, the spoils of the 95th scenario would match the 95th scenario.
The skills and stories available here had the power to transform the world in
the 20th scenario.

「 Don't be too ex hi la rated Kim Dok ja. 」

I barely calmed down at the Fourth Wall's words. In fact, it wasn't a
situation where I could rejoice. The rewards for the scenario was high but
the cost of failure was just as huge. If I failed, I couldn't go back to my
original round and would lose my incarnation body.

This wasn't the turn I belonged to so the influence of my 'stories' weren't
big. In such a situation, I could end up killed by a probability storm if I lost
my incarnation body. Moreover, this wasn't the biggest problem.

[The clearance conditions for this scenario are being updated.]

The most importance clearance condition hadn't been updated. I didn't
know if it was an error from crossing dimensions or if Secretive Plotter was
deliberately dragging out the time.
Frankly, it was possible either way. I thought as I watched Yoo Joonghyuk
fighting in the distance. If I was Secretive Plotter, what clear conditions
would I place on this scenario? Based on the movements of Secretive
Plotter so far…

It was an ominous thought.

[The exclusive skill 'Reading Comprehension' is activated.]

Secretive Plotter. I was expecting him to be Crawling Chaos but the true
identity of the outer god was unknown.

He had been with me since my first channel opened but I had very little
information about him. He wasn't arrogant like the Great Sage, Heaven's
Equal, full of justice like Uriel, wicked like the Abyssal Black Flame
Dragon… he wasn't even present in the original Ways of Survival. He was
merely Secretive Plotter.

[You can't read the target with the information you have.]

[The exclusive skill 'Reading Comprehension' is cancelled.]

[Curiosity about the unknown is leading to a new ability.]

…I didn't know. What was he trying to show me through this scenario? In
addition, what did he want to gain?

There was never a case where the outer god had done this so I couldn't
easily guess. Only one thing was certain.

[Kuaaaack!]

This scenario was likely to be connected to the monster slaughtering the
constellations over there.

[That's it! Now! Everybody pincer attack him!]
[Die Yoo Joonghyuk!]

As I was briefly distracted by the scenario window, the battlefield was
flowing in an unexpected form. Yoo Joonghyuk's condition was strange. A
little while ago, he had been killing the constellations and overwhelming
the battlefield…

Now his movements were dulled. Yoo Joonghyuk's body was stiffening
under the pouring bombardment.

…What was this bastard? What happened?

I adjusted the setting of Character List to check his condition.


  * Currently in an abnormal condition.



Abnormal condition? There was no way. Who was the 1863rd regression
Yoo Joonghyuk? This was Yoo Joonghyuk who was the Ruler of the East
Hell and killed the Devil of Principles. There was no one among the
constellations who could place an abnormal condition on the present Yoo
Joonghyuk.

Yoo Joonghyuk's eyes were blank.

I felt uncomfortable like something was stuck in my throat. No, there was.
There was only one person who could cause an abnormal status in Yoo
Joonghyuk.


  * The target is suffering from 'regression depression' due to an unknown
  cause.
It was Yoo Joonghyuk himself.

Regression depression. The spirit of the man who had been broken over
1863 lives made the regression depression almost a passive, low level skill.
Once he fell into the depression, his consciousness was caught in the weight
of his memories and he couldn't wake up.

[Kill him! He isn't invincible!]

The ruthless strikes caused Yoo Joonghyuk's body to bleed little by little. It
was strange. Originally, the regression depression shouldn't occur in this
situation. In the 1863rd round, Yoo Joonghyuk had learnt how to manage
this disease.

Why was he in this current state…

「 The Fourth Wall is saying, "Ha ha ha." 」

"…Was it your doing?"

The Fourth Wall didn't answer but it was the only guess I had. The previous
collision with the Fourth Wall must've caused some disruption in Yoo
Joonghyuk's inner surface.

Damn, what should I do?

Blood flowed from Yoo Joonghyuk's skin as he protected his face. The
power of Impenetrable Skin was still applied but it was only a matter of
time before Yoo Joonghyuk died. 「 I have to help. 」

「 Why should I help him? 」

The choices were fighting in my mind.

「 Yoo Joonghyuk is a monster now. If I help, he will surely kill me when
he wakes up. 」
「 Think carefully. You don't know the clear conditions of this scenario. 」

The clear conditions were still question marks.

「 If the condition to clear the scenario is Yoo Joonghyuk's death, this is a
golden opportunity. 」

However—

「 What if the clear condition is Yoo Joonghyuk's survival… 」

If Yoo Joonghyuk died, I would lose everything.

"Damn…"

Should I help or not?

Yoo Joonghyuk's knees were slowly sinking to the ground. The normally
weak guys were excitedly tearing at Yoo Joonghyuk's body.

[Hahaha! I will have the story of the Iron Blood Supreme King!]

Yoo Joonghyuk would regress even if he died here. Then he would start a
new round.

Regression…

[ Then what about the other worlds? ]

…Fucking plotter.

[ What about all the worlds you didn't save? ]

Once Yoo Joonghyuk died here, a world that wasn't in the original novel
would be born. Yoo Joonghyuk would repeat the hell yet again. An
abandoned world that Secretive Plotter showed me would be created and
Yoo Joonghyuk would once again crawl in the infinite despair.

…Shit, I didn't know.

I activated Electrification and flew towards Yoo Joonghyuk.

[Hey! Leave me a share too!]

At my rough true voice, the demon kings and constellations attacking Yoo
Joonghyuk looked up.

[Who are you?]

[…Demonic energy? I've never seen you before.]

[Do you come here to kill the Demon King Slayer?]

Demonic energy flowed from my body and I could see the enemy's
tenseness being released. It was as expected. I spoke as I pulled out my
status. [That's right. We will share the good things together. It isn't
possible?]

[You came late so you can't have the good stories.]

[Don't worry. I'll only help from the back.]

[A good attitude. Now, everybody continue…!]

I turned and struck the constellation with all my strength. The constellation
let out a scream as he flew in a straight line and hit a ruined building.

[K-Kuooh… what are you doing?]

I wanted to hit him to death but was lacking. The constellations were angry
by my abrupt actions and stared at me.
[Are you siding with the Demon King Slayer?]

I didn't reply and opened up the power of the giant story.

[Giant Story 'Demon Realm's Spring' has begun!]

The pulse of the story stirred deep in my heart. Sparks surrounded my body
as the story energy flooded through my blood. Some of the constellations
saw my 'giant story' and screamed with shock.

[The status of a demon king? From a guy I've never heard of?]

Of course, I wasn't a demon king of this world. I once again concentrated
the power of Electrification and blew away a constellation. The
constellation was hit in the belly and took a few steps back. It wasn't
comparable to Yoo Joonghyuk but the effect wasn't bad. I might be able to
fight if it continued like this.

[An error has occurred in the operation of the story.]

[The Star Stream can't find the origin of the giant story owned by you.]

[The power of the 'giant story' is sharply reduced.]

…Shit. It was like this. The basis of my giant story, the 73rd Demon Realm
wasn't here. We made up the giant story together. Thus, it was natural that
my story didn't work properly.

I swung my sword at the approaching constellations and shouted at Yoo
Joonghyuk. "Hey! Wake up you jerk!"

Yoo Joonghyuk didn't answer. I tried to think of lines to wake up him but I
couldn't come up with anything. My status started to decline and Demon
King Ose, who rose again on the battlefield, shouted.

[He is with the Demon King Slayer! Kill him!]
There were seven constellations, including Demon King Ose. I naturally
couldn't deal with them with my current power. I desperately evaded the
attacks but the 95th scenario was the 95th scenario.

They might be ordinary constellations of the absolute evil system but the
blows hurt. My flesh was frayed by the onslaught and the range of my
movements became narrower.

Despite the urgency, I continued to think of ways to wake up Yoo
Joonghyuk. Some things came to mind that would definitely wake up Yoo
Joonghyuk.

The problem was what came next. If I woke him up using the methods I
was thinking of, I was likely to die.

I bit my lips and slowly opened my mouth. There was no way. In any case,
I expected it to happen like this. I briefly took a deep breath and opened my
mouth. "How long will you keep your mouth shut?"

The expressions of the constellations changed at my words. Their eyes
wondered what I was talking about.

I continued speaking. "It will be difficult for them if I die here." The next
moment, the pockets of my chest shone brightly and a true voice was heard.

[What, you knew?]

Of course, I wouldn't wake up Yoo Joonghyuk. I might die if I did
something crazy like that.

"It would be strange if I didn't know. I don't have a flower arrangement
hobby."

Two flowers emerged from the inner pocket of my coat. It was a red
cosmos and a white lily. I hadn't noticed their existence in the beginning. I
realized when I crossed worlds. They were really daring constellations.
[Tsk. There is no other way.]

The moment they realized the identity of the true voice, the complexion of
the constellations hostile to me darkened. The 'lily' laughed at them.

[Should we both come out? Or Jophiel, will you do it alone?]

[They are enemies of Eden. Immediately execute them.]

[…Do you want to do it together? How annoying. Okay, I understand.]

The next moment, the petals of the cosmos and lily scattered in the wind.
The petals moved towards the sky and a message flashed in front of me. I
looked at the message for a moment before slowly nodding.

A huge presence started to descend behind me. Astonishment appeared on
the faces of the constellations and I couldn't help laughing.

I was curious. I had wondered what Jung Heewon felt like at the time. Now
I knew very well.

Six wings stretched out from behind me. I overflowed with probability as
the 'status' of Eden's best archangels was discharged from my body.

[The constellation 'Commander of the Red Cosmos' has appeared in Seoul!]

[The constellation 'Lily Blooming in Aquarius' has appeared in Seoul!]
           Chapter 287: Ep. 54 - Demon King Slayer, III


[Archangel!]

Demon King Ose was looking to this side with eyes that were frightened
beyond surprise. It was the same for the constellations of the absolute evil
system. For them, the archangels of Eden were the worst enemies.

It wasn't strange that they would be shocked at the sight of two archangels
emerging simultaneously.

[Why are there archangels? The angels of Eden mostly died after that day!]

I heard the murmurs and felt regret. This was the world of the 1863rd
regression. Gabriel and Jophiel wouldn't know what happened in this round.

[■ck, what nonsense is this?]
Gabriel's true voice rang out like she had been waiting. Like Uriel, swear
words emerged from her mouth. I had to stop her before things became
bigger.

"Gabriel. You don't need to listen to their nonsense. Quickly handle them!"

[…Don't whine at me. Cheeky human.]

There were places to tackle but she had to follow the words this once.
Gabriel's power filled my entire body.

[I am the archangel Gabriel.]

I could feel my hairs standing up. Finally, Gabriel's main story was heard.

[I have been sent to tell you this good news.]

Of course, that 'good news' only applied if Gabriel was on the same side.

[Don't be scared! The archangels are nothing but remnants who have lost
their stronghold!]

Demon King Ose encouraged the constellations. However, as he was
talking, Oso was already moving far away. It happened when the
constellations held their star relics and rushed towards me.

[This is about the fixed end.]

Gabriel's story, the 'Revelation of the Apocalypse' had begun.

「 You have seen a ram with two horns, the great horn between the eyes is
the first king. 」

Golden strings flowed from my body. The size of my body was growing
along with the strings. My body was overflowing with power like a ram in
breeding season. Pure white horns rose in the place where the demon king's
horns had grown.
[U-Uhhhh…]

The constellations of the absolute evil system were frightened just looking
at the horns. Some constellations dropped their weapons like helpless
incarnations and some of them rushed around screaming.

[Uwaaah!]

It was like they saw their end.

「 He will be stronger and stronger with his own power, not my power. 」

The six wings behind my emitted a brilliant flash of light as the attacks of
the constellations poured towards me. Even so, I didn't receive any damage.

The solid metal summoned before my eyes neutralized all types of attacks.
It was a weapon that the giant god clan were likely to use. The snake
shining with a white light climbed up the shaft and the snake's eyes were
studded with a dazzling windowpane reminiscent of a cross.

This was Gabriel's divine spear, the Preference Scale. I grasped the handle
of the spear. All of a sudden, the world felt like it was tilting. All beings in
the vicinity were placed on a scale. They were on one side of the scale or
the other.

I turned my head and Gabriel was smiling. Her palms touched my shoulder.

「 He will commit terrible destruction and shall destroy the mighty and
holy people. 」

The spear shone brilliantly and I threw it with all my might.

Then part of the world was erased. The constellations attacking me from the
sky, those running from the side and even the ones who had lost their
fighting spirit and had sunk to the ground. They disappeared like they never
existed in this world. The only things left were the existences on this side of
the scale.

This was the true power of the archangel. Gabriel opened her mouth and
spoke in a grudging voice. […I missed one. There was a limit to the
number of petals.]

In fact, Demon King Ose had anticipated the situation in advance and had
already fled. He knew that he couldn't cope with an archangel alone as a
lower-ranked demon king. However, Jophiel didn't just watch.

A red fog was generated behind me and followed Ose. The whole world
screamed like it was in pain. It was apparently a red fog but when I looked
closer, it was an army of small soldiers.

The 503rd unit of Eden turned the sky red. It was the elite unit that
followed the Commander of the Red Cosmos.

[Kueeeeok!]

Red thorns rose from the bloody fog that moved like piranhas. A terrible
scream was heard in the distance as the soldiers of heaven held a festival of
blood. Then after a while, everything became silent.

The torn incarnation body of the demon king flew in the wind like crumbs.
The silent Gabriel moved my feet and trampled on the fragments of the
demon king.

[It's nothing.]

[Constellations of the absolute evil system are greatly baffled by the
emergence of the archangels.]

[The demon kings are doubting the probability of the Star Stream.]
[Some constellations have condemned the abnormal intervention of the
archangels…]

[Shut up these ■■.]

The six wings stretching from my back flew through the wind as countless
feathers and the power of the archangels diminished.

I felt a bit nauseous but the burden on my body wasn't as severe as I
thought. Maybe it was because the amount of probability in the 95th
scenario was much more abundant or maybe it was the Outer World
Covenant with Secretive Plotter. Either way, it was good for me.

[It isn't finished yet.]

However, Jophiel didn't retract her strength. Jophiel continued by giving a
command. [Kill him too.]

She was pointing to Yoo Joonghyuk who was as stiff as a statue. I hurriedly
waved my hands. "There is no need. He isn't a bad guy…"

[He is absolutely evil.]

My right eye stung and the world started to look different.

[The stigma 'Eye of Sin' is triggered!]

Eye of Sin. It was Archangel Jophiel's stigma.

[Measuring the 'sins' of the target.]

The eye that saw the 'sins' accumulated in every existence in the world.
There was only a dark abyss in the place where Yoo Joonghyuk had just
been standing.

[The 'sins' of the target can't be converted to a numerical value.]
A darkness with no end. It was a darkness that got worse just by looking at
it. Even the demon kings or constellations of the absolute evil system didn't
have such huge sins.

Jophiel spoke. [It is an endless sin. I have never seen such a dense sin apart
from Baal and Agares. All the sins in the world combined can't go beyond
his sins.]

I knew. Yoo Joonghyuk had committed many sins. He killed many people.
He destroyed many worlds. Countless souls cursed him.

[He must die.]

However—

"It isn't possible."

This person, he also saved others.

"You can't kill him."

Maybe it was nothing compared to everything he screwed up. Obviously,
there were some things he saved.

[The constellation 'Commander of the Red Cosmos' is looking at you.]

In front of that sullen gaze, I gulped and opened my mouth. "This guy is
still useful. You shouldn't kill him now."

[…Demon King of Salvation. It is because of the scribe's orders that you
are still alive.]

"You spared me so you can spare one more person."

I looked back and saw that Yoo Joonghyuk's body was lightly shaking. His
consciousness was somehow struggling to emerge from the water.
Jophiel spoke towards Yoo Joonghyuk. [If he wakes up, there is no
guarantee that I can stop him. We have to kill him now.]

Jophiel tried to summon her fog again. I inwardly sighed. No matter what I
thought, this was the only way.

"What if I can stop him from waking up without killing him?"

Jophiel's red fog stopped.

"What if there is a way to stop him from regaining consciousness while
controlling his unconscious self?"

[Is there a way to bind him? What trick are you going to use?]

The moment Jophiel was about to explode again, Gabriel stepped in.

[Jophiel, leave it. In any case, we need time to figure out the situation.]
Jophiel thought for a moment before responding. […If he shows signs of
waking up, I will kill him immediately.]

I nodded. Then I ran straight to Yoo Joonghyuk. "Hey."

The vibrations of his body were becoming stronger. I had seen this scene
several times in the original novel. Maybe Yoo Joonghyuk's consciousness
would wake up in a few minutes. It was difficult if that happened.

I slowly moved my hand and grabbed Yoo Joonghyuk's neck. Just as he did
to me. It wasn't easy to raise him up because he was bigger than me.

"Let, go."

Yoo Joonghyuk's consciousness had almost reached the surface of the water
and he spoke in a choppy manner. His fingertips moved slowly like he was
trying to catch me.
I knew how to wake up Yoo Joonghyuk from his regression depression. In
other words, it meant I also knew how to sink him deeper into that
melancholy.

I saw Yoo Joonghyuk's fingertips moving and opened my mouth. "Do you
remember? The 33rd round. You cleared the 40th scenario and Lee Jihye
said this."

Yoo Joonghyuk's eyes dimmed and his moving fingertips stopped.

「 "It would be nice if Master didn't have to go to the next round." 」

"Think about it. You weren't always unhappy. Right? In all the rounds,
there were moments when you were happy."

Yoo Joonghyuk's expression was becoming stiffer.

"The 173rd round. You protected Earth for quite some time. You also saw
Lee Jihye receiving her high school diploma and Lee Seolhwa smiling at
someone's child."

「 "Joonghyuk-ssi, are you happy that you're alive?" 」

Every time I spoke, Yoo Joonghyuk's expression collapsed. It wasn't
despair that broke down Yoo Joonghyuk.

"The 383rd round. You finally cleared the 75th scenario. Fortunately,
nobody died in that round. That was the first time. Then Lee Hyunsung told
you."

「 "Joonghyuk-ssi, I won't forget today until I die." 」

The feather-like memories sank into his head.

"Then the 498th round…"
Yoo Joonghyuk's palms moved to cover his ears. The usual Yoo Joonghyuk
wouldn't have fallen from this much. Now it was different. I held his hands
and kept talking. "That happened 10 times."

A human sank deeper into the water just because of the weight of these
feathers.

"Twenty times."

My breath clogged up and my lungs tightened. I could feel what Yoo
Joonghyuk was going through. Only I could feel it. The most primitive
darkness at the bottom of one person was swallowing his ego greedily.

"100 times. It repeated over 1,000 times."

All those words were destroyed. All the happy memories flowed back to a
time they could never return to. Through the countless regressions, the
meaning of happiness faded. All the values he preserved became pieces of
torn paper.

"Yoo Joonghyuk."

Yoo Joonghyuk's self was sinking into the deep sea. It was to a place that
he could never come up from without someone's help.

"Have you protected all the things you wanted to keep?"

I looked at Yoo Joonghyuk's miserable face and thought: Don't worry Yoo
Joonghyuk. I'll do the rest. You stop and rest.

[Your understanding of the character 'Yoo Joonghyuk' is increasing
explosively.]

Yoo Joonghyuk's empty eyes were showing memories of losing his master.
I didn't use Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint but it wasn't hard to read.
「 I want to die. 」

「 I want to finish all of this. 」

「 If only I can never wake up. 」

A few drops of rain fell from the sky. It was black rain made from the blood
of the demon kings and constellations. Liquid also flowed onto Yoo
Joonghyuk's face. Yoo Joonghyuk's gaze lowered and finally fell on me.

I was looking at the moment a human's spirit collapsed. There was a broken
voice. Like a creaking machine, Yoo Joonghyuk stammered, "Wh,at…
should, I, d…o?"

I released Yoo Joonghyuk's hands and told him. "I'll finish your story."

Yoo Joonghyuk looked at me with empty eyes. However, I didn't see him.
The sub scenario window had just updated.


  [Sub Scenario (Secretive Plotter) - End of the Regressor]

  Clear Conditions: Yoo Joonghyuk's death.


I reached for Yoo Joonghyuk's Splitting the Sky Sword that was on the
ground.
           Chapter 288: Ep. 54 - Demon King Slayer, IV


A day passed since I arrived in the 1863rd round.

The Gwanghwamun area was wet from the dark rain that had been falling
since last night. Soon after the rain started, the monsters crouching between
the ruins woke up one by one. There was the monster that looked like an
elephant that I saw when I first got here and one that reminded me of a
huge octopus. The most frightening thing was the baby that was the size of
a huge building.

There were many types of outer gods but not all of them were named
'Devourer of Dreams' or 'Indescribable Distance'. Most of them were
'unnamed' and existed without a proper ego.

I watched the baby in a diaper pushing through the city like a bulldozer and
hid while holding my breath.

…To be honest, I probably needed the diaper more than the baby.
[The constellation 'Lily Blooming in Aquarius' is looking at you.]

It had been a few hours since the archangels fell asleep, stating that they
would save their energy.

The white lily in my coat trembled as if it had regained power. Gabriel.

"Have you woken up?"

[Why did you make that choice?]

"What choice?"

[Do you need to ask?]

"There was no other way."

I heard a creaking and crushing sound in the distance. The moment I
thought something else had happened, I saw the torn off leg of the elephant
monster. There were signs that it was torn off by a powerful force.
Someone dragged the severed leg and approached this way. It was the real
monster of this scenario, Yoo Joonghyuk.

Like a sigh, the petals shook again. [I thought he would die… why is he
holding a sword?]

"He could've committed suicide. Well, I don't think that will happen now."

I spoke while swinging Yoo Joonghyuk's Splitting the Sky Sword through
the air. It wasn't surprising but I didn't kill Yoo Joonghyuk.

Gabriel was silent for a moment before muttering in a small voice. [What
does Uriel like about this guy…?]

"Uriel? Ah, is Uriel well?"

[How should I know?]
It was a reaction that seemed a bit excessive. The moment I was about to
ask, another indirect message came.

[The constellation 'Commander of the Red Cosmos' is looking at you.]

The difficult angel had also woken up. Jophiel woke up and got straight to
the point. [Did you decide to keep him alive?]

I accepted the elephant's leg that Yoo Joonghyuk had brought instead of
answering. It was a leg that was very fleshy. It gave off a very rich and
clear story. I faced Yoo Joonghyuk who stared at me with empty eyes.
Jophiel opened her mouth again.

[Don't you know that you shouldn't keep him alive? The scenario you
received is…]

"Yoo Joonghyuk's death."

It would've been nice if I could lie but it was too late to deceive the
archangels. They would've seen the scenario window that I saw.

–Yoo Joonghyuk's death.

It was the scenario that Secretive Plotter gave me. I had to kill him in order
to return to the original third round.

"As I've already mentioned, it is difficult to interpret this scenario as it is."
The death proposed by Secretive Plotter might not be the 'death' we thought
about.

The archangels were silent. They didn't seem to understand my words. I
flipped the elephant's leg and calmly declared. "Yoo Joonghyuk can't
'die'. As archangels, you should already know this?" I could feel the
gazes of the two angels on me.

[What does that mean?]
"This guy is a regressor."

In the early scenarios, the information I just mentioned would've been
filtered but now it was different. The scenario was a scenario but by now,
rumours about the 'regressor' should've spread quite a bit. Thus, the
highranking constellations of Eden would know it.

The red cosmos leaves shook uneasily. […Don't tell me?]

I nodded. "He is a being who repeats his life forever. No one can kill him. If
he dies, he will just move onto another round."

[How do you know this?]

"Why was Uriel keeping an eye on me?"

It was best to respond to questions that couldn't be answered was with more
questions. Jophiel trembled as if controlling his anger.

[Then… what are you going to do now? If you can't kill him, you can't
return to your original round.]

I shrugged and placed the roasted meat into my mouth. "I have to think
about a way. There is plenty of time."

At my calm response, an unusual air flowed around the two flowers. I was
nervous because I thought they wanted to express their 'status', only to
suddenly hear a strange sound.

It was a growl that wasn't coming from my stomach. It didn't seem to be
Yoo Joonghyuk either.

…Then? I bowed my head and saw the two flowers looking away.

"Are you hungry?"
[Gabriel, how long are you going to stand by?]

[I'm not standing by. I'm just watching. If it wasn't for Uriel, I would've
killed him…]

Gabriel, who was stuck in a plastic bottle, answered while sucking up water
through his stem. Beside her, the cosmos of Jophiel was likewise inserted
into a bottle of water.

In the distance, Kim Dokja was saying something to Yoo Joonghyuk.
Gabriel stared at him blankly and asked,

[That Uriel, is she well?]

[Focus on the mission, Gabriel.]

[No, I'm worried. Uriel always gets into trouble when she is left alone.]

[…I see. Do you actually like Uriel?]

[What nonsense! Have you found a way to go back yet? How long are we
supposed to stay with them?]

Gabriel's petals fluttered and Jophiel replied, [I'm looking for a way but it
seems hard.]

[Why? No matter how different the world line, there must be Eden here. If
you ask the scribe here for help…]

[There is no reply from the scribe.]

[What?]

[It isn't just the scribe. I can't contact anyone from Eden.]
Eden couldn't be contacted? It was strange, no matter how much the world
had changed. Due to the constraints of the scenario, it was impossible to
return to their original 'constellation context'. It was frustrating.

Gabriel sighed and sucked up water again. [What? They were fighting and
holding each other by the collar a few hours ago…]

In the distant place, Kim Dokja seemed to be stroking Yoo Joonghyuk's
head. Looking at this scene, Gabriel was reminded of Uriel and herself. It
was different but there was some resemblance.

…Companionship?

For a very short time, Gabriel seemed to understand why Uriel liked them.




"Eat the soil, Yoo Joonghyuk."

Yoo Joonghyuk started to silently eat the soil. I was startled and smacked
him in the back of the head. "Why are you really eating it?!"

I wanted to test it but I didn't know he would actually follow my order. The
Yoo Joonghyuk I knew would've never done this. However, the regression
depression had completely devoured his ego and for the time being, Yoo
Joonghyuk was in a stupid state. Yoo Joonghyuk looked up at me blankly.

I sighed with some compassion. "How good would it be if the usual you
was so calm? You are better than the third round bastard."

"…"

"…Spit it out."
I watched Yoo Joonghyuk spitting out the soil and remembered another
Yoo Joonghyuk that I knew. I didn't know if he was okay. It would be nice
if he hadn't lost his mind by the time I came back. I entrusted it to Yoo
Sangah so I hoped things would turn out well.

"Now lie down there and get some rest, 1863rd Yoo Joonghyuk."

At my words, Yoo Joonghyuk trudged towards the ruined building. I could
see the sun setting in the distance. The sunset of the 95th scenario was still
glowing. I looked at the haze and felt strangely peaceful. It was strange. In
this horrible scenario, I could indulge in this appreciation.

「 Kim Dok ja needs to kill Yoo Joong hyuk. 」

…No, I didn't. Fortunately, there was no deadline for the scenario that
Secretive Plotter gave me. I turned my head and saw Yoo Joonghyuk curled
up with a foolish expression as he waited for my orders.

"Sleep."

Yoo Joonghyuk understood my words and closed his eyes. Since the
scenario started, Yoo Joonghyuk had never slept properly. Maybe this was
the 'first sleep' for Yoo Joonghyuk. It was the first sleep where he was freed
from all his memories.

Once Yoo Joonghyuk was completely asleep, I turned on my smartphone.
The phone desktop contained the text of Ways of Survival as usual.
However, there was something different this time.

–Three Ways to Survive in a Ruined World.txt

…What? Wasn't it the 'third revision?' I suddenly got goosebumps. Was it
because I came back to the original round? Then it changed back to the
original text, not the revised one?
I opened the file with a confused mind. The file was the original Ways of
Survival that I knew. Maybe this was better. It was important to obtain
information about this round if I wanted to think properly about the future. I
quickly moved the screen to the 1863rd round and read all the information
thoroughly.

「 I lost Lee Hyunsung in the 54th scenario. 」

I read the story, read it and read it again.

「 In the 67th scenario, Lee Seolhwa was killed. 」

He lost, lost and lost more people.


「 Lee Jihye died in the 78th scenario. 」

The Yoo Joonghyuk of this round was completely alone. In fact, it wasn't
only this round. In all of Yoo Joonghyuk's rounds, he had to leave alone. It
was the same life even until the end.

"…Poor guy."

I didn't know the epilogue of Ways of Survival. The one thing I could be
sure of was that Ways of Survival didn't have a happy ending.

…What if I didn't go back to the third round? What if I stayed here and
helped Yoo Joonghyuk of the last round clear the scenario?

「 The Fourth Wall says, "Kim Dok ja, that…" 」

I know.

「 Ye s. 」
This was the trick hidden in Secretive Plotter's scheme. Perhaps Secretive
Plotter expected this and gave me a scenario. It was why the scenario had
no time limit.

Kill Yoo Joonghyuk here and return to the original world. Or see the
conclusion of the scenario with Yoo Joonghyuk here.

This was the idea of the 'outer god'. The laughable thing was that I was
really shaken by the proposal. If I looked at the person here… I wouldn't
see the ending I really wanted. But if I killed him here, the original 'Yoo
Joonghyuk' would disappear forever.

My head hurt as I thought about it. If I wanted to kill Yoo Joonghyuk, I had
to end Yoo Joonghyuk's regressions. However, his sponsor didn't speak and
I didn't know the identity. I didn't know if it was fortunate or not.

I sighed and scrolled through Ways of Survival again. Then I felt a cold
feeling down my spine.

[The constellation 'Lily Blooming in Aquarius' is warning you!]

In the distance, the two flowers in the plastic bottles were shaking. It was a
strong alarm. Was it an outer god?

"You've been hiding here, Yoo Joonghyuk."

The moment I reflexively tried to turn around, I felt an eerie prediction. If I
turned around now, I would die. I clearly had this feeling. It was a degree of
stealth that could fool my constellation senses. It was clearly an
unquantifiable existence. The presence was nearby?

"What are you? Are you Yoo Joonghyuk's companion?"

I got a sense of deja vu from the voice. It was clearly a voice I knew. I
turned my head slowly enough so that the enemy wouldn't feel threatened.
Behind me was a woman with a familiar appearance. For a moment, my
mind was awash with panic.

…How on earth? I hadn't thought about it. It was because this person was
already dead in this 'round'.

"Well, there is no need to know. I'll kill him anyway."

The smiling Admiral Lee Jihye smiled as she pointed the Double Dragon
Swords towards me.
            Chapter 289: Ep. 54 - Demon King Slayer, V


"Destroy, Double Dragon Swords."

At Lee Jihye's words, magic power exploded from the two swords.
Something resembling a blue dragon flew forward to tear at my neck.

The Double Dragon Swords. The strongest swords on the Korean Peninsula
and the relic of the Duke of Loyalty and Warfare shone. I looked at the
trajectory of the Kendo and used Way of the Wind and Electrification.

"Eh, you became smaller? Where did this incarnation come from?"

Admiral Lee Jihye. She survived up to the 95th scenario and was one of the
100 most powerful people in Ways of Survival.

However, this was a story for when she was 'alive'. If I remembered, in the
original novel, the Lee Jihye of the 1863rd round had died long ago. Then
who was the Lee Jihye in front of my eyes?
I flew at an altitude that the Double Dragon Swords couldn't reach me and
shouted, "Lee Jihye, stop! I'm not an enemy!"

"What, you know me? Indeed, I am a bit famous." She muttered shameless
words and took a pose.

I knew what this technique was.

Instant Kill. A great skill in Ways of Survival and a fearsome skill that
killed any opponent with one blow.

"Do you really think I can't cut a small bug like you?"

I faced Lee Jihye's eyes and got goosebumps. Then Lee Jihye disappeared
in an instant. An invisible sword was aimed at my neck and I instinctively
knew what would happen next.

I cried out, "Yoo Joonghyuk!"

A shadow as big as a house covered my eyes and the strong sound of metal
colliding was heard.

Yoo Joonghyuk blocked the sword by my side and Lee Jihye swung the
Double Dragon Swords at Yoo Joonghyuk.

There was a small scratch on the blade of the Splitting the Sky Sword.
Instant Kill was a powerful technique. If only the opponent wasn't Yoo
Joonghyuk.

In the 1863rd round, Yoo Joonghyuk was closer to a killing machine than
anyone else. His decision couldn't be reversed. Once he decided to kill
someone, he would kill them.

Yoo Joonghyuk broke through the threshold of transcendence and swung
his sword. Lee Jihye was pushed by the power gap and crashed to the
ground. Yoo Joonghyuk, who held the upper hand, fell towards Lee Jihye.
"Yoo Joonghyuk! Stop!" I shouted as there was a loud roar from the
ground.

I saw Lee Jihye falling in the dust and Yoo Joonghyuk aiming at her. Yoo
Joonghyuk didn't stop at my words. Sparks of probability were around him.
The regression depression was releasing.

"Happy memories! Happy memories!"

Yoo Joonghyuk paused.

"Don't kill her! You can't kill her!"

I didn't know why this Lee Jihye was alive. However, there was one thing I
knew. At the very least, Yoo Joonghyuk shouldn't kill her. Lee Jihye rose
from the dust and shouted, "What are you doing? Come on Supreme King!
This time I will kill you!"

It seemed this wasn't the first time Lee Jihye and Yoo Joonghyuk had
clashed. I couldn't understand no matter how I thought about it. It was
strange that the dead Lee Jihye had survived, let alone become enemies
with Yoo Joonghyuk.

"Wait! Lee Jihye, stop this! We have no intention of fighting!"

Lee Jihye didn't stop. Yoo Joonghyuk's movements had become passive
because of my order. Lee Jihye's blade cut the skin and blood flowed from
Yoo Joonghyuk. In the regression depression state, he couldn't take
effective defense measures.

However, if I gave an attack order then he would rush at Lee Jihye like
before… shit. I was still maintaining Electrification so I climbed onto Yoo
Joonghyuk's shoulder and shouted at Lee Jihye. "Stop it, you brat! Yoo
Joonghyuk is your master!"

"Master? What is this bullshit? I've never had this monster as a master."
Lee Jihye's eyes shone fiercely. "My master is a much more wonderful
person."

A five coloured aura flowed from Lee Jihye's blade. I reflexively activated
Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint. No matter what the attack, it was easy to
avoid if the direction was known.

[The skill activation is cancelled due to a lack of understanding about the
person!]

…Even if my understanding with Yoo Joonghyuk was low, something was
strange. Lee Jihye wasn't such a complicated human being. At the very
least, the Lee Jihye that I knew…

[The character 'Lee Jihye' has activated the stigma 'Song of the Sword Lv.
10!]

Was she going to do this? Then I had an idea. I strongly gripped Unbroken
Faith and invoked a stigma.

[The stigma 'Song of the Sword Lv. 5' has been used.]

Lee Jihye's expression was shocked as she confirmed the five colours rising
from my blade. She hadn't seemed to notice yet. In any case, this stigma
relied on 'chance'. Let's see who was luckier.

Lee Jihye was the first player. Strings floated in the air and the writing of
the Duke of Loyalty and Warfare flowed.

「 The 10th day. Clear skies. After eating breakfast, I went to work in the
city hall. 」

Bingo. I could see Lee Jihye's expression distorting. Song of the Sword was
a skill developed based on the Duke of Loyalty and Warfare's diary. If there
was no luck then an effect wouldn't be triggered.
Then it was my turn.

「 The 28th day. Clear skies. I fired 10 rounds of five with the bow. In five
rounds, I hit all targets. In two rounds, I hit four targets and in three rounds,
I hit three targets. 」

A fire bolt poured out from my blade. Lee Jihye's eyes widened and she
stepped back.

[The constellation 'Maritime War God' is looking at you with
astonishment.]

Lee Jihye put out the fire burning her collar and screamed, "Who are you?
How are you using my sponsor's stigma?"

"Let's have a conversation."

"I will cut off your limbs and then you will answer straight."

Perhaps my attack had irritated her but Lee Jihye's expression became a bit
serious. "I don't know what sponsor you have but they will receive a big
injury."

Lee Jihye pulled out a new sword. Surprisingly, it was an item that I also
knew. The Four Yin Demonic Beheading Sword. In all the rounds that I had
read about, there was no memory of Lee Jihye holding the Four Yin
Demonic Beheading Sword.

"The Big Dipper! Give me strength!" At Lee Jihye's cry, several stars shone
in the sky.

The Big Dipper originally consisted of seven constellations. However, this
was the latter scenario and only four stars shone because some had died.
Dazzling light poured from the Four Yin Demonic Beheading Sword as it
evolved into a star relic.
It was obvious what Lee Jihye was going to do. The Four Yin Demonic
Beheading Sword had the terrible power to break the link between sponsor
and incarnation for a short time.

By the way, Lee Jihye's expression towards me was strange. "You… there
are no links?"

Of course. I was now one with my incarnation body.

[The constellation 'Demon King of Salvation' is looking at incarnation 'Lee
Jihye'.]

The astonished Lee Jihye took one step back. Then it was my turn. I pulled
out the same sword that Lee Jihye was holding.

"H-How?

How on earth?"

I leapt from Yoo Joonghyuk's shoulders and held onto the Four Yin
Demonic Beheading Sword that let out a dazzling brilliance. The moment
that the careless Lee Jihye's eyes widened, the trajectory of Way of the
Wind moved over her head. There were explosive sparks and Lee Jihye
shrieked with pain.

"Aaaaack!"

The star of the Maritime War God defending her flickered. I backed away.

[The constellation 'Maritime War God' is angry at you!]

…I understood. I had been planning to break the Maritime War God's link
to Lee Jihye in order to neutralize Lee Jihye, but it failed.

Lee Jihye's eyes turned white. The Duke of Loyalty and Warfare of the 95th
scenario was about to descend in front of my eyes. I hurriedly checked the
water in the surrounding area. Everything was over if the Ghost Fleet was
summoned here.

The tributary of Cheonggyecheon was rising in the air. There were sparks
as the illusions of the Ghost Fleet started to appear one by one.

Dammit. I reflexively looked at the plastic bottles behind me. To be precise,
it was at the flowers plugged in. Should I borrow the archangels' power?
Would they lend their strength? The Lee Jihye in front of me wasn't 'evil'.

"Duke of Loyalty and Warfare. Please stop."

Then a serious man's voice was heard. A bear-like man's hand pointed at
Lee Jihye's shoulder.

[The constellation 'Maritime War God' is furious!]

[The constellation 'Master of Steel' is sending out a cold gaze!]

It was a battle between constellations. It was the Duke of Loyalty and
Warfare who stepped down first. The Ghost Fleet's illusions disappeared
and Lee Jihye collapsed on the ground. Then a man emerged from behind
Lee Jihye.

"You were here as well." I stared blankly at the man. I didn't know how
many times I would be surprised today.

"What are you doing, Hyunsung ahjussi? He is on Yoo Joonghyuk's side!"

"That hasn't been figured out yet."

The 25th or the 95th scenario. The third round or the 1863rd round… Lee
Hyunsung was the Lee Hyunsung I knew.

I barely managed to hold back a few tears.

"I am Lee Hyunsung. Can I ask for your name?"
"…I am Kim Dokja."

Lee Hyunsung seemed to have suffered a lot and I could see a thick scar on
his forehead. There were countless scars on his tight steel-like muscles.

I tried to calm my confused mind. Like Lee Jihye, Lee Hyunsung was a
person who couldn't be alive right now. In the 1863rd round, Yoo
Joonghyuk lost all his companions.

Lee Hyunsung said, "Dokja-ssi. We have no intention of being hostile to
you. We just need Yoo Joonghyuk over there."

It was a nice smile but I could read the calm behind it without much
difficulty. This Lee Hyunsung had made it through 94 scenarios. If I
threatened him even a little bit, Lee Hyunsung would try to remove me in a
more thorough and effective way than Lee Jihye.

I inquired in a calm tone, "Why do you need Yoo Joonghyuk?"

"He has the key to clearing this scenario."

I knew what the 95th scenario was and could see that Lee Hyunsung's
words were true. By the way, that wasn't the only thing I was curious about.

"How many people are in your group?"

"Huh?"

"If you have reached the 95th scenario then you must have a group."

"Ah, my group is Jihye…"

"If you lie to me one more time, I won't trust your words in the future."

Lee Hyunsung's expression hardened. I continued speaking, "Are you the
leader? Is it Lee Hyunsung-ssi?"
Lee Hyunsung's eyes were shaking. Indeed, he was a man who wasn't good
at hiding his emotions, no matter how much time passed.

"That…"

The blurred eyes gave me confidence. Lee Hyunsung and Lee Jihye were in
the same group but they weren't the leader. This '1863rd round' wasn't the
1863rd round I knew.

My head calmed down because a definite hypothesis was in it. In hindsight,
many things could be understood. My understanding of Yoo Joonghyuk
was strangely low. The reason why Lee Jihye and Lee Hyunsung survived
when they should be dead.

There was someone else besides me. Someone who wasn't in the original
novel was active in this round.

"If you want Yoo Joonghyuk, please guide me to your leader."

Lee Hyunsung shook his head. "It is difficult. I don't know what you and
Yoo Joonghyuk intend…"

"You don't have to be so vigilant. As you can see, I'm weak and the current
Yoo Joonghyuk is safe. He listens to my words pretty well."

"What a piece of shit! How can that bastard listen to anyone?"

Lee Jihye had a pretty good understanding of Yoo Joonghyuk. Lee
Hyunsung was also full of disbelief.

"Kim Dokja-ssi, are you Yoo Joonghyuk's companion?"

…Companion.

"That's right."

"…I don't believe it. I know that Yoo Joonghyuk has no companions."
"I'll show you the evidence. Yoo Joonghyuk."

Yoo Joonghyuk looked at me.

"Pick up your sword."

Yoo Joonghyuk picked up the Splitting the Sky Sword.

Lee Jihye cried out. "Only that much…!"

"Yoo Joonghyuk, come here."

As Yoo Joonghyuk approached, the terrified Lee Jihye hid behind Lee
Hyunsung. "Hyunsung ahjussi! Be careful! He's going to attack―"

"Yoo Joonghyuk, sit down."

Yoo Joonghyuk sat down.

Lee Jihye and Lee Hyunsung's mouths were wide open. It was truly
amazing. The Yoo Joonghyuk they knew would never do something like
this. I felt a bit sorry for him but it should be fine since I was beaten up a lot
yesterday.

Lee Jihye and Lee Hyunsung looked like they were watching a circus and I
smiled at them. "What else do you want to try? Should I feed him dirt?"

They glanced at each other after hearing my words. Lee Jihye waved her
hands and Lee Hyunsung gave a deep sigh.

"…Follow me."
Their base wasn't far away. However, due to the 'unnamed things' that
appeared along the way, it took longer than I thought. It took around two
hours as we wandered around the ruins avoiding the monsters.

In the distance, a building that seemed to be their stronghold appeared.

"This is the place."

There, I met a person wearing the same coat as me.
           Chapter 290: Ep. 54 - Demon King Slayer, VI


"Hey, Lee Jihye." A man waved towards us while speaking in a typical
gangster tone. The white coat hanging from his shoulder was unmistakably
the Infinite Dimension Space Coat. Thus, it was the same coat as mine.

[The constellation 'Lily Blooming in Aquarius' is frowning.]

[The constellation 'Commander of the Red Cosmos' is showing displeasure.]

The flowers were shaking in my coat's inner pocket.

…This guy was the leader? The surging shock made me momentarily
dizzy. I reflexively looked back at Yoo Joonghyuk but I couldn't share my
shock with Yoo Joonghyuk who had become a fool.

I looked back at the man again. He had a bandage wrapped around one
hand and he was half-leaning against a door as he laughed while pushing
back white hair.
「 Kim Dok ja is an i diot. 」

…No matter how I thought about it, he couldn't be the leader. In the first
place, this 'coat' was something that could be easily obtained by the 95th
scenario.

Lee Jihye frowned. "Kim Namwoon."

"Yes."

"I told you to pretend not to know me. Now get lost. I have to go in."

"Uh, uh…"

Kim Namwoon faltered in front of Lee Jihye's words. Lee Jihye glared at
Kim Namwoon like he was pathetic.

"In addition, don't steal Master's coat. I'll kill you."

"…Don't you want to wear it once?"

Lee Jihye slammed open the door and entered the building. As if
overwhelmed by Lee Jihye, Kim Namwoon's gaze followed after Lee
Jihye's back.

…Come to think of it, their relationship was exactly the same as it was in
the original novel. There were many new things that emerged in my mind.
Lee Jihye, Lee Hyunsung and Kim Namwoon…

Curiosity and an unknown fear coiled deep in my heart. What happened in
this round? As I was distracted for a moment, Kim Namwoon looked at me.

"Who are you? That coat looks like mine?"

[The character 'Kim Namwoon' is showing vigilance towards you!]
I remembered the first time I met him. Kim Namwoon's head was blown up
on the subway. If Kim Namwoon was still alive… would it have felt like
this?

"Hey soldier, who is this person? Fuck! It is Yoo Joonghyuk!"

Kim Namwoon discovered Yoo Joonghyuk behind me and quickly stepped
back.

[The constellation 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' is baring his teeth.]

Delusional Demon Kim Namwoon. In this turn, the Abyssal Black Flame
Dragon had picked his original incarnation.

Yoo Joonghyuk raised his head at the hostility directed towards him and
Kim
Namwoon flinched. "You are still cool… did you come to fight, Yoo
Joonghyuk?"

Kim Namwoon's hands were trembling and I couldn't tell if he was excited
or afraid. Maybe it was both. It was Lee Hyunsung who blocked the
atmosphere from becoming worse. "Namwoon, these people didn't come to
fight."

"What? Then why did they come?"

"That…"

I stepped inside the building without listening to their conversation.

"Wait a minute! Kim Dokja-ssi!"

Lee Hyunsung's voice was heard behind me but my desire to check the
interior of the building was greater. If my idea was correct… This building
was the very 'building' that Yoo Joonghyuk envisioned in the early rounds.
I entered and a spacious room appeared. It was the size of a warehouse of a
large company. From a large door next to me, a bed carrying a patient
rushed in. There was one emergency patient.

"Don't play around and move the patient over here!"

I quickly pushed the bed over. There were people in white coats gathered.

"A story pack! Bring a story pack!"

"This patient is allergic to animal-related stories!"

They were all trained in medical skills. The one leading them was a woman
wearing small rimless glasses. A woman looked at the patient's pierced
stomach and thighs and asked me about the details of the patient.

"Where did this patient get hurt?"

I stared quietly at her. A woman who was called 'Poisoner' or 'Doctor'
depending on the rounds. She was Yoo Joonghyuk's lover in some rounds
and enemies in others.

I wore a white coat and was mistaken to be a doctor. I looked at the
patient's details and answered, "Perhaps he was hit by an unnamed thing. It
seems that the tentacles contaminated the wound."

"Indeed… um?"

Lee Seolhwa slowly blinked at me.

[The character 'Lee Seolhwa' has received a strange feeling from you.]

"Who are you?"

Who should I say? No, she wouldn't know no matter what I said.
"Hey ahjussi, what are you doing? Come along quickly! Bring Yoo
Joonghyuk with you!"

I left the bemused Lee Jihye and walked up the stairs with Yoo Joonghyuk
towards Lee Jihye.

The inner walls of the building were made of a transparent material so the
structure of the whole building came into view as I climbed up.

Patients were constantly pouring into the emergency room on the first floor.
They were incarnations injured by confronting outer gods or constellations.

It wasn't strange. Such tragedies had become commonplace in the 95th
scenario. I remembered the 95th scenario of the 1863rd round.

I turned my attention outside the building and saw the ruined scenery of
Seoul. There were nebulae emitting smoke and sleeping outer gods. Above
them were dark crystals covering the sky.

[Apocalypse Dragon Sealing Ball]

This seal was the core and goal of the 95th scenario. Gather five scattered
keys and release the Apocalypse Dragon. Once the Apocalypse Dragon was
released, destruction would come to the planet and those who completed
the scenario would automatically go to the next scenario.

However, this 1863rd round was different from the 1863rd round I knew.

–A first-grade monster has appeared on the river side!

Radio waves were spreading through the building. As we climbed the stairs,
I could see the scene in the situation room that had bright panels shining.

–I strongly recommend that you withdraw the forces dispatched to Seocho!
The Archangel of Fire has appeared.
–We have found the Holy Sword Ascalon in Nowon! We are currently
engaged with dozens of unnamed things! Please send support!

Numerous messages came and went and one person was managing
everything. He had curly hair. A boy wearing a headset with dark circles
under his eyes.

…No, he wasn't a boy anymore. I looked at him with a strange feeling.

Hermit King of Shadows, Han Donghoon. The child, who didn't become a
'king' in the round I lived, sat in a place where his talent could shine. White
light emerged from Han Donghoon's fingertips and his completed the
calculations quickly.

–Min Jiwon-ssi and her Hwarang and Maitreya Cha Sangkyung will be in
charge of the Nowon area.

–The incarnations of Olympus must be hit first before they attack.

–You must secure the holy sword Ascalon. Hurry!

Familiar names were heard in the messages. Min Jiwon and Cha
Sangkyung. Those who had the Slumbering Lady of Fine Brocade and One-
Eyed Maitreya as their constellations survived to the 95th scenario.

"Why are you looking like that?" Lee Jihye watched me from the side and
poked me.

I hesitated to answer before telling her honestly. "…It is more amazing than
I thought."

Lee Jihye was surprised by my answer and hesitated for a moment. "Well,
my master is really great. It is all thanks to Master. That person did it
alone."
Lee Jihye, Lee Hyunsung, Lee Seolhwa, Min Jiwon, Cha Sangkyung, Han
Donghoon… in addition, Kim Namwoon. All the people who should've
died in the original 1863rd round were alive. Furthermore, their level of
their armed forces was high and the size of their force was formidable.

In a sense, it was better than the third round that I lived… no, it was the
level I had always hoped for.

My head throbbed.

Someone I didn't know had changed the history of the 1863rd round. The
tragedy that should've happened didn't happen and humanity was fighting.

Yoo Joonghyuk hadn't lost any colleagues yet. Maybe… I didn't have to go
back to the third round. I could see the proper ending here.

Lee Jihye told me, "We will go to the end of the scenario with Master."

The moment I heard this, an eerie and cold sensation filled my chest.
Clearly, there was everything present in this landscape. Apart from one
thing.

I turned around and saw Yoo Joonghyuk standing with a blank expression. I
couldn't tell whether or not Yoo Joonghyuk was looking at this scenery. I
didn't know if he was grieving or rejoicing. All I could know was about
myself.

"Why do you hate Yoo Joonghyuk?"

"It is because he is a bad guy."

"Why is he a bad guy?"

"Are you really asking because you don't know?"

"I don't know."
"That person won't hesitate to kill for his own goals."

It was true. I asked, "Is that all?"

"Do you need another reason?"

That's right. Maybe this reason alone was sufficient. However…

「 Kim Dokja thought, 'You don't know why Yoo Joonghyuk did those
things'.」

I took a deep breath. This wasn't Lee Jihye's fault. No one had done
anything wrong. Rather, everyone was doing so well that perhaps it made
me angry.

"Who is the Master you are talking about?"

"Go to the top floor of the building. Take the elevator over there."

I nodded and moved to the elevator. Yoo Joonghyuk followed behind me
and
Lee Jihye pulled out her sword. "Leave Yoo Joonghyuk here."

It was as expected. I alternated looking between Yoo Joonghyuk and Lee
Jihye. I heard a dinging sound as the elevator arrived.

I approached Yoo Joonghyuk before boarding the elevator. "Yoo
Joonghyuk, think happy thoughts and wait. Do you understand?" Yoo
Joonghyuk nodded.

"However, if someone tries to harm you… remember the memories of the
most unfortunate days."

"What are you doing now?"
Lee Jihye felt a strange nuance from my words. I ignored her and got on the
elevator.

"Hey! Answer me! What did you mean by what you said to Yoo
Joonghyuk!"

I knew how important this place was to Lee Jihye. Naturally, someone's
precious thing was a weakness.

"If you're curious then try touching him. Although I wouldn't if I was you."

The door of the elevator closed.

3, 4, 5…

Gravity increased as the number of floors of the building changed. The
numbers changed while my brain moved faster than ever.

Who was it? There were a few potential candidates. Those who could read
information of the future and change the future. Anna Croft and some
constellations of a certain nebula. However, none of them could do
something like this.

No matter how good they were, they were still part of the original novel. It
wasn't possible to make a change to the original events with their power
alone.

9, 10, 11…

Then there was only one answer. Besides me, there was another being
outside the original. Still, there were some weird points. Even if it was an
existence outside the original, there was no reason they could progress so
perfectly to the 95th scenario. In a way, it resembled me… At this moment,
I got goosebumps.
…Don't tell me? There were the Yoo Joonghyuks in other rounds. If so,
what about me?

Dding.

I shook my head the moment the elevator made a sound. According to the
revised version of Ways of Survival, I didn't exist in Yoo Joonghyuk's other
rounds. After a few more rounds, there was no 'me'. If there was, the
revision itself would be different.

Thus, the existence likely wasn't me. The one thing that bothered me was
Secretive Plotter.

[ Actually, there was another person beside you who made a covenant. ]

The door opened. Then a room reminiscent of a hotel suite appeared. It was
a dim room where the fire was extinguished. There was a soft carpeted
floor. I saw a figure sitting on the chair.

"Hmm… you are the one Lee Hyunsung mentioned."

Along with the voice, a silver light lit up the room. The first thing I saw in
my dim vision was the sword on the table. The sword boasted a pure white
luster. I knew this sword well. It was because it was my Unbroken Faith. As
I looked at the sword, the person sitting on the chair spoke.

"It is a good sword. As the name implies, it doesn't break."

"I know. I'm using it too."

"Really?"

The person sitting on the chair was covered in a black half mask. I stared at
the eyes visible beyond the half mask. It had changed by the winds of the
scenario but there was no doubt.

[The exclusive skill 'Character List' is activated!]
Originally, it was a skill that shouldn't work. I used it a few times and I
knew it well. Then why did I try it again?

[There is too much information about this person. Character List is
converted to Character Summary.]

Maybe it was because I hoped it wouldn't work. I looked at the information
in front of me and felt somewhat heavy. Maybe she didn't know.

What terrible loneliness did I feel right now?

"Okay, where did you come from? I've never heard the name Kim Dokja."

I should've noticed it from the beginning. She was the only person who
knew the existence of Ways of Survival apart from me. She was the only
one who could've done this in the first place.

…But how? It was pointless to ask. There was a part I needed to know from
now on. However, there was one thing I could know. This wasn't the one
from the third round that I knew.

I looked at the woman with a bob cut and asked, "Are you Han Sooyoung's
avatar?"
              Chapter 291: Ep. 55 - Happy Memories, I


One day in the past, Han Sooyoung had said,

–The first time I tried creating a clone using Avatar… I gave away too
many of my memories and it went out of control.

"…How interesting. Where did you hear that?"

[The character 'Han Sooyoung' is curious about you.]

[Your understanding of the character 'Han Sooyoung' has increased.]

Han Sooyoung's clone was looking at me with interest. Her eyes were so
vivid that I couldn't help doubting if she was really a clone for a moment.
However, the real Han Sooyoung wouldn't be so composed.

"I have familiar with your main body. She has a loose mouth."
"Hmm… it is a childish provocation but I will let it pass this time. Your
idea is wrong. I'm not Han Sooyoung's clone but the real Han Sooyoung."
"What?"

The shape of this smiling mouth was undoubtedly Han Sooyoung.

"I have memories that she doesn't have."

"Memories? What memories?"

"Unlike her, I am tight-lipped."

I grasped the hilt of the sword at my waist.

"I heard that clones will live even if their heads are cut off."

In any case, I hadn't come here to waste time. The Unbroken Faith in my
hand cried out violently.

[The constellation 'Demon King of Salvation' is looking at incarnation 'Han
Sooyoung'.]

The whole suite shook from the 'status' I released. I heard loud noises from
below but Han Sooyoung wasn't nervous at all.

"…Demon king. You are bigger than I think."

The next moment, I realized why she was composed. A net of probability
spread over the entire room. The status that I emitted suddenly fell sharply.

[This area is a Non-aggression Zone.]

[You are prohibited from fighting in the area for the next hour.]

A Non-aggression Zone…

"Did you make a deal with the dokkaebi?"
"It is necessary for a person who can control Yoo Joonghyuk."

I decided not to think of her as a mere 'clone' anymore. Maybe as she said,
this was the real Han Sooyoung.

Then a system message was heard.

[The character 'Han Sooyoung' has triggered the Eyes of Truth!]

Eyes of Truth. It was a 'attributes detection' skill comparable to Anna
Croft's Great Demon's Eye. In this short time, Han Sooyoung tried to read
my information.

[The exclusive skill 'Fourth Wall' is activated!]

[The Fourth Wall has completely broken down the Eyes of Truth…]

Sparks flew and Han Sooyoung hurriedly cancelled the skill. "You have a
tremendous skill."

Han Sooyoung wasn't greedy. She didn't try to break the Fourth Wall like
Yoo Joonghyuk and didn't panic like Anna Croft. This calmness wasn't the
Han Sooyoung that I knew.

Han Sooyoung laughed like it was fun. "You can cut off my head later.
Shall we play a game? Do you know the Divine Three Questions and
Answers?"

It was the question and answer exchange I had once done with Ariadne of
Olympus.

"Don't you have questions you are curious about? Let's exchange them one
by one."

I didn't know what was going on. However, this was clearly a chance for
me.
I nodded in agreement. "Okay."
"Let's make a rule instead. We are able to lie."

"Then what is the use of the Three Questions and Answers Exchange?"

"It is interesting."

Han Sooyoung's eyes moved in a smooth curve. It wasn't difficult to read
what she was thinking. I smiled and replied, "Yes, okay."

At my answer, messages popped up in the air.

–The Divine Three Questions and Answers has begun.

–Both sides will exchange three questions and answers.

–Both sides can refuse to answer one question.

–The conversation won't end until the questions and answers are fully
exchanged.

"I will ask first."

–The first question ticket has been used.

"Tell me about the contents of the Outer World Contract you signed with
Secretive Plotter.

Han Sooyoung shook a bit at my first question.

[Your understanding of the character 'Han Sooyoung' has increased!]

The key to this exchange was to create 'concrete questions' that were
difficult for the other person to avoid. I also had to make the most of the
information that could be handed over.

Han Sooyoung said to me, "You even know this? It isn't easy."
"Answer me."

"It means you have also made an Outer World Covenant."

She was quick to notice, just like Han Sooyoung of the third round. Han
Sooyoung continued speaking. "I have signed an Outer World Contract
with Secretive Plotter. If he hears what he wants, he will help me complete
the world I wanted."

–The first answer has been received.

It wasn't a very informative answer. The important thing was the
authenticity of the answer.

[The exclusive skill 'Lie Detection Lv. 6' is activated!]

[The character 'Han Sooyoung' has triggered 'Poker Face Lv. 10'!]

[Poker Face has neutralized the effect of Lie Detection!]

As expected, she knew this skill. There was Poker Face among the skills
that I saw on her Character List. Thanks to this skill, it was impossible to
find out the truth of the answer using Lie Detection. Of course, that didn't
mean I had no solution.

[The exclusive skill, 'Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint' has been activated!]

[Your understanding of this person is sufficient and the second stage of
Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint is activated!]

As soon as she became a character, I could read her thoughts just by asking
questions. The next moment.

…

「 I knew it. 」
「 I told you. 」

「 Uh, don't step on my feet! 」

「 Why are you peeking at me? 」

…

I instantly heard hundreds of voices and my heard felt like it was going to
burst. I didn't have any time to express my astonishment and hurriedly
cancelled the skill.

[Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint has been turned off!]

I looked at Han Sooyoung blankly and she had a peculiar smile on her face.
"I did this just in case and indeed. I thought there would be such a skill."

"…What was that just now?"

"Is that your second question?"

I reflexively closed my mouth. Han Sooyoung laughed. "Well, I'll answer
as a free service. It is an application of the Avatar skill."

I finally understood what was going on. Han Sooyoung split her self into
hundreds by using 'Avatar. I looked at Han Sooyoung's cheerful expression
and felt my heart beating quickly. I had never met such an opponent before.

Han Sooyoung spoke first. "This time I will ask."

–Incarnation 'Han Sooyoung' has used the first question ticket.

"Have you ever written a novel called Ways of Survival?"

Some questions implied information just by the question itself. I knew for
sure what this person thought of me. Thus, I had to show off my skills here.
"That's right. I wrote it."
[The character 'Han Sooyoung' has used 'Lie Detection Lv. 10'.]

[The exclusive skill 'Poker Face Lv. 5' is activated!]

I'm sorry but I also had the Poker Face skill. Just before I came to this
round, I bought a bunch of needed skills to the Dokkaebi Bag.

[Poker Face has neutralized the effect of Lie Detection!]

Han Sooyoung's lips curved slightly at the message. "You're really
interesting."

This person was also interesting.




"…Is this really Yoo Joonghyuk?"

Lee Seolhwa asked like it was unbelievable. Standing in front of her were
Iron Blood Supreme King Yoo Joonghyuk. Yoo Joonghyuk stood upright
and stared into space with blank eyes.

People flocked around Yoo Joonghyuk. It was Lee Jihye who scolded them
first. "What are you all looking at? What's wrong with you when you've
often seen him on the screen?"

"It's amazing… This is the first time I've seen him standing still like this.
How did you do it? Did you use poison?"

Even Han Donghoon sitting in the control room observed Yoo Joonghyuk
through the panel windows. Kim Namwoon sneaked up beside Yoo
Joonghyuk and took a subtle pose.

Click. Click.
Lee Jihye frowned as she saw the scene. "What are you doing?"

The surprised Kim Namwoon's phone flew into the air. Then a hand
stretched out from Kim Namwoon's shadow and grabbed the smartphone in
place of Kim Namwoon.

"Hey, let's take a photo together. This opportunity isn't common."

"Hey, shouldn't you leave him alone? Why are you taking photos?"

Lee Jihye grabbed his wrist and roared. Then there was the sound of a
photo being taken. The photo showed the expressionless Yoo Joonghyuk,
the giggling Kim Namwoon and the angry Lee Jihye.

"The soldier over there! Don't just stand there and move out of the way!
We're taking photos!"

Lee Hyunsung stood still in the distance and Lee Seolhwa hit Kim
Namwoon's head.

"Didn't I tell you to use honorifics with Hyunsung-ssi?"

"Ah, I hate it. Stop nagging me!"

Click.

"By the way, is this guy really safe?"

"Shall I stab him once?"

"Don't do anything. The guy who climbed up set a strange trigger. If
the worst happens, he will start a massacre." Click.

"Trigger? What trigger?"

"I think he told Yoo Joonghyuk to go on a rampage if he was harmed."
"Hmm, then… what about this?"

Kim Namwoon smiled and put a hand on Yoo Joonghyuk's shoulder. Yoo
Joonghyuk didn't react. "What? This is okay? Then what about this?"

People laughed as they surrounded the empty Yoo Joonghyuk. There were
some who were amazed and others who were happy.

Click.

Several photos were taken and Yoo Joonghyuk's expression changed little
by little. Faint emotions appeared in the depth of his hollow eyes. Maybe
they were emotions that Yoo Joonghyuk himself couldn't understand. His
eyes seemed to become hot and his heart was stuffy. However, Yoo
Joonghyuk didn't have a proper consciousness and didn't know what this
feeling was.

"Eh, what? I think he just moved."

"…Did you see wrong?"

"No! Really…"

All he knew were the words left behind by Kim Dokja.

–Imagine happy memories.

–Warning! Warning! The archangel of flames is approaching!

A warning rang in the air and the people attached to Yoo Joonghyuk were
amazed. The first one who screamed was Kim Namwoon.

"What? Fuck! Why is that crazy bitch here?"

"This is bad. Be prepared. Hyunsung, go up and let Master know!"
As the group scattered, Yoo Joonghyuk stood in place. Some disturbed
people hit him as they passed by.

–Imagine happy memories.

In the urgent situation, Yoo Joonghyuk stared at the huge panel screen in
the air. The dazzling angel burning with red flames was moving. Every
time the angel's burning sword moved, the ruined area was engulfed in
flames.

Yoo Joonghyuk had a headache. In his empty mind, Yoo Joonghyuk had
seen the angel.

Happy memories.

Strangely, the memory was unfamiliar and amicable. It was like a thick
wall was in the middle of this distant and cold memory. In his memory, she
was a small doll.

–The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' is laughing.

–The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' is hoping you won't make
any unnecessary sacrifices.

It wasn't her memory. It was a record left on someone's wall and he just
stole it. They were memories of a world that didn't exist for him. It was
fiction.

–The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' is touched by your
companionship.

Even so, Yoo Joonghyuk didn't understand why he remembered this fiction
so clearly.

–The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' is rubbing her cheek against
you.
The burning archangel was watching him on the screen. Yoo Joonghyuk
muttered like a child first learning to speak. "…Uriel."
            Chapter 292: Ep. 55 - Happy Memories, II


It had been approximately 20 minutes since the conversation with Han
Sooyoung started. I was able to deduce a few pieces of information through
the three questions.

One, the 'Han Sooyoung' of the 1863rd round had contracted with Secretive
Plotter through the Outer World Covenant.

Two, 'Han Sooyoung' of the 1863rd round might not be the alter ego of the
third round person.

Three, the 'Han Sooyoung' of the 1863rd round had more information (and
was a bit smarter) than the third one.

I could combine them and deduce more information. For example, it was
likely that this Han Sooyoung came from from the same 'third round' as me.
She also obtained information about the future through methods I didn't
know…
I spoke to Han Sooyoung, "Thanks to you, I got some good information.
Then all that's left is my last question?"

"Hmm, do I have to answer? I know enough information about you now."

"…Really? What do you know?"

"Is that your third question?"

"No."

Han Sooyoung licked her lips and smiled at me. "Kim Dokja of the third
round. How am 'I' there?"

The moment I was about to say that her right to ask a question was over, a
cold sensation filled me.

…How did she know that I came from the third round?

"Oh, based on your expression, I'm right? I was taken."

"Don't lie. You knew when you said it."

"Ahaha, I didn't."

My gaze collided with Han Sooyoung in the air. Han Sooyoung moistened
her lower lip and asked, "The third round… do I have a screw missing? I
took too many memories."

"You are doing well in your own way. Shouldn't you worry about yourself
now?"

"Are you covering for me? Then will you give me some information? You
have read all the novel so you can show me this much generosity?"

"…I don't know what you're talking about."
"I was really curious about what type of person would read all of that novel
but you are more than I expected. Kim Dokja."

The third round Han Sooyoung was formidable but this one really wasn't
ordinary.

"I said that I'm the writer."

Han Sooyoung laughed. "You're not the writer. You're too intelligent to
write that novel. Although you are too stupid to deceive me."

"Only that reason…"

"I also have a guess about what the author of Ways of Survival is."

I almost asked her about the author. However, I couldn't reveal any
loopholes in this place that might be a trap. I frowned and asked another
question. "If you thought I wasn't the writer, why ask the question in the
first place?"

"Let's see? Why did I?"

Han Sooyoung smiled leisurely. It wasn't that hard to guess. Han
Sooyoung asked if I had written Ways of Survival. My answer admitted
that I knew about Ways of Survival… damn. I decided to stop talking and
ask the most important question. "I will ask the last question." –The third
question ticket has been used.

"How did you survive up to the 95th scenario? You definitely couldn't have
read Ways of Survival until the 95th scenario―"

Then a deafening noise occurred downstairs. Along with a beeping sound,
Lee Hyunsung hurriedly rushed up the emergency stairs into the suite and
shouted,

"Captain! It is serious!"
At the same time that Lee Hyunsung spoke, the two angels in my arms also
sent indirect messages.

[The constellation 'Lily Blooming in Aquarius' is shocked by something!]

[The constellation 'Commander of the Red Cosmos' is warning you!]

Han Sooyoung's eyes flashed. "Your flowers…"

I ignored her and ran towards the outer window. I didn't know exactly what
happened. However, if I was right…

The shadow of a giant dragon flew outside the window. I wondered if
someone had awakened the Apocalypse Dragon but it wasn't possible. I
gulped as I watched the giant dragon flapping its wings in the sky. Yes,
why didn't I see it?

"Everyone, avoid it! I will do it alone!"

A woman in a white fur coat was leading the giant dragon. Beast Lord Shin
Yoosung. She was no longer a child and was guiding the party in the 95th
scenario. The chimera dragon, that had evolved beyond a first-grade
monster to special-grade, breathed out.

However, the overflowing flames weren't extinguished by the breath.
Rather, they blazed even more with the poisonous substance.

I knew these flames. The flames were the Hell Flames that blazed at the
bottom of Eden. I knew that the future had changed with Han Sooyoung's
intervention.

However, this 1863rd turn was similar to the 1863rd turn I knew. For
example, the name of the last remaining archangel in this fallen world.

"Uriel."

[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' is furious!]
There was an explosive current and the outer window of the building was
broken entirely. Shin Yoosung's chimera dragon was falling. I leapt out the
window and pierced through the wind. The helpless Shin Yoosung fell into
my arms.

Shin Yoosung looked up at me with surprise. "Who…?"

"I'll stop the bleeding."

I triggered the Hit a Pressure Point skill and struck Shin Yoosung's neck
and arms. Then something waved inside me and a transparent string popped
out from my fingertips.

「 The Fourth Wall is making a playful expression. 」

I noticed what he was trying to do.

'But'.

「 The Fourth Wall is looking sullen. 'Che'. 」

I didn't want to tell the people of this world my story. It was strenuous and
unfair. There was also nothing they could do to help me. I landed lightly on
the ground and put Shin Yoosung down.

A little later, Lee Hyunsung descended to the ground while carrying Han
Sooyoung on his shoulder. Shin Yoosung staggered up and spoke towards
Han Sooyoung.

"…Captain, I'm sorry."

"It's okay."

Han Sooyoung jumped from Lee Hyunsung's shoulder and patted Shin
Yoosung. I felt very strange as I watched the scene. The existence that was
originally supposed to be in that place was Yoo Joonghyuk.
"Coat."

Han Sooyoung held out a hand and Lee Jihye took the white coat from Kim
Namwoon.

"Here it is, Master."

The white coat reduced its size to fit Han Sooyoung's body. I didn't know if
it was my feeling but it looked cooler than my coat. Han Sooyoung raised
the collar of her coat and looked at Gwanghwamun.

The hell flames were burning in the dust cloud. The burnt constellations
screamed helplessly. The remnants of the stars were turning to ask one by
one.

This was the field where the Archangel of Destruction, Uriel descended. I
watched the flames and asked Han Sooyoung. "…Do you know the reason
why Uriel came here?"

"What reason do you think?"

"The destruction of Eden."

"Your guess is right."

The flowers in my pocket trembled a the conversation.

[The constellation 'Lily Blooming in Aquarius' is asking what you mean!]

[The constellation 'Commander of the Red Cosmos' is looking at you.]

Of course, they didn't know what happened to Eden in the 1863rd round. In
fact, I didn't want them to know the truth. There were strange creatures
coming from every corner of Gwanghwamun where the white flames were
burning.
The unnamed things. The beings were attracted to Uriel's presence and
flocked like moths towards the flames. I asked Han Sooyoung, "Do you
need help?"

"Thank you for your help. The Archangel of Flames is difficult to deal
with."

Yoo Joonghyuk waited for my orders and stared at me. Han Sooyoung
continued speaking. "If this continues, someone can die."

I bit my lips. This round wasn't my round. Yoo Joonghyuk didn't have any
colleagues in this round. "Yoo Joonghyuk. Stop Uriel."

At my words, Yoo Joonghyuk moved. In fact, I hadn't wanted to do this.
Uriel discovered Yoo Joonghyuk and shouted as she lost her temper. –
Ahhhhhhh!

It was natural. One of the reasons why Eden was destroyed was right before
her eyes. The furious Uriel unleashed a wave of hell flames and Yoo
Joonghyuk's Breaking the Sky Swordsmanship cut off the wave. The
terrifying collision generated a tremendous shockwave in the sky.

The third round Yoo Joonghyuk and Uriel wouldn't have believed it if they
saw the scene. I didn't want them to see it either. I wanted this scene to
remain in my head.

The vibrations from the flowers in my pocket were becoming worse. The
impatient Gabriel couldn't bear it and spoke in her true voice.

[Why is Uriel attacking him? You know something.

Right?] I nodded.

[Tell me quickly! Otherwise―]

"What good is it to say it?"
There was nothing that could be changed. No, maybe it shouldn't be
changed. This fight was caused by the events of the 1863rd turn. Uriel's
fury was justified and Yoo Joonghyuk had to endure the fury.

I watched with clenched fists. Han Sooyoung spoke in an admiring voice by
my side. "You really can control Yoo Joonghyuk. I honestly didn't believe
it."

"Can you stop the rest?"

"No problem. Ah, I'll give you a reward."

Han Sooyoung continued speaking. "Didn't you ask me earlier? Why I
could survive to this scenario."

[The character 'Han Sooyoung' is talking about the story 'Predictive
Plagiarism'.]

"This is the answer."

A white light emerged from Han Sooyoung's body. Her eyes shone brightly
as she read the patterns of the incoming monsters.

…Future Sight? There was no doubt. I didn't know the principles but it was
unmistakable an ability like Future Sight. It was an ability that wasn't in the
original novel.

「 There is nothing new under the sun. Everything that is written is a
modification of what has already been written. 」

Han Sooyoung's story started flowing out in its entirety. She smashed
Unbroken Faith towards the necks of the approaching monsters and
laughed.
"I'm a first-rate writer. In addition, Ways of Survival is a collection of
cliches at best. Do you think it's hard to predict the development? In the
end, it's just a repetition of patterns."

Han Sooyoung skillfully read the patterns and hunted the monsters. I
watched the scene for a while and said, "Did you survive because of
that?" I had to admit that it was an excellent ability.

"Ways of Survival is a story full of complicated settings. Even if you are a
writer, there are things you can do and things you can't do."

"Yes, you are right."

The next moment, a white light rose from Han Sooyoung's body and
countless clones rushed out. 10, 20, 30… in an instant, there were 100
clones holding Unbroken Faith.

"If there was only one of me."

Han Sooyoung swung the sword in her hand and hundreds of Han
Sooyoungs jumped into the battlefield at the same time. They weren't afraid
of death and carefully attacked the unnamed things. Han Sooyoung
continued to split apart.

"However, what if it becomes two or three?"

The things that one person could do were different from what 100 people
could do. The things that 100 people could do were different from what
1,000 people could do.

"Do you know? Things that will take one person a lifetime to do can be
done by 10,000 people in two days."

[The exclusive skill, 'Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint' has been activated!]
Many voices pushed towards me at once, enough to overload me. The
voices soon produced a single image. I realized it was the landscape of Han
Sooyoung's mind. Numerous Han Sooyoungs were meeting there to
conceive the world.

.

.

「 This is wrong. 」

「 The next development is like this. I'm sure he'll emerge. 」

「 No, this is right. Archangel Uriel… 」

「 Let's do a majority vote. 」

.

.

Simulations of the world were drawn by Han Sooyoung. Perhaps Yoo
Joonghyuk wasn't the only regressor.

In someone's head, millions of worlds were born and broken. It was
because a small mistake was made or because there was a very small
defect. It was a scene where a story that pursued the extreme piled up.

I fell into Han Sooyoung's story. The life of this story was sad and
beautiful. Some were agreeable developments. Some were developments I
hadn't even thought about.

I didn't want to admit it but I had to. Some reproductions went beyond the
original. It was an effort to create a perfect 'single development'. This world
was the result of Han Sooyoung's plan.
I raised my head and looked at Yoo Joonghyuk. Yoo Joonghyuk kept
swinging his sword even when his skin was torn and blood splashed. It was
Uriel fighting against such a Yoo Joonghyuk.

No colleagues would die. No destruction would happen. A world where
everyone could gather their strengths and reach the 'last scenario'.

Dammit, I had no choice but to agree. In order for this world to be
completed, Yoo Joonghyuk…

Han Sooyoung stared at me. She seemed to understand what I was thinking.
"You know it by now. I don't need him in this world."

The plagiarist, who dreamt of a world beyond the original, told me,

"I know how to kill Yoo Joonghyuk."
            Chapter 293: Ep. 55 - Happy Memories, III


–I know how to kill Yoo Joonghyuk.

Those were Han Sooyoung's words.

I hesitated for a moment before opening my mouth. "…You don't have to
do something like that. A perfect story isn't the best story."

From afar, there was a deafening roar from the collision between Yoo
Joonghyuk and Uriel. The light that emanated from the sky filled Han
Sooyoung's white eyes.

"Yoo Joonghyuk has to die in this scenario. That way, the world I am
hoping for will be finished."

"What world are you hoping for…"

"Didn't you look into my head? Yet you're still saying this?"
My voice was buried by another roar. It was a meaningless question in the
first place. As Han Sooyoung mentioned, I got a glimpse of the world she
dreamt of.

It was a utopia without any gaps. It was an answer that only a person who
digested the original novel in a completely different way could present.

I turned my head and watched the battle between Yoo Joonghyuk and Uriel.
In the world that Han Sooyoung dreamt of, the answer for this battle was as
followed:

「 The archangel of flames will die here. 」

As if waiting, the party members gathered around Uriel and Yoo
Joonghyuk's battlefield. Lee Jihye was preparing Instant Kill, Lee
Hyunsung charted up Great Mountain Smash, Kim Namwoon was untying
his bandage and seemed ready to call the Abyssal Black Flame Dragon.

I grasped Unbroken Faith. Han Sooyoung noticed my movements and
glared at me. "Wait, you…!"

It was obviously Han Sooyoung, not Yoo Joonghyuk, who made this world.
But… so what?

[The constellation 'Demon King of Salvation' is opening his 'status'.]

In the first place, this wasn't the story I wanted to read. The small horns that
symbolized a demon king rose from my head. I wanted to embody the
wings but it wasn't possible with the imperfect Demon Realm's Spring. Han
Sooyoung was surprised but didn't stop me. Perhaps she thought it was
impossible to stop the fight with my own strength.

I knew it as well. By the way, now I wasn't alone.

"Gabriel, Jophiel."
[The constellation 'Lily Blooming in Aquarius' is looking at you.]

[The constellation 'Commander of the Red Cosmos' is looking at you.]

"Please help me."

[The archangels says that it will require more probability than before.]

"It doesn't matter."

The moment I gave permission, the status of the two angels entered me. I
felt my skin tearing and something grew.

[The archangels' 'status' dwells within you.]

Six wings grew from me, just like when I destroyed the constellations.

[The status of a demon king and an archangel are conflicting inside you.]

The stories that didn't mix screamed from inside me. An archangel's status
was added to the power of a demon king. The wavelength that was
impossible with common sense swept through the battlefield.

"What, this status…!"

It was natural to be shocked. Now Uriel was the only archangel to survive
in this world. Yet the status that could be felt from me belonged to an
archangel.

[The demon king 'Black Mane Lion' is watching you!]

[The demon king 'Devil of Lust and Wrath' is looking at you!]

It was surprising that the power of a demon king and archangel dwelt in one
being. As far as I knew, there was only one existence in the world that
could create this type of status in Ways of Survival.
[Demon. King…!]

Uriel felt my presence and looked over here. The moment I opened my
mouth, Gabriel who descended inside me struck first.

[Uriel! Stop! What is this?]

The majesty of the archangel's true voice caused a light of reason to return
to Uriel's eyes.

[…Gabriel?]

[Are you out of your mind? What are you doing?]

Gabriel's true voice flowed through me. I looked at Uriel's cold eyes and
belatedly realized the mistake.

[Look, these are the people you like! Yoo Joonghyuk and Kim Dokja! You
are always talking about them!]

The moment Gabriel's incarnation approached Uriel, her lips opened.

[What are you talking about? ■■■]

The confused Gabriel stiffened. Uriel continued speaking. [You are alive
Gabriel. You also groveled to a demon king.]

[W-What are you saying?] –

Ahhhhhhh!

Uriel's enormous magic power flooded the Gwanghwamun area. Hell
Flames Ignition was running wild and turning it into hell. I was able to see
Yoo Joonghyuk's coat melting away from the high temperature.

The unnamed things were swept away by the aftereffects and scattered into
pieces of meat.
I shouted, "Gabriel!"

The dazed Gabriel belatedly handed his strength to me.

[I will hear the explanation later.]

To be honest, I wasn't confident in explaining. They wouldn't be able to
fathom what happened to Eden in the 1863rd round. Once the archangels of
the third round knew the information, I didn't know what type of storm I
would be swept up in or the psychologically damage Gabriel would receive.
Because… Gabriel of the 1863rd round betrayed Eden.

"Yoo Joonghyuk!"

The moment I called out, Yoo Joonghyuk cut the flames using Breaking the
Sky Swordsmanship. I plunged into the flames.

Three petals from Gabriel and Jophiel scattered in the air. There was a huge
charge and something rose inside me. I took advantage of the reaction from
the colliding magic power to instantly approach Uriel.

I'm sorry Uriel.

I grabbed Uriel's head with both hands. The power of the Purest Sword
Force and the status of the archangels and demon king struck Uriel's head.
Uriel made a pained frown but Uriel's momentum didn't decrease at all.

Rather, her flames were encroaching towards me little by little. The high
heat caused my wings and horns to melt slightly. I was the one who
groaned first. This was the power of Edens' strongest combat angel.

Uriel smiled brutally and called the hell flames to her hands. The hottest
flames in the world. The moment that sharp blade of flames aimed at my
heart.

"Jophiel!"
Huge sparks appeared at my fingertips and Uriel's body was surrounded by
a circular restraint reminiscent of a halo. Uriel cried out with shock as the
white constraints bound her.

Uriel's status was reduced in an instant and the flames suddenly
extinguished. Uriel was one of the most powerful archangels in Eden. No
other angel could match her in fighting demons.

However, what if the opponent was also an archangel?

Archangel Jophiel. Unlike the other angels who focused on demon
eradication, Jophiel had one more special ability.

[Confinement of Good and Evil.]

Uriel's skill that was used to hunt fallen angels exerted strength against
Uriel. Uriel tried to escape but the restraint tightened. Uriel struggled before
finally giving up on rebelling and collapsed. The archangel trapped by the
constraints would fall into a deep sleep for a week.

I hugged the sleeping Uriel and moved out of the fire with Yoo Joonghyuk.
I emerged from the smoke and saw the party members looking this way.
Someone stared with astonishment while others felt admiration…someone
else was staring at me with faint hostility.

I watched Han Sooyoung. "This is something that wasn't present in the
world of your dreams."

"…Uriel being dead or not has no impact on the big picture. You've seen it
so shouldn't you know?

My visualization is perfect."

Her white coat fluttered as Han Sooyoung walked towards me. She soon
reached my nose and looked up at me. She glanced at the burned angel
wings and broken demon horns and asked,
"Kim Dokja, what world do you want? You have read the story to the end
and there must be a world you want."

I knew Han Sooyoung's words very well.

「 "What is the world that I want?" 」

They were the very words that Yoo Joonghyuk always used when recruiting
new colleagues. I told Han Sooyoung. "I'm not your colleague."

"I need you to complete this story."

Han Sooyoung continued while pointing to Yoo Joonghyuk. "Don't you
also need the completion of a new story?"

It seemed that she knew why I came to this world. I examined the faces of
the party members one by one. Lee Hyunsung, Lee Jihye, Lee Seolhwa,
Shin Yoosung, Kim Namwoon…

So far, there was no round where all of them had survived up to this point.
However—

"What's new about this story?"

I was watching Yoo Joonghyuk. The only person not selected by this world.
He repeated thousands of rounds to save this world but this time, he had to
die for the world.

Han Sooyoung's world was also a world where someone must die in the
end. There were countless other worlds like that, not just Han Sooyoung's
world.

"You have read part of the original, changed the development and placed
the name of another person in the place of the protagonist."
Some reproductions might surpass the original. However, they could never
be the original.

"Do you know what they call such an act?"

I wanted to have a relaxed smile but now I wasn't in the mood. Han
Sooyoung stared at me with blazing eyes. "This isn't the round you were in.
Don't talk nonsense."

Han Sooyoung no longer listened to me and turned away. "I'll give you
three days. You better decide by then. Help me or don't help me. That's all I
want to hear."

The party members followed Han Sooyoung and entered the building one
by one. Lee Hyunsung helped Lee Seolhwa transport patients. Lee Jihye
and Kim Namwoon glanced at me before looking away.

This wasn't my round. The people in my round were waiting for me and I
could go back if I killed Yoo Joonghyuk.

I looked at Yoo Joonghyuk. There were holes in his coat as Yoo Joonghyuk
stood there with foolish eyes.

…However, was that really all I had to do?




Han Sooyoung was sweating when she opened her eyes in the darkness.
There were faint sparks around her body. Her entire body was freezing
cold.

Han Sooyoung took a deep breath and rose from her spot. She turned on her
smartphone and opened her novel file. SSSSS-grade Infinite Regressor.
「 Yoo Joonhyun thought about it. 」

「 …I'm afraid. 」

「 Is it just up to here? 」

These were the contents of the saved pages. Nevertheless, Han Sooyoung
read them. She read them again and again, as if the contents would be
blown away if she didn't.

How long did she read? The sparks around her started shrinking. She barely
managed a sigh. If she had been a bit later, her existence itself would be
swallowed up by the sparks.

It wasn't the first time. It was the probability storm gnawing at my
memories. It wasn't known if this was a side effect of the excessive use of
Avatar or related to Ways of Survival.

[The Star Stream is watching incarnation 'Han Sooyoung'.]

Han Sooyoung bit her lips and relaxed her body. Her shoulders and wrists
hardened by the side effects were checked one by one. She could feel the
eyes of countless constellations on her.

Han Sooyoung thought, 'Look as much as you like. I didn't start this just to
end here'.

After warming up, the coldness in her bones were gone. Han Sooyoung put
on a coat and glanced out the window.

Kim Dokja and her party members could be seen. They were awkward on
the first day but after a few days, they were chatting. It was strange. Those
who had gone through 94 scenarios and were filled with distrust quickly
opened their hearts to him.

Kim Dokja. The variable that appeared at the end of this plan.
…Why did Secretive Plotter send another covenant at this point? Han
Sooyoung didn't know the answer. She just knew that she had to use Kim
Dokja.

Yoo Joonghyuk was standing blankly in a corner of the square. Han
Sooyoung watched for a while before jumping out the window.

Han Sooyoung landed beside Yoo Joonghyuk and opened her mouth. "It
has been two days."

Yoo Joonghyuk didn't answer. Han Sooyoung slowly watched Yoo
Joonghyuk. His blank eyes seemed to hear nothing.

Han Sooyoung stared into his eyes and suddenly approached him. "…You
really aren't conscious?"

Han Sooyoung's hand grabbed Yoo Joonghyuk's chin. Yoo Joonghyuk
didn't react.

"How funny. I can't believe this is happening… did you forget that you
promised to die?"

At this close distance, Yoo Joonghyuk's face was covered with scars. They
were traces of a lonelier battle than any other round.

Han Sooyoung looked at such a Yoo Joonghyuk. She felt both sympathetic
and angry. Han Sooyoung removed her hand from Yoo Joonghyuk's chin
and pulled out a cigarette. Smoke appeared as she lit it up.

In the distance, the people surrounding Kim Dokja shouted at something he
said. Han Sooyoung blew out smoke.

"The world is unfair. Some people find it easy to get along with others
using a few words while some people egress so much and feel out of place."

"…"
"Didn't you write down some good memories for me? You could've
done enough… no, it's fine. There was no way you could do it." Han
Sooyoung stepped on the cigarette ash that fell.

"Don't blame me for killing you when you don't remember. I did everything
you asked me to do."

Han Sooyoung walked towards her party members. Yoo Joonghyuk
watched Han Sooyoung moving away with empty eyes. A dim light was
returning to Yoo Joonghyuk's blank eyes.
             Chapter 294: Ep. 55 - Happy Memories, IV


Two days had passed since I started staying at Han Sooyoung's
headquarters.

In the meantime, I had to concentrate on a few things. One was to reveal
exactly what Han Sooyoung meant by 'the death of Yoo Joonghyuk'. The
second was to find out what Han Sooyoung ultimately wanted to achieve
through it.

Either way, finding out wasn't easy. This wasn't the only problem.

[It is really destroyed? Our Eden?]

I looked at Gabriel who was exuding a ferocious spirit.

"That's right. Didn't you hear anything about it from the third round
Metatron?"

[…The scribe knows about the destruction of Eden?]
I nodded. "If you go back, ask him yourself. Of course, that's if you can go
back safely."

The stems of Gabriel and Jophiel started to shake. I thought they were
angry with me but they seemed to be talking to each other. I pulled out the
Uriel doll. She was caught by the Confinement of Good and Evil and
couldn't use her strength for the next five days.

「 The Fourth Wall is looking at you. 」

Maybe I could borrow the power of the Fourth Wall to give her memories
of the third round. However, the idea that Uriel would be moved by my
memories was just a fantasy. Maybe after seeing the memories, Uriel would
say:「 ■■, so what? 」

The memories of the third round would sound like a novel to Uriel who had
lived through the third round.

"Kim Dokja-ssi, are you going to hunt with us?"

I looked up and saw Lee Hyunsung standing there with steel gauntlets on.
"Is it okay if I go with you?"

"Yes, well… there is no meaning in identifying a picked up bullet."

I smiled at Lee Hyunsung's words. Whether it was the third round or the
1863rd round, the strange analogies were still there. I calculated how many
times Lee Hyunsung must've be confined in the guardhouse so far.

[Your understanding of the character 'Lee Hyunsung' has increased.]

[The character 'Lee Hyunsung' shows a weak liking towards you.]

I recalled the first scenario and suddenly felt a bit distracted. I added a
sentence to alleviate Lee Hyunsung's wariness. "Shouldn't you be more
vigilant? I am Yoo Joonghyuk's companion."
"Um… Captain didn't say anything and… as a matter of fact, I feel that
Dokja-ssi isn't a bad person. I guess this is the intuition I gained after 94
scenarios."

Throughout the novel, Lee Hyunsung's intuition was mostly off the mark.
Whenever Lee Hyunsung said this, I used to think that Yoo Joonghyuk
would be stabbed in the back.

"Hey, you came? Let's take a look at your skills."

Those who went out to hunt together were Kim Namwoon and Lee Jihye.
Lee Jihye was covered with a big grey hood and looked at me in a
displeased manner.

"Come quickly. We're going to start."

I followed the party members out of the headquarters. The purpose of this
hunt was to clean up the unnamed things around the headquarters and
collect the items. Of course, I knew the real reason why Han Sooyoung
ordered this hunt.

–There are two ahead of you. One is a tentacled species and the other is a
composite species.

Han Donghoon's message was heard and Lee Jihye pulled out her sword.
She triggered Instant Kill to defeat all the tentacles and then Kim Namwoon
burned the main body with his black flames.

I felt it when I read the original but the two of them were really well
matched. There was a terrible scream as the monster turned to ashes and
Kim Namwoon approached Lee Jihye.

"Nice attack."

Kim Namwoon raised his right hand towards Lee Jihye with a cool face.
Lee Jihye aimed her sword at Kim Namwoon with cold eyes. The sword
pierced past Kim Namwoon's cheek and penetrated the tentacle that was
wriggling around as the unnamed thing struggled with the flames.

Lee Jihye moved towards the next prey. Kim Namwoon chased after her.
"Hey, let's go together!"

Once Gilyoung and Yoosung grew up, would they be a duo like this? I
might see such a scene if I went back.

"Dokja-ssi?"

"Ah, yes. I'll take the other side."

I hurriedly pulled out Unbroken Faith and activated Way of the Wind.
Some flying tentacles penetrated during an unguarded moment. It was a bit
tricky to deal with the unnamed things when I deliberately wasn't using
Electrification.

"Kukuk, you're weak?"

Kim Namwoon, who had the black flames in both hands, started to beat up
the unnamed things with a careless smile.

"Watch and learn!"

Certainly, it was a great combat force. The present Kim Namwoon was able
to draw out half the power of the Abyssal Black Flame Dragon.

I quietly cheered on Kim Namwoon. "You're great. It is coming again."

"Hahaha, give it to me!"

"Wow, no matter how good you are, isn't it hard?"

"What are you talking about? Hahahaha! Die!"

"Hey, there's that one over there…"
Kim Namwoon belatedly noticed something and his eyebrows twitched.
Lee Hyunsung standing nearby was smiling. In the distance, Lee Jihye
caught a monster and clicked her tongue like he was pitiful. The moment
Kim Namwoon's expression distorted and he raised his fist towards me, I
told him, "Lee Jihye doesn't like pretentiousness."

Kim Namwoon's face turned as white as his hair. His eyes shook like an
earthquake had occurred.

In fact, the one who had the biggest reaction was Lee Hyunsung, whose
eyes widened.

…This guy passed through every round without noticing. Kim Namwoon
glanced between Lee Jihye and I before stammering.

"H-How do you know that?"

"It would be strange if I didn't know. Dye your hair first and get rid of the
bandages. Replace them with half gloves on both sides. After the hunt, don't
say things like nice attack."

[The constellation 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' hates you.]

"It will be more helpful if you act like the guy behind me."

Kim Namwoon blinked as he looked at the person behind me. Yoo
Joonghyuk was standing there blankly. His coat was crooked and he hadn't
washed himself but he couldn't hide his good looks.

"That person is 'evil. Still, he looks cool."

Delusional Demon Kim Namwoon muttered. I answered with a smile. "He
isn't too bad. He has good parts."

"Hah, you must be talking about someone else. That reminds me, how did
you end up as Yoo Joonghyuk's companion?"
Kim Namwoon watched me suspiciously and Lee Hyunsung spoke up. "I
heard that Dokja-ssi is from another world."

Maybe Han Sooyoung had talked about me. Kim Namwoon looked
surprised and pointed at me. "Different worlds? Like… parallel universes?"

"It is similar."

I admired the fact that Kim Namwoon knew about parallel universes when
he had no biology knowledge. Obviously, this round was different from the
round I remembered.

"That's why I haven't seen you so far. So? Why did you come here?"

"You're excited. Unfortunately, I can't tell you."

"Sheesh, then what am I doing in your world? Am I a leader?"

"You're dead."

Kim Namwoon's face paled again.

"I'm joking. You're building a gundam there. You are very happy."

"Gundam? Ohh…"

Lee Jihye came back and hit the back of Kim Namwoon's head. "Why are
you messing around? Pick up the items."

"Uh, uh."

I watched Kim Namwoon hurriedly picking up items after Lee Jihye and
thought. Maybe I shouldn't have killed him in the first scenario. Kim
Namwoon, who was following Lee Jihye and picking up items, turned to
me and whispered, "Excuse me. I have something to ask."

"What?"
"Can you lend me that coat for a minute?"

…What was I saying?

"I see you."

Kim Namwoon grumbled and started picking up the items again. Lee Jihye
nagged him and Lee Hyunsung chuckled.

It was a peaceful sight. In the midst of this peace, I was strongly reminded
of my world. There was no Jung Heewon here. No Yoo Sangah or Lee
Gilyoung.

…Yes, Han Myungoh as well. Thus, I had to go back.

Not long after, we collected all the items around us. I looked at the items I
collected and smiled. There it was. One of the five swords that were the key
to clear the 95th scenario. Perhaps Han Sooyoung knew that one of the
swords was in the vicinity.

However, I was surprised the moment I held the sword. "Excuse me,
Hyunsung-ssi."

"Huh?"

"Did Han Sooyoung tell you to collect this sword?"

Lee Hyunsung glanced at the sword in my hand and replied, "Oh, that's
right. We are looking for that sword."

The 95th scenario was a scenario where 'five swords' were the key. A
scenario where the sealed Apocalypse Dragon was released through the key
five swords. But this sword…

A sense of discomfort passed through my head. I looked up at the sky and
saw the Apocalypse Dragon's Sealing Ball heading this way. Sleeping
inside the dark sphere was the worst ruin dragon in Ways of Survival.
Originally, Yoo Joonghyuk was supposed to liberate the dragon and gain
the giant story 'Liberator of the Apocalypse Dragon', entering the final
scenario.

「 At this moment, Kim Dokja realized how to kill Yoo Joonghyuk. 」

The hand holding the hilt trembled.

「 In addition, Han Sooyoung was thinking exactly the same thing as him.
」




Throughout the day, Kim Dokja read Ways of Survival again and again. He
read the pages he had already read and checked if there were any lines he
missed. Kim Dokja seemed to find something. Or perhaps he didn't find it.
He looked down at his smartphone, grabbed his head several times and
even sighed. "…Noisy. Stop talking."

Sometimes, he scolded the Fourth Wall. In any case, Kim Dokja tried hard.
It was an effort to change something, an effort that perhaps no one would
understand.

Soon a small resolution filled Kim Dokja's eyes. It wasn't a resolution that
could accumulate in one or two days. It was a resolution that only a person
who had read a story for a long time could have.

With that resolution, Kim Dokja continuously read Ways of Survival. He
read, read and read it again.

How many times did he read? Kim Dokja's eyes, shining like stars, dimmed
little by little. Kim Dokja fell into a shallow sleep.
Yoo Joonghyuk stared at the scene with empty eyes. The back of the weary
Kim Dokja. A snoring sound came out at regular intervals.

There were very small sparks as Yoo Joonghyuk's eyes recovered. Killing
intent filled the blank eyes and this killing intent was aimed at precisely one
person. Yoo Joonghyuk quietly moved the Splitting the Sky Sword. He
didn't make a sound as he approached and aimed a sword at Kim Dokja's
neck.

「Ha ha do not do su ch a th ing. 」

Yoo Joonghyuk frowned. The Fourth Wall caused sparks to fly, as if going
to wake up Kim Dokja straight away. Yoo Joonghyuk sent a message to the
illusionary wall using Sound Transmission.

–Don't wake him up. I will cut off his head straight away if you do.

「Hu um. 」

The sparks produced by the Fourth Wall rapidly reduced. Yoo Joonghyuk
didn't remove the sword and the Fourth Wall drew characters in the air.

「 Wh at do you wa nt? 」

Yoo Joonghyuk didn't say anything. It seemed like he was finding his
words or he didn' know what to say. At this time, the Fourth Wall let out
bizarre laughter.

「 A ha, I under stand. 」

"…"

「 Are you cu rious? 」

Yoo Joonghyuk still didn't answer and the Fourth Wall laughed like it knew
everything. The letters of the Fourth Wall started to increase. Gold letters
soon filled the room. Yoo Joonghyuk stared at the letters drifting around
him and reached out for one of them. The letters seemed to respond to his
hand and started to speak.

「 "My name is Dokja." 」

「 I usually introduced myself to people like this and then the
following misunderstanding would occur. 」

It was the story of a world he had never experienced. The Fourth Wall
giggled.

「 Very in te res ting. 」

Yoo Joonghyuk quietly listened to the story. This last until the night was
deep and then the faint light of dawn was seen.

.

.

.

By the time the sleeping Kim Dokja woke up, Yoo Joonghyuk was leaning
against the wall with blank eyes.

"…I fell asleep, damn."

Kim Dokja stood up with dishevelled hair and picked up his smartphone
and sword. He looked out the window and saw the troops of the
headquarters that had already gathered. They were gathered to clear the
95th scenario. At the center of the party, Han Sooyoung in the white coat
was looking this way.

Today was the day that 'Incarnation Yoo Joonghyuk' would die.
             Chapter 295: Ep. 56 - Reader and Writer, I


It was noon when the march began. It was an army containing 200 elite
incarnations. As numerous constellations watched, Lee Hyunsung raised a
horn at the front of the army.

[The item 'Battlefield Horn' is activated!]

[The morale of the allies has increased significantly!]

[The attack power of the allies has increased slightly!]

As expected of Han Sooyoung. She had already prepared such
consumables.
Lee Hyunsung blew the horn once again and the incarnations cheered.
Everyone seemed excited.

Shin Yoosung glanced at me and spoke politely. "That… thank you for
saving me last time."
"Ah, yes. It was nothing."

Shin Yoosung smiled at my words. She was raised to be kind and polite,
unlike Kim Namwoon. I glanced to the side and saw Han Sooyoung making
an unknown smile.

…I don't think Shin Yoosung grew up like this because someone raised her.
Yoosung was originally a good kid.

"Kim Dokja-ssi is also participating in this scenario?"

"Nope. I'm not qualified."

"Ah yes… I'm sorry. I heard that we can get a giant story if we clear this
scenario."

I didn't feel regret. It would be great if I could acquire Liberator of the
Apocalypse Dragon here as the second giant story. However, this wasn't the
direction I wanted. The giant story I wanted was in the third round.

In the front, Lee Seolhwa was wiping sweat from Lee Hyunsung's forehead.
Lee Hyunsung smiled weakly.

"…I'm nervous. I don't know if we can do it well."

"It's going to be fine. We've done a good job so far."

I could hear Kim Namwoon and Lee Jihye's voices behind me.

"Hey, Lee Jihye. What will you do at the end of this scenario?"

"Well, it is clearing another scenario."

"How long will you only clear the scenario? Sometimes we need to have
some fun. Come play with me after this scenario is finished…"
Kim Namwoon was watching Lee Jihye's eyes while wearing the coat I lent
him. As I told him, gloves were on both hands. His hair was still white and
there were bandages wrapped around his arms…

Then thunder struck in the sky. The armies of the nebulae participating in
this scenario were approaching in the distance. They were nebulae I had
already encountered and nebulae I hadn't met.

Han Sooyoung's companions were strong enough but the number was
inadequate to deal with all the enemies. Han Sooyoung stepped towards
Lee
Hyunsung and declared. "We have only one objective. It is to liberate the
'dragon' sealed in the sphere."

Her white coat fluttered as Han Sooyoung kept speaking. "As you know,
liberation of the 'Apocalypse Dragon' will destroy the peninsula. However,
as long as we have completed the clear conditions, we can move onto the
next stage. Then no one on this earth will die."

The determination of the incarnations solidified at Han Sooyoung's
declaration and they shouted again. They chanted Han Sooyoung's name. It
was a somewhat familiar sight.

…All of this was once done by Yoo Joonghyuk.

The 95th scenario, the Second Coming of the Apocalypse Dragon. This was
a scenario to awaken the apocalypse dragon that was sealed at the time of
Eden's fall. It was accomplished by collecting five 'swords' scattered around
the world and plugging them into the keyhole of the seal.

In fact, Yoo Joonghyuk accomplished this scenario and gained the giant
story.

"Let's go to the next scenario!" Han Sooyoung shouted and the incarnation
army moved towards the sealed sphere. However, enemies could be seen
running from the other side.
[Take the sword! We must take the keys!]

[Over there! Han Sooyoung!]

They were the incarnations and constellations hiding all over the Korean
Peninsula. They wished to acquire the story by awakening the apocalypse
dragon.

"Stop them!"

The people beside me scattered and pulled out their weapons. Lee
Hyunsung, Lee Jihye and Shin Yoosung ran while emitting magic power.

"Hahahaha! Come! Abyss Dragon!"

Kim Namwoon was also jumping into the battlefield. His blackening
reached the peak. The Kim Namwoon of this world was different from the
Kim Namwoon I knew. Still, Kim Namwoon tearing all the enemies
approaching him was clearly the Delusional Demon I knew. I didn't know
what terrible things he had done to reach this point.

Then Han Sooyoung pulled out several swords. The star relics gave off a
brilliant light. They were the keys to be used to clear this scenario.

Four swords. They were still lacking one to complete the key.

"Kim Dokja. Give me your Arondight."

"…You knew?"

I smiled as I pulled out a sword. The Dragon Slayer Arondight. This was
the key to ending this scenario.

"Then send Yoo Joonghyuk to the seal." I stared at Han Sooyoung after
hearing her words. Han Sooyoung was smiling. "Didn't I say I would kill
him? Have you forgotten?"
I didn't like the look in her eyes. At this moment, I realized something.
"You killing Yoo Joonghyuk is the condition for your Outer World
Covenant."

Han Sooyoung's eyes flashed. "Yes."

"That's why you're fixated on Yoo Joonghyuk?"

"Quickly give me that sword."

The cold texture of Arondight was felt. In fact, I knew what Han Sooyoung
was going to do.

"Holy Sword Ascalon. Thunder Sword Gram. Dragon Sword Ridill. Old
Dragon Sword Næġling and the Dragon Slaying Sword Arondight."

I called out the names of the swords and Han Sooyoung's expression
strangely stiffened.

"There is one problem. One of the swords I just mentioned has a different
character."

"What are you doing now?"

"You're fooling the people."

"Don't talk nonsense."

"Let's go to the next scenario?"

I continued speaking, "Don't pretend. You don't want to clear this scenario."

Han Sooyoung's eyes shook. Her eyes were filled with something close to
madness. The four swords were shining white beside her. "Continue."

"You don't want to free the Apocalypse Dragon. It is actually the opposite.
You are going to seal this 'Earth' with the Apocalypse Dragon."
"Why do you think that?"

I pointed to an object in Han Sooyoung's hand. "You have Næġling. This
sword is the only 'sword' with a different attribute."

The five swords that made up the 95th scenario were all related to dragon
slaying stories. Only one sword, the 'Old Dragon Sword Næġling' was
different.

"That sword is a failed dragon slaying sword. If you use that sword as a
key, the seal won't be released. It is actually the opposite."

An improper key would strengthen the seal, not release it. The seal would
realize it wasn't yet time for liberation and become a bigger and stronger
barrier. It would soon cover the entire planet with a seal.

"The time here will stop and Earth will be sealed with the Apocalypse
Dragon. It will remain forever fixed in the 95th scenario."

I couldn't read the expression of Han Sooyoung, who had bowed her head. I
continued speaking,

"This is how you will kill Yoo Joonghyuk."

I looked back at Yoo Joonghyuk. Yoo Joonghyuk was watching me with
blank eyes. As long as there was his sponsor, Yoo Joonghyuk wouldn't die.
Once he died, he would return again and again. However…

What if there was eternal sleep in the world? An eternal sleep with no
dreams and no waking up. Such a thing was no different from 'death'.

"You have decided to seal Yoo Joonghyuk forever in this turn."

Yoo Joonghyuk would be trapped in the seal and fall into a sleep that no
one could wake up from. He wouldn't regress or suffer anymore. He would
fall asleep eternally and a new world line wouldn't be created.
This was the 'death' of Yoo Joonghyuk. It was the death of a regressor.

I turned and saw Han Sooyoung smiling faintly. "Better than expected.
How did you know? I never showed you exactly what my next plan was."

"You didn't show me."

I had seen Han Sooyoung's mind. I saw the world she dreamt and read the
information she had shown. Obviously, almost everything was perfect.
However, there was one crucial thing missing from the world.

"There were no signs of ■■ in your story."

The end of all the scenarios, ■■. However, not everyone reached ■■. Some
stories ended without even going near ■■.

Thunder was heard from the sky to the west. Rain started to fall from the
dark clouds. The voices of those shouting in the distance and the true voices
of the constellations engaged in battle came out. Lee Hyunsung, Lee
Seolhwa and Lee Jihye.

They were all desperate. It was in order to survive. Survive and go to the
next scenario. It was Han Sooyoung who brought them here.

"Is this the conclusion you came up with?"

Han Sooyoung was now trying to finish their story. "That's right. This is the
end of the world that I thought of."

"If it was going to end this way, why did you save everyone? Why stick
to such a perfect development?" Han Sooyoung didn't answer.

"You betrayed them."

If Han Sooyoung's plan succeeded, all of them would never reach the end.
They would fall asleep in the eternity of this 95th scenario.
Han Sooyoung stared at the four swords floating around her with
emotionless eyes. "The end of the world isn't necessarily bound to ■■. This
will make Earth safer. Neither Yoo Joonghyuk or the other constellations
will know how to unlock the reinforced seal of the apocalypse dragon."

"It is a deception."

"Some call it salvation."

"Then the companions who have trusted you so far―"

"In any case, this isn't a world that I made."

Tragically, I understood Han Sooyoung's mind. I wanted to return to the
original world because this world wasn't my world.

"Is this the price of the Outer World Covenant that you received? In
exchange for killing Yoo Joonghyuk, you will get the power to make your
own world?"

A powerful air started flowing from Han Sooyoung's body. She intended
not to waste any more time.

"Give me the sword, Kim Dokja. This is the best way for everyone. Yoo
Joonghyuk wanted it."

The plagiarist who wanted to go beyond the original probably knew. To go
beyond the original, you had to get out of the original. This was impossible
as long as she was a plagiarist.

I laughed. "I don't intend to kill Yoo Joonghyuk."

"What are you saying? Are you going to give up on the Outer World
Covenant?"

"Of course not."
As soon as I finished talking, Han Sooyoung moved.

"Yoo Joonghyuk, block it!" I called out and Yoo Joonghyuk stepped
forward to block Han Sooyoung's swords. I put away the shining Arondight
and pulled out another sword.

It was the Four Yin Demonic Beheading Sword. An item that cut off the
links between a constellation and incarnation. I focused my attention on the
sword as I stared at Yoo Joonghyuk.

[The star relic 'Four Yin Demonic Beheading Sword' is opening up its
power!]

Han Sooyoung's eyes widened as she confirmed the energy dwelling in the
sword. "Don't tell me you…"

Death had a variety of meanings in the Star Stream. For example, my fate
in the past.

"It is useless Kim Dokja! That method…!"

At that time, I died as 'Incarnation Kim Dokja' but 'Constellation Kim
Dokja' lived. Then what about Yoo Joonghyuk?

"Gabriel, Jophiel! Please help me!"

[The constellation 'Lily Blooming in Aquarius' is looking at you.]

[The constellation 'Commander of the Red Cosmos' is looking at you.]

I heard Han Sooyoung yelling but I didn't listen. My senses were
concentrated on a single black thread rising above Yoo Joonghyuk's head. It
was Yoo Joonghyuk's link that I could see using the Four Yin Demonic
Beheading Sword.
No one in Ways of Survival had ever tried this method. However, if I
succeeded… If I could break this link for even a moment, I might be able to
save Yoo Joonghyuk.

"Yoo Joonghyuk, keep your mind straight!"

Now Yoo Joonghyuk had a sufficient amount of stories to become a
constellation. If the connection was temporarily disconnected and he got a
new story from this scenario… he might be reborn as 'Constellation Yoo
Joonghyuk'.

It meant he would die as an 'incarnation'. This way, Yoo Joonghyuk might
not regress even if he died. I might be able to go back to the third round
without having to seal Yoo Joonghyuk. The power of a demon king and the
archangels' power was imbued in the Four Yin Demonic Beheading Sword.

The opponent was Yoo Joonghyuk's sponsor, whose identity was unknown.
This much power would be needed to break the link.

I swung the Four Yin Demonic Beheading Sword. Then I did it again. One
more time. Again and again, repeatedly striking.

The huge shockwaves from the link swept away the surrounding
constellations and incarnations. Han Sooyoung couldn't easily approach
through this storm.

How many times did I hit him? Finally, I heard a sound. It was the sound of
the Four Yin Demonic Beheading Sword breaking in half. I looked at Yoo
Joonghyuk's link that didn't have any scratches.

[The constellation 'Lily Blooming in Aquarius' is feeling an unknown fear.]

[The constellation 'Commander of the Red Cosmos' is astonished.]

At this moment, I felt the vast universe staring at me. I couldn't imagine the
origin or fathom the enormity.
[The sponsor of incarnation 'Yoo Joonghyuk' is looking at you.]
            Chapter 296: Ep. 56 - Reader and Writer, II


Along with the extreme dizziness, it felt like the entire history of my life
had been destroyed.

Yoo Joonghyuk's sponsor. I didn't know exactly who it was. It couldn't be
described or explained. I

could just see it. It was very powerful and pure. It was like the original
circle of desire.

A baby's laughter echoed in my ears and by the time I came to my senses,
half of the Four Yin Demonic Beheading Sword had fallen to the ground.

Yoo Joonghyuk's link wasn't broken. I had failed. I turned my head and saw
Han Sooyoung approaching me.

"Did you see it?" Han Sooyoung was making a strange smile. At her waist,
the Four Yin Demonic Beheading Sword was shaking just like mine.
"…You already tried it?"

"Of course. I tried it on a much larger scale than you. I borrowed the power
of a nebula."

Perhaps Han Sooyoung had confirmed the reality of his sponsor in a
method clearer than mine.

"What the hell is it?"

"Let's see? I don't know exactly. Still, don't you have a bit of a guess?"

I didn't answer. Han Sooyoung continued speaking, "Now your last plan
has failed. There is no other way."

"…"

"As I told you before, Yoo Joonghyuk agreed to this plan."

"Yoo Joonghyuk agreed?"

"You can read thoughts. Haven't you tried reading that guy's thoughts?"

There was a clanging sound as Yoo Joonghyuk hit Han Sooyoung's sword. I
watched Yoo Joonghyuk's back that was blocking the front of me.
Obviously, I could use Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint stage 2 on him now.
I hesitated for a moment before triggering the skill.

[The exclusive skill, 'Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint' has been activated!]

[Your understanding of this person is sufficient and the second stage of
Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint is activated!]

Yoo Joonghyuk's thoughts were heard in my head. Most of the words
floated in the air like dust because his consciousness was deeply sunken.
One or two fell beside me like snow and then there was a flood of heavy
snow.
.

.

「 I want to die. 」

「 I want to die.

」「 I want to die.

」

.

.

I was currently looking at the inner self of a human who was repressed in
the text of Ways of Survival.

Han Sooyoung approached me as I stood there idly. Her hair grazed my
chin as she reached into my coat and took out Arondight. Han Sooyoung
laughed as she finally collected five swords and stepped away from me.

Yoo Joonghyuk stood blankly. Once Han Sooyoung inserted all the swords,
Yoo Joonghyuk would be trapped forever. Then he would get what he
wanted. This was the ending of this world.

At this time, I heard something in my ear. It was a very small voice. It was
a very small voice among the countless voices.

I placed the broken Four Yin Demonic Beheading Sword on my shoulder
and ran towards the distant Han Sooyoung. Her coat was crumpled by the
strong grip and Han Sooyoung turned her head with a frown. "You still
want to come?"

I watched Yoo Joonghyuk. I heard it clearly. I was still listening.
「 I want to live. 」

It was very faint but it was a voice. He was clearly speaking. Han
Sooyoung threw off my hand in an irritated manner.

"Forget saying any good things. Yoo Joonghyuk has to die in order to
achieve what you and I want."

"You don't know what I want."

I grasped Unbroken Faith. The blade cried out and Han Sooyoung stepped
away from me with a hardened face.

"What the hell are you trying to do? There is no other way for you."

That's right. There was no way. The Outer World Covenant meant I had no
way to save Yoo Joonghyuk. There was no such thing in Ways of Survival
that I read all night.

"There is a way."

However, there was another way.

"Yoo Joonghyuk!"

At my shout, Yoo Joonghyuk ran like a lightning bolt and dealt a blow to
Han Sooyoung. In this short gap, Yoo Joonghyuk was able to take four
swords from Han Sooyoung.

Holy Sword Ascalon. Thunder Sword Gram. Dragon Sword Ridill. The
Dragon Slayer Arondight. They were all swords with dragon killing stories.
They were the key swords in this scenario.

"Now Yoo Joonghyuk! Free the apocalypse dragon!"

"What is this nonsense?!"
The angry Han Sooyoung rushed towards Yoo Joonghyuk. I bumped into
Han Sooyoung's body and rolled with her. Han Sooyoung kicked me while
shouting. "There are only four swords! You will never clear the scenario!"

"No, there is one more sword."

I pulled out a sword. The Grass-Cutting Sword. It was a sword obtained
from Yamata no Orochi in Peace Land. I used the Grass-Cutting Sword to
kill the shadow of Yamata no Orochi and it inherited the story of slaying a
dragon.

"Take it, Yoo Joonghyuk!" Yoo Joonghyuk received the sword that was
fired with Way of the Wind. Finally, all five dragon slaying swords were
gathered. Han Sooyoung shouted, "You crazy bastard…!"

There was a conflict between the 'status' that Han Sooyoung and I emitted. I
activated Electrification while pouring the blue-white energy towards Han
Sooyoung. Han Sooyoung was pushed by the magic power and exclaimed,
"Everyone, stop Yoo Joonghyuk!"

Han Sooyoung's shout caused the eyes of the scattered party members to
concentrate on Yoo Joonghyuk at the same time.

"I'll catch him!"

Kim Namwoon discovered Yoo Joonghyuk first and flew.

"Damn, I knew you were going to betray…!"

Lee Jihye and Lee Hyunsung belatedly came out. Three of the 100 most
powerful people in Ways of Survival ran towards Yoo Joonghyuk at once.

Han Sooyoung emitted a formidable aura and screamed at me. "Do you
know what you're doing now? If this scenario is cleared―"
Han Sooyoung's following words weren't heard. I watched Yoo
Joonghyuk's back as he headed towards the seal.

「 Kim Dokja thought about the third round Yoo Joonghyuk, who was
silently going through the scenarios. 」

The sword wielded by Lee Jihye cut at Yoo Joonghyuk's back.

「 He thought of Yoo Sangah and Han Sooyoung of the third round. 」

Lee Hyunsung grabbed Yoo Joonghyuk's wrist while Kim Namwoon aimed
the black flames at Yoo Joonghyuk's face.

「 He thought for a long time about Jung Heewon and the children, Lee
Gilyoung and Shin Yoosung. 」

Yoo Joonghyuk didn't back down. His coat was torn and he moved forward
while bleeding. Lee Jihye and Lee Hyunsung were swept away by the
Breaking the Sky Swordsmanship.

「 He thought of Lee Jihye who called him 'garbage' and Lee
Hyunsung, who lost his casings. 」 …I wanted to see it.

「 Thus Kim Dokja finally made up his mind. 」

I told Han Sooyoung, "I won't go back to the third round."

"What nonsense are you saying? You, now…"

"I will stay here and see the ending with the people here."

The end of this world wasn't the ending I wanted.

「 It might take a very long time. Maybe I will never be able to go back. 」

Even so, it was an ending.
"Secretive Plotter isn't the only outer god of this world. There will be
another way to go back. Clearing the scenario and moving towards the
end…"

"Don't talk nonsense! It doesn't matter what you do! You don't know the
end of this story anyway!"

"I don't know."

I spoke as I followed Yoo Joonghyuk soaring towards the sealing sphere.

"I'll create it myself."

Han Sooyoung leapt towards the sky and fired a black spear at Yoo
Joonghyuk's back. I threw myself in front of the spear instead. The shock
hurt but I didn't retreat. Han Sooyoung's eyes were filled with a completely
different killing intent.

"Shall we do it now?" Han Sooyoung directly threatened me.

[The constellation 'Director of the False Last Act' is looking at you.]

Laughter emerged. Like me, Han Sooyoung of this round didn't have a
sponsor. She was a constellation like me. She even held the same Unbroken
Faith in my hand.

Unbroken Faith shone with a black ether that was much stronger than mine.
The moment the black blade appeared in front of me, I used the Purest
Sword Force and blocked the blow. It was obviously blocked but the bones
of my hand were distorted from the impact.

Han Sooyoung's body started to divide. Avatar. Numerous clones leapt
towards Yoo Joonghyuk and I at the same time. I moved to stop them.
Jophiel's Unit 503 was qualified to stop the clones.

"Jophiel!"
However, Archangel Jophiel didn't answer. I could guess why. Perhaps she
didn't like my current choice. The archangels wanted to go back to the
original world.

The next moment.

[The story 'Person Who is Loved by an Archangel' is triggered!]

[The constellation 'Lily Blooming in Aquarius' feels favourable towards
you.]

Archangel Gabriel sent me an indirect message. At the same time, Gabriel's
Preference Scale was created in one hand.

[The constellation 'Lily Blooming in Aquarius' is looking at you.]

[The constellation 'Commander of the Red Cosmos' is confused.]

I didn't know why Gabriel chose to help me. The only thing I was certain of
was that I desperately needed her help. Han Sooyoung ran and shouted, "A
reader shouldn't disturb me. The owner of the story is a writer! The world
should end here!"

"You aren't the owner of this story either. That type of ending is only in
your world!"

I cut through dozens of avatars of Han Sooyoung and flew towards the dark
clouds. Two Unbroken Faiths met in the air. The ether of the divine nature
and ether of the dark nature clashed together and produced a strange tone.
Along with the powerful explosion, my Electrification was broken.

I rolled on the ground while covered in wounds, Most of Han Sooyoung's
avatars had disappeared but she was still going strong. As the angry Han
Sooyoung ran through the dust towards me, I shouted, "Go! Yoo
Joonghyuk!"
Yoo Joonghyuk's body leapt into the air and he finally reached the sealed
sphere.

[The five keys have been inserted in the sealing sphere.]

Han Sooyoung shouted, "No!"

Five swords were inserted into the huge sphere. There was the sound of the
keyhole being turned.

[Someone has released the 'Seal of the Apocalypse Dragon'.]

[The scenario clear conditions have been met.]

The sleeping dragon's power was awakening. The entire sky flickered like a
giant light bulb. The sky was half divided into night and day. I felt the
owner of a giant story waking up.

[Constellations of the nebula 'Olympus' are astonished.]

[Constellations of the nebula 'Vedas' have boarded their flagship.]
[Constellations of the nebula 'Papyrus' are wary.]

The messages of the nebulae were head as the shadow of the dragon
trapped in the sphere was revealed. I knew what would happen later.

Not long after, the apocalypse dragon roared and swung its tail towards the
constellations in the distant Star Stream. A third of the night sky
disappeared. Maybe, if they were really unlucky―

「 Kim Dokja. 」

I turned my head and saw Yoo Joonghyuk holding the Splitting the Sky
Sword beside me. He didn't seem to care if this scenario was cleared or not.
The moment we made eye contact, I got goosebumps.
…Since when had the regression depression been released? The two eyes
were staring at me with a clear awareness. That bastard asked me.

「 The world that you showed, does it really exist? 」
           Chapter 297: Ep. 56 - Reader and Writer, III


I couldn't find an answer to Yoo Joonghyuk's question. I didn't understand
exactly what he meant. Then I heard it once again through Omniscient
Reader's Viewpoint.

「 Does the world where you live really exist? 」

Then I realized what Yoo Joonghyuk was talking about. He had seen the
world I lived.

「 Hi hi. 」

The Fourth Wall was laughing mischievously. The moment I was going to
open my mouth, Han Sooyoung ran and struck my back, pressing me
against the ground. "Yoo Joonghyuk! Didn't you promise me?"

Anger was contained in Han Sooyoung's voice. "You will die here and I
will get a new world. That was the condition of our exchange. Why did
you do this?" I could feel the taste of the soil as my lips touched the
ground.

「 Kim Dokja was thinking about his future plans. 」

Once again, I didn't know what Yoo Joonghyuk felt through my memories.
However, looking at his attitude, I didn't think he would give up on this life.
A terrible cry came from the top of the sealing sphere.

[Uwaaaah…]

[Everyone flee! Quickly escape from this scenario!]

The astonished constellations were escaping one by one from the scenario.
Even the nebulae in the sky were being bitten by the dragon. The
apocalypse was indeed such an existence. The decisive cause of Eden's
destruction, the worst disaster of the Star Stream.

In the midst of this, Han Sooyoung shouted at Yoo Joonghyuk. "Is it
because of this guy?"

Han Sooyoung grabbed my head and screamed. "Did this guy do something
to your spirit? Didn't you want to die so badly? Aren't you tired? Don't you
want to stop performing scenarios?"

Every word spoken by Han Sooyoung seemed to pierce my chest. Yoo
Joonghyuk had no expression but I knew the life he lived. Yoo Joonghyuk
of the 1863rd round was the Yoo Joonghyuk of the original novel that I
knew.

When my mother was locked up in prison, when I was bullied, when I sat
the CSATs, when I went to the army and when I joined the company. It was
the Yoo Joonghyuk I had always been watching. The Yoo Joonghyuk who
was cold, calculating and never gave up.
I have lived watching such a Yoo Joonghyuk. I could live because of him.
Thus, I didn't want to let him die.

If Yoo Joonghyuk died here, the Ways of Survival that I knew would
disappear forever.

Yoo Joonghyuk slowly opened his mouth.

"I want to die."

It was a clear voice but there was a voice only clear to me.

「 I want to live. 」

My hand tightly gripped the ground. Han Sooyoung shouted, "Then why
did you do this? Shit, why are you still alive?"

"…"

"Somehow replace the apocalypse dragon's seal. Draw the sword and do it
somehow!"

Han Sooyoung knew there was no possibility. Han Sooyoung was
collapsing. Her world that she expected through the 'Predictive Plagiarism'
was collapsing for the first time.

Yoo Joonghyuk didn't answer. Han Sooyoung couldn't overcome her
emotions as she threw me away and ran towards Yoo Joonghyuk.

The blade of Unbroken Faith moved to Yoo Joonghyuk's neck. In the end,
Han Sooyoung couldn't cut Yoo Joonghyuk.

"Dammit…!" Han Sooyoung's blade stopped as it touched Yoo Joonghyuk's
neck.

Han Sooyoung also knew. If she killed Yoo Joonghyuk, he would only
regress. I stood up and told her, "Give up, Han Sooyoung
"Shut up!"

"You have failed. Now you need to find a new way."

"Shut up! What do you know? The things I did to get this far―"

Yoo Joonghyuk looked at the blade touching his neck and spoke. "I want to
die."

「 I want to live. 」

"I want to finish it here."

「 If there is a chance, like the world I saw… 」

Yoo Joonghyuk's body shook. It was shaking violently from two different
egos clashing. The pain seemed to be getting worse as Yoo Joonghyuk
grabbed his head and slowly sank down. The surprised Han Sooyoung
stepped back as a powerful shock wave burst from Yoo Joonghyuk's body.

Han Sooyoung's body flew towards me and I rolled across the ground.

Stories were flowing from Yoo Joonghyuk's body. The memories of the
1863rd Yoo Joonghyuk revolved in the air, floating past me and Han
Sooyoung. In the memories, Yoo Joonghyuk spoke.

「 Han Sooyoung, find a way to kill me." 」

Then the Han Sooyoung in the memory nodded.

「 "Okay. Instead, promise me. You will help me." 」

The promise between the two people that I didn't know about before. The
seemingly perfect 1863rd turn was based on the sacrifice of a single person.
In this round, Yoo Joonghyuk lost everything.
「 "If you carry out my plan, I can't save your sister." 」

He lost his sister.

「 "I can't save the Breaking the Sky Sword Saint and Breaking the
Sky Master. There is no time for the First Murim." 」 He lost his
teacher.

「 "Become the enemy of the world. That way, all who are hostile to you
can unite." 」

Through his own will, he became the evil of this world. In the 1863rd
round, Yoo Joonghyuk was unhappy. He was more unfortunate than any
round.

I shouted through clenched teeth, "Yoo Joonghyuk!"

I didn't know what to say. I could understand the mind of Yoo Joonghyuk
who wanted to die but I still forced him to live. It was just because of my
words.

Then what was right?

Yoo Joonghyuk asked, 「 The world that you showed, does it really exist?
」

I didn't know if saying this would be comforting to Yoo Joonghyuk. I cried
out with all my strength.

[It exists.]

This was the only thing I could convey to him. It was in a place that he
couldn't see or hear but it definitely existed. Then Yoo Joonghyuk
answered, 「 …I see. 」
Strangely, at this moment, Yoo Joonghyuk's expression looked
comfortable.

「 You can go back to that world if I die? 」

"No, that isn't it. Somehow, I'll find a way. You don't have to die. It might
take some time but somehow…!"

I quickly summarized the information in his head. The best possible
future was drawn in my head. The world of the third round had Yoo
Sangah and Han Sooyoung and would be safe until I returned. In the
1863rd round, the 95th scenario was already cleared. There were plenty
of people who survived so if I struggled for three or five years here… I
looked up and saw Yoo Joonghyuk looking this way.

「 Then it is late. 」

It was as if he knew everything.

「If you are here, you can't save that world. 」

The moment I wanted to refute it, Yoo Joonghyuk stood up. The vibrations
from Yoo Joonghyuk were becoming bigger and more than one of him
seemed to be seen.

[The character 'Yoo Joonghyuk' has reached the moment of attribute
evolution!]

[The character 'Yoo Joonghyuk' has received a new attribute!]

Yoo Joonghyuk split apart with a bright light and glanced at me.

「 I was curious about the world's ■■. 」

A story overflowed and Yoo Joonghyuk was split into two people. I knew
this skill.
Avatar. A skill that only a person with the 'author' attribute could use. Until
recently, it was Han Sooyoung's exclusive skill.

"Yoo Joonghyuk! Y-You…!" Han Sooyoung's shoulders shook as she
opened her mouth. Her real confusion was conveyed through Omniscient
Reader's Viewpoint.

「 What if a person's presence could be divided exactly in half? 」

Tens of thousands of Han Sooyoungs were talking.

「 If one entity is divided into two exact and separate entities, which one of
them can be called real? 」

A chill went down my spine. The memories of Han Sooyoung in the 1863rd
round. Her figure, which was precisely divided into two, crossed my head
like a panorama. It was Han Sooyoung's experience and also Yoo
Joonghyuk's experience.

Yoo Joonghyuk split into two in a brilliant manner and faced each other.
Yoo
Joonghyuk said, "I want to die."

Then the other Yoo Joonghyuk opened his mouth. "I…"

The other Yoo Joonghyuk didn't talk but looked down at his ragged black
coat. He threw his coat to the ground.

"I want to live."

The white coat worn by the collapsed Kim Namwoon had fallen to the
ground. It was the Infinite Dimension Space Coat I lent him. Yoo
Joonghyuk picked it up and wore it. The white coat fitted to his body like it
was made for him from the beginning.

The Yoo Joonghyuk in a white coat confronted the one in a black coat.
"There is only one way."

The two Yoo Joonghyuks pointed their Heaven Shaking Swords at each
other.

[The sponsor of incarnation 'Yoo Joonghyuk' is looking at his incarnation.]

The party members were shouting in a confused manner.

"W-What are you doing?"

"Why did you suddenly become two?"

In the air, the energy of Breaking the Sky Swordsmanship and Breaking the
Sky Swordsmanship hit each other.

"Oh my god, that guy…"

Only Han Sooyoung had the same thoughts as me.

「 One being becomes two. 」

「 However, there is only one sponsor behind the two of them. 」

This was the answer that Yoo Joonghyuk found. I shouted at him. "Stop,
Yoo Joonghyuk! I said stop!"

The method to send me back to the third round and clear this scenario. How
to die yet continue living at the same time.

"No matter which one survives, the other will regress!"

The two Yoo Joonghyuks ignored my call.

「 I will die. 」

「 I will regress. 」
Yoo Joonghyuk knew it. He knew it very well yet he chose this method.

「 The story ends here. 」

「 Once again, everything will start from the beginning. 」

There was an end to this world that neither Han Sooyoung or I knew. The
black coat was pierced by the Splitting the Sky Sword. It was exactly half
his memories. The numerous memories accumulated by Yoo Joonghyuk
scattered in the air.

The stigma 'regression' could only be activated on one side. Thus, I could
see it. The black coat Yoo Joonghyuk was the one who chose to die.

[The incarnation 'Yoo Joonghyuk' has died.]

On the opposite side was the Yoo Joonghyuk in the white coat. Yoo
Joonghyuk killed himself with his own hands. However, he was also
stabbed. The Splitting the Sky Sword pierced his belly. The speed was slow
but he was also dying.

[The sponsor of incarnation 'Yoo Joonghyuk' is looking at his incarnation.]

[The stigma 'Regression Lv. ???' has been activated!]

[Incarnation 'Yoo Joonghyuk' has accepted the intention of his sponsor.]

Even so Yoo Joonghyuk didn't die. He would open his eyes in the darkness
and appear in the subway of the 1864th round, starting everything once
again.

「 This is a reward for showing your world. 」

Some stories flowed from the fingertips of Yoo Joonghyuk in the white
coat and reached me.

[The stories of the character 'Yoo Joonghyuk' have been given to you.]
I approached Yoo Joonghyuk. The person who protected my youth was
disappearing into a world I didn't know.

「 The next round… 」

Yoo Joonghyuk's figure started to scatter. I didn't hear any more of Yoo
Joonghyuk's thoughts through Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint. Omniscient
Reader's Viewpoint no longer worked for him.

[This person isn't a 'character'.]

Yoo Joonghyuk's appearance was fading into the light of this world. By the
time I staggered towards him, Yoo Joonghyuk had already disappeared
from the world. I looked back and saw Han Sooyoung sitting down with a
despairing face.

[You have cleared the criteria of the Outer World Covenant.]

The dazzling light filled the air like ashes, revealing a pale reality. In it,
Yoo Joonghyuk was walking towards a world we didn't know.
             Chapter 298: Ep. 56 - Reader and Writer, IV


Yoo Joonghyuk died.

[The 'Fourth Wall' is shaking violently.]

It didn't feel real.

[The 'Fourth Wall' is severely shaking!]

[The exclusive skill, 'Fourth Wall' is strongly activated!]

I couldn't breathe from the horror that filled my lungs. Why did Yoo
Joonghyuk suddenly get the 'writer' attribute and why did he choose to die
or regress? I seemed to know but it was hard to understand. There was no
more of the original Yoo Joonghyuk that I knew. Only a handful of stories
proved his absence.

…I felt like this.
「 This is a novel. It is a story in a novel. 」

I slowly inhaled and breathed out again.

「 Yoo Joonghyuk escaped from being a character. 」

I got tinnitus and my heart beat like crazy. I once again breathed in and out.

[The exclusive skill, 'Fourth Wall' is activated more strongly!]

My senses slowly returned and the murmurs of the party members were
heard.

"…What happened?"

"Didn't you just hear? The scenario is cleared!"

I slapped my cheeks twice and raised my head as I felt the status of the
apocalypse dragon flowing from the seal.

[The nebula 'Olympus' is preparing the battlefield for the Apocalypse
Dragon.]

[The nebula 'Vedas' is preparing for the disaster.]

[The nebula 'Tamna'…]

If my prediction was correct, there was still time. I shouted towards the
party members scattered all over the place. "Everyone gather together. I
have a story to tell."

The party members gathered around me despite their wariness. Someone
was supporting the fallen Han Sooyoung while Kim Namwoon and Lee
Jihye showed strong hostility towards me.

"After a while, the Apocalypse Dragon will be released. In relation to
that―"
"Shut up! What were you doing earlier? You and Yoo Joonghyuk joined
together to attack Master!" Lee Jihye screamed as she aimed her blade at
my neck. Then Lee Hyunsung muttered, "Dokja-ssi, that thing…"

"Captain! What about this jerk? Should I take care of him?"

Kim Namwoon filled his hands with the black flames. Han Sooyoung
shook her head. "…Everybody, listen to him."

"Huh?"

"Listen to him."

Han Sooyoung's eyes were open but the empty pupils proved that he gave
up everything. Han Sooyoung resembled me. She might look like this on
the surface but she already understood the situation in her head. Maybe she
was thinking about the next plan.

I looked around at the party members. Lee Hyunsung, Kim Namwoon, Lee
Seolhwa, Lee Jihye, Shin Yoosung…

The people who survived the 1863rd round. I could've told them the truth
about Han Sooyoung. Han Sooyoung was using you. In order to make a
new world, she wanted to end your story here. Even so, I couldn't say it.

"Everybody, take care of the captain. Don't jump to rash conclusions. Listen
to Dokja-ssi."

It was because they were seriously following Han Sooyoung. The group's
hostility towards me was dampened by Lee Hyunsung's words.

I started the story. "The liberation of the apocalypse dragon isn't over when
the seal is released. You might not know it but the end of this scenario…"

I looked up at the sky. The other party members also looked up with me.
The sealing sphere was crumpled. The fragments of the seal were breaking
little by little. As time went on, the density of the sky was becoming
thicker.

I relied on the Fourth Wall and spat out empty words. "Go back to the
headquarters and prepare for the next scenario. Maybe there will be three
days left."




I could immediately leave the 1863rd round. However, I couldn't do this
because the characters in this turn were people I liked.

I earned some time from the liberation of the apocalypse dragon by using
the Grass-Cutting Sword as the last key. It was lacking a bit of status to be
used as a key, slightly delaying the release of the apocalypse dragon.

I had to use this time wisely. Now that Han Sooyoung had chosen this
route, the destruction of at least one nebula was determined. The most
important thing was to avoid Earth being destroyed.

The next day, I handed Lee Hyunsung a considerable amount of
information. They were all plans that I had mapped out beforehand. From
avoiding the disaster of the apocalypse dragon to gaining new stories and
items. I also handed over the list of the strongest people.

Lee Hyunsung listened to my story from beginning to end and suddenly
looked up. "…How does Dokja-ssi know all of this?"

"It is the reason why Han Sooyoung knows."

I tried to avoid unnecessary explanations but Lee Hyunsung's expression
was unusual. Lee Hyunsung hesitated for a long time before saying
something unexpected. "Is Dokja-ssi a 'plagiarist writer?'"
"…Plagiarist writer?"

"You… aren't? I'm sorry."

I was filled with confusion. "Did Han Sooyoung talk about her attributes?"

"Ah, well…"

Lee Hyunsung scratched his head with a troubled expression. I couldn't
believe it. The prideful and selfish Han Sooyoung showed her original
attribute? Why?

"Everyone get out."

I was just thinking this when the door to the situation room opened and
someone entered. It was Han Sooyoung who was wearing a hat deep over
her face.

"Yes, I understand." Lee Hyunsung bowed, packed up and went out of the
room. The only ones left in the room were Han Sooyoung and me.

Since I cleared my Outer World Covenant, it must be the same for Han
Sooyoung. In such circumstances, there was no reason for her to show
hostility to me.

"Your mental state seems better."

"Shut up." Han Sooyoung answered as she folded her arms and sat down on
the chair. I asked, "Why are you complaining?"

"Complaining? Is that what you're calling it? Thanks to you, all the people
here might die."

I saw the party members waiting outside the room for us. The people
gathered outside the transparent wall were talking with serious expressions.
It was probably because of Han Sooyoung's desperate expression shortly
after Yoo Joonghyuk's death. I stated, "It is better to go to the next scenario
than fall asleep forever."

Outside the window, Lee Hyunsung met my gaze and smiled faintly. Lee
Hyunsung knew that Han Sooyoung was a plagiarist. Maybe Lee Hyunsung
knew that Han Sooyoung would abandon them. He was bear-like but he had
a deep heart. Lee Hyunsung might've predicted that this would happen.
Nevertheless, he decided to follow Han Sooyoung.

I continued speaking, "It isn't over when the apocalypse dragon is released.
Don't you also know?"

Han Sooyoung bowed her head and didn't answer. The apocalypse dragon
that was gradually being freed from the seal. Once freed, there would be a
disaster in the Star Stream. This didn't mean that all future scenarios would
end.

In fact, in the 1863rd round, Yoo Joonghyuk freed the apocalypse dragon
and saw the end of the scenario.

"Explain it to the members. Everything you did and everything you hid. It
might not be a perfect development but there is a way to do it."

"…"

"There are still many places where you can borrow power. Anna Croft's
Zarathustra, the Seekers of the End, the Transcendent King and 'the person'
who lives on the reincarnation planet…"

"I told you to shut up." Han Sooyoung looked up and glared at me. The
prideful eyes glared at me from below the hat. By the way…something was
strange.

Han Sooyoung's eyes were swollen. As I stared at her face, Han Sooyoung
growled and pressed her hat lower.
I didn't like Han Sooyoung of the 1863rd round. Even so, I could
understand Han Sooyoung. The world that she wanted to make was a bit
like the world I dreamt of.

Han Sooyoung spoke through gritted teeth. "Yoo Joonghyuk became an
'author."

"Why did he suddenly get such an attribute?"

"I guess he wanted to write a new story in a very sincere manner. That is
the condition to opening the 'author' trait."

I could understand but also didn't understand. A world that couldn't
complete the round but was struggling to survive… Yoo Joonghyuk went
out of it in order to write his own story.

Han Sooyoung didn't speak but we could clearly see what the other was
thinking. Han Sooyoung raised her head, took off her hat and lit a cigarette.

I asked, "How about a question and answer exchange? Don't use the system
because it is annoying."

Han Sooyoung smoked with an emotionless face. "Lies are included?"

"Okay."

"You first."

I nodded. "Who do you think is the author of Ways of Survival?"

Han Sooyoung once again sucked in smoke and blew it out. Then she
replied, "A very big baby."

"…Baby?"

"In a world without scenarios, only the desire to see the next story… a baby
with a terrible imagination."
Something came to my mind. A world without scenarios. There was only
one such world in this Star Stream.

"Don't tell me…"

"You better not say it with your mouth." Han Sooyoung pointed at the sky.
"It might be listening."

I closed my mouth. It wasn't impossible if that 'existence' was really the
writer. However…

My head was in a complicated state as I told Han Sooyoung, "It's your turn.
Ask."

"I'm thinking, please wait."

"…There isn't much time so ask me quickly. I'm leaving tomorrow
morning."

"Tomorrow morning?"

"I have fulfilled the Outer World Covenant and need to go back to my
original world."

Han Sooyoung frowned slightly. "You are finished and you're going to
throw us away? That's great. My world is ruined…"

"Everything I know was handed to Lee Hyunsung. They can proceed to the
end without any other help."

I thought as I glanced at the people outside the situation room. From the
beginning, this world was 'their world'. I asked, "When are you going to
leave?"

"Leave?"

"You have also fulfilled the Outer World Covenant."
I wasn't the only one to finish the Outer World Covenant. Yoo Joonghyuk
had died and Han Sooyoung fulfilled his mission. She would now leave to
complete her 'world' with the help of Secretive Plotter.

"Han Sooyoung?"

Han Sooyoung stared at the floor and replied, "I'm not going."
            Chapter 299: Ep. 56 - Reader and Writer, V


"What?"

"I won't go."

It was an unexpected answer so I looked like a fool. "Why?"

"Without me, they will all die."

I doubted my ears. I couldn't believe that Han Sooyoung could talk like this.
My voice involuntarily became louder and aggressive.

"Didn't you want to make your own world?"

"…I can make my world later. Somebody has to lead them."

"Why all of a sudden…"
"Yoo Joonghyuk is no longer a character. What do you think that

means?" I closed my mouth.


"It is no longer a novel."

My heart pounded at Han Sooyoung's words.

[The exclusive skill 'Fourth Wall' is strongly activated!]

"It isn't about being forgiven for everything. No matter how the
developments flow, we should end the story properly."

Han Sooyoung's face couldn't be seen properly because of the brim of her
hat. Before my words finished, Han Sooyoung left the situation room. I saw
Han Sooyoung talking to the people outside the situation room. I kept
watching.




Before leaving, there were a few things that needed to be addressed. One of
them was Uriel.

I looked down at the confined Uriel doll. She was currently in a state of
calm but once the confinement was over, Uriel would wake up again as the
Angel of Flames. She would burn all living things around her.

Gabriel's true voice entered my ears. [What are you going to do with
Uriel?]

"I am thinking."
I looked down at Gabriel who was waving her helplessly drooping petals.
Perhaps she was shocked by the situation here. According to the original
setting, Gabriel was someone who took good care of other angels.

[I'll stay.]

"It isn't possible."

[Why? Is it because I betrayed this place?]

I didn't answer. Gabriel acted like it was unfair.

[Why did I betray Eden?]

"It must've been an unavoidable decision for you."

[Tell me the details accurately. What happened? You know something!]

"I don't know exactly. If you are curious, go back and talk to Metatron."

It wasn't good for me to intervene in this thing. There was a possibility that
the development of the third round could find unexpected difficulties
because of misinterpreted information. Gabriel's leaves trembled.

[If I go back, won't I betray Eden again? Then I would rather remain
here―]

"The future can change. We have to go back." I spoke with confidence.
This world wasn't our world. [Then Uriel…!]

"I told you, I'm thinking."

For now, the best option was to leave Uriel to Han Sooyoung. However, I
wasn't sure if she could control the Archangel of Flames.

「 The Fourth Wall is saying, "Do you want me to come out?" 」
There was a way to tell Uriel the story of the third round. However, as I
said many times, there was no guarantee that Uriel would hear the story and
react like Yoo Joonghyuk. Perhaps the story of my world line might further
ruin Uriel's insecure spirit.

Still, there might be a bigger problem if I really left Gabriel here.
Moreover, Gabriel couldn't use Confinement of Good and Evil… I would
also like to stay a bit longer and help Uriel…

[I will stay, Gabriel.]

The petals of the red cosmos swayed. I reflexively bowed my head and the
startled Gabriel shouted, […Jophiel?]

[It is best that I stay.]

It was an unexpected declaration. Even I was stunned. It wasn't another
archangel. Jophiel was declaring to stay here?

[I decided after careful consideration. I can control Uriel through
Confinement of Good and Evil. Thus, it is right for me to stay here.]

"Jophiel, if you don't return to the original world now, you might never be
able to return."

[There are a few ways to cross world lines.]

"I know but they all require a tremendous price."

[It doesn't matter if I can't go back.]

[Jophiel!]

Jophiel didn't back down despite Gabriel's cry.

[This world line also has value. I don't want to depend on this insidious guy
but I think it is better to find out more about this world. I have an obligation
to find out why the Eden here was destroyed, what things will happen in the
future and to inform the original world.]

Jophiel's remark was reasonable. This world was very different from the old
1863rd round and it would certainly help if information could be sent to the
third round.

[Wait, Jophiel! Why are you making this decision―]

[There is no turning back Gabriel.]

A gleam of light emerged from the red cosmos and this turned into a white
light that bound the white lily. It was Confinement of Good and Evil.

Gabriel's petals drooped like he fell asleep. Jophiel told me. [Please look
after Gabriel.]

"Why are you doing this?"

[Uriel needs Gabriel. And Gabriel… both of them are unstable.]

I thought like Archangel Jophiel. Eden was a nebula made up of archangels.

"Then you?"

[I don't believe in you but I have one thing to ask.]

I hesitated before nodding.

[After returning to the original world line, please visit Eden. Then I hope
you can tell the scribe what happened here. Can you do that?]

"I understand."

Certainly, it wasn't a difficult request. I was already planning to visit Eden.
Soon after, Jophiel's cosmos flower drooped. It was a seemingly sleepy and
tired appearance. I changed the water bottles of the two flowers.

Someone was left and someone was leaving. No matter what was chosen,
everyone would eventually reach their end.




The next morning, I was sent off by the party members. Many things had
happened but the party members said they would send me off. To be
precise, it was Lee Hyunsung who said it.

I turned my head and saw Han Sooyoung staring at me with her unique
disgruntled face. I handed her a wrinkled notebook. Han Sooyoung bluntly
wondered, "…What is this rubbish?"

"The information you need now."

I had selected a few more pieces of information that would be useful for the
1863rd round from Ways of Survival.

Sparks rose around Han Sooyoung's body. I vaguely knew its identity. The
sparks were related to Han Sooyoung's identity as a 'character'.

"Don't throw it away and look at it whenever you have time."

Han Sooyoung stared down at the notebook I gave her and asked, "…Is this
okay?"

"What?"

[The Fourth Wall is strongly activated!]
Han Sooyoung stared at me carefully as if reading something on my
fate. Then she shook her head. "No, it's nothing. Never mind." …She
was unreliable.

Lee Hyunsung listened to the conversation and opened his mouth. "It
would've been nice if we couldn't carried out the scenario together. It is
unfortunate."

Lee Hyunsung, who became close to me, said goodbye first and then Kim
Namwoon stared at me.

"Bah, get lost. Give my best regards to the me over there."

Of course, it wouldn't happen. I had to go to the next world to speak to Kim
Namwoon of the third round.

The moment I finished the goodbyes and was turning around.

"Hey."

Something with a soft weight came flying towards my back. I hurriedly
turned my head and grabbed it. A white coat was caught. It was the Infinite
Dimension Space Coat.

"Didn't you never get a clear reward? Take this."

It was the coat that Han Sooyoung was wearing. I was dumbfounded.
"Coming to the 95th scenario and only getting something like this―"

Han Sooyoung looked at me like I was pathetic. Then a thought crossed my
mind. This bastard, don't tell me? I placed my hands in my pocket with a
bemused expression and Han Sooyoung asked, "The

question I didn't ask yesterday, can I finish it now?"

"…Speak."
"Why did you say you wouldn't go back to the third round?"

It was an unexpected question. Han Sooyoung continued to ask. "You are
playing my part over there… if you didn't go back, that world would've
perished. You should know this so why―"

"Let's see… why?"

"What?"

"Even without me, the third round would've been fine for a long time."

"How can you be sure?" Han Sooyoung stared at me suspiciously.

"You are there."

Han Sooyoung's expression slightly hardened at my words. Her eyes were
shaking with vague surprise.

"I believe in the you of the third round."

Han Sooyoung stared at me for a moment before turning her head away.
"Quickly get lost. I don't want to see you anymore."

"I'm going. Stay alive and well."

I looked up at the sky.

[The constellation 'Demon King of Salvation' is looking at the night sky.]

[Secretive Plotter! Please fulfil the contents of the covenant.]

A new portal was created under my feet. It felt like something was pulling
at me as the world started to collapse. The world of the 1863rd round was
becoming dim.
A world different from the original that I knew. It was a short time but I felt
that many things had changed.

Lee Hyunsung waved while the others sent me off with complicated
expressions. Just like Yoo Joonghyuk did and I did, they would walk
through a world different from the original that I knew.

Maybe someday, our worlds might be able to meet one another. However,
even if we couldn't meet again, there was no doubt that the world existed.
Just like Ways of Survival was to me.

The world was dark. I felt dizzy while hearing the voice of an outer god.

[ On ly the sto ry with out a be gin ning or end will re main. ]

The ground disappeared and I was sucked into the portal. The
metaphysically distorted pathways narrowed and expanded several times.

I closed my eyes and let my body flow in an unmeasurable passage of time.
I shouldn't have been gone for too long from the third round.

After a while, I fell to the ground with a loud sound.

[The Outer World Covenant has been completed!]

[The compensation will be settled.]

To be precise, it wasn't the ground. It was the galaxy of the Star Stream that
I had seen before. My body was floating in the emptiness of the universe. I
groaned and saw the hem of a black cloak dragging against the ground.

[ You came. ]

It was Secretive Plotter.
