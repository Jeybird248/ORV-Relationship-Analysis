200: Ep. 38 - Fake Revolutionary, II


Duke Syswitz' office. The demon earl Silocke was standing in front of it
with an anxious heart. It was because the earl 'Han' was guarding the office
like a gatekeeper.

'Han'.

No one knew what his real name was. Everyone just called him Han. He
was an 'earl' like Silocke but he was a very unusual fellow. It was because
he was in touch with Asmodeus of the 32nd Demon Realm. Maybe Duke
Syswitz kept him around because he was aware of this fact.

Silocke felt inwardly strained and finally opened his mouth. "I have
something to say to the duke."

"Tell me. I will let him know."

"It is difficult."
"The duke is currently in an emergency meeting with the Gilobat envoy."
"When will it finish?"

"I don't know."

Silocke clicked his tongue. If he told this guy, Han would clearly take all
the credit. Thus, Silocke replied, "It's fine. It isn't urgent so I will wait."
Han's eyebrows twitched at the words. Silocke liked seeing this expression.

'Son of a bitch, keep wondering'.

The information that Silocke reported was simple.

–A civilian presumed to be a marquis of Gilobat has appeared in public.

Of course, it wasn't bad to say this but the more he thought about it, the
stranger things seemed. Silocke thought for a moment before staring closely
at the duke's office.

"Is a marquis from Gilobat inside there?"

"Yes."

"He must've come straight here without going anywhere else."

"That is the case."

Silocke felt delighted at the reply.

'Indeed, my guess is correct'.

He didn't know for certain but there shouldn't be two marquis in the Gilobat
delegation. A marquiS-grade should be the leader of the delegation. It was
very likely that the citizen he met wasn't a marquis of Gilobat and was
pretending to be a demon noble.
This alone was worth reporting. It might not be big but it would help with
his performance review.

Han saw the hesitating Silocke and opened his mouth. "Since you are
wandering around, you must also be wondering who the next demon king
will be."

"Ah, well… That's right."

It was a misunderstanding but it wasn't a bad idea to ask about this
misunderstanding.

"Is it because of the rumours of the demon king emerging that the Gilobat
delegation came to visit?"

"I can't tell you more but it is similar."

"The story of the demon king, it is a bit funny… don't you think so?"

The source of the rumours was unknown yet these rumours shook the entire
73rd Demon Realm.

Silocke inwardly found this situation laughable.

Syswitz.

Gilobat.

Melledon.

Bercan.

For the past few hundred years, the 73rd Demon Realm had been properly
balanced by these four dukes. The peace that had been maintained for
hundreds of years was now shaking because of a rumour. It was a story
without any realism.
However, Han didn't agree with Silocke's words. "The signs of the 'demon
king' are already appearing."

"What? How do you know that?"

"I heard that Vedas has joined hands with the Melledon Industrial
Complex."

"Vedas?"

It was a name that Silocke was familiar with. No, it would be strange if he
didn't know it. It was one of the names that must be known in order to
safely live in the Star Stream.

Thus, Silocke couldn't help feeling astonished. "…The nebulae are moving
directly?"

"To be precise, one of the narrative-grade constellations from Vedas has
been in contact with Melledon."

The constellations and demon kings' enmity was famous in the Star Stream.
Now the constellations were interfering with the affairs of the 73rd Demon
Realm. The scale wasn't big but things would spiral out of control if it was
really a nebula.

"The nebulae are interested. Does this mean the demon king will really
appear…?"

Silocke muttered with a slightly dazed expression. This was a demon king.
Silocke had been living in the Demon Realm for a long time and it didn't
really sink in.

However, at least one thing was known.

"…This is why the duke is so busy."

"He is currently the closest person to becoming the demon king."
It was clear that one of the demon nobles would become the demon king.
Look at the cases of the other 72 demon kings. It was extremely rare for a
non-demonic existence to ascend to the throne.

Then there was a light warning sound from the Factory and a message came
up.

[A new main scenario has opened!]

[The 24th 'Revolutionary Game' has begun.]

Silocke was startled by the sudden message but he pretended to be calm
when he saw Han's surprised expression. Han asked first,

"What is this message about?"

"Oh, you don't know since you're new here. This sometimes happens. It is
the main scenario here. The Revolutionary Game."

"The Revolutionary Game?"

"He was probably caught by the executioner while hiding. He is an unlucky
person."

The Revolutionary Game starting meant that the hidden 'revolutionary' had
appeared. However, there couldn't be a revolutionary in this industrial
complex. Everyone clearly remembered what happened when the last
revolutionary appeared 30 years ago.

Silocke smiled and added, "Don't worry, it isn't a big deal. Wait a bit and
the executioner will take his neck. It will be a fun spectacle."

Still no matter how long he waited, the message announcing the end of the
game wasn't heard. He was just thinking that something was strong with a
low grade noble appeared.
Silocke immediately recognized who he was. It was because he was one of
the hidden executioners. He rushed towards the office and Silocke asked
first. "What is going on?"

"Someone has declared that they are a revolutionary!"

Silocke knew it was a stupid question but he couldn't help wondering,
"What? Who?"

"It is a new revolutionary!"

"Then what is his name?"

The low grade noble stuttered out a name. It was a name Silocke didn't
know. Unexpected, the bored looking Han opened his mouth. "Wait, what
did you just say?"

"Yes, it was definitely Yoo Joonghyuk…"

"He called himself Yoo Joonghyuk?"

Silocke hurriedly asked. "Do you know him?"

"I know."

Han's expression shone brightly but it was a somewhat warped smile. Even
the demon Silocke felt creeped out. Han asked, "Where did he show up?"




Night ended and I was called back to Aileen.

To be exact, I was almost dragged back.
The streets were almost completely turned upside down because of my
declaration.

–A new revolutionary has appeared!

The streets were loud with these words. If Aileen hadn't popped up and
dragged me away, I would still be sandwiched between the citizens. As
Aileen was unable to control her emotions, I checked the information of the
hidden scenario with a nonchalant mind.


  [Hidden Scenario - Fake Revolutionary]

  Category: Hidden

  Difficulty level: SS

  Clear Conditions: You have become a self-proclaimed revolutionary by
  impersonating a revolutionary. Kill a real revolutionary within the given
  time and take their position. Otherwise, it will be a terrible ending.

  Time Limit: 30 days

  Compensation: 150,000 coins, entering a new main scenario.

  Failure: Death


I roughly knew how to get the main scenario. In any case, I had to find the
real revolutionary…

I glanced at Aileen and said, "Then let's get started."

"…Are you crazy?" Aileen asked with an absurd expression, "Do you know
what you are doing?"
"A revolution."

"What revolution without a revolutionary? You're a fake!"

"Really?"

"There is no way… don't tell me…?"

She had a cute expression on her face. I shrugged lightly and Aileen's face
filled with despair. "Of course not! What the hell are you doing? Now it is
all over!"

I shamelessly replied, "This is what you wanted. A revolution and the death
of the duke."

"I didn't want it this way! This is a scam!"

"How is a real revolution a scam? I will make it real."

"A revolution isn't such a joke!"

"I agree with you. I didn't declare that I am a revolutionary lightly. I agree
that this industrial complex should be liberated."

"The fact that you can say it so easily is proof that your will is light."

Aileen's voice contained deep rage. "Do you intend to do the revolution
alone?"

"…"

"I have seen many revolutions in this industrial complex. How many
revolutions have failed and how much blood has been shed? And…"

"Don't regard past failures as scriptures. There will be no change if you
don't do anything."
"It is a scenario you can't do in the first place!"

I understood Aileen's feelings. In fact, the revolutionary scenario was a
famous one in the industrial complex. The only rebellion protocol allowed
by the scenario. Even so, the citizens of the industrial complex abandoned
this game a long time ago.

It was because there was no chance of winning. Thanks to this, the scenario
lost its value as a scenario.

Aileen continued, "This is why I've been relying on exiles. The duke can
never be killed using existing scenarios! There is no way to win against the
damn executioners, let alone the duke!"

"The scenario is made to be broken. There is a way to clear it if we look
carefully."

"People are going to die because of you."

"I won't let that happen."

"Then you'll be the first to die."

"I won't die. I didn't die before."

"This…!" Aileen bit her lips. "That was just luck. Do you think the
guardian will protect you again?"

"Well, I think they will protect me."

"You don't know but the guardian will exhaust their vitality after using their
protection. Every time they use it, they lose vitality and will eventually die.
No one will protect you two or three times!"

"The first time is the most important."

"…"
"Aileen, you know this place better than me but you don't understand the
people here."

Aileen was about to say something only to tightly close her lips for the first
time. Perhaps Aileen had also felt something.

The hidden guardian had appeared and protected me, a revolutionary. It was
probably a sight that Aileen hadn't seen for a long time. It was really a long
time.

Aileen licked her lips for a long time before speaking in a small voice. "Do
you really think it is possible?"

"It is possible. Haven't you seen enough of my skills?"

It would be possible. I would make the impossible possible. Aileen replied
with a sigh, "You aren't a real revolutionary."

"That's why I need your help."

Aileen's expression shook at my words.

"Let's make a revolution without a revolutionary."

Aileen made a decision and replied, "…You have to collect the positions.
This is a game that you can't win alone."

"I guess so."

"A guardian is the minimum condition for survival. You also need a
'fighter' to deal with the executioner and a 'spy' to find the hidden
executioners."

"Collect them one by one. Those positions won't be as far away as you
think."
I didn't fret. The revolutionary declaration was already ringing so those in
charge of their positions would realize it one by one. They would have to
figure out what side to take in this damn game.

"I think one position has already been collected."

As soon as I spoke, the door of the meeting room opened with a bang. Jang
Hayoung was looking this way with wide eyes.

"That, Aileen…"

"What?"

"Someone is asking to enter…"

"I'm busy right now! Send them away."

"That, it is a bit…"

"Why?"

"…A person claiming to be the guardian has come."

The surprised Aileen rose from her seat. Then behind Jang Hayoung,
a middle-aged man with a study build appeared. "You… are you
really the revolutionary?"

Surprisingly, it was a face I already knew.
           Chapter 201: Ep. 38 - Fake Revolutionary, III


The door opened and a middle-aged man appeared. His hair was white and
he wore a dirty apron. The faint scar on his cheek was the only sign of
'strength' that could be found on the man's face.

He didn't seem like a person who would be a 'guardian'. Aileen
looked incredulously at the man and hesitantly sat back down. "You
are a guardian?" "Yes."

"…Really?"

"I was worried you would react like this."

Aileen glanced at me after hearing the middle-aged man's words. I smiled at
Aileen. "I told you. They will be around us."

"However, to be this close…"
The guardian was the pub owner who previously made the side dishes for
me. Of course, I guessed from the beginning that he was the guardian. He
was very similar to the guardian who appeared in Ways of Survival.

I also knew that he would save me. If I didn't know this, I wouldn't have
declared myself a revolutionary.

Aileen asked, "Why did you keep quiet until now? If you are really the
guardian, you've had many chances to save people."

"I had to save my points. You know that a guardian can only save people a
total of five times."

"I know, but if you didn't use all five times…"

"If I had saved someone else…" The pub owner glanced at me before
continuing. "The revolutionary would be dead."

"You sound certain that the revolutionary would appear."

"I have always been waiting. Not everyone gave up like you."

"…Are you saying that to me?"

The atmosphere seemed to be heating up and Jang Hayoung quickly
interrupted.

"Now now Aileen, Pub Owner. Let's stop fighting and think about things
going forward. Isn't it good for us if the guardian shows up?"

I admired his skillful method of changing the topic. Jang Hayoung was one
of the most extraordinary people in Ways of Survival. He was a
foulmouthed person who desired to stay here but he was originally an
excellent mediator who understood the hearts of people better than anyone
else.
Jang Hayoung coughed and tapped on the shoulder of the pub owner. "At
any rate, I am surprised. I thought you were only good at cooking.
Honestly, couldn't you have given us a clue?"

"A good chef often has many secrets. Speaking of the revolutionary, how
did you like my cooking earlier?"

"Unfortunately, I didn't get a chance to eat it. Someone else ate all of it."

Jang Hayoung stared at me with wide eyes and the pub owner chuckled.
Aileen poured cold water on the atmosphere that had barely improved.

"You guys are laughing like you're already colleagues. Don't you know?
The game has already begun."

If Jang Hayoung was an excellent mediator, Aileen was an experienced
schemer. She might not be in the 'lying down dragon' grade but she pointed
out something that a revolutionary should be suspicious about.

"I know."

In fact, her advice was pointed to a verse of the Revolutionary Game that
appeared in Ways of Survival.

「It is important to gather the same side. But the most important thing is
finding out the identity of the enemy. 」

It wasn't easy to distinguish between who was an enemy and who was a
friend. Most revolutionaries failed and self-destructed because they couldn't
break through this point.

The pub owner received my gaze and smiled bitterly. "Do you perhaps
doubt me? Do you think I am a snitch for the duke?"

I laughed without saying a word. I already knew that the pub owner was a
guardian. Thus, this gesture was for the people other than me.
"Shall we start with the introductions first?"

"I am Mark. How about you?"

"I am Yoo Joonghyuk."

"Yoo Joonghyuk? Hrmm. It sounds like a name I've heard before…"

It was because the Earth scenarios were spreading. Therefore, there might
be a person who remembered the name 'Yoo Joonghyuk' in the Demon
Realm.

I could use this hand if necessary. There were also a few story fragments
that I had obtained…

"Well, let's go to the point. I'm not the duke's snitch. It is hard to believe but
I'm being honest."

"No, I believe you."

"You believe me?

"Yes. You are really the guardian."

Mark stared at me like I was a fool. "…I don't know what happened but I
guess I passed the test?"

"That's right. Congratulations on entering the Revolutionary Army."

The aghast Aileen shouted at the sudden conclusion. "No, wait a minute!"

"This person came right after I made the revolutionary declaration. The
duke's snitch wouldn't have responded this quickly. The least Revolutionary
Scenario was 30 years ago."

Aileen paused at my quick clarification before she continued, "It isn't
wrong but I don't think this is enough evidence.
"I do. I am sure that this person is the guardian."

"How?"

"Just as I am sure that you are an engineer of Lindberg."

"How could you…"

"I also know that Aslan over there is really Jang Hayoung and that he is
from Earth."

"Hey! M privacy…!"

Aileen's expression changed once she saw Jang Hayoung's reaction.
"You… can you see the attribute information?"

"As much as necessary."

In fact, I had already checked Mark's attribute information. Aileen didn't
understand but she was finally convinced. "You have an unusual skill. Until
now, there wasn't a skill that could give a glimpse of the position
information."

"My skill is special."

"…I'm glad you have such a skill. Still, the situation is very hopeless."

"It should be very hopeful."

Aileen sighed with half-hearted resignation and said, "With this, the Fake
Revolutionary Army is formed."

"…Fake Revolutionary Army? What does that mean?"

That reminded me, my situation was a bit complicated. I should first give
an explanation. The people here were those I needed to take to the end of
this scenario.
I took some time to persuasively explain that I wasn't a real revolutionary
but a person who could make the revolution a success.

"Whaaaat?!"

"…You're not a revolutionary?"

Two people screamed before my words were over. Thinking back, I never
got a good evaluation every time I announced a project at the company.

Mark, who exhausted his points because of me, completely lost his soul.

"Crazy. A fake revolutionary, a poor guardian, the chairman of the Civil
Council and a frivolous little boy… is this a joke?"

"Frivolous little boy? Hey, you are talking too much Mark!"

"Stop fighting. The situation is like this so we should worry about what we
will do next."

"Mr. Fake Revolutionary, do you have a plan?"

"I have a few things to prepare."

I briefly explained my plan to the group. The haggard-looking people
became more serious as I talked. By the end of the story, Mark who joined
the Fake Revolutionary Army opened his mouth. "Certainly, those are the
measures we need now."

"Are you going to participate?"

"I don't have a choice. What will you do first?"

"I have to change my face."

I pulled out the story fragment 'Face of A Casanova Who Died from Sexual
Relations'. Mark seemed puzzled. "Face? That wasn't in the plan…"
"The most important things in the world aren't included in a plan."

"Why your face?"

"Shouldn't I be handsome to be a revolutionary? Let's see a few hands."




At the same time, Earl Silocke and Han were walking down the streets.
Silocke walked through the streets and glanced at Han. "Hey Han."

"What?"

Silocke wasn't satisfied with this answer but the other person was in contact
with 'Asmodeus'. Since Han was willingly joining him, becoming closer
wasn't bad.

"…I think you originally weren't a demon. Can I ask where you came
from?"

Surprisingly, Han gave an answer. "A place called Earth."

"Earth! Ah, I've heard that name before."

"I guess. The planet is famous these days."

"Since you got Asmodeus' attention, you must have considerable skill?"

"Considerable skill?"

Silocke was a bit amazed by the pride that emerged on Han's face. Was he
making this face because he was such a great person?

"What were you originally? A sword master? Or a great magician?"

"It is similar."
"What is it?"

"I was the department head of a large company."

"A large company? What is that?"

"Hmm… you don't know it?" Han thought for a moment. "If I had to give
an explanation, it is a group similar to a nebula."

"…A nebula!"

"I am just giving an analogy."

"Then you were a 'constellation'?"

"No, but it is a similar analogy."

"Then… you are amazing."

Silocke didn't understand the words 'company' or 'department head' but he
was forced to feel surprised at Han's explanation. It felt like he slightly
understood how Han made contact with Asmodeus.

"…What is that?"

At the gateway between the nobles section and the civilians' section, a huge
barricade was being built. It was obviously an iron gate. Silocke shouted in
an annoying voice,

"Hey, what are you doing right now?"

A citizen working on the barricade replied, "Ah, a noble."

"I asked what you are doing!"

"Can't you tell just by looking? We are blocking the way."
Silocke was a bit startled by the shameless voice. "Who made you do this?"

"This is the chairman's orders. For the moment, nobles can't enter among
the citizens."

"What bullshit. What right… get rid of those barricades now! Otherwise I
will immediately throw the two of you into the dump."

The citizens flinched and retreated at his ferocious growl. Then another
voice was heard from behind the citizens.

"If you are confident then try it."

The citizen who spoke was different from the other citizens. The unknown
citizen released a powerful force from his body.

Silocke became tense and retreated. Most citizens were weaker than nobles.
However, that didn't apply to all citizens.

There were the mysterious dimensional movers and some of them were as
strong as the demon nobles.

"You are doing this just because there is a revolutionary? Do you think we
can't kill him?"

The reason why the citizens never stood up against the nobles was due to
fear of the execution at Night. However, things started changing from last
night.

"You didn't kill him yesterday."

The citizens muttered as they gazed at each other. Silocke was furious but
he couldn't cross the barricade. He was alone and had no way to deal with
so many citizens. At this time, Han asked, "Are those guys holding a
strike?"

"Strike?"
"They are talking about doing what they're not supposed to do."

Silocke understood what Han was saying and nodded. "…It is a similar
situation."

"I see. Leave it to me. I am a professional at dealing with this." A different
type of wickedness emerged on Han's face. "This happens when the
workers don't know who they are going against. For starters, you have to
implant some fear."




Aileen helped me with the story fragment that I absorbed through
Lamarck's Giraffe.

However, the molding of the face wasn't as easy as I thought. The Face of
A Casanova Who Died from Sexual Relations didn't rest safely on my face
until it was evening.

I looked in the mirror and smiled with satisfaction.

「 Kim Dokja thought: It isn't better than Yoo Joonghyuk but isn't this
decent? 」

Then Aileen finished the procedure and muttered, "It seems a bit better.
Well, I don't know. Why is the impression so fuzzy…?"

…I guess it was fine. My nose was slightly higher and my cheeks more
taut…

The anxious Aileen asked me, "By the way, is it okay to be this carefree?
Soon it will be the second Night. The Executioner will come again."

"It will be fine tonight."
"The guardian can't protect you indefinitely. Don't you know?"

"I know."

I would prefer not to use the guardian's points if possible but now there was
no other way. I had to overcome the second Night with the Guardian's help.
The third Night was when I could try a new method.

"Surely Mark won't become the target right? A guardian can't protect their
own life…"

"Don't worry. No one other than us knows that he is the guardian."

The duke would still be caught off guard. He didn't think the revolution
would succeed. We had to use this chance well.

"Aileen! Night is coming!"

Jang Hayoung yelled from outside and I went out with Aileen. I had to be
the target to avoid unnecessary disturbances.

"The revolutionary!"

People remembered my outfit and cheered. I felt a bit sad that no
one realized I had changed my face. [The second Night has
arrived.]

I looked around the street. Mark was hiding somewhere in advance and
preparing to protect me.

[You are currently under the protection of the guardian.]

The creepy flute sounds were heard and the executioners appeared one by
one. They emerged as expected.

[Who is the revo lu tion ary?]
"It is me. You can't kill me yet you gathered here anyway."

The executioners looked at each other.

[You are the re vo lu tion ary.]

Then they said, [B u t.]

At this moment, I felt suspicious. Wait, this…

It wasn't possible. They already thought of this strategy?

[The one who wi ll di e.]

The executioners aimed their scythes at different targets.

[Not the re volu tio nary.]

One of the nearby executioner's scythe aimed for Jang Hayoung's neck.
           Chapter 202: Ep. 38 - Fake Revolutionary, IV


"Avoid it!" The executioner's scythe moved along with Aileen's call.

「 At this moment, his thoughts accelerated and the world looked like slow
motion. 」

「 Kim Dokja thought: What the hell is this? 」

I gritted my teeth and rushed towards Jang Hayoung.

There might be a difference between the 111th regression and the current
regression but there was no such development in the original second Night.
The executioners didn't receive any orders from the duke and should've
wasted their second Night after being unable to kill me.

[Kill every one.]

Now the actions of the executioners were like those who had been playing
this game for a long time. It was clear that someone had given them orders.
I pushed Jang Hayoung away while releasing Blade of Faith and receiving
the executioner's scythe.

[The combat shock has made your story configuration incomplete.]

The situation wasn't very good. I couldn't fight now.

[The story fragment 'Face of A Casanova Who Died from Sexual Relations'
has been slightly damaged.]

Damn, my face! Fortunately, the executioner had no intention of fighting
with me and immediately switched targets. I barely managed to sigh but
quickly realized that this wasn't a good thing.

[Ke ep the re vo lu tio nary a live.]

"Aaaaack!"

Citizens shrieked as they were cut by the executioners' scythes. No one was
dead yet but half a dozen people were already bleeding.

"R-Revolutionary!"

I bit my lips.

「 Kim Dokja thought: Was there a schemer he didn't know about? Or was
the duke already acting? The stories of Ways of Survival flowed quickly
through Kim Dokja's head. 」

"Everyone gather this way! I can't protect you if you scatter!"

「 Kim Dokja judged. The duke hadn't moved. It wouldn't have ended like
this if the duke moved. 」

The Fourth Wall was right. The industrial complex would already be ruined
if the duke had moved.
"Kuaaack!"

The damage to the people didn't reduce. The injuries from the executioners'
scythes continued all over the place. There were more than ten wounded in
an instant.

The good news was that the enemies couldn't kill many citizens. The
game's rules stated that each executioner could only kill one citizen per day.

At least, for three days.

Aileen shouted, "Everyone fight against them! They can't use Execution
without the mark!"

Some citizens armed themselves with weapons at Aileen's words but the
situation didn't easily improve. In the first place, only a few citizens could
follow the movements of the executioners. Even then, they didn't last long.

"Kuaaack!"

The fact that the people didn't know when the executioners would use the
'mark' added to their fear. They could always use the mark and some
citizens would surely die. Furthermore, the guardian was protecting me and
couldn't protect them.

"R-Run!"

In the end, the ranks collapsed and the citizens started to scatter.

"No! Don't go!"

Aileen urgently shouted but the frightened citizens couldn't hear anything.
The injured citizens groaned and seemed to be cursing towards empty air.

「 Kim Dokja was quietly furious. 」

I didn't know who did this but…
"S-Save me…"

A wounded civilian crawled towards me. There were many people without
good details. Some of them would die by the end of this Night if they were
unlucky. The same went for those who fled.

This Night would be remembered as more terrible than any other Night in
the industrial complex.

「 If the damage gets bigger then it will go according to their intentions. 」

The citizens would no longer be willing to help the revolution. They would
once again follow the orders of the duke and Aileen's Civil Council would
be isolated. I couldn't allow this to happen.

Thus, I had to play a different hand. The moment I took a short breath to
call out to Aileen.

"This way! Kill me!" Someone hiding behind a building started shouting. It
was Mark. "Over here! I am the guardian!"

Jang Hayoung realized what was going on and shouted, "Damn! Pub
Owner, what are you doing?"

It was a hasty judgment. It was a valid but bad judgment.

"I am the guardian! Kill me!"

As Aileen and Jang Hayoung glanced at me, I was already running towards
Mark. At almost the same time, the executioners were also running.

[Guar di an.]

Mark's provocation worked well. The scattered executioners gathered in an
instant.

[Kill the guar di an.]
I used Bookmark and Way of the Wind to quickly rush towards Mark.
Mark's pale face was nearing.

[The exclusive skill 'Character List' is activated!]

In fact, unlike what I told Aileen, I couldn't know the exact 'position' of a
person using Character List. However, I could see that someone had a
special position and an unknown skill.

"It was a fleeting dream…"

The Dimensional Mover from the Gainz Planet, Mark Javier. He retired as
a mercenary and become a chef after coming to the Demon Realm. Every
character in the scenario had their own reasons.

Mark smiled at me as the scythes flew towards him. "I hope you succeed,
Revolutionary."
I didn't know much about his life. He was a supporting role among
countless people who died in Ways of Survival.

[The Syswitz Executioner has placed a mark of death on 'Mark Javier'.]

['Mark Javier' have been identified as the scapegoat of the Night.]

Ways of Survival had a huge 3,149 chapters. Some people probably thought
this story was too long. They thought it was a long and boring story.

「 But for Kim Dokja, 3,149 chapters was short. 」

I always thought this. I wished that Ways of Survival was longer. I had read
so many chapters but I was still curious about Ways of Survival.

"Don't worry. You won't die."

Thus, I would read a part I hadn't read from now on.

"Vicky! If I die…!" Mark shouted with a bit of embarrassment.

"Why are you so anxious to die? No one will die. At least, not in my

story." I blocked the scythes of the executioners and used a skill.

[The exclusive skill 'Bookmark' is activated!]

[The proficiency of Bookmark has increased and a new slot has been
enabled.]

"I will place Knight of Revolution Mark Javier in the sixth slot."

[The character 'Mark Javier' has been registered in the sixth slot.]

[The number six bookmark is activated.]

[(Private skill Lv. 1)is enabled.]
The scythe of an executioner headed to the neck of Mark, who had closed
his eyes.

[You have temporarily acquired the position of 'Guardian'!]

However, my side was a bit faster.

[Someone has used their vitality to protect 'Mark Javier'.]

The executioner's scythe stopped one inch from Mark's neck. The scythe
stopped like it was caught in a net. Mark knew the meaning of this and his
eyes widened.

[The guardian was successful and the mark of death has been released!]

Of course, Mark wasn't the only one to feel amazed.

[Is th ere ano ther guar di an?]

It was a voice filled with disbelief. The executioners scattered into the
darkness one by one. The executioners couldn't kill anyone, unlike their
purpose. I wasn't satisfied but it was still okay.

I sighed lightly and looked around where the survivors were staring at me.
In particular, Jang Hayoung and Aileen were staring with shock. Judging
from their expressions, it would be a long night.

[No one died tonight.]




As expected, Jang Hayoung and Mark didn't leave me alone.

"What are you really?"
"What is your position? Are you actually a guardian?"

I would've suffered even more if Aileen wasn't taking care of the citizens. I
shook my head and sighed.

"I told you. I am a fake revolutionary." Thus, I can be a fake guardian."

"Explain it now…!"

"Just let it go. I will expose too much if I tell you more details. Don't you
know how dangerous it is to disclose your information in a situation like
this?"

"…"

"Let's say I tell you the information. If you are kidnapped and reveal my
information to the duke, how do you think this revolution will end?"

In fact, this was an excuse that Yoo Joonghyuk frequently used when he
found explaining was annoying. Now I was Yoo Joonghyuk so I didn't
mind saying it.

"I am just Yoo Joonghyuk. Remember that."

「 Kim Dokja thought: He feels like he is actually becoming
Yoo Joonghyuk. 」 Shut up.

「I miss Kim Dok ja who speaks with hono rifics. 」

As I was playing with the Fourth Wall, the two men watched m with tired
eyes and shook their heads.

"…You are a really difficult person."

A message was probably entering Yoo Joonghyuk's ears on Earth by now.
Perhaps it was this message?
[Your story is being created in the 73rd Demon Realm.]

If he was smart, he would notice what was going on. However, it didn't
matter. The atmosphere calmed down and I brought up the main subject.

"Let's talk about work. There is something that broke my expectations.
There is a guy attacking using the rules of the game."

"…I heard that Duke Syswitz isn't a schemer. Do you think the duke has
moved directly?"

"I don't think so. I think it is someone else."

"Still, tonight went well. Isn't it more favourable to us if there are two
people who can use the power of a guardian?"

"Not necessarily. Those guys won't use the 'mark' tomorrow."

"What?"

"If it is hard to kill me then they will try to hurt as many people as
possible."

"Ah…!"

If the mark wasn't used, the Night wouldn't end until the sun rose.

"Many people were already hurt tonight. We didn't win. We lost."

Today people learnt to fear the executioners again. Once tomorrow came,
people's attitudes would be clear. People would be afraid of the duke again
and be afraid of the revolution. The enemies wouldn't miss this gap.

Mark's expression became darker and he opened his mouth. "…Then what
do we do now?"

"We don't need to do anything. Maybe someone else will move first."
I had seen numerous Revolutionary Games in Ways of Survival. If things
were like this then the next development was certain.

"The second 'position' will appear."

"The second?"

"Yes. A position other than revolutionary, guardian and executioner."

I just said this when someone knocked on the door. It was Aileen. "…
Revolutionary, someone has come to find you."

I saw her strangely tense face and knew that the movements of the enemy
had already begun.

"He says he is a spy."
            Chapter 203: Ep. 38 - Fake Revolutionary, V


Spy…

I once read a phrase about the 'spies' in Ways of Survival.

「 All positions in the Revolutionary Game belong to either the
'Revolutionary' or the 'Dictator'. There is only one position that isn't fixed
and that is the 'Spy'. 」

The most dangerous and most cowardly position in this Revolutionary
Game. Therefore, Ways of Survival described the spy as followed:

「 The team that gets the spy can win the game. 」

In the Revolutionary Game where information was a top priority, the status
of the Spy was great.
It was because the spy could check the position information of the desired
person. There was a limit of 10 people a day but this alone was enough for
the spy to shake the entire board.

Right now, a person claiming to be the spy was in front of me. "Are you
Yoo Joonghyuk?"

The appearance of the man didn't go well with the Demon Realm. He gave
off an ambiguous feeling. No, to be precise… what was it? Why did I get
deja vu from this face? I didn't recall a similar appearance in Ways of
Survival.

I replied to the man, "That's right. I am Yoo Joonghyuk."

By the way, the man's reaction was subtly strange.

"…Hrmm." Is that so?"

At this moment, I realized something. "By the way, you know my name."

Usually he should be asking if I was really the revolutionary. Yet he first
confirmed that my name was 'Yoo Joonghyuk'.

The man shrugged. "Haha, it is a famous name."

Unlike his words, the man was stubbornly staring at my appearance. It was
as if he was contrasting it with something he knew. I became certain.

「 This person knows Yoo Joonghyuk. 」

I quickly recalled Ways of Survival but I couldn't make a guess. In the first
place, Yoo Joonghyuk was a regressor and this was officially before he
entered the Demon Realm.

There wasn't anyone here who should know Yoo Joonghyuk well. If he was
good at observing, he might've seen Yoo Joonghyuk by watching the Earth
scenario but… it was unlikely.
Due to my poor reaction, Jang Hayoung, Aileen and Mark were nervously
glancing between me and the man. Maybe they instinctively felt something.
I decided to find out the identity of my opponent. "What is your name?"

"I am Aurelius."

"…Aurelius?"

I hesitated for a moment. I remembered hearing this name somewhere. It
wasn't Ways of Survival but somewhere else.

"It is an unusual name."

"So they tell me."

"Then you are a spy?"

"That's right."

[The exclusive skill 'Lie Detection Lv. 3' is activated!]

[During the Revolutionary scenario, you can't use the Lie Detection skill.]

…As expected, this skill didn't work. I had guessed it.

There was a scene where Yoo Joonghyuk of the 111th regression had been
frustrated after learning that this skill didn't work. I tried it just in case but it
was as I figured.

Well, if Lie Detection could be freely used then the difficulty of this
scenario would be very easy. Fortunately, I didn't only have Lie Detection.

[The exclusive skill 'Character List' is activated!]
Of course, I couldn't discern the exact position of the opponent after using
Character List. Nevertheless, I could at least figure out if he had a special
position or not.

[The person's information can't be accessed through Character List.]

[This person isn't registered on the Character List.]

…What? I was confused for a moment.


[The information on the corresponding person is being updated.]

[This person's information will be added in the next update.]

It wasn't the first time I heard this message but it was unexpected. The man
didn't know my situation and asked,

"Huh? What's wrong?"

A person who couldn't be read using Character List. It meant this man was
a person who didn't contribute to the original Ways of Survival novel. In
other words, the man was a variable I created.

But how was it possible? This was the Demon Realm, not Earth…

I was hesitating when Mark asked, "Did you come here to join our side?"

"Maybe, maybe not."

"What does that mean?"

"I came to save you. It is obvious that the revolution will be destroyed at
this rate."

"…You are coming to sprinkle the ashes even though the meal hasn't been
cookied yet?"
"It isn't a joke. Public opinion regarding you isn't good. I don't know if you
have seen outside."

Certainly, the outside had been noisy for a while. I heard a knocking on the
door of the office. We glanced at each other before heading straight outside.
Loud voices were heard as soon as I went outside.

"Revolutionary!"

Countless gazes focused on me after someone shouted. It was a crowd of
nearly 100 people. Some of them shouted towards me in exaggerated
voices. "It is because of you! If it wasn't for you!"

"My wife was hurt!"

Someone even threw stones. To be honest, I was a bit surprised. There was
some damage but it wasn't enough for them to come out to such an extreme
degree.

The voices continued, "It was better when the Night came once every three
days!"

Before the Revolutionary scenario was invoked, Night only came once
every three days. Now Night was invoked two days in a row. It was natural
for people's fears to be heightened.

Jang Hayoung shouted towards these people. "You crazy… what are you
crazy fuckers talking about? Are you so pathetic? It is okay for one person
to die every three days?"

Some people heard this and stepped back. Jang Hayoung continued to
shout.

"If you want to live that way then leave the industrial complex!"
"W-What does a little boy like you know? Do you have any idea of what it
is like outside?"

The voices were frightened. Everyone here was well aware of it.

「 Civilians belong to the scenario of the industrial complex. If they leave
here, they will be given an exile penalty for leaving the scenario area. 」

The exile penalty. There was no one in the Demon Realm who didn't know
what it was.

Thus, people would rather turn the roulette of death once every three days.
Now that the revolutionary emerged, the interval of the roulette had
decreased from three days to one day.

"D-Do we have to experience Night every day from now on?"

"What are you going to do? What are you going to do in the future?"

The voices were filled with panic.

Aileen and the other council members tried to restrain them but the crowd's
actions became fiercer. I turned my head and saw Aurelius staring at me
with a despicable smile.

"Do you now understand what's going on?"

A revolutionary who didn't have the support of the citizens was bound to be
defeated.

I smiled bitterly. "You are on the duke's side."

"It isn't important. The important thing is your choice."

"So what do you want?"
"Surrender to the duke. Everyone else can live except for you. In any case,
your revolution is going to fail."

"I will be the sacrifice?"

"I'm not saying that. I'll help you find a way to live."

"How?"

"If you are really Yoo Joonghyuk, I will protect you."

"Doesn't the duke want to kill me?"

"My backer is far beyond Duke Syswitz."

An existence that Duke Syswitz couldn't be compared to. I was quite
intrigued by the suggestion. If I wasn't Yoo Joonghyuk then I
might've thought about it for a moment. "Of course, I will refuse."

"I see. You will regret it."

The next moment, Aurelius disappeared. In the midst of the crowd,
someone shouted, "Let's give him to the duke!"

"The duke said he will end the scenario if we hand him in!"

"Then the Night won't come!"

The voices that came out spread like wildfire. It was very interesting. In
fact, I had seen a similar sight before. Maybe it was during the Mino Soft
labour negotiations.

"Everything is over when the next Night comes! We have to catch the
revolutionary before that!"
The crowd was moving with overwhelming agitation. The people were so
terrified that it led to a backlash against me.

"S-Somebody grab him…!"

I stared at them for a moment before stepping towards the crowd. The
crowd was confused as I walked forward without any fear. My
surroundings split apart like Moses' wave because the people tried to avoid
contact with me.

"Are you that afraid of the executioner?"

I spoke as I pulled out Unbroken Faith. Then the Blade of Faith vibrated
and a white light burst from it. My voice filled with magic power poured
cold water on the crowd. A few people in the crowd were surprised by the
wave of magic power and fell on their asses, which others backed away. I
spoke towards them in a serene voice,

"Everybody has forgotten that this isn't the Night."

I raised the sword towards the air. The magical wave of Purest Sword Force
poured from the heart of the gold dragon and filled the dark sky with a
white light. My actions frightened people and they exclaimed, "W-
What…!"

"He wants to kill people!"

"Aaaaack! The revolutionary is killing civilians!"

The surprised people screamed and Aileen's shouts could be heard.
However, I ignored all sounds and ran to the center of the crowd. Then I
swung myself towards someone in the crowd without hesitation.

"First one."
He was one of the men who had been inciting the crowd. The man was
pierced in the heart and couldn't even scream. He just watched me with
wide eyes as he died.

[The exclusive skill 'Fourth Wall' is activated!]

The sensation of murder was gnawing at my hand. Obviously, I was
affected by the move to kill someone. It was due to the habit that formed
from trying to keep the King of No Killing attribute.

However, today I didn't hesitate a single bit. It was as if I really had become
Yoo Joonghyuk.

"The second one."

The blade moved through the air and blood scattered. A second man's head
flew away. Blood splashed, wetting my clothes while the fearful
expressions of the people around me could be seen.

I moved my sword and stabbed the last man in the back.

"The last one."

I killed three people in an instant and looked around. There were constant
screams as the grieving civilians watched me. It wasn't just the citizens.

Aileen, Jang Hayoung and Mark were the same. They didn't understand
what was going on and panic filled their faces.

The revolutionary killed ordinary civilians. Nothing I said would be a
convincing explanation. Nevertheless, this was something I never needed to
explain.

[A change in the Revolutionary scenario has occurred!]

Everyone looked up as the message was suddenly heard. It was followed by
subsequent messages.
[An executioner has been killed by someone.]

[An executioner has been killed by someone.]

[An executioner has been killed by someone.]

.

.

.

[Current number of executioners remaining: 7.]

People's expressions changed at the messages.

A total of three people died. The number of dead executioners was also
three.

The people watching me with trembling eyes now screamed and retreated
from the dead bodies. It was as if they were looking at something terrible.

"U-Uwaaaack!"

"E-Executioner? They were hiding here?"

"Aaron was an executioner! Oh my god!"

Executioners hid among the civilians. In the midst of this colossal betrayal,
the crowd gradually realized.

The executioners had died. The executioners they thought to be invincible
had died like a normal man.

It was a story they had never experienced before. In front of this story,
people were being inspired in unexpected ways.
One man rose first and drew a sword. His eyes were blazing with anger.
"SSon of a bitch! Kill those sons of a bitches!"

Those who had just been threatening me started to trample on the corpses.
The seething heat of the crowd was several times their previous emotions.
They had all lost something to the executioner. This was an act of miserable
revenge but it was the best they could do.

I leisurely strolled through the crowd. Then I grabbed the neck of a man.

"Kuaack!"

"You still have the great skill to incite others." The man who tried to escape
struggled in my hands. "How are you unscathed, Department Head Han
Myungoh?"
             Chapter 204: Ep. 39 - Unidentified Wall, I


I left Aileen, Mark and Jang Hayoung to clean up outside and dragged the
unconscious Han Myungoh back to the office.

To be honest, it was a revelation. I never thought Han Myungoh would still
be alive.

Department Head Han Myungoh. Before we reached the third scenario, he
was cursed by Demon King Asmodeus after killing the dark keeper. I
thought he had died before I entered Chungmuro and hadn't expected to
meet him in the Demon Realm.

I placed Han Myungoh on a chair in the meeting room. I used a story
suppressor that I had borrowed from Aileen.

「 Kim Dokja thought: The department head has aged a lot. 」

There were many small wrinkles on Han Myungoh's face. Moreover, his
whole skin was blackened. Putting aside the wrinkles, the skin
discolouration was a sign of a species variation. The longer I looked, the
more I could see the old face. Still, many human traces were missing and it
was hard to know without looking closely.

Yoo Sangah. Lee Gilyoung. My mother and Song Minwoo… They were
the people I couldn't confirm using Character List.

All of them were people who were involved with me before the scenario or
at the start of the scenario. Han Myungoh was also one of them. They
survived in this world because of me. That's why I couldn't read their
information with Character List.

"I know you're awake so get up."

"Uhh… you…"

Han Myungoh… I asked the spy, no, the self-styled Aurelius. "Aurelius.
Did you pick the name personally?"

"…!"

Han Myungoh opened his eyes and I was filled with a vague feeling of
certainty. Aurelius. This was the decisive clue that convinced me this
person was Han Myungoh.

「 A web novel? Hey Kim Dokja-ssi. How much time do you have to read
this shit? 」

During my days at Mino Soft, I had heard these words after I was caught
reading a web novel.

「 If you are going to read a book then you should read something like this.
Read a good book if you want to build up your specs. 」
Han Myungoh was holding the book called 'Meditations', written by
Marcus Aurelius. The first few pages of the book were completely
discoloured…

"You usually carried the Meditations book that you can't read. Your
bluffing still remains."

"W-Who the hell are you?"

Han Myungoh didn't recognize me at all. It was because I changed my face
ahead of time. If I hadn't done that, I might be the one to fall into the trap.

I smirked and asked, "Who do you think?"

At this moment, something flashed through Han Myungoh's eyes.

"D-Don't tell me…!"

As expected, Han Myungoh was Han Myungoh. Even the parachute
department head needed to do some work to survive. I quietly brought a
finger to Han Myungoh's lips that were opening.

"Shhh."

"Oof. Oof. Ooof!"

"If you say anything then you will die here. Think to yourself. Do you
understand?"

I was worried about another transcendental existence listening. There were
no dokkaebi channels here. However, the lack of a channel didn't mean
there was no way for other beings to peep.

[The Fourth Wall says that the demon king 'Devil of Lust and Wrath' is
looking at stupid Kim Dokja.]

…Better than expected. It could tell me something like this?
「 A hem. 」

Devil of Lust and Wrath…

Like constellations, the demon kings had their own modifiers. After all,
they were fallen constellations. Of course, there were those who didn't use
the modifiers as resistance against the constellations…

If I remembered correctly, 'Devil of Lust and Wrath' was the nickname for
Demon King Asmodeus. Han Myungoh seemed to be his subordinate. It
was a high-level position where his vision was shared.

"Shouldn't you pay coins if you want to keep peeking?"

Han Myungoh's eyes widened again when he saw me speaking towards the
air. He noticed who I was talking to.

Small sparks appeared in the air. If this continued, Asmodeus was likely to
gain my information. One day I would reveal my story but now wasn't the
time.

I thought for a moment before pulling a sword out of my coat's subspace. It
was the Four Yin Demonic Beheading Sword.

It had been a really long time since I used it to destroy the Absolute Throne.
It was a sword that could temporarily evolve to a star relic if the power of
the Big Dipper was borrowed.

It was a sword that could break through the constellation's affinity with the
star relic. Originally, I required the help of the Big Dipper to manifest that
strength. Now that I was a constellation, I could use the power of this sword
without their help.

[The Four Yin Demonic Beheading Sword has responded to your story!]

"If you aren't going to pay then get lost."
I swung the sword over Han Myungoh's head. The message appeared as I
swing the sword and strong sparks appeared in the air.

[The connection between the Demon King 'Asmodeus' and his household
member is temporarily disconnected.]

Han Myungohwas now shocked beyond surprise. He never thought I would
have the power to break off his link with the demon king. I warned Han
Myungoh.

"Here, my name is Yoo Joonghyuk." Nod if you understand."

Han Myungoh stared at me with a complicated gaze and barely nodded
after thinking about it. He made the correct judgment because he knew that
his life was precious. I released his mouth and Han Myungoh gasped as he
looked up at me.

"H-How the hell… I heard you were definitely dead…"

"I'm not dead. Thus, I'm alive."

The terrified Han Myungoh asked, "W-What are you going to do with me?"

"We'll see. I'm thinking."

"H-Help me! The years we spent together aren't short!"

"I don't have any good memories of those years."

"I-I am a spy. I can help your revolution! I can see other people's
positions!"

It seemed to be true that Han Myungoh was a spy. Indeed, the spy didn't
emerge in the 111th regression. It wouldn't be strange if a surprising person
appeared as the spy.

"I don't need a spy. I found the executioners without you."
Han Myungoh's eyes once again shook at my words. Then Han Myungoh
spoke the question he had been curious about. "That reminds me… how did
you find the executioners?"

I roughly knew what was going on but I decided to be fooled for a bit. "I
didn't know they were executioners…"

"What? Then how…"

My words were true. The descriptions of some executioners appeared in
Ways of Survival but it was written in passing and I didn't remember them.
It would also be hard to recognize just based on the description.

I didn't kill them because I knew they were executioners. I just used a skill
to figure out that they had a special position.

「 That information was enough for Kim Dokja. 」

Han Myungoh didn't know anything and exclaimed, "The people you killed
could've been innocent or have important positions! Y-Yes! For example, a
fighter or…!"

"Stop talking about useless things. If you are trying to drag out the time
because you think other nobles will come to rescue you… they won't
come."

"Ha, haha. What do you mean?"

"It is only the executioners that the citizens are afraid of. Without them, the
nobles can't easily invade the civilians' area."

Now that he realized that things were wrong, Han Myungoh's
struggles became worse. He stared at me with red eyes and yelled, "If
you kill me, you will receive the demon king's wrath!" My previous
self would've been afraid.
"Do I look like I'm afraid of the demon king?"

I raised my constellation status. It was to such a slight extent that the dukes
of the industrial complexes and the demon kings of other demon realms
wouldn't notice. No matter how light, I was a constellation and it was
sufficient to kill Han Myungoh.

Han Myungoh trembled before finally giving up. "…What do you want?"

It was the question I had been waiting for. In any case, Han Myungoh was
someone who had made contact with the demons here. It would be wiser to
use him as much as possible.

"Make an Oath of Existence. Do you know what it is?"

"T-That…"

"Do it if you want to live. Or you can go out and be beaten to death by the
common people."

Han Myungoh sighed. "What do you want me to swear?"

"You won't interfere in the revolution. You won't lie. You will truthfully
answer any questions I ask and cooperate with me wholeheartedly."

"…For how long?"

"One year."

"Shit…"

It was better to have a deadline when making such a violent oath. If I forced
a permanent oath then the object of the oath might go crazy. If they were
given hope that the oath would one day end, the other person would agree
to the oath more easily.
"…I understand. I will make the oath." Sparks sprung from Han Myungoh's
heart and the oath was completed.

Now there was a question I wanted to ask Han Myungoh. "Department
Head Han Myungoh. How are you still alive?"

Han Myungoh started telling his story. The hardships he suffered after
separating from us at Chungmuro and how hard it was for him…

He tried to make himself look as poor as possible and I interrupted in the
middle.

"Tell me the important things."

"W-What do you mean?"

"At that time, you obviously received the demon king's curse. How did you
become a subordinate of the demon king? Asmodeus isn't that simple an
existence."

One of the 72 demon kings, Asmodeus. No matter how long Han
Myungoh's tongue, he didn't have the ability to bewitch the demon king.

In addition, Han Myungoh didn't have a unique story. The demon kings
were just as jaded and bored as the constellations. The story of a
department head of a big company wouldn't be sufficient to even talk to the
demon king.

Han Myungoh licked his lips for a long time and his expression distorted in
a miserable manner. I was about to rush him when Han Myungoh opened
his mouth. "…I gave birth."

"Huh?"

"Kuock… I, I…
I thought I heard wrong. I was about to ask again when Han Myungoh burst
out crying. "I gave birth to a child!"
             Chapter 205: Ep. 39 - Unidentified Wall, II


Unfortunately, Han Myungoh's words didn't continue. Han Myungoh was
knocked unconscious because he received a penalty from disclosing some
of the details of his contract with Asmodeus.

I felt a bit sad because it was broken off at the exciting part.

「 Kim Dokja thought: In any case, the demon kings and constellations
have started to show interest in this world. 」

The land of abandoned scenarios, the Demon Realm. This world, which had
long been shunned by the constellations, was starting to receive attention
again.

–Humans can't beat them! Compared to them, we are just insignificant
bugs!
Han Myungoh had said this several times. He had been in the Demon
Realm for several months so he was well aware of the strength of the senior
nobles and demon kings.

This despair was understandable. In fact, even the early-mid Yoo
Joonghyuk had struggled in the Demon Realm. Of course, that was Yoo
Joonghyuk's story. I was different.

My stomach started growling because I had stayed awake all night. I
headed to the pub and asked Mark to cook some simple dishes. Jang
Hayoung was sitting absentmindedly at a table. I quietly approached him
and sat down.

"Hiik!"

"You say that every time."

Jang Hayoung stared at me with an ugly expression and screamed, "What is
it? What? What other issue are you coming to create?"

"Why are you so grouchy?"

"…Never mind."

"Why? What happened?"

Jang Hayoung couldn't easily answer my question and stared at the plate in
front of him. I knew that I couldn't urge him and just waited.

Mark glanced between Jang Hayoung and I. It was unknown what he was
thinking but he suddenly winked. After a while, Jang Hayoung opened his
mouth.

"Why did you let me join the Revolutionary Army?"

"What?"
"I'm not a guardian or revolutionary. I'm not the chairman of the Civil
Council like Aileen."

[The character 'Jang Hayoung' has used Lethargy Lv. 4.]

[The character 'Jang Hayoung' has used Self-Loathing Lv. 10.]

Damn, it was starting. I had forgotten for a while. If Yoo Joonghyuk
suffered from the 'regression depression' then this person suffered from a
thorough 'self-loathing'.

I didn't think there were any main characters of Ways of Survival who were
sane.

The small shoulders quivered. I would feel better if I hit him on the
shoulder but it would be hard for him to feel comforted.

[Your understanding of the character 'Jang Hayoung' has increased.]

Jang Hayoung stared out the window. He seemed to be looking at Aileen
who was cleaning up the previous incident. Jang Hayoung spoke again, "…
Night will come again. Will you still be able to protect the people?"

"Maybe not," I answered honestly. "I don't know all the executioners. It
is impossible to catch all of them before tomorrow's Night." There were
seven executioners who hadn't been caught.

If those seven people made up their minds and started attacking people,
tomorrow night would be a bloody festival. I added before Jang Hayoung
could fall into despair.

"There is no other way to stop it. We must find the fighter."

The fighter. It was the only position that could deal with an executioner
during the Night. If I could find that position, it wouldn't be unreasonable to
restore the atmosphere.
However, Mark interrupted from where he was cooking. "…I'm sorry but
there probably won't be a fighter."

"What? Mark, how do you know this?"

"There is no one from the old generation to pass on the skills of a 'fighter'."
Unlike other positions, a fighter could only receive the position through
'succession'. Mark kept speaking. "After the fighter died protecting the
former revolutionary, there was no successor."

I already knew this information. In fact, there was no fighter in this
industrial complex. In the original novel, Yoo Joonghyuk had been very
confused by this. I bit into the sandwich that Mark gave me.

"If there isn't a successor then we have to create one. Inherit the position
from another fighter."

"As far as I know, there are no fighters left in the 73rd Demon Realm."

"I'm not going to find them in the Demon Realm."

"What?"

I glanced at Jang Hayoung. Now was the time. I spoke to the blank-looking
Jang Hayoung. "Hey, talk to the wall."

"W-What does that mean?"

"You have a 'wall'. Every time you try to learn something, that wall blocks
you."

"H-How do you know about the wall?" The startled Jang Hayoung stared at
me.

"There are ways for me to know," I smirked and replied.
Other people might not know it but Jang Hayoung had a 'wall'. To be
precise, it was a wall called the Unidentified Wall. This wall had been
blocking Jang Hayoung's growth so far.

"Isn't it because of the wall that you never learnt any skills? That's why
you're like this. Lethargic, self-loathing…"

"W-What?"

"I know you think it is a wall of talent. However, it isn't a wall of talent. It
has a different purpose."

"No, how do you…!"

"In any case, quickly talk to it. You can communicate with that wall."

Jang Hayoung's face turned red after hearing that he could talk to the wall. I
wanted to tell him not to worry. After all, I was in the same boat in regards
to talking to a wall. Jang Hayoung hesitated before slowing opening his
mouth.

"T-That…"

"Quickly."

A moment passed before Jang Hayoung triggered the skill.

[The character 'Jang Hayoung' has used Unidentified Wall Lv. 1!]

Jang Hayoung's pupils were white. It wasn't visible to me but perhaps in
Jang Hayoung's vision, he would be surrounded by a white wall.

A pure white wall with nothing written on it. It wasn't strange for Jang
Hayoung to get a mental illness if he was blocked by such a wall every time
he tried to learn a skill.

Jang Hayoung carefully opened his mouth. "Excuse me… Wall-nim?"
Surprisingly, I also heard a message the moment Jang Hayoung spoke.

[The 'Unidentified Wall' is giving off a wrinkled impression.]

I didn't know why. Maybe it was because I had a similar 'wall'. Either way,
it was good.

[The 'Unidentified Wall' is looking at its master.]

[The 'Unidentified Wall' says: You aren't qualified yet.]

As expected, it was just as petulant as the original novel. I was prepared.

"Hey, don't do that and give your permission. If you don't help, your kid
will die."

Jang Hayoung was surprised by my sudden words and stared at me. The
next moment, the Unidentified Wall spoke.

[The 'Unidentified Wall' says: Who are you?]

[The 'Unidentified Wall' says: How can you hear my voice?]

"It isn't important who I am. Just give your permission. If it is level one,
can't he use the minimum of features? Why are you blocking him?"

[The 'Unidentified Wall' is frowning.]

It was angry at my words and sparks appeared around Jang Hayoung. The
probability was putting pressure on me, a constellation. Myth rated
attributes were truly different.

…This wouldn't be as easy as I expected. I stepped back from Jang
Hayoung.

The sparks that suddenly appeared in the air surprised Mark and the other
pub customers. Once I had them evacuated, I opened my mouth again. "Are
you going to keep acting like this? It isn't good for you. Won't you have to
find a new host if he dies?"

The sparks of probability once again appeared. It was a measure of Jang
Hayoung's strong potential that he could create such a force with the power
of a single skill despite not being a constellation. Thus, I needed to awaken
Jang Hayoung here.

[The 'Unidentified Wall' says: You are impudent.]

The sparks that burst from Jang Hayoung's body became increasingly
intense. I was a bit baffled because I didn't know the reaction would be to
this extent. It happened the moment I thought a small probability storm
would occur here.

[The exclusive skill 'Fourth Wall' is strongly activated!]

The sparks around me calmed down at once. To be exact, a larger spark
seemed to have swallowed the surroundings sparks.

[The Fourth Wall greets the Unidentified Wall.]

[The 'Unidentified Wall' is surprised.]

I was also shocked. The 'walls' could converse with each other?

[The Fourth Wall greets the Unidentified Wall with pleasure.]

Jang Hayoung's face was turning reddish-white. He was clearly seeing this
scene.

The Fourth Wall opened its mouth. 「 Fri end. 」

[The Unidentified Wall is starting to shake.]

I didn't know about the communication between the walls but just by saying
hello, the air around Jang Hayoung started to distort into a mysterious form.
[The 'Unidentified Wall' says: You, what are you…?]

The air around me shook faintly. The Fourth Wall was moving in a form
different from usual.

I couldn't express it well. One thing was clear. It seemed to be angry.

[The 'Unidentified Wall' is complaining about the pain!]

[The 'Unidentified Wall' is complaining about the pain!]

[The 'Unidentified Wall' is complaining about the pain!]

There were brilliant sparks as Jang Hayoung grabbed his head and
screamed. How much time passed? There was a heavy feeling and the
Unidentified Wall sent a message.

[The 'Unidentified Wall' says: W-Who are you?]




Honestly, I had no idea why Jang Hayoung had such a wall.

Ways of Survival didn't explain exactly what the Unidentified Wall was. I
thought it would mention it in the ending but… of course, this didn't mean
it was impossible to predict the identity of this wall.

The existence of this wall was presumably related to Jang Hayoung's job
before he moved dimensions.

"This is the first time I have seen…"

Jang Hayoung was staring into the air with a very perplexed expression.
[The Unidentified Wall has recognized its master as the incarnation 'Jang
Hayoung'.]

It was a complicated procedure but with the help of the Fourth Wall, Jang
Hayoung succeeded in being acknowledged by the Unidentified Wall. Then
a new window popped up in front of Jang Hayoung for the very first time.

[Enter the modifier or name of the presence you want to send a message to.]

Thanks to the Fourth Wall, I also saw the message. Jang Hayoung stared at
me. "…W-What is this? What should I enter?"

In fact, it was because of this ability that I had to bring Jang Hayoung with
me. I had to borrow the wall's strength through Jang Hayoung so that I
could have the power to fight against those fucking nebulae.

"Please enter the names I will tell you."

"…Yes."

I called out several names. They were all names of characters who had
fought with fighters in the Demon Realm in the original novel of Ways of
Survival. Then another window popped up.

[Please enter a message to send.]

"What should I write?"

"I want to become a 'fighter'. Please help."

"…Will it work?"

"I don't know. Just try it first."

Jang Hayoung sent the message. Then we waited. One minute, two minutes.
Three minutes… 10 minutes.
Jang Hayoung asked, "Did I do it properly?"

"…I guess it failed."

The damn Star Stream had no consideration for newbies. I asked for help so
earnestly but no one sent a reply. We sent a few more messages.

[I'm looking for someone who will make me a 'fighter'.]

[I need the skill of the 'fighter'.]

[Please help.]

No matter how many times he sent the message, there was no reply. Maybe
they thought it was a spam message and didn't answer… damn.

I had no talent for writing so I didn't know what message I should send to
get a reply. It would've been nice of Han Sooyoung was here. She would've
come up with a good idea.

Jang Hayoung frowned and thought about something for a while. Then he
opened his mouth. "…I need to get a reply? Can I write what I want?"

"Have you thought of something?"

Jang Hayoung lightly nodded and typed his message.

[I am a 15 year old schoolgirl.]

"Hey, wait―"

Before I could stop him, Jang Hayoung pressed the Send Message button.

[The message was sent to random constellations because no recipient was
entered.]
The message wasn't even sent to a particular person. I shouted in a
frustrated manner. "You are dealing with constellations! Do you think that
would work?"

"…Just watch."

What the hell did this guy eat…

The next moment.

[A reply has arrived!]

We stared at each other with bemused expressions and confirmed the reply.
To my surprise, the constellation who replied was someone I knew.

[Sender―Abyssal Black Flame Dragon]
             Chapter 206: Ep. 39 - Unidentified Wall, III


Jang Hayoung started talking in earnest with the Abyssal Black Flame
Dragon and laughed with pleasure. I watched Jang Hayoung and slightly
scolded him,

"What's so funny?"

"It's just funny to talk to this kid."

Jang Hayoung was a strange guy who treated a high ranking constellation
as a friend but the even more ridiculous thing was that the Abyssal Black
Flame Dragon had sent a reply.

This jerk only cared about Han Sooyoung so why was he responding to the
wrong message?

Then as if to defend the black dragon, Jang Hayoung shook his head. "I
don't think he is a bad guy like you think."
"What nonsense is this? Did you fall for him?"

"He is more gentle when speaking than you think."

"Gentle? A bastard who replied to a 15 year old schoolgirl is gentle?"

I wondered if I should explain the nasty context when Jang Hayoung
replied, "He replied because I am 15 years old."

"What? He replied because you are 15 years old? What a complete trash."

I knew that the Abyssal Black Flame Dragon was cruel and tasteless but I
didn't know he had such preferences. I was suddenly a bit worried for Han
Sooyoung.

"Why are you so agitated? He is just happy to have a friend. He says he is
15 years old."

"What bullshit! I don't know how old he is but is there a 15 year old
constellation?"

At this moment, a setting suddenly rose in my mind.

「The constellations living in the eternal Star Stream are accustomed to
confining themselves in certain frameworks to protect their sense of self. A
representative example is age. They tend to transfer themselves to a specific
age and think they are that age. 」

…Don't tell me? Even so, wasn't 15 years old too much? Really?

Then a scream was heard from inside the meeting room. It was Han
Myungoh. I turned and spoke to the startled Jang Hayoung.

"I have to go talk to him. I'll be back in a minute."

"I know. What should I ask?"
"Just let him go. In any case, he isn't a warrior. I'd rather you talk to
someone else. Don't you have the list I gave you earlier? Try them again."

Jang Hayoung nodded. I was uneasy after seeing his excited expression but
I thought it would be okay. This was originally his ability.

The awakening of the Unidentified Wall was a bit faster than the original
novel but this was the best for now. The industrial complex's revolution was
impossible without the help of the wall.

I opened the door to the meeting room. Han Myungoh had just woken up
and was covered in sweat.

"Why did I faint?"

I quietly closed the door of the meeting room and replied, "You fainted
after remembering the pain of childbirth."

Sweat was flowing down Han Myungoh's face like he had a nightmare.

"That's it?"

"Asmodeus probably cursed you as well."

"That son of a bitch…"

Han Myungoh expressed his hatred for the demon king more directly than
before. It was originally a dangerous thing but now he had left Asmodeus'
sight thanks to the Four Yin Demonic Beheading Sword.

I pulled out the chair again and sat back down.

"Listen again. What child did you give birth to and why did you receive
Asmodeus' favour?"

"…I first have to explain why I had a child."
"I have a rough idea. Is it due to the dark keeper that we fought before?"

Right before we split apart, Han Myungoh had been affected by the
parasitic tentacles of the dark keeper. Usually, such a thing didn't
necessarily mean the conception of a demon species but it happened
directly with Han Myungoh "That isn't the case. It isn't because of the dark
keeper that I had the child."

"Then…"

"It is because of the curse."

Asmodeus' curse dealt the final blow to Han Myungoh who was infected by
the dark keeper. Asmodeus' curse consumed probability to realize the 'most
terrible thing' that the target thought of. In other words…

"I understand. By the way, is that possible? A man's body giving birth…"

"Don't ask about that part."

I lightly nodded. It was the minimum courtesy for the elder who had an
unbelievable experience. We were silent for a moment. It suddenly felt
weird that I was talking to Han Myungoh like this.

「 Kim Dokja thought: It is a strange feeling. 」

Before the destruction came, Han Myungoh was a person who made life
hard for 'office worker' Kim Dokja. He was one of the top-ranked bosses to
be avoided. Certainly, there were days like that. It was a time when I felt
bitter over the 3,000 convenience store bento and when I had to count every
bit of my monthly salary.

Now those days were gone. Kim Dokja and Han Myungoh were no longer
an office worker and department head. Instead, they were talking about a
'demon king'.
"Kim Dok… no, Yoo Joonghyuk-ssi. Do you know what it's like to be a
father?"

I was a bit baffled by Han Myungoh's sudden words. "I don't know."

"I learnt."

In fact, it was hard to say if Han Myungoh should be called a mother or a
father but I decided to move on because this wasn't the important thing.
Han Myungoh had a serious expression.

"It was painful."

The words sounded much more painful than any of Han Myungoh's
previous statements.

"I was also happy."

I looked at Han Myungoh with surprise. At this moment, I realized the
identity of my strange feeling. Maybe I didn't want to admit it. Everybody
changed. Whether they were good or evil, a child or an adult.

"She is a very pretty daughter."

"I would love to see her once. Is she in the Demon Realm?"

"Now she isn't with me." His expression darkened and I got a hunch.

"Then…?"

"It is a long story. Will you help?"

"Tell me first. I would like to hear your story."

Han Myungoh hadn't come directly into the household of the demon king.
In a place that I didn't know, Han Myungoh's story had continued. He took
his daughter and broke through the scenario alone.
Capture the flag.

The war of kings.

The five disasters.

I couldn't believe such a story had happened in places I couldn't see. I
couldn't believe that Han Myungoh could show such devotion to someone.
On the other hand, I had to admit it.

I was no longer the old Kim Dokja. The man in front of me wasn't the old
Han Myungoh. I didn't know if the birth of his child was the trigger. The
only thing that was clear was that Han Myungoh had changed.

"It was tough."

"Yes, it was hard. I almost died many times. At the end, I fell into a crisis I
couldn't escape from."

He was finally driven to the brink at a time when the Dark Castle scenario
hadn't officially started yet. Han Myungoh was surrounded by demons and
demon nobles and realized he could no longer defend his child.

Then he prayed for the first time in his life. He prayed for someone to
protect his child. If this child lived, he would do anything. To his surprise, a
presence answered his prayers.

–A beautiful child.

"It was Asmodeus."

"…Did the demon king steal your child?"

I felt bad because of the terrible things I imagined. Asmodeus was the Devil
of Lust and Wrath. It was obvious what would happen if a child entered his
hands. However, Han Myungoh's expression was calm.
"She is safe. After all, she is a child born from Asmodeus' curse. And… the
demon king isn't in a situation where he can touch my daughter."

"What does that mean?"

"The demon king has made my daughter his 'incarnation body'."

I seemed to know what happened.

It might be a whim but the demon king Asmodeus made Han Myungoh's
child one of his incarnation bodies. As one of the child's parents, Han
Myungoh was given a demon noble title.

"…That's how I became a demon."

After hearing this, I felt that Han Myungoh's life was very difficult. His life
might be considered successfully because he got a title but it might be
considered a failure because his child was taken…

Han Myungoh's eyes were sombre as he opened his mouth again.

"I want to save my daughter."

For a moment, I thought I heard wrong. What did he want?

"I won't speak long words. Help me. I won't forget your grace if you help
me this once."

What was going on?

He filmed a life theatre all by himself and now he wanted me to help him?

"You've been watching me for a long time and should know well. I am a
human who is a coward. However, this is something I can't concede on."

"…"
"Last night was out of my expectations. I was scared but I actually didn't
hurt anyone. The executioners were excited by the appearance of the
guardian and did what they wanted."

Han Myungoh swore the Oath of Existence and couldn't lie to me. Then this
wasn't a lie. I decided to respond rationally. "I'm sorry but I have no plans
to fight Asmodeus."

This would become complicated if one of the 72 demon kings were lost. It
would attract foreign forces when the revolution hadn't even begun yet.

Han Myungoh's next reaction was surprising. "You don't have to fight
Asmodeus. You just have to continue doing what you are doing. Start a
revolution and kill the duke. I will help you."

"…Aren't you on the duke's side?"

"Originally that was the case. Now that things have become like this, I think
it will be okay to help you."

"What do you mean?"

"Asmodeus didn't want me to help the duke. He had a suggestion for me. If
I made the story he wanted, he would return my daughter. That's why I
attached myself to Duke Syswitz."

This part wasn't in the original novel. It was no wonder. From the
beginning, Han Myungoh wasn't present in the novel.

I struggled for a moment before asking, "What story does the demon king
want?"

"The king of the 73rd Demon Realm."
Han Myungoh slowly raised his head and stared at me. Han Myungoh's
eyes were exactly the same as the interviewer on the day I joined Mino
Soft.

"The demon king… he told me to make the '73rd Demon King' with my
own hands."




Yoo Joonghyuk was starting at the night sky with indifferent eyes.

The sky with different constellations from Earth was visible. Yoo
Joonghyuk's body leaning against the Splitting the Sky Sword looked
thinner than usual as he counted the stars. His body was covered with blood
and his face was wounded. There was a second grade monster that had just
been defeated lying in front of him.

"…The 15th scenario is finished."

Planet Lugratia.

Yoo Joonghyuk came here through a 'personal scenario' from one of the
constellations of this world.

Originally, he would've proceeded with Earth's scenarios. However, he had
strong colleagues this regression and decided to leave the scenarios to them.
The situation was growing faster than his previous regression. It was right
for him to stockpile his power when he could. This current power wouldn't
be enough if he entered the scenarios in the 20s.

'I need to be stronger'.

That's why Yoo Joonghyuk replaced the main scenario with 'personal
scenarios' since the 11th main scenario. He also picked the hardest personal
scenarios with the most rewards. Sometimes he even challenged personal
scenarios that were too reckless for him.

Fight, fight and fight again.

As always, he trained and overworked his body and spirit. He thought it
would fill a bit of the sense of loss that he couldn't understand. Strangely,
the more he fought, the greater the emptiness became.

[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' is looking at you sadly.]

Yoo Joonghyuk frowned and glared at the sky.

Demon-like Judge of Fire. Yoo Joonghyuk didn't know why this
constellation came so often recently. It was a constellation he had little
contact with in the past.

[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' is asking why you aren't
looking for Kim Dokja.]

"Kim Dokja is dead."

[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' is shaking her head while
holding back tears.]

Yoo Joonghyuk didn't understand why a constellation was dwelling so
much on the death of a single incarnation.

The thing he didn't understand was the next message.

[Your notoriety is spreading in the 73rd Demon Realm.]

'Again?'

The message was unforgettable.
Yoo Joonghyuk didn't know why his notoriety was rising in a distant place
like the 73rd Demon Realm. At first, he thought Kim Dokja was alive and
impersonating him. However, even if Kim Dokja was alive, there was no
reason for him to do this…

'…Wait. Perhaps Kim Dokja is alive and in danger?

Maybe Kim Dokja was alive. Maybe he lived alone in the horizon of the
story without any scenarios and beyond that damn fate.

Thus, he survived. Maybe he was asking for help. That guy, who always
moved ahead by himself, was in danger and asking for help for the first
time.

There was no way to ask for help in the absence of a channel so…

Yoo Joonghyuk's expression became complicated as he stared up at the sky.

'The 73rd Demon Realm…'
            Chapter 207: Ep. 39 - Unidentified Wall, IV


「 Kim Dokja thought: I don't know if people are doing well. 」

I wondered if I could see the story of Earth again on the screen but there
was nothing to be seen. It wasn't easy for the wenny people to easily steal
the videos of the dokkaebis.

Night was fast approaching. I hadn't sleep well for a few days but the
condition of my body wasn't bad because Aileen had repaired my stories.

"I have temporarily fixed it but you need to be careful with outside
activities.
Don't you know? You are still outside the main scenario."

"You sound like a doctor."

"I can't speak like a clock maker because I'm not dealing with clocks now."
Aileen watched me before standing up with their repair equipment. Many
things had happened in the past two days but she didn't seem dissatisfied
with the current situation.

「 Kim Dokja thought: If I hadn't come, Aileen would've kept being a clock
maker. 」

In many regressions when Yoo Joonghyuk hadn't come to the Demon
Realm, Aileen would've actually survived. She quietly made clocks that
told the time of her home planet and reflected alone on the disappearance of
her planet. Sometimes she would struggle with Jang Hayoung or go out to
eat dishes made by Mark… maybe it was a happier life for Aileen.

"Do you know? The number of people who had been looking for clocks has
increased in the last few days."

Aileen looked at me with an unknown gaze. I hesitated for a moment before
asking, "Did their clocks break as a group?"

"Originally, people of the industrial complex don't use clocks."

"Why?"

"It is because there is no use in knowing something like time."

I remembered something I read in Ways of Survival. Someone had referred
to the Demon Realm as the 'city that lost time'.

"Then what about the hours of the Night?"

"Can they change their fate if they know when Night comes?"

A fear that was too old became a law. It had happened for so many years
that Night in the industrial complex had become a natural thing.
Once every three days, someone would die and their story would be used as
fertilizer in the factory.

No matter what life they lived, the stories they contained or the tomorrow
they would live. Then the rest of the people would live for another three
days.

"However, there was a Night where no one died. It is because of you."

"…"

"People have started to fear the Night again. It isn't a natural thing and can
be resolved. They think they perhaps they can live tomorrow. This is what
they are thinking."

My eyes suddenly fell to the watch around Aileen's wrist. There were three
hours left until Night arrived…

I listened to the ticking second hand as Aileen remained silent. Perhaps
some people in the industrial complex were watching clocks like we were
now.

Perhaps tonight would be harder and more intense than last night. Then
why? I listened to the sound of the second hand moving and felt a bit
comforted. I wasn't the one who should be comforted.

"Thank you."

"…I'm not saying this to praise you. It just doesn't look good if the
revolutionary is depressed."

Aileen turned away. I laughed at Aileen and quickly added. "Ah, wait a
minute."

"…What?"

"Speaking of clocks, can you make something else?"
"Something else?"

"It is called… a smartphone."

"What is that? Is it magic technology?"

I was wondering how to explain it and gave an overview of the feature of
the smartphone. Then Aileen spoke like she knew, "Do you mean
something like a communication device? It shows a small panel?"

"That's right."

"However, there isn't a dokkaebi channel here so communication isn't
possible…"

Considering past experiences, it didn't matter if communication was
possible. My phone synced automatically so the text file would be created.

"Don't worry about it. Can you make it today?"

"I'm afraid it will take at least three days… I will try my best."

"I know. Then do your best."

I left Aileen's workshop and headed towards the pub. The people who
found me on the streets stared with strange eyes. Some greeted me after
making eye contact and others lightly gathered both hands together. As
Aileen said, I could see something that looked like watches on their wrists.

「 Yoo Joonghyuk felt lonely as he saw these watches. They got their time
back but he still wasn't

living in this time. Yoo Joonghyuk suddenly thought. If so, where do I live
in those countless hours? 」

It was the monologue of Yoo Joonghyuk, who once saved the Demon
Realm. It was also one of my favourite scenes from Ways of Survival.
I suddenly seemed to understand a bit of his mind. To the regressor Yoo
Joonghyuk, the time in these worlds didn't belong to him. In a life that
could go back over and over again, the present time was meaningless.

Once this was over, I would ask Aileen to make me a watch. If he had
something like this, he might become more attached to this world. Maybe
the regression depression would get better…

I knew that this world wouldn't disappear when he went back in time but
without him, it would be difficult to clear the remaining scenarios.

"Ahahahaha, this is really funny."

I opened the pub door and saw the laughing Jang Hayoung. From this
distance, he looked like a junior high school student.

"What are you doing?"

This time, he didn't make the 'hiik' sound. Instead, Jang Hayoung avoided
my eyes like a child caught by his parents doing something bad.

"I-I was doing what you asked me to do!"

"Did a fighter reply?"

"That…" Jang Hayoung licked his lips for a while before eventually
confessing the truth.

"…None of the fighters replied?"

"R-Really? No one gave me a response!"

"What did you say?"

"I am a 15 year old schoolgirl…"
My forehead vein bulged. "Hey! They didn't reply because you sent that
message!"

"But it worked before…"

"Do you think they are all like the black flame dragon? How many
messages did you send?"

"A total of 300…"

Maybe they thought it was a spam message and blocked it. Damn.

"It's a big deal. I only know the fighters on that list."

Jang Hayoung realized that he was in trouble and paled. "Then what now?"
This was why I needed Ways of Survival. If I had the text file would've
allowed me to re-read things and search for more information about the
fighters.

"Let's find out if there are any other fighters. For now…"

I was reminded of a few modifiers for the constellations. Was there
someone among the constellations who could help us?

"Write a message to Prisoner of the Golden Headband."

"…Isn't he a powerful constellation?"

I didn't know if he had any skills related to a fighter. However, now was the
time to grab onto any piece of straw.

Jang Hayoung typed a message and we waited. One minute, two minutes…
five minutes.

Jang Hayoung shook his head. "There is no reply."

"Write this." I dictated the contents of the message again.
Then Jang Hayoung was amazed. "Can I use something like this?"

"You just have to get his attention once."

The Great Sage, Heaven's Equal was a lazy guy. It must be to this degree to
get a reply. Less than 10 seconds after Jang Hayoung sent this message, the
following notification popped up.

[A reply has arrived!]

"A-A reply is here!"

"Is that right?"

For reference, the message I sent was as followed:

[Regrow your hair.]

Every time I did something, he would pull out his hair in the indirect
message. Thus, I figured that he had hair loss. I asked, "What did he say?"

"If we meet, he will kill me."

"What else?"

"He asked who I am. Should I say Yoo Joonghyuk?"

"…Don't answer."

It would be fun to say Yoo Joonghyuk but it would only make the matter
bigger. I rubbed my temples. The Great Sage, Heaven's Equal ate the wrong
bait so we had to find another way.

"Demon-like Judge of Fire… I don't think it is good to call her.
Secretive Plotter… I still don't know his identity…" It had become
troublesome.
"Queen of the Darkest Spring and God of Wine and Ecstasy are from
Olympus…"

If I revealed that I was alive, some of them would help. The problem
was that if I clarified my identity, the nebulae would notice my survival.
"It is difficult."

It was the first challenge I encountered after entering the Demon Realm.
There wasn't much time left until Night arrived.

If Jang Hayoung didn't become a fighter then all the plans I set up for
tonight would be wasted. At this time, Jang Hayoung wondered, "Can the
black dragon help?"

I paused for a moment as I thought about the identity of the 'black dragon'.
"…You're still talking to him?"

"Yes."

"Forget that guy. He probably has nothing."

"No, he was a fighter in the Demon Realm for a while."

…The Abyssal Black Flame Dragon was once a fighter? That story never
came out in Ways of Survival.

Come to think of it, details of the Abyssal Black Flame Dragon were never
described in earnest so it wasn't an impossible story…

"However, he didn't like the rules of the scenario and killed them all."

"What?"

"The duke, the revolutionary and the executioners, he killed them all?"
Something suddenly came up. Perhaps it was when the 64th Demon Realm
was integrated? There was one such madman in the history of the Demon
Realm. That person was the Abyssal Black Flame Dragon?

"Ask him if he can pass on the fighter's skills to you."

The Abyssal Black Flame Dragon was a constellation of the evil system
and sending a message to him wouldn't be too obvious. It would be best if
we could get help from him.

Jang Hayoung entered something and then he suddenly lit up. "It isn't
a problem to give it to me since he isn't using it anyway."

"Really?"

…It was an unexpected help. The problem could be solved in a way I hadn't
thought of?

In fact, neither the black dragon or Kim Namwoon were good guys. I had to
carefully read the parts where they appeared once I got the text file back.

By the way, Jang Hayoung's words weren't over. "However, he has one
condition?"

That's right. That jerk couldn't give it away so easily.

"In any case, any transaction through the wall requires a payment. What is
his condition?"

"He has a problem recently."

"A problem?"

"He isn't getting along very well with his incarnation…"

"His incarnation?"
"His incarnation keeps ignoring him."

If it was the incarnation of the Abyssal Black Flame Dragon…

"She is in a crisis right now but she isn't listening to his words…"

…A crisis? I quickly ordered Jang Hayoung. "Tell him to explain the story
in detail."
             Chapter 208: Ep. 39 - Unidentified Wall, V


There was the sound of a blade penetrating the heart and the last man fell.

"K-Kuock… d-dog…"

He tried to squeeze out a curse but the man's mouth was crushed by the
woman's foot. He was the last man.

Han Sooyoung looked around the office that had become a bloodbath. "…I
barely killed them all. At any rate, the adaptation of the Korean people is
dirty and fast."

This was the home of 'Law of the Jungle', an incarnation club of Gyeonggi
Province. As soon as the scenario started, they chose a useful sponsor and
turned themselves into a criminal group. They were those who refused the
control of the government. If she didn't kill them now, they would become a
cancer of the Korean Peninsula. According to the original novel, they were
bound to be such people.
"Damn Kim Dokja." She started cursing but didn't feel any better. Thus,
Han
Sooyoung added one more thing. "Bastard Yoo Joonghyuk."

She thought of the two people who went their own separate ways and Han
Sooyoung felt like an abandoned food processor.

"Dammit. Kim Dokja has a reason but what's wrong with Yoo Joonghyuk?"

The moment that Yoo Joonghyuk left Seoul Dome, he continued to do
things that weren't in the original third regression. He stayed alone in a
room, talked to himself and then threw the Korean Peninsula scenarios
away for the personal scenarios…

Thanks to this, cleaning up the remnants were left entirely to Han
Sooyoung.

"What is he thinking… Shit…"

In any case, she was currently the last person who read Ways of Survival.
Kim Dokja and Yoo Joonghyuk weren't present, leaving her the only one
responsible for the Korean Peninsula.

She sighed and quietly left the scene of slaughter. "Ah, what a surprise.
What are you doing here?"

There was a woman waiting for her at the office doorway. The woman
wore a combat uniform that clung to her body and her hair flowed around
her in a cool manner. As if conscious of the body that was revealed, she
wore a wide coat on her shoulders. It was a refreshing but very beautiful
face.

Well, this was what the media stated.

Han Sooyoung wondered, "I thought you were busy with TV these days.
Isn't this the case?"
Han Sooyoung stared at Yoo Sangah with a slightly unfriendly look. Yoo
Sangah moved away from the wall she was leaning on and looked down at
Han Sooyoung. There was a slight difference in their heights.

There was a moment of confrontation before Yoo Sangah opened her
mouth with a brief sigh. "…How long are you going to act this way?"

"What?"

"You can't kill all of them just because law and order is gone."

Han Sooyoung was too lazy to explain and just waved her hands. Yoo
Sangah didn't know. What type of people belonged to Law of the Jungle? In
addition, she didn't know what they would do.

She didn't know which was why she could argue with such childish justice.

"They are the ones who will do something wrong in the future."

"However, you didn't give them a chance."

"It has already been determined. You don't know anything." Han Sooyoung
replied while passing by Yoo Sangah.

She couldn't share the future. The information that many people knew
would become less valuable and would change the future. Kim Dokja
would've probably done the same thing. So…

"Three Ways to Survive in a Ruined World."

Han Sooyoung instantly stopped walking at Yoo Sangah's words.

"Isn't that the book the prophets call the Revelation?"

"…You must've heard something funny."

"Did you read it?"
Han Sooyoung bit her lips before opening her mouth. "You don't need to
know."

"The constellations seem to have no idea about this book."

The story had slowly spread so it wasn't strange. Some of the readers were
outside Seoul Dome and there were also the rumours that the prophets had
leaked. Yoo Sangah also knew that she was the First Apostle.

"Did Kim Dokja read it?" That's how he knows the information of the
future."

"Who knows?"

It was an uncomfortable topic. Han Sooyoung pulled out a dagger. The
information about Ways of Survival was filtered but she didn't know how
long it would continue. Thus, she had to reduce the number of mouths…

"Why did he do that?"

Han Sooyoung turned her head at the sudden sad tone.

"Why did Dokja-ssi make such a choice even though he knows the future?"

Han Sooyoung looked at Yoo Sangah's face and seemed to know why she
came. Han Sooyoung stared quietly at Yoo Sangah's face. She had been an
ordinary office worker before the scenarios started.

'She was in the same company as Kim Dokja'.

Why? Han Sooyoung suddenly felt hot. "Everybody talks about Kim Dokja
everywhere I go. They don't know anything about Kim Dokja."

Han Sooyoung took short breaths as a terrible voice flowed out. Without
knowing why she was so angry, Han Sooyoung cried out. "He is a selfish
bastard. He only thinks about himself from beginning to end."
"…"

"The person who fooled people to the end, lied and disappeared as a
hypocrite, what do you know about him? You don't even know if he is dead
or alive."

A fleeting scene ran through her head. It was Kim Dokja's eyes looking at
her in the tenth scenario. It was that damn expression that made her pull out
her knife first.

"No, he can't be dead. I'm sure he is alive and living well in another story."
"Do you really think so?"

"You don't know Kim Dokja."

There was a deep sense of self-deprecation in her cold tone. Nobody knew
Kim Dokja, including Han Sooyoung herself. Yet Yoo Sangah's answer
was different. "No, I know."

"What?"

"A person doesn't change so suddenly." Yoo Sangah's voice was calm. "The
scenarios started and for a while, Dokja-ssi was like a different person. A
man who could calm down in front of life-threatening situations and kill
unknown beasts without hesitation. He was different from the Kim Dokja I
knew."

"You probably didn't know Kim Dokja very well."

"Even so, Dokja-ssi is still Dokja-ssi."

Han Sooyoung closed her mouth.

"A person who likes reading books rather than building up his specs. His
presentation abilities aren't good but he will listen to someone else's
presentation…"
That Kim Dokja was different from the one Han Sooyoung knew. The
person who knew Kim Dokja was talking.

"Thus, he was obviously lonely."

Somewhere in front of her, Kim Dokja seemed to be making a face. In a
world with no one… Kim Dokja might be looking at the sky alone in a
world that no one knew.

"Han Sooyoung-ssi. I have to go and rescue Dokja-ssi."

Han Sooyoung saw her determination and felt somehow defeated.

'You are a lucky person, Kim Dokja. People are worrying about you'.

Han Sooyoung was about to open her mouth when a message was heard in
the air.

[A new main scenario has started!]

"Son of a bitch."

The Great Hole was opening in the air. The cries of monsters were heard
from somewhere. The surprised Yoo Sangah and Han Sooyoung stood back
to back. A giant monster was swooping down through the Great Hole. Then
the dokkaebi's voice was heard.

[The wave pattern is obvious and very slow, but I put it in because people
seem to be too free these days!]

Yoo Sangah frowned at the sudden emergence of a situation and frowned.
"…Was this the original content?"

"I don't know. I don't remember everything."

This was why she didn't want to do it alone. She knew the future but the
information she knew was about flimsy things. Kim Dokja knew many
rounds and Yoo Joonghyuk who made it through the rounds might be able
to make a breakthrough but not Han Sooyoung.

The giant serpent flew through the dark clouds and landed on the ground.
Every time the long tail swept over the ground, the high-rise buildings
collapsed.

This was a third grade strange dragon species, the Kragagon. It was the
name of the monster who descended as a disaster in the 12th scenario.

'How do we beat that?'

Han Sooyoung tried hard to recall the contents of the original novel but no
matter how she thought about it, a strategy didn't pop up. Then the only
way left was a full-scale battle. Fortunately, there was Yoo Sangah right
next to her. They weren't colleagues but it was better than nothing.

[The stigma 'Black Flames Lv. 6' has been activated!]

She focused her magic power on her dagger while activating the skills of
the weapon.

[The third grade strange dragon species 'Kragagon' has defended against the
attack using 'Fire Resistance'.]

[The third grade strange dragon species 'Kragagon' has defended against the
attack using 'Shadow Resistance'.

"Ahh, you are no help against a damn lizard!"

The enemy had fire and dark resistance so Han Sooyoung's skills didn't
affect it at all. The attacks just seemed to tickle and annoy the strange
dragon.

[The constellation 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' is gloomy.]
She looked around and Yoo Sangah's situation didn't seem much better.
Han
Sooyoung thought to herself, If only she had inherited the story of the
Abyssal Black Flame Dragon…

'Dammit, how do I inherit that damn story?'

Han Sooyoung's expression darkened as she looked at the group of
incoming strange dragons. If that jerk Kim Dokja was here, he could've told
her what to do.

It was at this moment.

[The constellation 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' tell you that if you
want, he can you tell their weakness.] "…You know their weakness?"

[The constellation 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' is nodding.]

"Don't make a fool of yourself. You don't know much about the scenarios."

[The constellation 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' is jumping around
wildly.]

Han Sooyoung listened to the black dragon's childish message and inwardly
sighed. 'That brat Kim Dokja, he must've laughed at me when I chose the
black dragon?'

The Abyssal Black Flame Dragon was clearly a powerful constellation.
However, his intelligence was much lower compared to other
constellations. Why? This guy was too strong since his birth and didn't need
much strategy to attack the scenarios. It was cool to hear but it wasn't good
from the position of his incarnation.

However, this time something was different.
[The constellation 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' says that the kragagon's
weakness is the silver scale on top of its head.]

"Really? Last time you told me the wrong thing."

[The constellation 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' claims on his black flame
dragon that this is real.]

"You said that last time as well."

[The constellation 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' claims this story was told
by a reliable source.]

"Reliable source?"

Since there was no other method, Han Sooyoung decided to follow the
words of the black flame dragon. Han Sooyoung jumped onto the strange
dragon's tail and used footwork to run up. She crossed the streamlined
body. She really saw a silver scale near the crown of his head.

"Haaap!"

The dagger dug into the scale and the kragagon collapsed with a terrible
scream. The breath of the giant monster stopped in an instant. Han
Sooyoung was stunned and muttered, "…Really? Aren't you quite useful?"

[The constellation 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' is puffing up his chest
with a triumphant expression.]

Yoo Sangah flew through the air and said,

"Do you know its weakness?"

"No, not me… in any case, the silver scale is its weakness. That's all you
have to attack."
Thanks to the information given by the black dragon, the two of them
safely suppressed the kragagons.

[The constellation 'Bald General of Justice' admires your performance.]

Han Sooyoung received the messages of the constellations and slightly
frowned. Usually it would be a pleasant situation but today something was
wrong. She always felt like this when she was teased by Kim Dokja. At this
moment, something ran through her head.

"Hey, black flame dragon."

[The constellation 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' is surprised and looks at
his incarnation.]

"…Tell me honestly. Who did you hear this from?"




[The third Night has arrived.]

I listened to the message and recalled what happened a while ago. He really
did as I told him. Just like Kim Namwoon, perhaps the Abyssal Black
Flame Dragon wasn't as bad as I knew. Either way, he was Han Sooyoung's
sponsor.

Thus, it was okay to tell him this.

'I am safe, don't worry'. Tell this to the person who asked.

"Revolutionary!"

I had to endure this. Endure it now so I could smile and meet them again. I
quietly moved through the Night.
"Kuaaack!"

Screams came from everyone. It wound the sound that signalled the
executioners appearing.

It was bloody from the beginning. Maybe it would be a terrible Night that
couldn't be compared to the other two days. I killed three executioner so
tonight they would come full force.

Nevertheless, I wasn't afraid. Starting from tonight, I would start the
counterattack.

"Jang Hayoung."

Jang Hayoung walked forward at my words. He was very tense but it wasn't
the same expression as before. Jang Hayoung asked, "Can I do well?"

"No one can do it better than you."

"…Do you really think so? I only learnt the skill two hours ago."

"Two hours is enough."

I spoke with confidence. It wasn't just to reassure Jang Hayoung.

「 "Who is the most perfect incarnation?" 」

One day, the flippant commentators of the Star Stream discussed this topic.
「 "The strongest incarnation in a one on one fight is definitely Yoo
Joonghyuk. There is no one who can fight as well as him." 」

「 "No one can beat Anna Croft when it comes to information." 」

「 "How about Lee Hyunsung? He is the best tanker." 」

「 "It is Ranveer Khan in major wars." 」
Jang Hayoung's name wasn't mentioned at all. He was inferior to Yoo
Joonghyuk in a one on one fight. He had less information than Anna Croft.
His defense wasn't better than Lee Hyunsung. He wasn't as effective as
Ranveer Khan in a major war. However…

「 "The most perfect incarnation is someone who must do well in
everything." 」

「 "Then it has been decided." 」

He had more defense than Yoo Joonghyuk. He was better in a one on one
fight than Anna Croft. He was better in a large war than Lee Hyunsung. He
was an outstanding presence was more information than Ranveer Khan.

[The character 'Jang Hayoung' has used Fighter Transformation Lv. 9.]

「 "Jang Hayoung is the most perfect incarnation." 」

Jang Hayoung's body moved in a burning curve and painted the sky red. He
wasn't exceptional in one area but he had the most attributes and skills of
everyone in Ways of Survival.

The moment he acquired a skill, he had the ability to reach the highest level
of the skill sooner than anyone else.

The master of the Unidentified Wall, the 'King of Transcendents' Jang
Hayoung. The second part of Ways of Survival began with this guy.
             Chapter 209: Ep. 39 - Unidentified Wall, VI


[The character 'Jang Hayoung' has awakened as a 'Fighter!']

Just as a guardian had the skill 'Guard', a fighter had the skill 'Fighter
Transformation'. It was a skill that melted all of their fears and turned it into
force. Thanks to this skill, a person who had been exploited for a long time
could gain a more powerful force. In that sense, Jang Hayoung was a good
candidate to be a fighter even without the Unidentified Wall.

"Haaaaaap!"

The problem was that he was too excited. A sky shattering sound was
heard. The fighter was a position capable of exerting as much power as
possible against an executioner. Perhaps Jang Hayoung was currently
feeling like a constellation.

"Don't mess around you idiot!" I belatedly raised my voice but Jang
Hayoung had already gone out of my reach.
This was the problem with Jang Hayoung. In fact, I wasn't afraid of Jang
Hayoung's talent. I was afraid of him running wild as a result of his talent.
「 Kim Dokja thought: Jang Hayoung isn't without talent. Rather, he has
too much talent. 」

The only all-rounder in Ways of Survival, Jang Hayoung. Jang Hayoung's
Unidentified Wall guaranteed a formidable growth only through skills
obtained from the wall's transactions.

Of course, it was impossible to reach the grounds of transcendence but Jang
Hayoung could raise his skill level faster than anyone else. It was a talent
that could go beyond other people's training in just a few hours. Such talent
would inevitably make the owner of the talent dangerous.

[Wh at are yo u…]

I barely managed to catch up with Jang Hayoung where he was already
engaged with an executioner. The sparks of a fighter wrapped around Jang
Hayoung and protected him from the executioner's scythe.

[The 'mark' isn't available for this position.]

Perhaps the executioner would be receiving such a message now.

[Th is… are yo u per haps…?]

However, enlightenment was too late. Jang Hayoung overcame the
executioner's scythe and grabbed its neck with a skillful move.

[Ke ok…!]

It wasn't possible for a fighter to show this much combat power. At most,
they were usually one level of power beyond the executioner.

Now Jang Hayoung was completely overwhelming the executioner. It was
only possible because it was Jang Hayoung.
The caught executioner struggled like a ferocious rat but it couldn't endure
Jang Hayoung's slowly tightening grip. The was the sound of bones
breaking and the executioner's body dangled down.

Then the hem of the executioner's clothes started scattering. It was an
absurd end for the existences who had dominated the industrial complex's
Night for decades.

[An executioner has been killed by a fighter.]

[Current number of executioners remaining: 6]

The citizens injured by the executioners were looking this way. Jang
Hayoung's fire lit up the Night. It was like a glowing sun. However, Jang
Hayoung wasn't the sun and it was currently Night.

"A-An executioner has died! An executioner has died!"

"No way! It is currently Night!"

"A fighter has appeared!"

After the end of the executioner, the people hiding in the houses stretched
out their heads. They were people who had been living for a long time in
the shadow of the Night.

[The citizens are influenced by the heat of the revolution.]

They were coming out of their houses one by one. They stared at Jang
Hayoung like he was the leader.

[The character 'Jang Hayoung' has stiffened because of Fighter
Transformation.]

…This jerk thought he was a revolutionary. I lightly slapped Jang
Hayoung's back.
"Uh…!"

Jang Hayoung's red-tinged eyes slowly recovered. Jang Hayoung was
belatedly aware of the pain and glared at me as he held the back of his head.
"That hurts! Why did you hit me so hard?"

"Steady your mind. You will be in trouble if you act like an idiot."

「 "It should be the crowd that is heated up. If the person who leads is
swept away by the heat, the revolution won't be able to tolerate the fire and
will go out before it burns properly." 」

These were Yoo Joonghyuk's words in the 111th regression. It was a
shameful line for me to spit out so I kept it to myself.

Jang Hayoung looked at me disapprovingly and pouted. "It hurts more than
the executioner."

"Then I hit you properly."

Jang Hayoung's current strength was limited to the scenario and it was only
wen dealing with the executioners. It was dangerous to be taken in by such
power.

Aileen shouted in the distance. "There are two in the west! One to the
south! The rest are in the north!"

It was clear what these numbers meant.

"Let's move."

Jang Hayoung nodded and we ran through the Night. I looked at Jang
Hayoung, who was going ahead again, and heard a message in my mind.

[The 'Fourth Wall' is looking at 'Jang Hayoung' with a desire to eat."

"No way. Don't even think about it."
Just like against Nirvana and the outer god, the Fourth Wall coveted Jang
Hayoung's story. It probably wasn't just Jang Hayoung but the Unidentified
Wall as well.

[The Fourth Wall is sorry.]

"I thought you wanted to make friends with that wall. You shouldn't eat
your friend."

「 Kim Dokja who wanted to be friends with the Fourth Wall said. 」

It was a real brat.

"Waaaaahhhhh!"

There were screams from the rushing crowd.

"A fighter has appeared! Hang in there!"

They screamed while wielding weapons towards the executioners. The fires
of magic power popped up in various places around the industrial complex.

People were fighting back. They were fighting against opponents they
couldn't face. I could believe it if one of them was a revolutionary.

[An executioner has been killed by a fighter.]

[Current number of executioners remaining: 5]

Jang Hayoung knocked down another executioner. Now there were only
five remaining. Once all the executioners died, the duke would no longer be
able to hide. From then on, the real revolution would start.

"Kill everybody!"

"Wahhhh!"
As the citizens' gained courage, the executioners gradually slowed down.
No one apart from the fighter could harm an executioner during the Night.
Nevertheless, the important thing was atmosphere.

[Fool ish…]

An executioner who swung its scythe was attacked by Jang Hayoung. Two
executioners had already died so this one didn't face Jang Hayoung head on.

The executioner fled like it was frightened.

The citizens watched the executioner running away and shouted, "They're
going away!"

Jang Hayoung stepped on the low roofs of the industrial complex and
chased after the executioner.

Everything was flowing smoothly. At this rate, the Night would pass safely.
The duke would be forced to recall the Night in order to reduce the damage
to the executioners.

「 Even so, Kim Dokja was vigilant to the end. 」

There were countless 'revolutionaries' who died in the history of the Demon
Realm. Until the Night was gone, the revolutionary should be vigilant until
the end. Even if I was a fake revolutionary.

「 Kim Dokja thought: The spy Han Myungoh was caught by me and three
executioners died during the day. 」

The balance of power was collapsing and the atmosphere of the industrial
complex was rapidly changing. Under these circumstances, the duke
couldn't send the Night again without a plan.

At least, not the Duke Syswitz I knew…
Sure enough. I felt something flying towards my neck and reflexively
leaned back. Four scythes passed over my head and hit the roofs. My head
would be gone if I had been one second slower.

…They had been hiding. Apart from the executioner that Jang Hayoung
was chasing, the four other executioners all aimed for me. It couldn't
compare to the first day. I used Bookmark to trigger Way of the Wind but it
wasn't enough to avoid all the flying attacks.

"The guardian!"

[Someone is using their vitality to protect you.]

The hiding Mark used 'Guard' on me. Now Mark had two points remaining.
The executioners didn't leave despite the effect of Guard being applied to
me.

「 The stupid Kim Dokja started thinking. 」

It felt like they were dragging out the time. I noticed the duke's plan.

「 The duke knew a fighter would appear. 」

…Jang Hayoung was in danger. I condensed the wind using Way of the
Wind and made a powerful explosion behind me. I shot forward like a
comet and the perplexed executioners shouted after me,

[St op!]

I borrowed the power of Guard and Wave to break through the wall of
executioners. Jang Hayoung had gone chasing after one executioner.
Presumably, there would also be a―

"Aaack!"
There was a sharp scream and I saw Jang Hayoung flying back while
bleeding. Dammit, this was why I hit him. I controlled the wind and caught
the falling body. "Hey, are you okay?"

"Heook, keok…"

He was coughing up blood. It wasn't a fatal injury but it would be hard for
him to continue fighting. I wanted to know who made the Night's fighter
like this but then I saw an oversized executioner walking towards this side.

[Revo lution ary?]

It was impossible. An executioner could never win against a fighter at
Night. Yet this one…

The collar of the executioner slowly scattered and the face of a demon was
exposed. Now I realized what happened. Jang Hayoung wasn't hit with the
power of an executioner. The power of this story was incomparable to the
demon baron and earl I first saw when I came here.

I watched him carefully and asked, "You used your head and used a
technique other than 'Execution'. You aren't a duke so you must be a
marquis. Am I correct?"

"I asked first. Are you the revolutionary?"

"That's right. I am the revolutionary."

"A cheeky voice." The demon's thick eyebrows wriggled and he spoke in a
somewhat languid voice. "I am Marquis Osteon."

Demon Marquis Osteon. Along with Duke Syswitz, he was one of the two
marquises leading this industrial complex.

"I think there is one more."
"…You have keen eyes." Among demon emerged from the darkness. This
one didn't seem to have the power of an executioner.

"You are also a marquis?"

It wasn't the demon who answered the question.

"M-Marquis Cuarteto!"

Marquis Cuarteto stood under the moonlight as the citizens screamed.

Osteon and Cuarteto. The two marquises leading the Syswitz Industrial
Complex appeared at the same time, causing the citizens to be completely
frightened.

"Ahhh…"

Duke Syswitz liked things to be certain. He didn't know the identity of the
enemy so he sent out both marquises.

"You created such a nuisance during this precious time. You are a big guy."

Their expressions showed it was annoying to take care of a nuisance. It was
understandable since they had been in control of the industrial complex for
hundreds of years.

After already deciding I was dead, the two marquises stared at the other
citizens. The surrounding pressure soared and the citizens were forced to
kneel. The incarnations trembled and held their breaths.

The marquises spoke towards them. "This is the price you will receive."

[The story 'Ruler's Command' is activated.]

The edge of the language created by the marquises threatened the citizens.
Nothing had happened yet but the words themselves started to dominate the
imagination of the citizens.
"You will lose everything valuable."

They imagined losing their precious families.

"You will lose the peaceful Nights."

They were deprived of all the nights of peace.

"You will pay the price for disturbing this industrial complex."

They paid a price that they could never afford.

"This is the meaning of revolution."

The sentences fell like a final verdict. The citizens were mired in them and
stared up at the marquises with frightened eyes. The marquises laughed like
this situation was satisfactory.

"Look! Your hopes are crumbling."

They decided to use this as an opportunity to consolidate the ruling system.

Bihyung should see this nonsense. The two marquises turned towards me
while directing their 'status' towards me. Ordinary citizens would be
terrified right now.

However, while all citizens were kneeling on the ground, I alone stood
upright. The perplexed marquises stared at me and shouted again, "Look!
Look at how he collapses!"

The marquises attempted to use their 'status' to pressure me several times.
The veins bulged as if they were exerting all their might to reveal their
presence.

"Collapsing…! Collaps…! Um? No, this…?"

I slowly approached them.
「 Kim Dokja thought. 」

Only a fighter could deal with an executioner at Night. The enemies
decided to utilize their force instead of using the 'positions of the scenario.
Thus, it was necessary to respond to them.

「 It can't be avoided this time. 」

If I opened this power, my incarnation body would shake a lot. However, it
was inevitable to deal with a marquis. I needed to use the minimum of
strength. I had to get rid of them with optimal efficiency.

"You…?"

I knew what they wanted to ask and preempted them. "Who am I?"

A marquis-grade noble was strong. Still, no matter how strong they were, it
was just a measurement of the 'incarnations'. They were those who didn't
even match the historical-grade constellations.

I slowly closed my eyes and took a deep breath. I felt somewhat
uncomfortable. I had never done this since becoming a constellation. [The
constellation 'status' is released.]

The 'status', which couldn't be compared to the previous one, crushed the
time and space in the area.
                   Chapter 210: Ep. 40 - Hatching, I


It was the first time I felt like this in my life. I felt so enormous that I
focused on this feeling and forgot to say that I was Yoo Joonghyuk. It felt
like dozens of meters of time and space were kneeling before me. This was
what the constellations felt.

[Your incarnation body isn't suitable for expressing your status.]

I had adjusted the level but there was still a huge burden on my body. It
wasn't even a proper release of my status in the first place.

[Your status is disagreeing with your incarnation body and will be
temporarily adjusted.]

[Your current status is historical-grade.]

A narrative-grade status wasn't something my incarnation body could
afford. Even the historical-grade constellations couldn't keep their dignity
in the form of a symbol, let alone a ragged incarnation body. However, this
was enough.

"Kuk, keok, keook…!"

The incarnations were letting out pained sounds. I saw this and quickly
confined it to the radius of the marquises. The half-kneeling marquises had
expressions like they lost their souls.

[Someone in the Demon Realm has detected your presence.]

[Someone in the Demon Realm has detected your presence.]

[Someone in the Demon Realm has detected your presence.]

It was just a short moment yet I already received three messages. They
were probably the demon kings of the Demon Realm.

It didn't matter. I was going to let them know eventually. In addition, they
couldn't tell who I was at this level.

[Your incarnation body can't afford your status!]

The stories making up my back started falling away. Fortunately, it was in a
blind spot and the marquises hadn't noticed yet.

"T-This aura…"

"A constellation!"

Marquis Osteon belatedly regained his spirit and screamed. Cuarteto next to
him was on the verge of retreating back. It was a spectacular sight but I
couldn't waste time.

[Your incarnation body has started to collapse!]
I didn't have a lot of fighting power compared to my 'status'. Thus, I had to
end it the moment the opponents died.

[The exclusive skill 'Bookmark' is activated!]

Then why? Sparks appeared in the air and the skill was forcibly terminated.

[Your incarnation body is too unstable to use that skill.] …Son of a bitch.

Was I too hasty?

[You have used a strength that doesn't meet the probability!]

[The exile penalty is accelerated.]

I had engaged in combat recently and expected this to happen. However,
the collapse of my body was much faster than expected. It seemed that the
burden of extracting a constellation's status was considerable.

The marquises started to adapt and pushed themselves against my pressure.
They seemed to have one legendary story or many historical-grade stories. I
guessed they were on the level of Reinheit of Paradise.

"Even if you are a constellation, you can't kill me in the scenario!"

In addition, they were smart. Marquis Osteon once again transformed into
an executioner and aimed a scythe at me. It was a situation where the only
fighter, Jang Hayoung couldn't move. Now I had no way to kill this guy.
The situation started flowing in an even worse direction.

"An exile?"

"…Don't tell me?"

The story fragments falling from my body increased and the marquises
finally noticed. I wasn't able to use Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint due to
the skills restriction but I seemed to know what they were thinking.
「 If I could get that guy's story… 」

The hyenas hunting the injured predator started to carefully surround me.

"Call for reinforcements! We can destroy him if we drag out the time."

There was a whistle and executioners approached from every direction. I
also felt unusual movements from the nobles on the Factory side.

「 Kim Dokja thought. 」

To kill a marquis, I must use at least Electrification.

「 But I can't use the skill. 」

If I wasted more time, my body and the citizens would be at risk.

「 I have to kill them using a method other than skills. 」

How?

「 There was only one way. 」

The moment I made a decision, Marquis Osteon approaching me let out a
terrible scream. "Kuaaack!"

Marquis Osteon's arm rolled along the ground. He was currently an
executioner and shouldn't be hurt by normal attacks. It meant…

"You shouldn't be so careless."

Jang Hayoung stood behind him and laughed like a villain. It was an
incredible recovery when considering what happened earlier.

[The character 'Jang Hayoung' has used the skill 'Immortal Body Lv. 7'.]
…Immortal Body? Wasn't this a healing skill from the Murim World? Jang
Hayoung felt my gaze and muttered like he was giving an excuse. "One of
the people I chatted to was from Murim…"

I watched the ashamed Jang Hayoung and sighed. He didn't talk with just
the black dragon. By the way, Immortal Body was part of the Breaking the
Sky Sword style…

"Hit them all! Kill the fighter first!"

Marquis Osteon removed the status of executioner and shouted at the
surprised reinforcements. The remaining four executioners and the nobles
who arrived started to surround us. I counted three earls and give barons.
There was Baron Melen who I saw on my first day here.

"There! Save the revolutionary!"

The citizens ran to save us but the numbers were still lacking. Jang
Hayoung turned pale as he watched the nobles who were taking out
weapons.

"What should I do? I can't kill them."

A fighter was strong against the executioner but vulnerable to all other
positions. In the end, I had to deal with the rest.

"Deal only with the executioners."

I blocked the nobles aiming for Jang Hayoung. Countless spears headed
towards me but I didn't avoid them.

[You are currently under the protection of the scenario.]

I couldn't die under the protection of Guard. I could handle them one by one
without overdoing it. As if reading my thoughts, a message appeared in the
air.
[The 'ruler' has forcibly recalled the Night.]

The ruler. It was a position that referred to the duke, the master of this
industrial complex.

[No one has died tonight.]

Night was over but the fight was still continuing. No, it was starting from
now on.

[The power of the scenario that is protecting you has disappeared.]

"His protection has been released! Kill him!"

"He is a guy with amazing stories!"

The nobles rushed at me with anticipating and I smiled bitterly. "You
slightly used your head but this was a mistake."

Night disappeared and the strength of the executioner couldn't be used. In
addition, the marquises who were the core leadership of the industrial
complex were here. I had been waiting for a long time.

"Open the story."

My body was unstable and I couldn't use skills. This didn't mean I had no
way to fight.

[The historical-grade story 'Bug Slaughter' has been activated.]

It was impossible to open a story above legendary grade in my present
state. However, I didn't need a legendary story to deal with these guys. This
was a story that used the 'status' at the highest level. It was a story that the
demon noble called Tentacio had once used in Dark Castle.

I slowly blinked and felt the nobles in front of me becoming smaller. The
story Bug Slaughter was gained in exchange for killing tens of thousands of
bugs. It was a terrible and vulnerable story when encountering a strong
person but it was different when dealing with a weak person.

[You have absolute power over all beings with a lower status than you.]

[This story is only available to existences with a certain level of 'status'.]

A menacing air emerged from my body and the complexions of the
approaching nobles turned blue.

"T-This is ridiculous…!"

It was already too late to feel regret. There was no need to use a sword. The
muscles of my body instantly swelled and I started to beat the nobles with
my fists.

"Kuaaack!"

It was literally a 'slaughter'.

[You have acquired a historical-grade story.]

[You have acquired a historical-grade story.]

The stories of the nobles entered my hands one by one.

[Your incarnation body is rapidly collapsing!]

I quickly opened a hole in the bodies of the barons and then pulled off the
heads of the earls. The situation suddenly reversed and the remaining
nobles started to run away.

"Run away! He isn't someone you can deal with! Quickly―!"

I missed some people but I didn't miss the important ones.

"Kuaaack!"
Cuarteto and Osteon struggled as I grabbed them by the neck. I didn't
hesitate to hit their heads together and them pierced both heads with a hand.

"Kuheeeeok…"

The situation would've been different if it was a full-blown resistance.
However, the marquises had been defeated by my 'status' and couldn't
resist.

[You have obtained many new stories!]

[You have killed the Demon Marquis 'Cuarteto'.]

[You have killed the Demon Marquis 'Osteon'.]

[A new achievement has been acquired!]

[Your notoriety is spreading in the 73rd Demon Realm due to the killing of
the marquises!]

[The high-ranking nobles of the Demon Realm will fear you.]

[50,000 coins have been acquired as compensation for the achievement.]

It was a small amount of compensation but it was better than nothing. I
looked around and saw Jang Hayoung and the citizens organizing the
remaining situation. The surviving executioners and nobles were retreating
towards the Factory.

[Your incarnation body is reaching its limit.]

[The story 'Bug Slaughter' has been forcibly terminated.]

My vision momentarily shook and I became dizzy. I shouted towards the
people fleeing towards the Factory. "Baron Gilat, Baron Sarabos and Earl
Mokba!"
They were the names of the surviving executioners. It was the names of the
executioners I got from Han Myungoh in advance. Now Jang Hayoung and
I didn't have the energy to chase or engage with them.

Thus, I called out their names. It was a type of warning. I knew all their
identities. I knew who they were and their positions. Therefore, they could
die at any time.

The executioners trembled as they were threatened for the first time in their
lives. I shouted towards them, "Tell this to the duke."

The light of dawn started shining like a lot of time had passed. In the dim
and pervasive shadows, I slowly concluded my words.

"Learn to fear the day."

I was going to collapse at any moment but I didn't lose consciousness until
the remnants of the nobles disappeared into the Factory.

Someone muttered, "R-Revolution…"

People started to call out for a revolution. I listened to these voices and
recalled my favourite sentence from the 'revolutionary' arc.

「 In the light of dawn, the stopped time of the industrial complex started
flowing again. 」

The anger and screams of those who had been sleeping for a long time in
the Night. They were asleep for a long time and now feelings they didn't
know existed were waking up.

"Revolutionary! Revolutionary!"

"Yoo Joonghyuk! Yoo Joonghyuk!"

[Your influence has transcended the influence of the real revolutionary.]
[The acquisition conditions have been satisfied and a new story is created.]

[The new story 'Silver Screen Revolutionary' has begun!]

Bihyung and the constellations should've seen this sight. It was a waste. I
would've received a lot of coins. Then the message arrived like it had been
waiting.

[The 'Dokkaebi Egg' has responded to your story.]

[The 'Dokkaebi Egg' has started to record your story.]

The vibrations of the egg became stronger and I heard another message.

[The egg's hatching is imminent.]

I knew that the time had come when I had the sound of cracking.
Indeed, there was no need for other dokkaebis at this stage. It was
because a dokkaebi had been present in this stage from the beginning.
[A temporary channel will be created in the Demon Realm.] The
Demon Realm's scenario would start from now on.

[The constellation 'Demon King of Salvation' has entered the temporary
channel.]
                  Chapter 211: Ep. 40 - Hatching, II


I suddenly let out a breath. It felt like somebody had taped up my mouth
and then ripped it off.

[The constellation 'Demon King of Salvation' is looking at the Syswitz
Industrial Complex.]

My field of view widened and I saw things that couldn't be seen by
incarnations. The industrial complex seemed like a giant circular dome
from up high. A circular city centered around the Factory. All incarnations
within the city were looking at the sky.

"T-This…!"

"A channel! A channel is open!"

Perhaps they received the message that a temporary channel had opened.
"A dokkaebi has come! Our Demon Realm is finally receiving attention!"
Their faces looked thrilled. It was natural. This was a place where people
excluded from the scenario gathered. The incarnations, who once hated the
constellations and coins, entered the Demon Realm and became the ones
who missed them more than anything.

"Hey! Are you okay? Did you hear the message just now?"

I barely managed to stand up with the support of Jang Hayoung.

[Entry into the temporary channel has temporarily delayed the collapse of
your incarnation body.]

I sighed with relief. A channel was an important device that formed the
core of a story. My stories started recovering just by entering the channel.
Of course, the exile penalty wasn't completely removed but… I could earn
some time with this.

[Enter the main scenario to prevent the breakdown of your stories.]

I had to kill the real revolutionary in order to enter the main scenario. I
touched my broken arms and legs as a test. Fortunately, the core stories still
seemed safe. The broken parts could be somehow repaired.

[Your current incarnation body is severely damaged.]

[You need more stories to repair it.]

The list wasn't confirmed yet but many stories were taken from the nobles.
Most of them were historical-grade with a few legendary grades mixed in.
In any case, I had to move fast before the temporary channel closed.

I asked Aileen who was approaching from the distance. "The injured
people?"

"…There are more than I thought."
Aileen's expression was dark. At first glance, dozens of people were lying
down on the ground. Considering that many of them were critically injured,
it would be hard for a lot of them to survive today.

"Dokkaebi Bag."

A familiar holographic window appeared in the air. It had been so
frustrating when it was missing.

This was the feeling of a rich person who couldn't spend money. I briefly
checked if any useful items had been received and then spent 3,000 coins to
buy a large amount of Ellain Forest Essence.

"Give this to the people."

"T-This… how did you get this?"

"Don't ask me anything more."

The startled Aileen received the essences with wide eyes. It was natural to
be surprised. It was because the Ellain Forest Essence was something that
could only be obtained through the Dokkaebi Bag. It wasn't available in the
Demon Realm where there wasn't a channel.

[The duration of the temporary channel is very short.]

I pulled the Dokkaebi Egg out of my bag. The surface of the egg had fine
gold cracks.

Signs of hatching. A temporary channel was a type of fetal movement for a
dokkaebi. It was like breathing exercises.

I lightly stroked the egg and a small vibration was felt inside the shell.

[The 'Dokkaebi Egg' will soon hatch!]

[Consume a healthy story.]
I quickly pulled out a few story fragments and gave them to the egg. The
egg shivered and made some noises.

[The Dokkaebi Egg is satisfied.]

[The Dokkaebi Egg wants the warmth of parents.]

It was really fussy. Come to think of it, Bihyung had said something.

–I'm telling you just in case the egg hatches. Before the hatching, you have
to carry the egg in your arms.

–What? Why?

–I don't know for sure. But that is how healthy dokkaebis are born. Thus, I
did it.

I thought it was strange that the dokkaebis believed in such a superstition
but there were reasons for superstitions in this world. It was because this
was a world where all stories came true.

I looked towards the Factory in the distance. Since the two marquises had
died, the Syswitz Industrial Complex had now turned completely towards
the path of revolution. I broke both limbs and gave a good warning at the
end, so the Factory side wouldn't act rashly. I couldn't face them in my
current state so this situation would last for a few days.

"Aileen. Close off the council's residence from now on."

"Huh?"

"The nobles won't move for a while. Thus, we should take a break and get
ready."

I looked down at the egg, which was shaking more and more. From now on,
the duke wasn't the only problem. Once the channel opened, the real
monsters would appear.
I needed to prepare some things before then.




Thanks to the help of the others, I set up a room in the council's residence
with the proper temperature and humidity. Aileen checked my body's
condition and sighed. "Don't move today. Your body is in bad shape."

"Understood."

"Don't speak carelessly. You really almost died. This is the first time I've
used five historical-grade stories for the repair…"

I wasn't happy with the cost to my body. I could barely survive by using
good stories. Still, it was better than dying.

"I still have the legendary stories so it's fine."

I confirmed the legendary stories I had acquired from killing the marquises.

[The legendary story 'God of the Dice' has been acquired.]

The legendary story, God of the Dice. According to Ways of Survival, the
story was roughly like this:

「 One of the stories held by the King of Gambling. The owner of this story
said he was about to freely choose the scale of the first dice roll. 」

Sometimes it was unknown why certain stories were considered legendary
grade. It might be a legendary grade but how could it compare to my 'King
of a Kingless World'…

Aileen had an astounded expression on her face as she opened her mouth.
"Are you going to use a legendary-grade story as a fragment to repair your
body? Don't you know how much it is worth?"
"…"

"No, how the hell have you survived so far? Even with the protection of the
story…"

The protection of the story… It was a greeting often used by the dokkaebi.
"Stop nagging. In any case, I can't move today because of this child."

I touched the egg in my arms. All future plans could be implemented if this
child hatched well. Jang Hayoung stared carefully at my arms and asked,
"What is that?"

"An egg."

"Egg? What egg?"

"A dokkaebi egg."

Jang Hayoung and the other group members had wide eyes at my words.

"What? Really?"

I nodded and looked down at the egg. Every time the egg shook, the
temporary channel was opened and closed.

[Number of constellations who have entered the channel: 1 person.]

It was currently a lonely number but it wouldn't be long before the channel
was full. I would surely make it happen.

"Wait! This is a real dokkaebi egg? It's not a joke?"

"Do I look like I'm joking?"

"…The channel is open because of this egg?"

"Yes."
Unlike the stunned Jang Hayoung, Aileen was making a serious expression.
"Wait a minute, if this is really a dokkaebi…"

"I just want to give the Demon Realm a chance. You can't remain as slaves
of the industrial complexes forever."

Aileen bit her lips at my words. In fact, she also knew. I pointed out
something she was thinking in her heart.

"Are you afraid the next scenario will be worse?"

A scenario was always waiting after the current scenario. The scenario
might be better than this or the worst one they had ever experienced. Aileen
spoke like she didn't want to admit it. "A world without it is the best."

"You need to think if an uncertain life is truly worse."

"I'm very thankful for your revolution. But you…!" Aileen stared into
my eyes and paused. I didn't know what she saw or felt in this brief
encounter. "…What are you doing this for?" She ended up asking.

"Some people want to see the ending of the story." I replied as always.

"That… do you intend to reach the end of the scenario?"

"It is similar."

Then Aileen muttered, "A Seeker of the End…"

"…?"

"I heard a story from the constellations of my home planet. There are
constellations seeing the 'end' of the stories."

Seeker of the End. That reminded me, there were those guys in the Star
Stream. It wasn't yet time to move in earnest but the story was already
circulating on Aileen's home planet. Aileen fell deep into thought while
Jang Hayoung opened his mouth. "If that is a dokkaebi, won't it become
like the ones we know eventually?"

"I won't let that happen. Not all dokkaebis become the same streamers."

"Indeed, it is the same with people. How did you obtain the egg? I never
heard anything about this from the wenny people."

"That…"

I hesitated as I wondered how to explain it. Suddenly, Han Myungoh
looked between the egg and I with strange eyes. "It must've been hard.
Childbirth is a painful thing."

"…I think you are misunderstanding something. I didn't give birth to it."

"I understand."

It seemed that an uncomfortable consensus was formed. I wanted to explain
that I never received the demon king's curse. Then the cracks in the egg
became stronger and a dim light started leaking out.

[The egg's hatching is imminent.]

The moment I had been waiting for finally came.

[The Star Stream is watching the birth of a new streamer.]

I looked down at the creature that emerged along with Han Myungoh, Jang
Hayoung, Mark and Aileen. There was something wonderful about the birth
of life. A small back could be seen through the breaking shell. Jang
Hayoung made a helpless expression as he stared at the back covered with
white fur.

"…I really hate the dokkaebi. I feel it once again."
However, this birth wasn't blessed. The newborn dokkaebi cried with a
wrinkled face. It was as if just being here was painful. I recalled one
paragraph about the Dokkaebi King spoken of in Ways of Survival.

「 "Listen. They are born with fate and are inevitably poor people who
have to live while loving the story." 」

The newborn dokkaebi kept crying. She was born in this world and as long
as there were stories in this world, she had to love it.

Yes, I made you like this. Thus, blame me.

[The baby dokkaebi is looking at you.]

[The baby dokkaebi recognizes you as a parent.]

[The soul of the baby dokkaebi is communicating with
you.] Then I heard a voice.

–I've been waiting for a long time ahjussi.
                 Chapter 212: Ep. 40 - Hatching, III


The flow of time and space was becoming abnormal. Jang Hayoung's lips
moved very slowly while the voices were badly fragmented and didn't
sound normal. It was like the whole world was in slow motion.

「 Kim Dokja realized. This is the time of the dokkaebis. 」

In order to manage and judge a large number of channels at the same time,
the dokkaebis' cognition rate was significantly faster than other creatures.

I looked up at the air. A sphere of white light floated over a baby dokkaebi
with fluffy fur. It was a sphere I had seen before. It was the soul of Shin
Yoosung.

'It has been a while, Yoosung'.

A translucent light appeared inside the sphere and the silhouette of a person
could be seen. The existence who wanted to save the world and who used to
have faith in Yoo Joonghyuk. The Shin Yoosung of the 41st regression was
right in front of me.

[You have earned an incredible achievement!]

[You are the first human to hatch a dokkaebi egg.]

[You have acquired a new story!]

[The story 'Father of a Dokkaebi' has been acquired.]

Shin Yoosung read my expression and spoke.

–Don't apologize. I chose this.

'Still, I'm sorry'.

–Ahjussi is incredible. Captain of the 41st regression wasn't like you.

'It isn't easy. I have a lot of work to do'.

–Don't you need my help?

I nodded and Shin Yoosung smiled brightly.

–Can I do it well?

'You can do it well. I will help you'.

Only a person who reached the bottom of the scenario knew the weight of
the scenario. This was why I believed in the 41st regression Shin Yoosung.
Of course, this wasn't why Shin Yoosung had to believe in me.

–Captain of the 41st regression was unsuccessful.

Shin Yoosung's voice was shaking slightly.

–There will be more horrible things going forward.
'I guess'.

–Ahjussi can't imagine the things that are waiting.

'I will go with you'.

Shin Yoosung was silent for a moment. She seemed to be discern the
meaning of my words and was measuring the depth of the last years. Either
way, it would be painful for her. Soon, Shin Yoosung opened her mouth.

–I won't be able to remember ahjussi right after I'm born.

'I know'.

–Don't make too much of a fool of yourself.

'I'll try'.

Her smile was brilliant. In the silence that was like calm music, Shin
Yoosung continued to speak.

–I have few good memories of the scenario.

She sounded indifferent but it was sincere because of the indifference. I
listened to her and recalled the story of Ways of Survival. I thought of the
stories of 'Shin Yoosung' that I knew. It couldn't be fully explained even
with one hundred or one thousand sentences…

–Still, if I ever have something to say…

I didn't know if I had time to worry about this. I might've read Ways of
Survival and could read her thoughts with Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint
but I didn't understand the pain that the 41st regression Shin Yoosung had
endured.

–This time, I will talk to ahjussi.
Thus, I could only reply to her in one way.

'Thank you'.

I bit my lips to try and conceal my heart. A bright string of light rose and
the flow of time gradually returned to its original state.

[The first channel of the 73rd Demon Realm has opened.]

[Channel name: #BI-90594]

The fragmented sounds returned and I could hear Jang Hayoung's voice.
"What will you name the child?"

…This was what he said. I had been very worried because of the name.

The baby dokkaebi was looking at me. I stared into her eyes and spoke
quietly.

[Channel Manager: Biyoo.]

Did she know it was her name? The baby dokkaebi reached out to me. I
grabbed the small and fluffy hand and it felt like the baby dokkaebi smiled
at me.




Shin Yoosung was crying. She often cried after escaping from Seoul Dome.
It happened when she fell asleep after a hard day or when she opened the
Attributes Window and gazed at her 'constellation support'. Shin Yoosung's
tears flowed out unknowingly.

It was always Lee Gilyoung who spoke to Shin Yoosung during this time.
"Hey. Why are you crying again? Dokja hyung likes mature people."
Shin Yoosung's red and swollen eyes flashed at the words. "Get lost!"

"Hyung will be back soon. Didn't you see? He left while saying, 'We will
meet again, Lee Gilyoung'."

"He never said that?"

"He told me! Surely you heard it?'

Lee Gilyoung saw Lee Jihye standing in the back and his eyes narrowed.

"What are you smiling at?"

"Something cute."

Shin Yoosung, Lee Gilyoung and Lee Jihye were on the way to the place
they promised to meet after getting rid of the monsters that appeared as
disasters in the 12th scenario. The place where they promised to meet the
other party members was Seongnam City. Since they decided to meet again
here, the other party members would soon gather.

As Lee Jihye and Lee Gilyoung bickered, Shin Yoosung opened her
Attributes Window.

[The link to your sponsor has been disconnected.]

This was the message that appeared that kept appearing in Shin Yoosung's
Attributes Window shortly after leaving Seoul Dome. Lee Gilyoung didn't
like Shin Yoosung's somber face and spoke again, "Hey, look at this coin."

"…What is it?"

"If I throw the coins and it is heads, Dokja hyung is alive."

Lee Gilyoung pulled out a 100 won coin and Shin Yoosung pouted. "You
have done this before."
"Let's try it again."

"…Do what you like. Ahjussi won't suddenly appear in front of you."

Flipping a coin. It was the action done whenever Shin Yoosung and Lee
Gilyoung became uneasy.

"How many times has Dokja hyung died so far?"

"…41 times."

"How many times did he live?"

"59 times."

If a heads emerged, Kim Dokja would come back to live. If a tails emerged,
Kim Dokja was dead.

Lee Jihye heard this story and asked, "Are you sure you want ahjussi to
really be alive?"

Lee Gilyoung threw the coin in the air. At almost the same time, three pairs
of eyes followed the coin. The skeptical Lee Jihye also focused on watching
the coin. There was a clink as the coin fell to the ground and moved twirled.
Three people stared breathlessly at the coin.

Heads, tails, heads, tails. Then…

"Heads! Look, what did I say?"

Lee Gilyoung's confident voice was heard as the coin stopped on the heads
which contained a portrait of Admiral Yi Sunsin. Even Lee Jihye felt
slightly better after seeing the result. However, Lee Jihye knew this result
wasn't due to 'chance'.

[The constellation 'Maritime War God' has consumed some probability.]
Lee Jihye smiled bitterly. Her sponsor had been losing power recently and
it was because he wasted his probability on this. Nevertheless, she couldn't
say anything.

[The constellation 'Maritime War God' is looking at the children with sad
eyes.]

People needed hope and perhaps the constellations were the same.
Suddenly, Lee Jihye wanted to be mischievous. She picked up the coin that
had fallen and opened her mouth. "Since ahjussi is alive, let's try something
else."

"Huh? What is it?"

Lee Gilyoung spoke half-heartedly like he was displeased with her
intervention. Lee Jihye ignored him and kept speaking.

"Does Dokja ahjussi like you better? Or does he like Yoosung more?"

"Of course it is me!" Lee Gilyoung shouted.

"What? Have you forgotten the garter belt incident? My liking was higher."

"Hey! That…"

Then a shrill voice was heard from behind them. "A 15 year old
schoolgirl!"

The owner of the voice wasn't Shin Yoosung, Lee Jihye or Lee Gilyoung.
They saw two girls approaching in the distance. They were Han Sooyoung
and Yoo Sangah who came back from fighting monsters in Gwacheon.

Lee Jihye recognized the owner of the voice.

"A 15 year old schoolgirl. He said that to the black flame dragon and took a
skill!"
As they were going to reach Lee Jihye and the children, another woman
appeared from the Suwon direction. She was a slender woman with a long
sword hanging from her waist.

"What are you talking about?"

It was Judge of Destruction Jung Heewon, who had been in charge of
Suwon.

"Heewon unni!" Lee Jihye rushed towards Jung Heewon with delight.
However, Jung Heewon's state wasn't good. Her armour was severely
damaged and her thights and forearms were covered with cuts. It was
unthinkable when considering Jung Heewon's strength. The monster species
weren't that strong.

"Are you okay? Did a different monster appear?"

"That isn't it. There were some problems with my stigma."

"Stigma?" Jung Heewon was about to explain only to lightly shake her
head. Instead, she looked towards Han Sooyoung. "Han Sooyoung-ssi,
please keep talking. What were you saying?"

Maybe it was because of Jung Heewon's intense interest but Han Sooyoung
instantly started to talk about what happened. Lee Jihye listened to the story
and wondered,

"I'm not sure what you are saying… who is the 15 year old schoolgirl?"

People's gazes focused on Han Sooyoung. Han Sooyoung spoke brief
gibberish before declaring in a slightly excited voice.

"Kim Dokja, he is alive."

"How did you come to that conclusion? Why…"
Anyone who heard Han Sooyoung's reasoning would think it was nonsense.
At this moment, Jung Heewon interrupted. "I don't know the connection
between Kim Dokja and the 15 year old schoolgirl but… it doesn't seem
very likely."

Lee Jihye asked with an absurd expression. "Unni, you understood what she
said just now? Did you learn a new skill?"

"It isn't likely. However, I do think Dokja-ssi is alive."

The party members gulped at Jung Heewon's words. Kim Dokja, was he
really alive? Jung Heewon took a pained breath and started speaking. "I
suddenly can't use my stigma."

"Huh?"

What did this mean? What did Jung Heewon's inability to use her stigma
have to do with Kim Dokja surviving? Jung Heewon immediately replied to
their question. "My sponsor has suddenly disappeared."

"Your sponsor?"

Jung Heewon nodded and looked at her Attributes Window.

[The link to your sponsor has been disconnected.]

It was the first time she had seen this. Thanks to this, she was unable to
borrow the power of her sponsor for the moment. However, that wasn't the
only message.

–I found Kim Dokja.




At this time, a person arrived in the 73rd Demon Realm.
[You have arrived in the 16th personal scenario area!]

[This scenario has a time limit!]

[Be sure to return to the main scenario within the given time!]

The moment he stepped through the portal, a bleak horizon of stories and
mountains of garbage story fragments unfolded. Yoo Joonghyuk frowned at
the sight and asked, "…Is this really the right place?"

Then a small angel doll sitting on his shoulder nodded.

"Do you have to answer through this toy?"

[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' says it can't be helped
because there are no channels here.]
                  Chapter 213: Ep. 40 - Hatching, IV


Yoo Joonghyuk's wrinkles deepened as he stared at the symbolic figure
shaped like a doll. "…How are you sending an indirect message without a
channel?"

[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' says it is possible if the
symbolic body is in contact with the incarnation.]

Uriel's symbolic body was the doll on Yoo Joonghyuk's shoulder. Yoo
Joonghyuk gently poked the symbolic figure with a finger.

"Is it okay to do this?"

[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' says it will be okay as long as
it isn't caught by a dokkaebi.]

"No, I'm not talking about the dokkaebi."
Uriel initially didn't understand what he was saying. Yoo Joonghyuk
pointed to the side of the doll.

The doll cocked her head and then covered her mouth with both eyes.

[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' is deeply moved by the heart
of the incarnation 'Yoo Joonghyuk'.]

[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' says it is a bit painful.]

There were weak sparks around Uriel's symbolic body. It was because the
Demon Realm was a taboo for her, an archangel. The Demon Realm was
the domain of the demon kings. Uriel was taking an unnatural risk and
forced to bear the brunt of her probability being exhausted. Uriel moved to
clinging to his arms and Yoo Joonghyuk asked her, "Why are you going so
far to look for Kim Dokja?"

[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' is asking if it isn't the same
for you.]

"There seems to be a misunderstanding. I…"

In fact, the Demon Realm was originally a place where he would've never
come. The difficulty here was incomparable to other scenarios of the same
rank. It was comforting that this was the 73rd Demon Realm. There were
no demon kings and the ruler would be a duke at most. This much was
worth a try. Above all, he was much stronger than he was at the same point
in his previous regressions.

"I just don't like people impersonating me. It doesn't matter if it is Kim
Dokja or not."

[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' is laughing.]

"There are also many usable items in the Demon Realm…"
[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' is laughing loudly.]

"Do it one more time and I will rip apart your body."

Yoo Joonghyuk turned his head and gazed at the wide horizon. Perhaps that
bastard was somewhere in this desolate world. In this silent world, Yoo
Joonghyuk finally started moving.




The Syswitz Industrial Complex.

The atmosphere of the duke's office was much more unusual than usual as
Earl Silocke sweated while reporting.

"…Therefore, we plan to control access into and out of the industrial
complex while the revolution is ongoing."

Silocke's heart sank several times as the face of the Gilobat envoy distorted
in front of him. This

person might be Gilobat's envoy but he wasn't the one in charge of the
delegation.

Explosive Ombros. He was a marquis of the Gilobat Industrial Complex
and the most prominent candidate to be the next duke of the 73rd Demon
Realm. Silocke gasped for breath as he saw the fire glowing in Ombros'
eyes. He might've fled if it hadn't been for Duke Syswitz standing at the
window and looking outside leisurely.

"…That's why I am asking the Gilobat envoys to stay here for a while."

"Have you finished speaking?"

"Y-Yep! T-Then I will go…"
Silocke hurriedly opened the office door and ran away. Meanwhile,
Ombros took a few deep breaths to control his temper. It was an annoying
situation but he couldn't act as usual. It was because the strongest existence
in the 73rd Demon Realm, Syswitz was behind him.

Duke Syswitz stared out the window for a while before smiling. "That's
what happened."

"…What am I supposed to do?"

"I'm sorry but you can't leave. Please stay in the Syswitz Industrial
Complex for the time being."

In the end, Ombros exploded. "…Don't you know these words can cause
diplomatic issues?"

"You're too sensitive. It is just a protection measure for the envoys of the
alliance."

"Is it because of the revolutionary?"

"Seven executioners and two marquises have died. It has been a long time
since this happened."

The last phase of the Revolutionary Scenario would start when all
executioners in the complex died. Strictly speaking, Duke Syswitz was in a
crisis right now. Unlike his words, there was no sense of crisis in Duke
Syswitz' expression. Ombros didn't like this contradiction and complained,
"A revolutionary appearing at this time… you must want to save face, Duke
Syswitz."

"Really? I think it is fun. It has been 30 years since a revolutionary emerged
in Syswitz. Sometimes this event is needed."

"You are speaking like the constellations."
"Why not? The story isn't only related to the constellations."

Ombros would've scoffed if a normal incarnation had said this. However,
Duke Syswitz was qualified to say such things. He wasn't comparable to the
'historical-grade constellation's but Syswitz was a monster who had ruled
the 73rd Demon Realm for 400 years.

"It is good to have as many stories as possible before the beginning of the
demon king competition.

The more powerful the revolutionary that appeared, the better it is for me."
He never even thought about being hit by the revolution.

"Why are you so confident that you can stop the revolution?" Ombros
asked.

"Why do you think?"

Ombros' eyes sank at the question. Maybe it was an obvious story. Syswitz
had lost two marquises in this incident.

"I hope you won't betray Gilobat."

"Haha, who said that?"

"I'm telling you this personally."

"I will also give you a piece of advice. Do you think that Duke Gilobat can
become the demon king?"

Ombros was a bit upset by the words. Syswitz didn't give him time to think.

"Or do you think Melledon and Bercan can become the new demon king?"

"…I can't answer this question."
"No, you can answer it. It is because everyone knows who is the strongest
of the four dukes in the 73rd Demon Realm."

Ombros gulped. This calm declaration could sound so scary. Once again,
the oldest duke of the 73rd Demon Realm couldn't be ignored.

"It won't be easy. Melledon has joined hands with Vedas."

"He isn't the only one who can borrow the power of the constellations."

"These words…"

Duke Syswitz stared at the sky outside the window instead of answering.

"The dokkaebis will come soon. Then what will happen next?"

Now the night sky was completely dark. However, soon there would be
many stars in the night sky. Then the other demon kings would show up as
a response to the emergence of the constellations.

Marquis Ombros felt a heart-shaking sensation.

Finally, the 73rd Demon Realm would become a battleground for a proper
scenario.

"…Is there a channel liaison yet?"

"I put in a request to the bureau."

At this moment, Ombros realized why Syswitz didn't look for support.
Once the dokkaebis appeared and the full-fledged scenarios began, the
constellations would gather towards the bigger events. Suddenly, some
thoughts ran through his head.

"It wouldn't be bad for there to be a small entertainment before the
fullfledged Demon King competition begins. The constellations love
slaughter."
"Is that why you are leaving the revolution alone?"

Syswitz stared at the smoke with a strange smile. Ombros sighed bitterly.
"…You were born evil."

Every conflict in this world was a commodity. Now Syswitz was selling the
lives of the many civilians in the industrial complex to seek the attention of
the constellations.

"Thank you for the compliment."

Ombros shook his head like he was tired. If he planned this production then
Duke Syswitz would surely be preparing for a greater blow. It wasn't
difficult to predict what would happen in the industrial complex.

"I can see movement in the Factory."

The most powerful story weapon possessed by the dukes, the Factory. Duke
Syswitz nodded. "I have already prepared it so you will see sooner or later."

Anticipation filled Ombros' eyes. The most powerful person in the 73rd
Demon Realm. It wasn't a common opportunity to see him in action.
Then…

[The #BI-90594 channel has been created in the 'Syswitz Industrial
Complex' area.]

Ombros heard the message and stood up with amazement.

"Did you call the dokkaebis already?"

Once he saw the expression on Duke Syswitz' face, Ombros realized this
wasn't part of the plan.

The door of the office opened and somebody ran in.

"Duke!" I'm sorry but I have an urgent report—"
It was Earl Silocke who previously fled from this place. Syswitz quickly
managed his facial expression and replied, "Tell me."

His report was probably related to the emergence of the new channel.
However, unexpected words emerged from Silocke's mouth.

"The Factory isn't operating hard enough."

Duke Syswitz made an embarrassed expression.

"…What does that mean? Didn't I tell you to replenish it?"

"T-That… it looks like all the civilians who came to work have stolen the
story fragments."

Ombros noticed how things were progressing and said, "It seems this
revolutionary is using his head. Perhaps the dokkaebis moved first because
of him…"

"That is impossible. The negotiations with the bureau haven't ended yet."

Duke Syswitz frowned at the unexpected situation and immediately gave
instructions. "Send the supervisors and slaves to the horizon. Have them
collect more story fragments."

"I have already sent them. By the way…"

Duke Syswitz hadn't realized that the report wasn't over. Earl Silocke's
shoulders hunched over like he was afraid of how the duke would react.

"Just… I lost contact with the supervisor who went out to collect the story
fragments."
The horizon near the Syswitz Industrial Complex. Jang Hayoung kicked the
body of the dead supervisor and said, "It seems that the duke has been
preparing for quite a while. Ordering a collection of this scale…"

It was an extra large collection with thousands of slaves mobilized. The
situation was resolved but it would've been dangerous if we had been a bit
later. It was impossible to launch a full-scale war against the Factory when
my incarnation body wasn't yet intact. Things would've become worst if
these story fragments entered the Factory.

"You are good." I glanced at Han Myungoh beside me.

He knew the duke would move in this way. If Han Myungoh hadn't been
the spy, I wouldn't have guessed the exact timing to put the plan into action.
Han Myungoh was elated by my praise and laughed.

"Hum, who am I? Aren't I the 'Brain of Mino Soft?"

"You can use that as a modifier if you ever become a constellation."

I smiled at Han Myungoh. At first, I didn't like being on the same side as
this person. Now I thought it wasn't a bad choice.

"Bring the slaves over here! I will start repairing those who are still sane
first."

Now that I had decided to wage war properly, I could feel something
different from Aileen and the citizens. I watched them and controlled my
heart. The baby dokkaebi who looked like cotton candy sat on my shoulder
and cried out. "Baat!"

Her memories hadn't been recovered but every dokkaebi had the instincts of
a streamer. They filled in the scenarios where there should be a story.

[A new sub scenario has arrived!]
[The Sub Scenario―'Liberate the Slaves' has started!]

"Thank you."

I lightly stroked her head and Biyoo shouted, "Daat!"

It might not be possible for me to enter the main scenario but I could
receive a sub scenario whenever there was an opportunity. It might be a
temporary measure but if I kept building up sub scenarios, I would be able
to recover enough to face the duke.

「 Kim Dokja thought: There is nothing urgent. Time is still on my side. I
now need to thoroughly prepare to safely pass the Demon Realm's scenario.
」

I sincerely thought this. At least, until I heard an unexpected message.

[A new constellation has entered the #BI-90594 channel.]
                  Chapter 214: Ep. 40 - Hatching, V


…A new constellation? Already? It was earlier than the expected timing. I
thought there would only be subscriptions after a few more incidents…

[A constellation is looking at the incarnations without revealing their
modifier.]

It didn't seem to be a constellation I had already met. I was a bit
disappointed. I was hoping it would be Secretive Plotter or Abyssal Black
Flame Dragon.

"D-Did you hear the message just now?"

"What message?"

"I heard an indirect message!"

I didn't know if it was rich or not but the new constellation was sprinkling
indirect messages from the beginning. Biyoo shouted from her position on
my body. Maybe Biyoo was receiving many coins right now. It was natural
to be amazed. Now she knew how to make coins as a dokkaebi.

「 Kim Dokja thought: I hope they are a good person. 」

The inclination of the initial subscribers would determine the nature of the
channel. The stimulus and difficulty of the scenario would be determined if
the initial constellations were 'incarnation seekers' or 'fun seekers'.

After all, every detail that the dokkaebis couldn't determine were made in
response to the desires of the subscribers.

In fact, this was what I was most worried about. The 41st regression Shin
Yoosung had already suffered countless injuries from the dokkaebis. In
order to continue the scenario in the future, Biyoo must constantly face the
desires of the constellations.

"Baat?"

I placed my hand on Biyoo's head.

[A constellation who hasn't revealed their modifier is revealing their
modifier.]

[The constellation 'Nouveau Richer Snake Boss' disapproves of the
incarnations here.]

I frowned at the message.

…This was a bad start. I remembered hearing about the Nouveau Richer
Snake Boss in Ways of Survival.

[The constellation 'Nouveau Richer Snake Boss' is bored with the
development of the scenario.]

[The constellation 'Nouveau Richer Snake Boss' is dissatisfied with the
naive development of the dokkaebi.]
Nouveau Richer Snake Boss. His hobby was to enter the channels
containing weak constellations, flash coins around and ruin the scenario.

[The constellation 'Nouveau Richer Snake Boss' wants stimulation.]

I remembered Ways of Survival talking about how many channels had
decreased subscribers or were completely destroyed due to him. He was
only mentioned in passing but now I had to face him directly.

[The constellation 'Nouveau Richer Snake Boss' doesn't want the survival
of the 'removal slaves'.]

[The constellation 'Nouveau Richer Snake Boss' says everyone should
cooperate to kill the enemies!]

[The constellation 'Nouveau Richer Snake Boss' declares that he will donate
coins to anyone who kills a removal slave.]

The citizens started to look around at the messages. Some people looked
confused at what this meant and others looked hesitant. Some people were
panic-stricken as bad memories popped up.

However, some of them were secretly taking out their weapons. Jang
Hayoung noticed it and screamed, "Wait! What are you doing right now?"

He was one step late. Once they saw one person taking out a weapon, the
actions of the citizens became faster. One, two, three. The number of
weapons increased.

"Hey, are you serious? This isn't it!" Mark seized a citizen who was
approaching a removal slave. "Just because they are removal slaves doesn't
mean they are lost. Some still have their minds!"

"Most of them were those who sold their souls to their duke!"

"Not all of them are like that! Don't you know?"
"Aren't they dead anyway? This is great!"

The citizens were blinded be coins and drew their blades.

[The constellation 'Nouveau Richer Snake Boss' is excited about the
intensified conflict.]

[The constellation 'Nouveau Richer Snake Boss' declares that he will donate
3,000 coins to the incarnation who kills the

most removal slaves.]

3,000 coins. It was a luxurious sum in the industrial complex where coins
were precious.

"L-Let's just kill them. We have to live…!"

"Right! Chairman, just kill everyone and go back!"

The balance of voices was leaning sharply. The number of citizens who
took out weapons increased. Mark once again shouted to stop their greed.
"They were once citizens! If you act this way, how are you different from
the nobles?"

"Get out of the way! If we don't act right now―"

[The constellation 'Nouveau Richer Snake Boss' is enjoying the dispute
between citizens.]

The moment Mark was pushed to his ass by the struggle, another message
followed.

[The constellation 'Nouveau Richer Snake Boss' declares that he will donate
300 coins to an incarnation who kills a citizen.]

The citizens were momentarily stunned. They glanced at each other and
hurriedly moved away from each other.
"Uh…"

"W-Wait a minute!"

I thought I knew what they were thinking.

「 Yes, the scenario was originally like this. 」

One day, the citizens of this place had performed the 'first scenario'.
Pointing blades at each other and killing to survive.

"U-Uhh…"

The citizens glanced at each other while holding weapons. A constellation
spoke a few words and the bonds of the citizens gathered in the name of
'revolution' were gradually dimming.

[The constellation 'Nouveau Richer Snake Boss' is delighted with the
reaction from the incarnations.]

My hatred of the constellations, which I had forgotten for a while, revived
again. Once upon a time, I might've been like these citizens. I would've
played along with what the constellations for one or two coins, adapted to
the story of the constellations and become disillusioned, saying 'this is
unavoidable'.

「 Kim Dokja thought. 」

It was unavoidable…

「 There is nothing unavoidable. 」

I took a step back and completely crushed the floor. I used this force to
jump into the crowd of citizens. Then I grabbed the neck of the citizen who
had strongly pushed Mark. "K-Keeok!"
"300 coins per body."

"Kuoock… R-Revolutionary?"

"300 coins. Don't you think that is too cheap?"

The citizen I was holding struggled but I tightened my grip instead of
releasing my hand. Soon after, the pale citizen dropped his weapon and the
surrounding citizens screamed. Once the citizen was about to suffocate, I
laid him down roughly on the ground. Their terrified eyes watched me.

"300 coins per person… how much would it be if I kill everyone here?"

"U-Uhh…"

"If you kill the removal slaves, he will give 3,000 coins. So altogether, it is
13,000 coins… indeed, it is hard to ignore."

13,000 coins. Most of the citizens here had never seen such an amount.

"…But don't you know? You can't change anything with 13,000 coins. At
best, it will be a few vague skills and some equipment."

The citizens' eyes started shaking. Those who had never used the Dokkaebi
Bag wouldn't know. 13,000 coins were just a petty amount of cash for the
high-ranking constellations. What could they do in this world with that
much money?

I looked down at the citizen on the ground. "Then what are you going to do
next?"

"Y-Yes?"

"What will you do with the 13,000 coins after killing everyone?"

Emotions slowly crossed the faces of the citizens. Fear, fear and…
"I, I…"

The citizens murmured in voices that sounded like they had fallen into an
abyss.

"N-Nothing…"

I watched the bewildered faces of the citizens. In fact, I knew. They didn't
do this with a clear purpose. Perhaps the citizens themselves didn't
understand why they were trying to gather coins. They just had the
compulsion to survive and collect more coins than other incarnations. The
scenarios made the incarnations slaves to the story.

In this heavy silence, the citizens realized what they had been planning to
do and burst out crying. "R-Revolutionary. I…"

I got up, ignoring their eyes. Then I spoke casually, "Since a channel has
opened, more constellations will come in the future."

The eyes of the citizens staring at me were shaking with a different light.

"Don't sell your stories for just one or two coins. If you want to sell them,
do it for the right value."

I didn't know how much of my words had been communicated to the
people. I wasn't good at talking. Even so, this was all I could do.

The people around me bit their lips with sad faces. Then they looked like
they had decided to do something. The citizens dropped their heads and
started to put away their weapons. None of them opened their mouths but
their expressions alone were an answer.

However, not all of them accepted my words.

[The constellation 'Nouveau Richer Snake Boss' is staring at you.]
[The constellation 'Nouveau Richer Snake Boss' feels a strong rage towards
you.]

[The constellation 'Nouveau Richer Snake Boss' has requested a bounty
scenario.]

A bounty scenario. Yes, there was something like that. It was a damn
scenario that was invoked at the request of the constellations.

"…Revolutionary?"

The surprised citizens glanced at me with fearful faces. The target was
obvious if a bounty scenario was triggered now. At this time, Biyoo rose
from my head and floated in the air.

[Baat.]

Other dokkaebis would've willingly accepted the bounty scenario but Biyoo
couldn't do that. Biyoo's body swelled up as if to refuse the request.

[…Baat?]

Then faint sparks flowed over Biyoo's small body.

[B-Baat. Baaaat…!]

At this moment, I realized what would happen.

[The constellation 'Nouveau Richer Snake Boss' has requested a bounty
scenario.]

[The constellation 'Nouveau Richer Snake Boss' has requested a bounty
scenario.]

Biyoo was now struggling with her instincts.
「 Unlike common misunderstandings, the dokkaebis don't deliberately
produce stimulating scenes. 」

It was out of instinct to meet the demands of a constellation subscribed to a
channel.

「 The more innate the streamer, the more powerful these instincts are. It is
an instinct to create a scenario that more beings desire. All dokkaebi live
with such instincts. 」

Biyoo was still a baby and it was more difficult for her to overcome such
instincts. I reached out and lightly grabbed Biyoo. "It's okay."

"There isn't only 'one' subscriber to this channel."

[The constellation 'Demon King of Salvation' doesn't agree with the
invocation of the bounty scenario.]

The sparks scattered instantly at my fingertips.

[The bounty scenario request has been denied.]

[The constellation 'Nouveau Richer Snake Boss' is astonished.]

I raised my head towards the air. "Snake Boss. The story that you want isn't
here."

I gazed at the faint constellations shining in the night sky and declared in a
nonchalant voice. "I'm busy so get lost."
            Chapter 215: Ep. 41 - Real Revolutionary, I


At this moment, I thought it was a bit of an overkill. I meant to say
something similar but I didn't mean to provoke him so much. Maybe I was
too accustomed to giving cider to individual constellations. It was
laughable. I wasn't Yoo Joonghyuk and I didn't have anyone giving me
coins now.

"Didn't you hear it? The Demon King of Salvation!" Jang Hayoung ran to
my side and exclaimed. "Look at the constellation who joined out channel!
A person from Earth!"

I was about to tell him that I was the Demon King of Salvation when I
remembered something that he said previously.

–Ah, he already has a girlfriend.

…I shouldn't.

Instead, I looked up at the sky where the light was shining.
[The constellation 'Nouveau Richer Snake Boss' has jumped exceedingly
high.]

This jerk must be pissed off but he couldn't go on a rampage. A low-
ranking constellation like the Nouveau Richer Snake Boss didn't have the
guts or enough probability to make trouble in the Demon Realm.

[The constellation 'Nouveau Richer Snake Boss' is furious that a mere
incarnation has destroyed him!]

…What incarnation? Who killed this guy in the original novel? It couldn't
be Yoo Joonghyuk…

[The constellation 'Nouveau Richer Snake Boss' is indignant that a
constellation he has never heard of is opposing his will!]

[The constellation 'Nouveau Richer Snake Boss' is looking around for the
Demon King of Salvation.]

This guy didn't know that I was the Demon King of Salvation. Well, it
didn't matter. As long as he cared about the Demon King of Salvation, half
of my purpose was achieved.

「 Kim Dokja thought: I must gather constellations to this channel. This
way, I can gain the upper hand in the 'Demon King Selection' which would
follow after the Revolutionary Scenario. 」

For this to happen, I needed word to spread about this channel. Even so, it
was dangerous to blindly recruit constellations. If too many powerful
people entered from the beginning, Biyoo would find it hard to handle and
it could be troublesome for me.

At this moment, Nouveau Richer Snake Boss was becoming upset in the
channel.
[The constellation 'Nouveau Richer Snake Boss' starts to question the
nearby constellations about the Demon King of Salvation.]

[The constellation 'Nouveau Richer Snake Boss' is surprised to hear the
rumours about the Demon King of Salvation.]

He was a low-grade guy among the top people of this world.

[The constellation 'Nouveau Richer Snake Boss' claims to have seen the
Demon King of Salvation.]

[The constellation 'Nouveau Richer Snake Boss' is appealing against the
accusations of the constellations pouring towards him.]

[The constellation 'Nouveau Richer Snake Boss' claims to have really seen
the Demon King of Salvation.]

Therefore, the narrative-grade constellations didn't believe his words. In
other words, the story only reached the arrogant lower-grade constellations.
It meant the Nouveau Richer Snake Boss was a perfect fit for collecting
such constellations.

[The constellation 'Nouveau Richer Snake Boss' is gathering his gang.]

It was as I expected.

[New constellations have entered the #BI-90594 channel.]

If Secretive Plotter was in the same channel, he would've clearly sent me a
message of admiration at my ploy. It felt a bit nostalgic.

[The newly entered constellations are revealing their modifiers.]

[The constellation 'Nail-Eating Rat' is looking for the fingernails of fallen
incarnations.]
[The constellation 'Dog Who Threw Himself into the Flames' is curious
about the channel's incarnations.]

Since there was a series of animal modifiers, he really had called his
friends. Nail-Eating Rat and Dog Who Threw Himself into the Flames…
they were modifiers that I knew were unknown even without looking at
Ways of Survival. These bad guys were also constellations.

[The constellation 'Nouveau Richer Snake Boss' is warning the Demon
King of Salvation.]

[The constellation 'Nouveau Richer Snake Boss' declares that this channel
has been taken over by the Twelve Zodiacs nebula.]

…What was this? I had seen the Twelve Zodiacs in passing in Ways of
Survival. They were a nebula but they weren't very cohesive. In addition,
the majority of members were low-grade constellations. There wouldn't be
a problem even if they became hostile to me.

「 Kim Dokja thought: First, the number of subscribers has increased. Next
would be to sort them. 」

The larger the channel, the more loaches that obscured the water. Now that
I wasn't free to use my status, I needed a constellation to take charge of
quality control. It needed to be a constellation with a strong power but was
moderately decent. They should be capable of crushing other
constellations… where could I find such a person?

In fact, I already had the answer.

"Jang Hayoung, what are you doing?"

Jang Hayoung, who was typing something into the air, glanced at me with
surprise.

[The 'Unidentified Wall' is surprised.]
It seemed he was doing something similar. My eyes narrowed as I said,
"You will die if you tell the other constellations about the Demon King of
Salvation."

"I just wanted to boast that I heard the message…"

"Then you will be punished. The Demon King of Salvation is a very, very
scary man."

Jang Hayoung jumped and glanced up at the sky. He thought that the
Demon King of Salvation might be looking at him from somewhere.
Fortunately, there were no indications of unusual movements in the
channel. Jang Hayoung hadn't spread his nonsense yet. Jang Hayoung
noticed my glance and asked, "You know the Demon King of Salvation?"

"A little bit."

"Are you friends?"

I didn't know if we were friends on not…

"It is enough that he gave me a message to tell you."

"…What is it?"

"He is looking at you."

I thought saying this would be better. In any case, I had to take advantage
of his power from now on.




[The constellation 'Nouveau Richer Snake Boss' is looking for a place to
relieve his anger.]
[The constellation 'Nail-Eating Rat' is curious about you.]

The indirect messages appeared in the air one after another. Duke Syswitz
listened to the messages for a while before opening his mouth with a frown.

"Gather all the nobles at Night."

"Huh? But… U-Understood!"

The subordinate quickly escaped from the office and Duke Syswitz placed a
new cigar and placed it in his mouth. He looked slightly nervous due to the
indirect messages of the constellations.

'I don't know who opened the channel. However, I can't let that opportunity
go'.

It wasn't a formal channel. However, he could still take advantage of the
channel to start the competition in the most advantageous position in the
Demon Realm.

'The other dukes haven't yet obtained a channel for broadcast'.

The modifiers of 'snake' and 'rat' seemed wrong but they were still
constellations. He didn't know the details but this situation was a great
opportunity for him to become a demon king.

Marquis Ombros watched the situation and asked, "Are you planning to
face the revolutionary in a situation where the Factory isn't operating?"

"…"

"Once all the remaining executioners are dead, the revolutionary will gain
the power to kill you."

A ruler who lost all his subjects would be vulnerable to a revolution. That
was the planned evolution of this scenario. However, Duke Syswitz didn't
blink at all. "Of course not. If the person who showed up now is the real
revolutionary."

"What…"

"By the way, have you decided which side you will be on?"

"Huh?" Ombros looked surprised. "I'm a marquis of Gilobat…"

Duke Syswitz smiled and Ombros realized the meaning of 'side'. "Are
you?"

Ombros' back was soaked with sweat while there was a very short conflict
in his head. The duke who obtained the first 'channel' would be
overwhelming advantageous in the selection competition. Many
constellations would soon
flock to this channel. In addition, Duke Syswitz had the most powerful
story in the 73rd Demon Realm…

Ombros' worries didn't last long. "I greet the new demon king of the Demon
Realm."

The demon made a decision. Duke Syswitz nodded as Ombros slowly knelt
down.




I entrusted the removal slaves to Aileen and Mark before asking Biyoo to
disrupt the broadcast channel for a while. It was to prepare for any possible
problems. I didn't want the animal friends to hear what happened from now
on.

"Jang Hayoung, how many people are you talking to now?"
Jang Hayoung looked me in the eye and replied. "Three people?"

"One is the black flame dragon. Who are the remaining two?"

"Um… Actually, it might be five."

"Five people?"

"To be precise, it is nine but…"

"…Nine people?"

"If I add those who took longer to reply, there is 15 altogether…?"

There were several distinctive features of the Unidentified Wall. One of
them was the chat function that Jang Hayoung opened not long ago. It was
the ability to send messages to anyone with a modifier in the Star Stream.

However, having this ability didn't mean everyone could use it like Jang
Hayoung. "You talked to 15 people in this short amount of time?"

"Well, it wasn't that hard?"

It was hard for me to talk to even one person. He was a really great
multitasker. In short, 15 constellations and transcendents were talking to
this guy. Those people with strong pride…

I wondered how it was possible but this was Jang Hayoung's true power. It
was because of this power that Jang Hayoung was able to build a force of
transcendents.

Jang Hayoung watched my face and asked, "By the way, why are you
asking?"

I hesitated for a moment. This choice was very important. If I made a bad
choice, my hard-earned channel could become ruined in an instant. I
thought for a moment before slowly opening my mouth. "I'd like to call
somebody."

"Huh? Who?"

I hesitated to reply. I wasn't sure if my choice was correct or not.

「 Kim Dokja thought: The one I will call now is beyond my control. 」

It was really hard to get here. A damn scenario was a scenario but the ones
who really bothered me were the constellations. Those who wanted the
bounty scenario were easy. When I thought about it, I came to the Demon
Realm because of my fate.

Even now, I couldn't sleep when thinking of that time. After all these
efforts, I came to this distant stage and opened a new channel. Now should
I call one of them to this place…?
            Chapter 216: Ep. 41 - Real Revolutionary, II


"…What aren't you saying?"

Obviously, there were good constellations in this world. They were the
constellations I read about in Ways of Survival. After Ways of Survival
being a reality, there were some constellations that I reevaluated. Still, it
didn't change that their essence was a 'constellation'.

I didn't know what my expression was like but Jang Hayoung had
worried eyes. "…Is something wrong?" "No, nothing like that."

"Then why are you worrying?"

I was somehow hesitant to speak and shook my head lightly. Jang Hayoung
stared straight at me and stated, "I would like to hear it."

There was something familiar about this and I couldn't help smiling. I
closely examined Jang Hayoung's face. A sharp nose on pure white skin.
Clear and deep eyes below eyebrows that were drawn in a soft line…
A faint guilt filled my heart.

「 He is a kid who likes stories. 」

「 Because Yoo Joonghyuk is a good person, this person should taste the
bitterness of reality… 」

「 Joonghyuk doesn't listen to people. The other person should be a good
listener. 」

The result of all the comments I made was now in front of me. He had eyes
to see the world, a nose to breath and ears to hear the story. Perhaps it was
because of guilt but I spoke my first words unknowingly. "There are people
who think bad things."

"People?"

I nodded and continued, "They are overall bad people. They bully or gossip
about others and even commit some terrible things."

Jang Hayoung listened to the story and asked me, "Do you hate the people
you are talking about?"

"…I thought so but I don't know."

I didn't know if I was serious or not.

"Some people were better than I thought and some people acted differently
than what I knew."

The countless words of Ways of Survival that I read in the past flowed
through my mind.

"What is real about them? What is reality and what is fake? I don't know
very well."
Jang Hayoung silently listened despite my vague wording. How much time
passed? Jang Hayoung thought about something. "It's hard to understand
what exactly is troubling you… so you want to know more about these
people?"

"What?"

"They seem like bad people but there might be some good people. Well,
isn't that your expectations? No?"

Why did it sound so romantic? There was a backlash but when I thought
about it, this might be the problem. Jang Hayoung nodded and said, "Every
now and then, too, you have to talk. Talk to the people."

"It would be useless to talk."

"Why?"

"Just…"

I couldn't explain it well. It was a helpless feeling that couldn't be
described. However, it was when a person became most helpless that they
were the most truthful.

"I think there is a huge wall."

[The Fourth Wall is looking at you.]

"You and I are talking like this but we're not really communicating. There
is no such thing as communication in this world."

[The 'Unidentified Wall' is looking at the Fourth Wall.]

「 Kim Dokja thought: Maybe reality or the novel is all the same. 」

「 I've read it for so long and I still don't know. 」
「 Maybe I will never know. 」

I felt like I was mistaken and that the moment I spoke these words,
everything would change. This optical illusion was broken by Jang
Hayoung's words."I might be different from others but of course, there is no
such thing."

"What?"

"Everyone has a wall and communication is impossible… that's obvious."

I couldn't believe the friendly Jang Hayoung thought so. It was a bit
surprising. Then Jang Hayoung continued, "However, we still have to talk.
Even if there is a huge wall, there is a person behind that wall."

"…What can we say when there is a wall?"

"Write on the wall."

My mouth dropped openat the brazen words.

"If you shit or pee, you will leave something on the wall. That way, the
other party will recognize it."

"Why would you do such a thing? The other person is beyond the wall
anyway…"

"Still, you should leave a mark." Does that make sense?" "There is no
apparent meaning."

"Then?"

"It is just important that you left it."

"The other party won't know so why?"

"At least the wall has changed." I was speechless for a moment. Jang
Hayoung spoke in a resolute voice. "Then one day, someone might read it."

I stared at Jang Hayoung. Jang Hayoung, who was born into this world
because of my greed, lived a life unrelated to me. Maybe he became a better
person than I thought. I laughed with some bitterness. "I have one
question." "…Huh?"

"Did you talk to the constellations in this way?"

"Ah, that…"

Judging by his hesitation, I must be correct. I had a bit of understanding of
the minds of the constellations. They were the heaviest but at the same
time, loneliest beings in the universe. They were writers as well as those
who watched the stories. Jang Hayoung would've listened to them as he did
to me.

[The constellation 'Nouveau Richer Snake Boss' is looking at the cheeky
incarnation!]

Jang Hayoung looked up at the air at the same time. Thanks to Biyoo's
interference, the Nouveau Richer Snake Boss couldn't find my location for
a while. Of course, this didn't last long.

Jang Hayoung asked in an uneasy voice. "…Is that bastard thinking of
staying here?"

"Perhaps."

He had been embarrassed and was probably determined to ruin the channel.
I thought for a moment before finally making a decision.

Jang Hayoung was right. Even if there was a wall, I had to write something
on this wall. This was despite the fact that it might change what was
originally written…
I didn't want to be a person who only read.

"Jang Hayoung, can you contact this person?"

Once I thought about it, I had been acting as a reader the whole time. In
order to see the ending that I wanted, I had to create a new story. In fact, I
had already warped reality. I just didn't know yet who would read it.
"Who?"

I didn't know if the constellations would comply with my suggestions. Now
that I opened a channel… if that person helped, the Revolutionary scenario
would end without any problems.

Then a message appeared in the air.

[The fifth Night has arrived.]

Sinister flute sounds were heard. I looked around the industrial complex. In
the raging fire, people were screaming. My expression hardened and I
spoke towards the scattered Aileen and Mark.

"Gather all the citizens."




The duke was driven into a corner. It was obvious after the Fourth Night
was over. The Factory's operating power had been cut off by the kidnapped
slaves. Thus, the duke couldn't come out for the moment.

However, the duke led the nobles and emerged on this Night.

「 Kim Dokja thought: What is he intending? 」

My mind was a bit complicated due to the variable of a new constellation
intervening. In addition, the constellation I called hadn't come yet.
「 It's fine. Let's think positively. This might be an opportunity. 」

Yes, I didn't need to have a weak mind. I was now a constellation. I had
done well so far and there wouldn't be a problem.

"Jang Hayoung! Take care of the executioners! Absolutely don't get
involved with the other nobles!"

"I know!"

I ran through the streets using Way of the Wind and reached the place
where the biggest fire was burning. How long had I been running? I soon
saw a demon standing on the spire of a broken building.

"Are you the revolutionary?"

It was a long-haired demon engulfed in red flames. My face was tingling
from the heat that emerged from his whole body. It was a stinging heat
wave. I looked at the yellow flames and knew what this power was. There
was only one person who used this type of story in the 73rd Demon Realm.

"Marquis Omboros."

He was the most powerful noble in the 73rd Demon Realm after the dukes.
He was someone I would've hesitated to bump into before I became a
constellation. However, Omboros' expression was weird.

"I am Ombros, not Omboros."

Ah, I got his name wrong. I might be Kim Dokja but even I couldn't
memorize the name of extras. Omboros kept muttering like his pride was
hurt. "You aren't fleeing despite knowing me. I thought you were someone
with good knowledge but you're just someone with good luck."

"You would be the lucky one if I ran away. Omboros."

"I told you it is Ombros!"
Instead of answering, I raised the magic power in my body. Last time, I had
fought using the status of a constellation. This time, the opponent was great
and it wouldn't work against Omboros. Thus, this was an all-out battle.

[The 5th bookmark, Kyrgios Rodgraim is selected!]

[The exclusive skill 'Miniaturization Lv. 3' is activated!]

[The exclusive skill 'Electrification' Lv. 11 (+1) has been activated.]

A yellow heat wave burst out from Omboros' fist. It was the emergence of
Brilliant Explosion, a skill of his story. He had the most impressive
explosion stigma in the 73rd Demon Realm. The power was strong but it
wasn't difficult to avoid. The explosion range was large so it was
considered a long-range attack.

"You rat…!"

[The constellation 'Nail-Eating Rat' hates the words of Demon Ombros.]

Omboros felt it was difficult to deal with the smaller me with a simple
explosion and he changed his operation. The heat from his hands rapidly
contracted and changed into a small ball.

"Die!"

The condensed heat was more intense around his hands. He thought he
would push me in strength after reducing the range…

It was a good plan but he met the wrong opponent. I wasn't an ordinary
incarnation. I watched the fierce incoming explosion and stretched out my
fist without hesitation. The center of the explosion was deeply pierced by
the blow containing my magic power.

My ears momentarily buzzed and the fragments caught in the explosion
scattered in the air. The flames in the area were swept away and went out.
Only a blue-white lightning was scattered everywhere. I heard a sound and
my vision blinked white.

[The constellation 'Nouveau Richer Snake Boss' is astonished at your
strength.]

Omboros couldn't be seen in the place that the blue-white lightning swept
through. Maybe he flew away or he might've died.

"Oh my god…"

The industrial complex was brutally destroyed. Some of the citizens
confirmed my strength and were kneeling. At this point, I didn't know how
I was in a fight. If I returned to the scenario properly, could I win one on
one with a few constellations?

[Your incarnation body can't handle the level of force used.]

[A significant portion of your incarnation body has been damaged!]

…Damn, it was starting again. Still, it was fine. It would be over before my
body was in tatters.

"Waaaaahhhhh!"

Were they inspired by this situation? The citizens in the surrounding area
started shouting.

"Revolutionary! Revolutionary!"

[New constellations have entered the #BI-90594 channel.]

The number of constellations kept increasing. It was a different feeling
from Bihyung's channel. Well, maybe because I thought of this as 'my
channel'. I went to the forefront of the battlefield and cut at the approaching
nobles.
"Waaaaahhhhh!"

The duke himself brought about his end by coming out without the Factory.
The wave of angry citizens gradually pushed the nobles.

How long had it been? Finally, we arrived at the gate of the Factory.

"The revolution is around the corner! Just a bit more…!" Someone cried
out.

However, the next moment, an earthquake occurred from deep in the
ground. The confused citizens screamed and sat on the ground. Something
seemed to stand up in front of me. A huge building, which had been
sleeping like an old beast, was raising its body. There was an engine sound
reminiscent of a steam engine. Soot filled the night sky and loud sounds
tore at the eardrums.

My heart suddenly sank.

…The Factory was operating? How?

Nevertheless, I couldn't afford to think about it. A giant fist struck my
defenseless self. A few buildings were smashed and the steel frames
shattered. I momentarily lost consciousness before coming back.

[Your incarnation body is seriously damaged!]

[Enter the main scenario now to prevent the breakdown of your stories!]

Blood poured from my body and the stories making up my body were
shaken. Damn, my mind was in such a complicated state that I was caught
off guard. Making such a mistake…

Nevertheless, I couldn't understand no matter how hard I thought. How was
the Factory operating?

[The constellation 'Nouveau Richer Snake Boss' is pleased at the sight.]
[The constellation 'Nail-Eating Rat' is enjoying your trials.]

[A few constellations hope that you will suffer more pain.]

Dammit. I opened the channel but none of these guys were on my side. The
moment I gritted my teeth and raised my body, a familiar name was heard.

[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' is holding his hair
while closely scrutinizing you.]
            Chapter 217: Ep. 41 - Real Revolutionary, III


…Really?

[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' is looking closely at
your face.]

Did the Great Sage, Heaven's Equal really come?

[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' is narrowing his eyes
at your attire.]

I felt a strange sense of stability from the gaze. It was a strange feeling to
feel at ease from someone watching me.

"Prisoner of the Golden Headband."

[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' is looking at you.]
The Great Sage, Heaven's Equal had yet to notice. He wasn't certain if I was
Kim Dokja or not. Maybe it was due to the story covering my face. I
thought for a moment before deciding to give him confidence. "That's right.
It's me." Silence filled the air. It was a tight silence like someone was taking
a breath. After a while…

[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' is shocked by your
identity!]

[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' is asking how you are
alive.]

[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' is wondering why you
are here.]

The message that flew only at me seemed like it was covering the sky.

「 The Great Sage, Heaven's Equal. He isn't part of the absolute good or
absolute evil system. He is of the neutral system. He is playful but also
indifferent. He doesn't easily connect with other constellations due to his
temperament… 」

This was the Great Sage, Heaven's Equal that I knew from Ways of
Survival. One of the strongest constellations in Ways of Survival, who
fought against numerous constellations and built up a ridiculous myth-grade
story. Even so, he died a lonely person without any deeps bonds to the end.

[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband'…]

I listened to the Great Sage, Heaven's Equal's messages while slowly
closing my eyes. It was important to trust the information I knew.
However—

"The Great Sage, Heaven's Equal."

"…I'm glad to see you again."
The Great Sage, Heaven's Equal was silent for quite a long time. We might
both be constellations but he had a presence I couldn't catch. Even so, at
this moment, I felt like the Great Sage, Heaven's Equal was right in front of
me.

[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' has sweet lips for a
long time.]

[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' is repeatedly grabbing
and releasing his hair.]

The next moment, something fell from the sky. I unintentionally caught it.

…It was the hair of the Great Sage, Heaven's Equal. I couldn't help
laughing. Perhaps this was how the Great Sage, Heaven's Equal showed his
trust in someone.

[Your understanding of the constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband'
has slightly increased.]

I spoke towards the Great Sage, Heaven's Equal. "The fact that I'm here is a
secret. Do you understand?"

[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' is nodding.]

The constellation was better than I thought and he would keep my secret
well. "By the way, how did you come here…?"

Before I could finish speaking, one wall of a collapsed building tilted and
someone appeared. It was Jang Hayoung who appeared with dirt falling
from him. Fortunately, the fighter was still unharmed.

"Yoo Joonghyuk! Are you okay?"

[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' is making a strange
expression.]
That reminded me, I was still selling Yoo Joonghyuk's name. It was time to
tell my real name to Jang Hayoung…

I asked about the outside situation. "How is it outside?"

"…It isn't good."

I thought I knew what was going on. The industrial complex was shaking
like there was an earthquake. Screams of the citizens came from all over the
place and Jang Hayoung's expression hardened. "The duke is turning the
industrial complex into a ruin while looking for you."

It would be strange if this place wasn't turned into a wasteland. Once the
duke started the Factory, there was no way to stop it. However, it was
impossible for me to retreat now.

"How are the executioners?"

"There is only one left. He is good at running…"

The blood of the demons on Jang Hayoung's cheeks covered up the aura of
a fighter. It was a remarkable achievement considering the short time.

"Take care of the remaining one. Then the duke…"

As I spoke, sparks appeared around my face. My knees instantly lost
strength.

"Hey! You…" The amazed Jang Hayoung ran over and grabbed my
shoulder. My skin started cracking apart.

[Your broken story is collapsing.]

[The exile penalty will resume.]

[The durability of your incarnation body is at a dangerous level!]
…This damn incarnation body wasn't easy. The nickname of 'sunfish' might
fit me more than Yoo Joonghyuk.

"Biyoo."

[Baat!]

I called out and Biyoo's fingers moved through the air. Then a scenario
message popped up.

[A new sub scenario has arrived!]


  [Sub Scenario - Story Repair]

  Category: Sub

  Difficulty level: D

  Clear Conditions: Restore the durability of your incarnation body to a
  certain level.

  Time Limit: None

  Compensation: None

  Failure: ―


It was a scenario I had requested from Biyoo in advance. Originally, it
would be impossible to use the sub scenarios for personal gains. A formal
channel of the bureau would've never allowed it.

[The sub scenario has alleviated the exile penalty.]
Thanks to Biyoo's scenario, the anguish of my incarnation body was
reduced.

[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' is interested in the
way you use the scenario.]

[800 coins have been sponsored.]

Normally I would've received a barrage of criticism from other
constellations but in this case, there wasn't a fuss because there was no
compensation. In any case, now I was an exile and had to constantly receive
scenarios. I had to stick to this until I entered the main scenario.

[The acquisition of a sub scenario has delayed the collapse of your
incarnation body.]

I barely managed a sigh and met the worried eyes of Biyoo. I deliberately
smiled.

–I'm fine so don't worry.

Biyoo moved her head and disappeared again. She had to manage the
scenario throughout the industrial complex so Biyoo would be feeling
hectic right now.

The sparks around my body fell silent and Jang Hayoung asked, "…Are
you really okay?"

"I can hold on. Where is Aileen?"

"She is with Mark. They are evacuating the citizens."

It was a wise choice. It was too unreasonable for the citizens to fight back
as long as the Factory was in operation. If I didn't know the real
revolutionary was hiding somewhere…
I moved and could see the atmosphere covered with fine dust. There were
the bodies of the fallen nobles and the citizens.

"…Is it going to end like this?" Jang Hayoung looked at the shadow of the
Factory in the distance and bit his lips. The transformed Factory looked like
a giant. It was an old giant spewing smoke from a chimney on its head. The
giant's hand pulled out something from a nearby building.

"Kuaaack!"

The dying noble struggled as he was caught by the hands of the Factory.
Looking closer, it was the marquis I fought before.

"Duke! Duuuuuke!" He shouted painfully before being crushed in the
Factory's fuel engine.

There was the sound of teeth grinding. Heavy flames emerged from the
power plant side of the Factory as if it was satisfied. Now I was able to
determine how the duke operated the Factory. Jang Hayoung spoke in a
weak voice. "Using his own men as a source of power… how can he do
that?"

"It means he doesn't care about the industrial complex anymore.

"…Why? Isn't this his industrial complex?"

I activated Lamarck's Giraffe instead of replying. It was to temporarily
restore my body by using story fragments.

「 Kim Dokja thought: This guy is determined to become the 'demon king'.
」

A large voice burst out from the head of the Factory and challenged the sky.

[Look constellations! This is what you want!]
It was the appearance of a duke fully absorbed in the story he was making.
How old was he and how many years had he lived?

All beings might just be children in front of the story. The duke's words
caused more constellations to enter Biyoo's channel.

[Very few constellations are curious about Duke Syswitz' actions.]

Maybe this was what I looked like. I was reminded of something.

「 "It is easy to attract the attention of the constellations. However, creating
a good scenario is difficult." 」

It was something the Dokkaebi King in Ways of Survival had once said. I
thought this saying was correct. Then I had a thought.

What was a good scenario? No, did it even exist?

"If we leave…!"

"Just wait a bit."

I stopped Jang Hayoung and looked up at the Factory. The Factory and the
'story weapons' produced an unusual force that couldn't be tolerated by the
existing probability. In other words, it was perfect for a self-destructive
scenario.

As expected, sparks burst from the joints of the randomly operating
Factory. I explained to Jang Hayoung. "Maybe his 'persuasion energy' is
lacking. It won't last long if he only has a few nobles."

The factory's persuasion energy that was its fuel was made of countless
story fragments. The story weapons consumed the persuasion energy and
temporarily overcame the probability. It was easy to say that the Factory
was similar to my current incarnation body.
Soon it would be caught up in a probability storm…

However, unlike what I thought, the movements of the Factory didn't
become dull.

[The constellation 'Nouveau Richer Snake Boss' is looking at Syswitz with
pleased eyes.]

[The constellation 'Nail-Eating Rat'is delighted with Syswitz' destruction.]

[A few constellations are willing to pay for the probability.]

…Damn, it was like this. There were those who paid the probability.

[Where is the revolutionary hiding?]

Once again, there was a huge earthquake and the citizens screamed in an
awful manner. I leaned against the building for a moment before slowly
walking forward.

Jang Hayoung hurriedly grabbed my arm. "You will die if you go now!
Can't you see that?"

I measured the durability of my incarnation body.

「 Do I have enough power to get rid of this enemy? 」

I didn't know.

「 Can I kill it if I use Electrification and Way of the Wind?」

I still didn't know. "Jang Hayoung, kill the last executioner. I'll somehow
take care of the rest."

Jang Hayoung stuttered at my words. "W-Why are you going so far? You
can run away! You aren't a real revolutionary!"
"I hate this damn story."

"…What?"

"It's so obvious."

I ran towards the Factory. The streets were mostly deserted. Most citizens
were trapped inside their houses and holding their breaths. I looked at the
scene and remembered Yoo Joonghyuk of the 111th regression.

「 The industrial complex's last Night arrived and the revolutionary didn't
appear. 」

…Yes, this was expected.

「 However, I wished for a different story. 」

Suddenly, a citizen bleeding against a wall reached out towards me.

"Re, volutionary…"

What revolution? What was all this about? Why did so many people have to
die? Why did this scenario exist?

[The constellation 'Nouveau Richer Snake Boss' is staring at you.]

[The constellation 'Nail-Eating Rat' is yelling towards you.]

[The constellation 'Dog Who Threw Himself into the Flames' wants your
destruction.]

The constellations sent messages towards me. Biyoo struggled as she was
forced to send the messages towards me. I waved my hand to indicate that it
was fine. Honestly, I wasn't fine before but now I was good.
[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' is looking at you.]

At the very least, one person was on my side.

[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' wants you to
smash that damn scrap heap.] I flew into the air.
           Chapter 218: Ep. 41 - Real Revolutionary, IV


The pistons of the cylinders installed on the Factory moved wildly while
the grinder roared. The story fragments that weren't digested popped out
from the surface like screws. It was evidence that this Factory wasn't a
finished product.

The duke slightly frowned as he saw the unstable exterior of the smoking
Factory. 'It isn't at a bad level yet'.

The Factory. Everyone in the Demon Realm had a similar story, even if
they were a grand duke. Of course, the power of each Factory varied but
Syswitz' Factory was unique.

'It was worthwhile going to the Underworld'.

A body height of 40 meters. The Factory that resembled a giant was based
off the Giant Soldier of the Underworld. It was a weapon that he barely
managed to get a look at by bribing one of the judges of the Underworld.
Of course, the duke's Factory was only a clone with an inferior output
compared to the giant soldier.

'I can't be satisfied with this degree…'

The Factory let out a harsh sound as if to express the duke's
disappointment. The blades of the grinder struck the ground. Dust filled the
area as dozens of civilian buildings collapsed. Just like a child breaking a
hand-crafted toy, the duke relentlessly broke them.

[Very few constellations are delighted at the exciting destruction!]

[Some constellations are pointing to the fleeing citizens!]

It was a long story. The history of the Syswitz Industrial Complex had
accumulated over countless years. Even so, there was no hesitation in the
duke's behaviour.

"Kuaaack!"

The duke picked up the stories that were blown out of the grinder and
thought. 'It is an offering to proceed with a bigger story'.

400 years. A time when a dynasty was born and collapsed. During that
time, Syswitz was the dictator here.

He once loved everything in this industrial complex. He was sometimes a
wise ruler and sometimes a tyrant. He tried to elevate the happiness of the
citizens through a gentle reign and he slaughtered them through oppression
and tyranny. He was happy, sad or sometimes interested.

Then one day, the duke had only one emotion left. 'I'm tired'.

After going on a field trip to Olympus and the Underworld, his thoughts
became even stronger.

'Why should I be eating these stories?'
He never forgot the lavish dinner that was served at the dining table of the
queen of the Underworld.

A sword master of another world, a great sage, a 9th circle great
magician… Syswitz ate the finely cooked story pieces and was truly
amazed. Oh my god, this taste. He had a soulless expression as he enjoyed
the tastes that burst in his mouth.

–I see that you're pretty good at eating.

Syswitz came to his senses and noticed that Persephone never touched the
food in front of her. Persephone stared at the stories that were ravenously
scattered on his plate like they were terrible food. Syswitz couldn't forget
the disgrace he felt at that moment.

'I will go to the next scenario'.

Bigger stories. Bigger stimuli. Then he would gain a bigger power.

'I will become a demon king. I will live by eating huge stories that are far
superior to those fucking guys'.

For that dream, it meant nothing to discard this trivial industrial complex.

[…What revolution?]

His voice trembled and the whole industrial complex shook.

[Look, there is no such thing as a revolution! It is just the roleplay of the
scenario!]

It was a tone that mocked all citizens.

[A play that has been repeated over and over for 400 years. You are
fighting for such a foolish thing!]
Syswitz shouted despite also being part of the scenario. He felt like he
could move onto the next stage.

'I can do it'.

It seemed successful to some extent. Duke Syswitz felt a sense of liberation
as numerous constellation focused their gazes on him. A peripheral pleasure
obtained from denying oneself. Syswitz felt like he was the center of the
whole world for the first time. By the way… "Do you really think so?"
Someone cried out.




Of course, it was me.

「 You… 」

…Damn. The problem was that I heard his inner thoughts too well.

[The character 'Demon Duke Syswitz' is overwhelmed by his delusions.]

[The exclusive skill, 'Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint' stage 2 has been
strongly activated!]

The thoughts of the duke randomly poured in. It was like looking at his
naked self. To a certain extent, even those who didn't use Omniscient
Reader's Viewpoint could feel it.

[The constellation Nail-Eating Rat's hands and feel are curling up from the
duke's words and deeds.]

[The constellation 'Nouveau Richer Snake Boss' says he is okay because he
doesn't have hands or feet.]
These guys were even laughing. The duke didn't know the situation and
smiled at me. [Fake revolutionary.]

"Who is fake?"

I activated Bookmark and Way of the Wind before running forward. A
giant blow narrowly passed by me. A crater occurred in the place where the
grinder passed like a bomb had gone off.

…This level was enough to hit a historical-grade constellation? It was a
power that I couldn't endure in this damn incarnation body. This was the
power of a story weapon. It made non-constellations a match for
constellations.

Furthermore, Duke Syswitz might not be a constellation but he was d
demon had historical-grade stories comparable to historical-grade
constellations.

The bombs from the grinder swept through the industrial complex. Citizens
ran out crying as they lost their homes. They were people who lost their
hometowns and came to the Demon Realm, struggling to make a life here.
The citizens who lost their jobs were staring at me with soot-covered faces.

I looked at the citizens and had a thought. I also disliked the scenarios.
But… dammit.

「 Kim Dokja thought: I hate to admit it. 」

I seemed to understand why this scenario existed. I split through the air
using Way of the Wind. I instantly arrived at the head of the Factory and
once again used Electrification.

[The durability of your incarnation body is at a dangerous level!]

I fainted earlier and used up the duration of Bookmark in vain. I only had
20 minutes left. A blue-white whirl of lightning emerged from my right
hand and rushed towards the Factory. The exterior of the Factory shook
slightly.

[Kuek…?]

As expected, I lacked hitting power. My current incarnation body could
only exert a quarter of the original firepower.

[Better than expected…]

Moreover, the sustainability wasn't long. Nevertheless, I had to fight. I
had to defeat this guy with my own hands. [The constellation 'status' is
released.]

[Your incarnation body is several damaged and only a fraction of the
energy is released.]

It was a short time but for a moment, the Factory temporarily stopped
working. I didn't miss this gap and focused magic power on both fists.

[This aura? You, don't tell me…!]

[The Gold Dragon's Broken Heart is activated!]

Whenever the amount of magic power sharply decreased, the gold dragon's
heart recharged my magic power. In the ensuing battle, the Factory's hard
shell started to be peeled off. Screws popped out and story pieces flowed
from the gap.

「 Kim Dokja thought: It would've been a good fight if my body was fine.
」

[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' is watching you
anxiously.]
I stood firmly and hit the upper part of the Factory with a fist containing all
the power of Electrification. If I knew that I would have such a hard fight, I
would've learnt more diligently from Kyrgios. Well, I guess I didn't have
talent.

[The durability of your incarnation body is reaching its limit.]

[If you don't stop combat immediately, the collapse of your body will
resume.]

My breathing was becoming worse and my fists were slowing down. The
Factory was still in good condition.

The duke spoke with delight. [Thanks to you, the last scenario of the
industrial complex will be very sweet.]

I knew I couldn't win. First of all, I wasn't fighting for the sake of winning.
「 Kim Dokja looked down at the citizens of the industrial complex. 」

People were watching me. Some people's mouths were wide open while
others had their two hands joined together. I could also see Aileen and
Mark. Each person was different but they all had similar expressions.

「 Revolutionary and fighting. 」

It was enough to think this.

「 There is a revolution. 」

It didn't matter if it was real or fake. It had once been written that the things
people believed in had power. Just like a story became reality.

[Your influence on the story will become more pronounced.]

The next moment, the Factory's huge arm took my attack. My body was
thrown back by the shock wave.
[Your fighting ability is good but you can't win. You are fake.]

I raised my body from the broken floor. "As you said, I'm not a
revolutionary. However, there is a revolution."

[Such a thing doesn't exist.]

"Why do you think that? Is it because you were a 'revolutionary' at first?"

[…!]

"In the end, even if a revolution occurs, the endless cycle of governance
will repeat?"

I could understand Duke Syswitz' feelings. I was well aware of the tragedy
of the 'Revolutionary Scenario'. What made a revolutionary a
revolutionary?

"It is you who failed, not everyone else."

There were terrible scenarios. There were tragic scenarios. However—
"There are no meaningless scenarios."

No matter how rubbish a scenario, people ended up living that scenario.
They were happy or sad. They struggled against the impossible. Someone
died while someone else saved another person.

This was the scenario of Ways of Survival that I knew. That's why I was
able to keep reading Ways of Survival.

My body became harder and harder to move. If I had followed the original
novel, I wouldn't have suffered like this.

「 Yoo Joonghyuk had a thought. If he doesn't know who the revolutionary
is, he can kill them all until the revolutionary emerges. 」
In the end, the Yoo Joonghyuk of the 111th regression made the worse
choice. However, I didn't want to do this. That's why I kept fighting.

The duke once again struck and in the end, my back was grazed. Towards
the me without strength, the giant hands of the Factory came again and
again.

[Your story is quite tempting. I'm going to eat you.]

He was a person who had gone to the Underworld and tasted excellent
stories. It was natural for him to be thrilled when looking at me. As soon as
the giant hand was about to grab me, someone rushed towards me with all
their power and rolled holding me.

A familiar woman stood in the place where dust rose. "What are you
doing?"

The chairman of the Civil Council, Aileen. I stood up on the wall with a
frown. "Get out of the way."

"You've done enough." Aileen didn't move. I saw her determined
expression and a corner of my heart froze. Wait a minute, surely the
revolutionary…

[Hahaha! Where are you hiding? Self-proclaimed revolutionary!]

Aileen turned back after hearing the duke's voice. I realized what she was
going to do and hurriedly chased her. Just as she stood in front of the duke,
someone shouted, "The revolutionary is here!"

It was the first time I had seen this person. He shouted while pointing at
himself.

[Someone has made a 'revolutionary declaration'!]
He could've been a member of the Civil Council or a hidden citizen. I didn't
know the revolutionary's name or face. They were just a passing extra not
mentioned in Ways of Survival.

[What…?]

"No, I am the revolutionary!" This time it was a woman's voice. I didn't
know these faces. The woman trembled as she shouted but nevertheless, she
stood firmly upright. This was the start as voices burst from everywhere.

[Someone has made a 'revolutionary declaration'!]

[Someone has made a 'revolutionary declaration'!]

Aileen and Mark were the same. It wasn't just the citizens. Many of the
incarnations hiding in the house also cried out. They held weapons while
shouting in an irresistible manner.

"I am the revolutionary! Kill me!"

The features of the citizens holding weapons were extremely desperate.
Numerous citizens armed with weapons advanced towards the Factory like
a wave. I was so excited that I stumbled.

「 It was a sight that didn't appear in the Ways of Survival that Yoo
Joonghyuk lived. 」

It was a pity. I wanted to show the 111th round Yoo Joonghyuk this sight.
If he saw this, he definitely would've made a different choice.

At this moment.

"I am the revolutionary Yoo Joonghyuk!" Someone shouted.

"I am Yoo Joonghyuk!"

"No, I am!"
…What? No, wait a minute.

"I am Yoo Joonghyuk!"

What the hell were they thinking? Now people were shouting a name
instead of 'revolutionary'. There were countless Yoo Joonghyuks in the
industrial complex.

[Someone has made a 'Yoo Joonghyuk declaration'!]

No… wait.

[The Star Stream's achievement system is confused.]




At the same time.

A man dressed in a black coat with a small doll on his shoulder arrived at
an industrial complex. The man looked at the industrial complex and
muttered. "…Is this Kim Dokja's location?"

[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' is nodding with a faint blush.]
            Chapter 219: Ep. 41 - Real Revolutionary, V


Yoo Joonghyuk entered the industrial complex by using Covert Maneuver
and Stealth Shroud.

[You have entered the new main scenario area.]

The Demon Realm's industrial complex. He had visited the Demon Realm
in the second regression but it was the first time he came in this period of
time.

He slowly looked around and saw the citizens wandering the area. Their
faces showed that they abandoned the scenario and felt despair at the world.

It was one of the reasons why Yoo Joonghyuk rarely formed bonds. He
didn't want to share that despair. This was the most poisonous emotion for a
regressor.

'It is quieter than I thought. I thought it would be a mess thanks to Kim
Dokja'.
He looked around and there wasn't anyone who seemed to be Kim Dokja.
He would be easily seen with his unusual behaviour…

Yoo Joonghyuk wondered if he was really alive.

"…How annoying. It is too big."

[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' is hoping you won't make any
unnecessary sacrifices.]

He turned his head to see the Uriel doll puffing up her cheeks. Yoo
Joonghyuk gave a small sigh and focused his eyesight as he looked around.
He came here with the symbolic body of an archangel so his actions were
limited.

'I can grab a citizen and ask…'

As he focused his senses, he felt dark energy hiding among the citizens. It
was a characteristic of demons. If it was a demon then the archangel
couldn't say anything.

'They must have a lot of information'.

Of course, a demon was strong. However, Yoo Joonghyuk was a
transcendent. He rose to this realm without borrowing the power of his
sponsor. There were few presences that could threaten Yoo Joonghyuk
unless they were equal to a constellation.

'That is a good one'.

Yoo Joonghyuk moved through the shadows like flowing water and quickly
spotted his desired target. Yoo Joonghyuk activated a skill before the
startled demon earl could scream.

[The exclusive skill 'Sound Wave Blocking Lv. 10'. is activated!]
The demon earl's neck was grabbed. Yoo Joonghyuk opened his mouth. "If
you answer my questions carefully from now on, I will spare you."

Of course, he didn't mean to spare the demon but he still said so. It was
because he knew from experience that this was more effective.

The confused demon earl shouted, "W-Who are you…!"

"Kueeok! S-Such a thing…"

A brutal assault was poured towards the demon earl and his body became
ragged in an instant. The demon earl coughed up black blood and spat out
all types of curses. Then he changed his tune in less than five minutes.

"A-Ask! Ask anything you want!"

Then Yoo Joonghyuk opened his mouth. "Kim Dokja…"

Yoo Joonghyuk was talking when he suddenly remembered something.
'Kim Dokja' obviously wouldn't mention his own name here. Yoo
Joonghyuk changed the question.

"Where is Yoo Joonghyuk?"




[Someone has made a 'Yoo Joonghyuk declaration'!]

[Someone has made a 'Yoo Joonghyuk declaration'!]

Numerous citizens shouted the name 'Yoo Joonghyuk'. It seemed as if the
entire industrial complex had become 'Yoo Joonghyuk'. As I came to my
senses, I noticed the countless 'Yoo Joonghyuk' advancing towards the
Factory.
"I am Yoo Joonghyuk!"

"I am the real Yoo Joonghyuk!"

Of course, I moved between them and raised a hand.

"Yoo Joonghyuk! Wow…"

Yoo Joonghyuk should've seen this sight…

I wondered what he would look like if he was here.

[The name of 'Revolutionary Yoo Joonghyuk' is being widely spread in the
73rd Demon Realm.]

The Star Stream was a world of stories. So many citizens here were calling
out Yoo Joonghyuk's name so he must've acquired a considerable degree of
stories. I didn't know what these jerks were doing but he got to eat well…
Then a strange message was heard.

[Your reputation is rising.]

Huh?

[The reputation of 'Kim Dokja' is rapidly increasing in the 73rd Demon
Realm.]

The messages continued to be heard.

…What was this situation? I never said my name?

[T-These damn guys…!]

On the other hand, Duke Syswitz was baffled by the surging tide of people.

[The last executioner has died.]
[Duke Syswitz's 'ruler' effect is disabled.]

Then Jang Hayoung finally completed his mission.

[All executioners in the industrial complex have died.]

[Everyone in the industrial complex has gained the 'execution right' for the
ruler.]

[From now on, the 'Night of Revolution' will begin!}

Night of Revolution. The citizens were excited as they heard this message
for their first time in their lives. The 'execution rights' for the duke. They
had the power to directly punish the ruler.

"Wahhhh! Goooooo!"

Just like waves hitting hard reefs, the citizens flocked towards the Factory.
The citizens were bloody and countless citizens were trampled on by the
Factory, but this caused the citizens' will to burn even higher.

"Smash it!"

The citizens were thinking that they just needed to smash this big pile of
metal. They just needed to get beyond this iron barrier and they could tear
apart the duke.

「 However, the citizens didn't know. This was actually the greatest hurdle
of this revolution. 」

The giant grinder started to spin and the citizens were sliced apart in the
blink of an eye.

"Uwaaaack!"

"Back off!"
In the Revolutionary Scenario, the Night of Revolution was the time when
the duke was the weakest. It was because every citizen in the industrial
zone gained the power to kill the duke. Nevertheless, there were conditions.
The duke needed to come out of the Factory.

"Shit! It is too hard!"

The shall of the Factory didn't break down no matter how it was smashed.
The duke laughed.

[Foolish things.]

At one time, he was also a revolutionary. Thus, he never thought about this
day. Night of Revolution was the most dangerous time for a duke. Still, the
duke was absolutely safe as long as he didn't leave the Factory.

[There is nothing that can destroy this Factory.]

Thus, the duke made his Factory in the hardest form in the world. It was
built on the basis of the Giant Soldier in the Underworld. It was impossible
for this fearsome story weapon to be broken with the power of the citizens.

The duke showed no mercy in his movements. Every time the grinder
moved, the citizens' bodies were torn to pieces. Indirect messages poured
down from the sky like rain.

[The constellation 'Nouveau Richer Snake Boss' is drunk from the
battlefield of blood.]

[The constellation 'Nail-Eating Rat' is excited about the human slaughter.]

The coin messages poured as the ranks of the citizens were broken.

"Aaaaack!"

The revolution was crumbling before the solid outer wall that couldn't be
broken.
"Aileen. Is everything ready?"

"The temporary measures are over. But the battle…"

"It's fine. I just need to move once."

I responded roughly and stood up. This was probably the limit of what I
was capable of with the story repair.

[Where are you hiding? Recite that smug revolutionary declaration again!]

I listened to the duke's voice and went forward. I held firmly to Unbroken
Faith and walked step by step. Sparks appeared around the outer shell of the
Factory thanks to excessive probability consumption. The Factory was
obviously a force outside the scenario. It was the constellations supporting
this unfair scenario.

「 Kim Dokja thought: If the duke is crushing the people with a power
from outside the scenario, I can do the same thing.」

"Biyoo."

The hiding Biyoo emerged with a "Baat."

"Extend the bandwidth of the channel to the Underworld."

It might be difficult for the present Biyoo but if I didn't do this, I wouldn't
be able to use this method.

"Can you do it?"

Biyoo seemed tired but nodded.

[Baat.]

This was really the last resort. I remembered the memories of my second
trip to the Underworld.
–This is the key to making a giant soldier. Understood?

–Oho, it was like this… hey, I really appreciate it!

–Well, if you really appreciate it, place my name in the maker column.

I hadn't used it until now because this story weapon consumed a huge
amount of probability. A weapon that would cause a probability storm
simply by summoning it. Therefore, this weapon was limited by probability
unless it was a scenario of Gigantomachia. It was impossible for me to
summon it, even if I have the strongest sword.

"Prisoner of the Golden Headband."

The story was a bit different if I wasn't alone.

[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' is looking at you.]

"Please help me."

Of course, it was only a summoning even with the Great Sage, Heaven's
Equal's help. Even so, I could win just by summoning it.

[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' says it is against the
fairness of the scenario.]

"I want to change this scenario."

I stopped talking and glanced at the Factory where sparks were flying.
They might've received a buff due to the execution rights but the citizens
weren't able to lay one hand on the duke. If this continued, the population
of the industrial complex would be wiped up in the next few minutes.
"Besides, hasn't it stopped being fair a long time ago?"

[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' is annoyed.]
Damn, I thought we were a bit closer. Originally, the Great Sage, Heaven's
Equal was the type that didn't get easily involved in such matters. Maybe it
was a miracle that he was even listening to me.

"Are you really going to leave these guys alone? They are the ones who
hijacked the probability first."

[The constellation 'Nouveau Richer Snake Boss' is rejoicing in the mess.]

"There are no dokkaebis here to deter them."

The Great Sage, Heaven's Equal was silent. Thinking about it, he didn't
lend me probability even during the King of a Kingless World story. In the
end, I committed a taboo.

"Did you receive a strange message a while ago?"

[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' is asking about what
you mean.]

"I don't know the details but it is about the missing hair―"

A thunderous aura was felt from the sky. It was the Great Sage, Heaven's
Equal's anger.

I shouted in reply to the anger. "That's right. They are the ones who sent it."

[The constellation 'Nouveau Richer Snake Boss' is staring at you with
astonishment.]

[The constellation 'Nail-Eating Rat' is biting his nails at the unexpected
situation.]

[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' is furious.]

At this moment, the hair of the Great Sage, Heaven's Equal that I left in my
pocket floated into the air. I replied with a sigh, "…I will use it well."
I grasped the hair and felt the power of a condensed story. There was
inherent energy in the hair. It was hard for me to measure the strength of
the Great Sage, Heaven's Equal. The first thing that mattered here…

I hesitated for a moment before watching the sky and chanting the 'starting
words'.

"…Now, the sword designed to cut a sleeping giant."

The moment I started chanting the first words, the colour of the sky began
to change. The clouds showed signs of abnormality and a new, ominous
aura filled the night sky.

[Constellations of the Demon Realm have noticed your presence!]

Yes, I was caught. It would be strange if I wasn't noticed but it couldn't be
helped. I hoped that Persephone and Hades would take care of me.

"Now, descend here."

The discoloured sky started to split in half. In the gap, two huge eyes were
staring at me.

[The Giant Soldier Pluto has responded to your call.]

The sparks of a formidable probability shook my body. I jerked like an
electric eel and red blood flowed from my eyes. I wanted to scream but it
was a pain that didn't even allow me to scream.

[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' is sharing your
probability.]

My already tattered body wasn't immediately destroyed because the Great
Sage, Heaven's Equal was bearing some of the price.

[The demon kings of the Demon Realm are stunned by the surprise
probability storm!]
[A few constellations are surprised by the abnormalities in the scenario!]

There was another huge shadow covering the sky. Some citizens noticed
and stared at the sky. Then their eyes slowly widened.

"D-Disaster…"

The duke discovered it late and also looked up. A black gas emerged from
the gap in the cracked sky. The shell boasted an eerie luster like a black
dragon's scales. The duke saw its appearance and exclaimed with shock.

[T-This… h-how…!]

Shock filled his face.

[I heard it was incomplete!]

It was incomplete at one time. To be exact, it was until I visited the
Underworld.

「 The secret weapon of the Underworld King, Giant Soldier Pluto. 」

Finally, a huge armoured weapon with a height of 30 meters fell from the
sky.
           Chapter 220: Ep. 41 - Real Revolutionary, VI


The body of the giant soldier appeared with a loud roar. In the original
novel, it was the weapon of the Underworld King but in the second half,
Yoo Joonghyuk started using it in earnest. The ultimate weapon that struck
the giant in the myths was summoned in front of me by the probability I
shared with the Great Sage, Heaven's Equal.

Blood flowed as I looked up at Pluto with a messy and shaky vision.

[Your incarnation body has reached its limit!]

[Your incarnation body has reached its limit!]

Shut up. I had to maintain consciousness. At least, until I gave a command
to him.

[What? Where is this?]
Then I heard a voice. It was obviously a voice I had once heard before. This
guy used his 'soul' as the last ingredient. I called the guy's name. "Kim
Namwoon."

Then Pluto's thick body looked this way.

[…Subway grasshopper?]

"…That's right."

Kim Namwoon laughed as if he realized everything.

[Hahaha! What, did you really use those starting words?]

The starting words to summon the giant soldier were given to me by Kim
Namwoon.

–Understood? I will use these starting words so remember them well. If you
call it properly, I might be able to help you once.

I didn't know if he would really use those words as the starting word.
However, his personality didn't change just because he died.

"You entered it directly."

[Hahaha, of course! I like this feeling!]

Originally, all souls planted in the giant soldier were overseen by the main
system. Now Kim Namwoon planted his own soul in the software of the
giant soldier.

[Okay, it is a special service. Take a look ahjussi. I'll give you a good
show.]

"I'm sorry but I don't have the strength to do so…"

[What? Why is that?]
I lifted my finger without any strength and pointed somewhere. Pluto's gaze
followed my finger and its mouth moved curiously. I opened my mouth,
"Finish it."

The probability allowed me to summon the giant soldier for less than a
minute. There was probably only 30 seconds left.

The fear-stricken Duke was moving the Factory this way. [T-This is
impossible! Why, why is the real giant soldier…!]

The fiercely rotating grinder struck Pluto's outer shell.

[What is this crappy toy?]

The grinder that the duke was proud of was torn down with a simple swing
of its hand.

It was a light hand gesture like tearing a piece of paper.

[Did you call me to destroy something like this? It is really too much.]

…There were 25 seconds until the summoning was cancelled.

[How annoying.]

Pluto was moving steadily despite the complaints.

20 seconds. It smashed the arms of the Factory with an outstretched fist.

15 seconds. The hand sword completely paralyzed the operations of the
Factory.

10 seconds. A simple kick smashed the main power unit of the Factory.

The fearsome Factory that ate a tremendous amount of stories sank down. It
was impossible to know if the duke inside the Factory was dead or alive.
Pluto's body turned towards me.
[Is it over now? Haha, then what now?]

"…"

[Ahjussi. Now you are stuck with me…]

Then a tremendous probability storm swept over Pluto. Kim Namwoon's
voice was buried by a roaring sound that seemed to rip apart time and
space.

The body of Giant Soldier Pluto started to disappear into powder like it was
vaporized. The probability was exhausted and it was forced to return.

…One second.

[Damn. Underworld, I…]

That damn jerk. I'm not going back there, you idiot.

[The summoning of 'Giant Soldier Pluto' has been released.]

The giant soldier disappeared but people still couldn't react. The majority of
citizens were stunned from shock and those who managed to open their
eyes were already crazy. It was natural. The incarnations here had
witnessed the greatest god of death in this world.

I turned my head and looked at the wreckage of the Factory. The outer shell
that wasn't damaged by my Electrification was now a mess, like it had been
hit by a fierce beast. There were no movements from the Factory since its
joints were broken and the power part was destroyed. It had been destroyed
by the giant soldier in less than 30 seconds.

I slowly climbed up the Factory and found the person sitting in the cockpit.
The lid of the cockpit was cracked open and the demon sitting there was
bloody.

"Cough, cough!"
It was Duke Syswitz. The duke looked up at me with eyes full of disbelief.
"Y-You. What are you…"

The Factory was the duke's main story. The story was ruined and the duke
absolutely wasn't safe anymore. I aimed Unbroken Faith at the guy. The
duke opened his mouth, "From the wenny people… I heard about you."

The duke foresaw his end and started chattering. "Unfortunate constellation,
you will never survive if you kill me… Because you―"

I stabbed his heart without hesitation. There was no energy left so I fell
from the Factory along with his body. There was terrible pain and I gasped
as I looked up at the sky. Aileen came running to support me.

"…The duke?"

"He is dead."

Then the system messages came up.

[Demon Duke Syswitz has been defeated.]

[200,000 coins have been acquired.]

I weakly laughed. However, it wasn't yet time to relax.

[You have defeated the 'ruler' of the industrial complex.]

[You aren't a 'revolutionary'.]

[The normal scenario route wasn't followed and the 'ruler' inheritance has
been cancelled.]

[The inheritance is automatically transferred to the most prestigious person
in the current scenario.]

[The current 'hidden scenario' is in progress.]
[Kill the 'real revolutionary' to enter the main scenario.]

…It was as expected. Killing the duke didn't allow me to enter the scenario.
I sold the name of Yoo Joonghyuk so maybe Yoo Joonghyuk was given the
inheritance rights to the industrial complex.

"…What is my status?"

Aileen bit her lips as she repaired my story. "It's okay. I'll fix it."

"…How much time do I have left?"

Aileen didn't answer.

"Tell me quickly."

"10 minutes. No… 5 minutes."

My five senses were becoming paralyzed. My lips didn't listen to my
instructions and the sensation at end of my hand gradually faded. I couldn't
hear the system messages anymore. Perhaps my body was broken enough
that it could no longer be repaired. I didn't know why I was suffering like
this despite coming to the Demon Realm.

Aileen's voice quivered. "You said you are looking for a revolutionary…"

"Yes."

"Why?"

"I have to kill the revolutionary to enter the main scenario."

There was no reason to hide it so I answered honestly. Then Aileen stared
at me. "I see…"

Aileen seemed like she made up her mind.
"You can live. Because I…"

"The revolutionary was in the ranks earlier. Isn't that right?"

I cut off Aileen's struggling words. "You wanted to hide and also wanted to
run away."

"…"

"Still, you came out and fought hard."

Aileen watched me for a moment before turning her head. I could tell what
expression she was making without looking.

"Don't cry. I'm not going to die." I laughed without strength.

「 Kim Dokja thought: If I kill the revolutionary here, the stories I've
accumulated will be meaningless. 」

There would be a method even if I didn't become the 'revolutionary'. It had
always been this way so far. "Aileen. Didn't you ask something before? The
thing I asked you to make…"

Aileen pulled something out. It was a rectangular communication device
equipped with a panel. It was the smartphone I asked her to produce.

"Turn it on please…"

The panel turned on and a message automatically appeared.

[You have acquired a new device. Synchronization has started.]

The synchronization finished and as expected, a file was created on the
desktop. My eyes were still blurred and I couldn't see properly, but it was
obviously the text of Ways of Survival.

「 Kim Dokja thought: I am a 'reader'. All the answers are here. 」
I somehow opened my eyes and looked at the text. However, my vision was
blurred and I couldn't see. I had to find a way to break through this situation
by reading Ways of Survival but funnily enough, I couldn't read it.

「 Kim Dokja thought for the first time. 」

…Dammit.

「 This is the end. 」

At last, even Aileen's face was blurred.

[The hidden scenario 'Self-Proclaimed Revolutionary' has been cleared.]

It was an auditory hallucination.

[You have become a revolutionary.]

I definitely thought it was a hallucination.

[Congratulations. You have officially entered the main scenario.]

[The exile penalty has ended.]

[Your incarnation body has automatically started to recover.]

[Your collapsing stories are recovering.]

It was impossible. My five senses were returning and my faded vision
started to reappear. I looked around with wide eyes. Aileen was safe. Jang
Hayoung and Mark were the same. None of them were dead. Then why…?

This wasn't the end.

[The name 'Kim Dokja' is being widely spread in the 73rd Demon Realm.]

[All the demons in the Gilobat Complex are afraid of your name.]
[The citizens of the Gilobat Industrial Complex have joined your
revolution.]

I thought I heard wrongly for a moment.

…The Gilobat Industrial Complex? This… it wasn't the Syswitz Industrial
Complex?

[A group of people who consider 'Kim Dokja' a hero have appeared in the
Gilobat Industrial Complex.]

The Gilobat Industrial Complex was quite a distance from the Syswitz
Industrial Complex. There was no way my name would resonate there. I
listened to the explosive messages and thought about some faint
possibilities. Even so, the possibilities were too dim.

[Someone has killed the 'ruler' of the Gilobat Industrial Complex!]

[You are currently the most prestigious person in the Gilobat Industrial
Complex.]

[Due to the scenario possibility, you have become the owner of the Gilobat
Industrial Complex.]

This was impossible. It was something that couldn't happen.

"Haha…"

There was a flustered laugh as relief spread from deep inside my heart. I
wonder why. I glanced at Aileen's wrist watch at this moment.

The clock wasn't going backwards. The time was advancing steadily
without rewinding. The needle could go back but time wouldn't return.

"…He came." I was so happy that I wanted to call out his name.
"Huh? What are you saying?"

I smiled and said, "The real Yoo Joonghyuk came."

I couldn't see or hear it but I could feel it. That person was definitely in this
world. The guy who slaughtered a strong demon with the Splitting the Sky
Sword had arrived from beyond the horizon. I was lost in these wild
feelings and forgot about my smartphone.

「 Perhaps Kim Dokja should've checked the smartphone first. 」

I heard the Fourth Wall's words and reflexively picked up the fallen phone.
As usual, the title of the text file appeared on the screen. Then I realized
something and a corner of my heart was frightened. Something had been
altered. To be exact, there were strange words attached to the title of the txt
file.

–Three Ways to Survive in a Ruined World (1st Revision).txt
                  Chapter 221: Ep. 42 - Asmodeus, I


A sleeper car was rolling around. The citizens of the council, including
Aileen, were busy moving me somewhere. I could feel the fragments of my
stories constantly entering, like patient in critical condition.

Putting aside the urgent situation, my mind was gradually becoming calm. I
decided to sort out the situation.

[Currently, you have the inheritance rights to the Gilobat Industrial
Complex.]

How did I become a revolutionary and gain the inheritance rights of the
Gilobat Industrial Complex?

The answer was simple.

「 'Kim Dokja' killed the ruler of the Gilobat Industrial Complex. 」
At first glance, it seemed like a circular argument but this wasn't the case. It
was because 'Kim Dokja' wasn't my body. In other words, it was easy for
someone to impersonate me, build up a reputation there and finally kill the
ruler.

[The Star Stream is correcting the scenario error.]

[A new story related to you is scheduled.]

What crazy person could do such a thing? There obviously couldn't be two
such crazy guys.

「 Kim Dokja thought: Yoo Joonghyuk is now in the Gilobat Industrial
Complex. 」

At first, I purely felt gratitude. Ah! Yoo Joonghyuk was a decent person!
That jerk hit the industrial complex to save me! I felt thrilled for a while
without thinking much.

Then once I thought about it, I couldn't believe it. That Yoo Joonghyuk
entered the Gilobat Industrial Complex to save me? In the first place, it was
strange that Yoo Joonghyuk knew about my crisis. How could a guy who
wasn't a constellation or have access to a channel know about my crisis?

Thus, Yoo Joonghyuk was likely to do the opposite of coming to my
rescue. He noticed that I impersonated him and came to the Demon Realm
to pick me up. In the meantime, something went wrong and he headed to
the Gilobat Industrial Complex first where he went through an unnecessary
dispute and overturned the industrial complex. I couldn't even fathom how
much rage it felt to do that.

"You're being healed. Don't shake your body." Aileen, who was working on
my story in the treatment room, pushed up her glasses and scolded me.

I replied in a dispirited manner. "I'm sorry, it is instinct. How is my state?"
"Don't talk nonsense in your current physical condition." Aileen sighed but
her expression didn't look bad. "I can only see it as a miracle. You are
slowly recovering. The damage to your stories is so big it will be hard to
move around but… I think you will be fine.

Maybe it was because I entered the main scenario again but my sense of
breathing had changed.

Those who didn't know what it felt like to be an exile and return to the
scenario wouldn't understand.

「 Kim Dokja thought: This is the 'story'. 」

It felt like a cozy and huge world was embracing me. Funnily enough, it felt
like I was now living properly. It was frightening to think about who
designed these 'senses'.

"Kuek…"

"Don't move!"

Aileen's sharp voice was heard along with the strong pangs.

[Your current story configuration is incomplete.]

I had entered the scenario and was in the recovery phase but things were
still serious. It was a miracle that I survived long enough to kill Duke
Syswitz. It was a reckless battle. It was uncharacteristic of me and I didn't
know why I acted like that.

[Some constellations are asking about you.]

Moreover, I summoned the story weapon so my future stories would
become very complicated. I opened the message log that I had been putting
off.
[Many constellations in the channel are greatly impressed by your
performance!]

[3,000 coins have been sponsored.]

[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' is nodding at your
confidence.]

[4,000 coins have been sponsored.]

There was some sponsorship. Somehow I wasn't impressed.

[The 20th main scenario has ended.]

[The main scenario 'Demon Realm Revolution' has been cleared.]

[The excessive main scenario skip is delaying the compensation.]

[The collection of stories due to clearing the main scenario is pending.]

There were some problems but the scenario messages came up correctly.

[Some constellations are wondering about your identity.]

[Some constellations would like to invite you to their nebula!]

[Someone is eyeing your story!]

The familiar shenanigans had also begun. It was understandable why they
were running around like this.

「 The story weapon Pluto. 」

Even the narrative-grade constellations coveted the giant soldier. The giant
soldier was a rare weapon that could only be seen in the huge stories of
Gigantomachia. It was a weapon that could trample on the legendary story,
the Factory like it was a toy. There was no way the constellations wouldn't
covet such a weapon.

By the way, 'he' hadn't come yet…

[The constellation 'Father of the Rich Night' is watching you.]

…He came, shit.

[The constellation 'Father of the Rich Night' is watching you.]

Father of the Rich Night. Fortunately, he didn't take any action apart from
looking at me. It was normal for him to be angry because I used his story
weapon… No, Hades looking at me might be a terrible thing in itself. He
was the king of the Underworld.

[The exclusive skill 'Fourth Wall' is strongly activated!]

[The Fourth Wall is laughing.]

Dammit, I disliked this mean fellow.

Of course, I was narrative-grade and could touch Hades' toes but the
problem was my current condition. The bandages wrapped around my body
represented my present situation.

The incarnation body was the phenotype of my status. The phenotype was
ruined so the status of the constellation inevitably shrunk. It was the first
time I had been injured like this…

It was hard to lift one arm but the smartphone in my hand was comforting. I
was grinning and Aileen frowned as she bandaged me. "…I told you not to
look at that for too long."

"My mother always said this."

"You need to maintain absolute stability."
"For me, looking at this is absolutely stable."

I deliberately didn't explain. It would probably be filtered even if explained.

"What about the Syswitz Industrial Complex? No, now we should call it the
Yoo Joonghyuk Industrial Complex."

"It's fine."

The duke died and the industrial complex was on its way to stability. There
was a lot of talk about the removal slaves and the treatment of the nobles
who were prisoners but Aileen was doing well.

Aileen looked at me for a moment and asked, "In fact, you aren't Yoo
Joonghyuk?"

It was a question I had anticipated and I nodded. "That's right, I'm not him."

"However, the owner of this industrial complex is now Yoo Joonghyuk."

Certainly, it was true. In fact, there was a mention in my messages.

[The current owner of the industrial complex is Duke Yoo Joonghyuk.]

Duke Yoo Joonghyuk… That jerk should be thanking me. I glanced at
Aileen and told her, "The duke will soon come."

Aileen's expression filled with a strange tension. "…Yoo Joonghyuk is a
demon?"

"He isn't a demon although sometimes he feels like a demon." I was
worried about how to explain and finally decided to say, "In this round,
Yoo Joonghyuk is a good guy."

Aileen didn't understand what I meant. I shook my head. "I have a favour to
ask. Can you call Jang Hayoung and Han Myungoh to me? I have
something to say to them."
"…I understand."

I had passed one crisis but it was literally only 'one'. The 'Revolutionary'
scenario was over but the following scenarios were incomparably larger in
scale.

[some demon kings are interested in your actions.]

If I wasn't cautious, I would be eaten. Thus, from now on, I had to prepare
step by step. As soon as Aileen disappeared, I opened the file on the panel
screen without hesitation.

–Three Ways to Survive in a Ruined World (1st Revision).txt

It was the long-awaited Ways of Survival. My heart was already beating
quickly. What did first revision mean? In addition, why did the writer give
this to me?

However, the file didn't immediately appear. It might be due to the smart
made by Aileen. The performance was enough to make me miss my old
smartphone. The file barely opened after a considerable amount of time
passed.

"…The phone isn't slow. It is the file that is too big."

Indeed, this was around the time it would take to load on an unoptimized
PC. I felt a bit sick at the huge amount of text.

Damn, how did I read this?

In order to see where the story was modified, I had to read it again from the
beginning and compare it to my memories. I started reading the first ten
pages.

…There didn't seem to be much change? It started with the subway and
Yoo Joonghyuk's actions…
This was a revision so why was this jerk still like this? Then a sentence that
didn't exist in the original Ways of Survival appeared for the first time.

「 Yoo Joonghyuk thought, 'If it was him, I wouldn't have thought of this'.
」

I stopped as I felt cold.

「 'If he had been here, I would've judged things a bit differently…' 」

I subconsciously scrolled back to the first page. The performance of the
smartphone caused the text to be mixed up but I couldn't afford to worry
about it. An eerie feeling filled my heart. I was missing something.

…The first scene was the same? No. It was a completely different
beginning.
I scrolled to the first page of the first chapter of Ways of Survival and
stared with a stunned expression.

"…It isn't the third regression."

The first revision of Three Ways to Survive in a Ruined World. I read the
first sentence of the novel again.

「 Thus, Yoo Joonghyuk's fourth life began. 」

The first revision started from Yoo Joonghyuk's fourth regression.

「 Yoo Joonghyuk had a thought. 」

「 In this round, that guy doesn't exist. 」
                 Chapter 222: Ep. 42 - Asmodeus, II


In this round, that guy doesn't exist…

As soon as I read this sentence, an electric current flowed from my head to
my toes.

…Perhaps, no, it couldn't be. Of course not. There were many people who
could be called 'that guy' by Yoo Joonghyuk. In the previous regressions,
there were a few 'guys' that Yoo Joonghyuk met…

Then I remembered Yoo Joonghyuk's thoughts that often appeared and my
mind became complicated.

「 Yoo Joonghyuk had a thought. 」

「 'Don't think it will improve by repeating the regressions'. 」

「'There is only my birthday in this life'. 」
「 'I don't know if I can do it. Still, I won't give up'. 」

Shit, by all appearances, these were my words. I quickly scrolled through
the pages towards other scenes. The words 'that guy' often appeared. He
never wrote the name 'Kim Dokja but it was clearly me.

Of course, I couldn't be sure 100% because I didn't remember everything I
said. Even so, I couldn't imagine anyone else saying these words to Yoo
Joonghyuk. If someone else had spoken such cheeky things, Yoo
Joonghyuk would've cut off their heads.

"…I'm having a psychotic break."

[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' is wondering about
your words.]

I ignored the message from the Great Sage, Heaven's Equal and slowly took
a deep breath. I needed to organize my thoughts. There was still time.
Unexpectedly, the Fourth Wall helped me.

「 Kim Dokja thought: In short, this is the current situation. 」

Yes, tell me.

「 One, the first revision of Ways of Survival had arrived. 」

「 Two, the revision started from Yoo Joonghyuk's fourth regression. 」

「 Three, a person presumed to be 'Kim Dokja' appeared in the
recollections of the fourth regression Yoo Joonghyuk. 」

It was a very straightforward organization. These three facts were proof of
only one thing.

「 Yoo Joonghyuk failed the third regression. 」
I couldn't think of anything else, no matter how I looked at it. If Yoo
Joonghyuk and I reached the end of this world, he wouldn't have moved
onto the fourth regression.

This was the most logical reasoning. The third round that I intervened in
was a failure. The time after the failure was newly recorded in the revision
of Ways of Survival.

I wondered how it was possible but this was a world where many
impossible things had already happened. I let out a brief sigh and searched
Ways of Survival again.

One question was resolved but many more opened. Through the Fourth
Wall, I tried to sort out the questions that came up one by one.

「 Why don't I exist in the fourth round of Yoo Joonghyuk? 」

No matter how I thought about it, I couldn't get an answer. It might be
because I wasn't a character or it might be due to other problems. In any
case, it was obvious that 'I' no longer existed from the fourth regression
onwards. There was a second problem I had to focus on.

「 If the first revision is a depiction of future events, could there be a
second revision depending on my actions? 」

Nothing was certain. Maybe this first revision couldn't be ruled out as a
'definite future'. Still, I was certain that it wasn't a high probability. If this
was a 'definite future', the author wouldn't have sent it to me.

I didn't know why but the author was giving me an opportunity through this
'revision'. If I kept going along this path, the third regression would end in
failure. Then in the fourth regression, Yoo Joonghyuk would repeat things
alone.
The author was sending a warning. Of course, the author might have a
terrible stench but… in any case, I decided not to consider it because there
was no answer.

"The first step is to read all of this again… my head will hurt."

I pressed a hand against my temple and kept reading Ways of Survival.
Some places were the same while some were changed. Anyway, I felt
numerous emotions as I read the story.

'That jerk Yoo Joonghyuk, he is still like this despite everything I told him."

I was thinking about it.

'Eh? Look at this. Hasn't it changed a bit?"

I thought about it. Also…

'Yes, this part was very interesting. I liked this part'.

'Fuck, there is too much explanation…'

'…No, the sentences seem a bit better? Did the author grow?'

Stuck in these thoughts, I returned to the reader's identity and fell into Ways
of Survival again. He was still a sunfish but the interesting thing was that
my intervention reduced Yoo Joonghyuk's minor mistakes. The most
notable part was that he caught the 'ichthyosaur' like me at the beginning of
the fourth round.

「 Yoo Joonghyuk thought, 'That guy got a hidden scenario here'. 」 He

also didn't die from the Theatre Dungeon in the 8th and 11th regressions.

「 "…I lived because of that guy. Well, I still would've somehow survived'.
」
I was almost moved to tears when I read this part. If I had a place to show
off then I would've boasted.

'Everyone, take a look. That damn sunfish has grown'.

Of course, I was the only reader of Ways of Survival so there was nowhere
to boast. My quick scrolling suddenly stopped as I thought of a question.
Wait a minute, this guy was doing better than I thought? Then what
happened next? Yoo Joonghyuk who was affected by me… would he reach
the 'proper' ending of this world?

"What are you doing? I heard from Aileen that you are dying."

"Kim… Joonghyuk-ssi. Is your body okay?"

The door opened and Jang Hayoung and Han Myungoh entered. I had
forgotten that I told Aileen to call the two of them.

"Eh, is that a smartphone?" Jang Hayoung saw the device I was holding and
ran over in a flash.

I lightly changed the hand holding the phone and answered, "No, go away."

"Can you receive messages? A call? The Internet?"

"Do you have a jaw?"

Jang Hayoung made a sullen expression at my cold reply. "Then why did
you call us here?"

"Are you still keeping in contact with the constellations I told you about?"

"Ahh, them?" Jang Hayoung shrugged and replied, "They aren't interested."

"Really?"
The future scenarios would be difficult to overcome with my strength
alone. Until now, the opponents were disasters that descended through the
scenarios or individual constellations. Those who would disturb me in the
future were bigger. For example, those damn Vedas guys who fucked me
over with 'fate'.

If I wanted to fight them, I needed to know the trends of the constellations
and transcendents with similar ideas.

"Everybody seems busy doing their own thing. Most of them didn't even
answer."

…It was still too early. It was much later in the story that Jang Hayoung
became the 'King of Transcendents'. Therefore, the constellations who were
by Jang Hayoung's side in the original novel might be different at this point
in time. Moreover, the 'original' had already changed.

I sighed and said, "It's fine. You can go out."

"…What? You were the one who called me." Jang Hayoung grumbled and
left the room, leaving only Han Myungoh behind.

Han Myungoh opened his mouth first. "You know, it is strange. I knew you
from the days in the company but…"

"That's enough. Do you know why I called you."

"Ahem." Han Myungoh seemed to know the reason. "…In fact, I can't
contact him."

"Isn't your connection to the household restored?"

"It recovered. However, there is no response from the demon king."

Not long ago, I broke Han Myungoh's connection to Demon King
Asmodeus using the Four Yin Demonic Beheading Sword. Still, it was only
a temporary thing. I thought it was time for contact with Asmodeus to be
re-established. Yet there wasn't any contact from him yet.

"Isn't there anything he wants to ask?"

"Perhaps he no longer believes me. Or…" At this moment, Han Myungoh's
expression changed. "I-I am connected!"

I was nervous for a moment. Demon King Asmodeus. A powerful presence
among the 72 demon kings would now speak to me through Han
Myungoh's eyes and mouth. By the way, Han Myungoh's expression was a
bit strange.

"Huh?"

"What is it?"

"Something is wrong."

"What happened?"

"H-He came directly!"

"Huh?"

"The demon king came directly!"

One side of my heart cooled. The demon king came directly. The meaning
of these words was simple. Demon King Asmodeus directly visited the
scenario area with his own body.

I asked while constantly receiving the channel messages from Biyoo. "Is he
near here?"

"I-I think he has already found you…"
Already found me? No matter how much I raised my senses, I couldn't feel
the demon king at all. If the demon king really came near here, not only
would the constellations of the channel be turned upside down, the
enormous pressure should've caused a group of incarnations to bleed to
death. By the
way…

"Wait, don't tell me…?"

If I thought about it, I did everything under the name of 'Yoo Joonghyuk'.
The beings who didn't enter the channel or know exactly what was going on
were likely to guess my position through the Star Stream. According to the
Star Stream, my current position was…

"Shit."

"W-Why all of a sudden?"

"Head Director Han, do you know the way to the Gilobat Industrial
Complex?"

Yoo Joonghyuk was in danger.




"Kim Dokja!"

"Hooray Kim Dokja!"

"The independence of the industrial complex!"

Yoo Joonghyuk listened to the shouts coming from all over the Gilobat
Industrial Complex and had a complicated expression.

'I didn't mean to do this'.
Yoo Joonghyuk frowned as he stared at Duke Gilobat who died in his
hands. Sparks were flying around Yoo Joonghyuk's body due to the
excessive opening of his transcendent power. He didn't need to open it at
this point.

'It was too early to open the first stage of transcendence'.

However, it was impossible to handle his work in the Demon Realm in a
short amount of time without opening the power. It was a power that was
deliberately hidden from the constellations but he was caught by one of
them. Yoo Joonghyuk watched the Uriel doll sitting on his shoulder.

'I don't think this person has any ideas'.

[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' is satisfied with your
achievement.]

[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' is touched by your
companionship.]

"…The duke gives a lot of coins. Thus I killed him."

[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' is laughing.]

Yoo Joonghyuk didn't answer and looked at the panel screen in the duke's
office. There were low-quality scenes that seemed to be taped by the wenny
people.

–Yoo Joonghyuk!

–I am Yoo Joonghyuk!"

It was an absurd scene. Hundreds of people shouted that they were 'Yoo
Joonghyuk'. The most disturbing thing was the huge guy yelling it in the
center.

–Yoo Joonghyuk! Yoo Joonghyuk! Wah!
Yoo Joonghyuk watched the scene with a frown before turning his head.

[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' is turning red.]

[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' is urging you to go and meet
Kim Dokja.]

Yoo Joonghyuk shook his head. "…I've confirmed that he is alive. Cancel
your personal scenario and send me back to the original world.

[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' is surprised.]

[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' says the personal scenario
hasn't ended yet.]

[The contents of the personal scenario of the constellation 'Demon-like
Judge of Fire' is to meet Kim Dokja…]

"Do you really think I will accept that personal scenario?"

[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' is greatly shocked.]

The shoulders of the Uriel doll trembled and she had an expression that she
wouldn't make even if Eden was destroyed. Yoo Joonghyuk watched for a
while before sighing.

"Is this okay?"

[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' is raising her head with a
sullen expression.]

"I have become a duke of the Demon Realm with this. But you are an
archangel. I'm asking if there is a problem with this."

[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' is greatly embarrassed.]

[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' says she hasn't thought about
it.]

"…Shit." Yoo Joonghyuk spoke all types of curses as he wondered how he
could act in the future with the archangel.

[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' is warning you!]

A tremendous darkness started gathering around him. Yoo Joonghyuk
instinctively drew the Splitting the Sky Sword at the formidable aura.
However, the opponent was someone he couldn't win against just be
drawing a sword.

A dark abyss gathered into an essence. The deepest darkness of the Demon
Realm was manifested before his eyes. Yoo Joonghyuk knew this darkness
very well.

"Run away. I can't protect your symbolic body."

[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' says it isn't possible.]

[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire'…]

Yoo Joonghyuk's shoulders were shaking slightly. The Uriel doll had never
seen such a sigh before and grabbed Yoo Joonghyuk's shoulder with a
panicked expression. It wasn't easy to calm down the trembling. As if he
didn't want to acknowledge the fear, Yoo Joonghyuk opened his mouth
with a nasty expression.

"…I was once killed by this guy."

The next moment, the body of darkness revealed itself with a
tremendous aura that burst the bodies of the incarnations in the area.
[You are in a place like this, Demon King of Salvation.]
                 Chapter 223: Ep. 42 - Asmodeus, III


I told her to take me to the Gilobat Industrial Complex and Aileen replied,

"No matter how fast you are, it will take at least two days to reach the
Gilobat Industrial Complex. Perhaps if there is help from a transcendental
existence…"

"The delegation must be a transportation vehicle. Is it unreasonable?"

"I said two days assuming that you use it."

Two days… even two hours was too long for me. No matter how I got
there, I had to arrive within an hour or I would find Yoo Joonghyuk's torn
body. I was thinking hard, "The help of a transcendent presence…"

The first one to come to mind was 'Hermes'. If I had this constellation's
help, I could cover a distance that took two days within a few minutes. The
problem was that he belonged to Olympus.
"…Going to hell is going to hell. I can't borrow his hands."

"Huh?"

I waved my hand at the startled Aileen. "I'm just talking to myself."

Of course, I was purposely talking to myself. The reason—

[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' is wondering what is
going on.]

[The constellation who likes to change sex is wondering what happened.]

[Some constellations are curious about the information you have hidden.]

It was in order to induce this response. I deliberately ignored their messages
and spoke towards Aileen. "Is there another way? A warp portal or
something like that…"

"This is the 73rd Demon Realm. It is also the outskirts of the 73rd Demon
Realm. We don't have such advanced transportation devices."

"…I see."

"What the hell is going on?"

"Someone is about to die."

"Who?"

"It is the master of this industrial complex."

As expected, my message log exploded.

[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' is asking what you
mean.]
[The constellation who likes to change sex is listening to your story.]

…The explosion was still small but it couldn't be helped since there weren't
many constellations in the channel. By the way, when did the person who
liked to change sex come here?

"Prisoner of the Golden Headband. Can you help me?"

I spoke directly to the constellation and the people in the treatment
room were astonished. I decided to be more brazen.

"If you don't mind, I'd like to borrow your Nimbus Cloud."

It was one of the Great Sage, Heaven's Equal's star relics, the Nimbus
Cloud. If I could borrow it, I could reach the Gilobat Industrial Complex in
the shortest time. The problem was whether the tricky the Great Sage,
Heaven's Equal would lend me his star relic. He had already wasted
probability once because of me…

[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' is asking why you
need the 'Nimbus Cloud'.]

I struggled for a moment before opening my mouth. I had to speak well
here. "I pretended to be Yoo Joonghyuk. Then Yoo Joonghyuk
impersonated me… it caused a scenario error and there is a problem…"

[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' is annoyed.]

[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' hates complicated
things.]

I decided to summarize the situation according to the Great Sage, Heaven's
Equal's patience. "Due to this, Yoo Joonghyuk is going to die."

I wanted to know if he would help but the response from the Great Sage,
Heaven's Equal was unexpected.
[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' is pulling out a
handful of his hair from the stress.]

"Wait a minute."

[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' is leaving to find a
hair comb.]

"Excuse me?"

There was no response from the Great Sage, Heaven's Equal who
disappeared.

[A constellations who likes to change sex is enjoying the situation.]

[100 coins have been sponsored.]

I was looking up at the air when Aileen asked me, "I don't know who he is
but the new owner of this industrial complex is in a crisis?"

"…That's right."

"Why?"

"He is going to meet a demon king."

"A demon king isn't necessarily an evil existence. If you are lucky, you can
survive."

"I guess but…"

The problem was the demon king was 'Asmodeus'. In the novel, Asmodeus
was one of the greatest adversaries whenever Yoo Joonghyuk regressed.
Yoo Joonghyuk had already died against Asmodeus in the past. Could Yoo
Joonghyuk be safe from him? No good images popped up no matter how
hard I thought.
Han Myungoh looked at me nervously and opened his mouth. "Now what
are you going to do?"

It was a big problem. Even if I managed to get there in time, there was no
guarantee I could overcome Asmodeus by joining forces with Yoo
Joonghyuk. However—

"I won't know without trying."

"Huh, I didn't know you were so passionate. In the company, you never…"

"If I don't work hard, I will die. It is different from not becoming a full-time
employee if I didn't work hard."

"…Ahem."

The situation was bad but I decided to think as positively as possible. There
was something I didn't know. Perhaps things would turn out well even if I
didn't go there. A miracle could happen that caused Yoo Joonghyuk to
experience a great awakening or Asmodeus might suddenly become a good
guy.

…Damn, that was impossible. I opened the revised Ways of Survival on my
smartphone again. I couldn't come up with something so I had to read this
to find the answer.

"What's happening?"

"Shhh, be quiet. This is what I do best."

I quickly scrolled through the contents of Ways of Survival. Then one
sentence in the 12th regression caught my eyes.

「 Yoo Joonghyuk thought there were many reasons for his failure in the
third round. This was the most important reason.」
My heart suddenly sank. No, hurry up and think about it. The moment I
read the next sentence, my mind became blank and I almost went crazy.

「 'At that time, we shouldn't have pretended to support the Demon King
Asmodeus'.」




There was a little girl with dark eyes. She had a small body and appeared to
be around eight or nine years old. The chubby cheeks and vivid expressions
were reminiscent of a child actor. There wasn't any apparent threat on the
surface.

'…His taste is the same'.

However, Yoo Joonghyuk knew very well that the gigantic presence in that
body wasn't the main character of a children's drama. This girl was the peak
of the 72 existences scattered across the Demon Realm and the owner of the
'32nd Demon Realm', someone even narrative-grade constellations were
reluctant to face. Devil of Lust and Wrath, Asmodeus.

Asmodeus smiled with the girl's face.

[Oh, there is no need to be so tense. I just came to talk.]

The utterance of his true voice brought pain to the incarnations in the area.
All incarnations in the industrial complex were probably bleeding. In front
of this fearsome pressure, Yoo Joonghyuk held his breath and raised all his
magic power.

The feeling of pressure wrapped around his skin gradually decreased. This
presence was so strong that even the transcendent Yoo Joonghyuk found it
hard to bear. As expected, the status of a demon king itself was different.
Whether or not he knew Yoo Joonghyuk's heart, Asmodeus approached Yin
with gentle footsteps.

[Interesting. The last time we met was when I saw you through my
subordinate's eyes at the Syswitz Industrial Complex…]

The steps were obviously light but in Yoo Joonghyuk's eyes, they were the
heaviest things in the world. The grip on the Splitting the Sky Sword
become stronger and the veins of his neck bulged.

[You moved to Gilobat and defeated the duke in such a short time… your
skills are great, Demon King of Salvation.]

Demon King of Salvation… It was obvious who this was referring to.

'Damn Kim Dokja'.

Everything happened in the wrong place. In a short time, Yoo Joonghyuk
had dozens of thoughts.

'This guy is in an incomplete incarnation body. Can I win?'

'No, it is impossible'.

'It might be an incarnation body but this is the Demon Realm'.

'Then can I run away?'

'It is too unreasonable'.

'There is no way to get rid of the demon king, who has the mind and heart
of an incarnation'.

Originally, the demon kings couldn't exist in this scenario. Based on the
visible sparks, a huge amount of probability was being consumed in real
time. Yoo Joonghyuk couldn't escape from somehow who showed up with
this determination.
'There is only one way that will possibly work'.

'Buy time to waste his probability'.

He might be a demon king but he couldn't take over the body of an
incarnation in the scenario for long. He would be forced to return as long as
Yoo Joonghyuk could buy some time. The problem was that it shouldn't be
a 'fight'. In the end, Yoo Joonghyuk had to bend his pride a bit.

"Yes, I am the Demon King of Salvation. Who are you?"

[…It is a bit strange? Were you originally this handsome? The face I saw
last time…]

"You came here because you have something to say. Then tell me."

[Huhu, yes. But before we talk, there is something that is bothering me.]

"What?"

Asmodeus's small fingers snapped. Formidable sparks appeared and a little
doll with half of one arm torn appeared in the air.

[As expected.]

Yoo Joonghyuk bit his lips. He was dealing with a demon king. It was a
mistake to think that the Recluse's Cloak wouldn't be noticed.

[Why is the symbolic body of an archangel here?]

"I don't know."

[Is that so? Is this true?]

Intense sparks flashed and Uriel made a pained expression.

[I can tell who you are based on this symbolic body.]
[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' is looking at Asmodeus.]

[Archangel Uriel. Is your brother Raphael well? I want you to tell him that I
haven't forgotten the debt.]

[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' is roaring with anger!]

[Of course, you can only tell him if you return safely.]

Yoo Joonghyuk's expression darkened. This was the Demon Realm. No
matter how strong Uriel was, she couldn't expose the demon king's
incarnation body with a symbolic body. Yoo Joonghyuk didn't hesitate to
raise his energy.

"Stop."

It would be difficult if he lost Uriel's symbolic body here. He would
become lost from the scenario if he lost Uriel here. Asmodeus looked
impressed by the pressure of the boiling magic power coming from Yoo
Joonghyuk.

[Hrmm? This energy… it is tough. But…]

The next moment, Asmodeus was in front of Yoo Joonghyuk.

[A mere mortal is imitating a star.]

The small arm stretched out and grabbed Yoo Joonghyuk's jaw.

"Kuek…!"

[Indeed, you aren't the Demon King of Salvation. Isn't that right?]

Yoo Joonghyuk hurriedly swung the Splitting the Sky Sword. Surprisingly,
it was easily caught by Asmodeus' hand.
[If I'd known you could make such a pretty face, I wouldn't have let you go
in the beginning.]

Then the Splitting the Sky Sword was broken in half.

[You are afraid of me. Cute child.]

"Kuoock…"

[If you resist so much, I will lose the desire to talk to you.]

Dark shadows flocked behind Asmodeus. The darkness gathered in the air
and formed a monster with huge horns.

[I want to trample on you.]

Blood started to flow from Yoo Joonghyuk's nose. The mighty story was
weighing down on his transcendence. In front of the vast presence, Yoo
Joonghyuk quietly prepared to open 'transcendence stage 1'.

There were no odds but Yoo Joonghyuk didn't give up. If he could just
create a gap for one moment, he might have enough time to return to the
Earth scenario. As Yoo Joonghyuk was thinking this, he allowed one attack
and felt the shock of his entire body being broken.

His left arm and right leg were broken and even the magic power in his
stomach was lost. By the time he came to his senses, he was crumpled on
the ground. Asmodeus raised this Yoo Joonghyuk and touched Yoo
Joonghyuk's forehead softly.

[I can't believe it. A mere human has such sublime despair.]

"Dog… bas…tard."

[Persephone said that 'Kim Dokja' must be the best story. Huhu.]
Asmodeus licked his lips. Yoo Joonghyuk stared at Asmodeus before
closing his eyes.

'I'm sorry Kim Dokja'.

There was no other way. He was forced to look towards the next
regression. He closed his eyes and Yoo Joonghyuk's clock prepared to go
back. The second hand, the minute hand, the hour hand. The moment that
the giant hands were going to move in the opposite direction— 「 That's
why you should've thought about me earlier. 」 All of a sudden, Yoo
Joonghyuk's clock stopped.




[The exclusive skill, 'Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint' stage 3 has been
activated!]

Huge sparks appeared around Yoo Joonghyuk and the startled Asmodeus
moved back. Something blinked inside Yoo Joonghyuk's eyes while
something else woke up. Of course, it was me.

[You…]

[The constellation 'Demon King of Salvation' is looking at the 'Devil of
Lust and Wrath'.]

I stared at Asmodeus with bright eyes. Then I said, [Don't touch my
incarnation, Asmodeus.]
                 Chapter 224: Ep. 42 - Asmodeus, IV


"What the hell is this guy thinking…?"

Aileen pulled out the catheter and muttered as he watched Kim Dokja lying
down. Fragments of the story were trickling from the bandages.

–For now, this is the only way. I hadn't wanted to use it.

Aileen hurriedly raised her courage, swept up the fragments and took the
pulse of the other arm. Kim Dokja's face was pale and no warmth could be
felt.

"Bring more story packs! Quickly!"

The people watching ran out of the treatment room at Aileen's cry. Aileen
watched the face of the dying Kim Dokja and recalled his last words.

–Just let me die for an hour or so.
–Ah, of course, it isn't really dying. It is just on the verge of dying.

–I really will go to see Kim Namwoon if I die at this time.

–I will trust you. Understood?

Beep― beep―

The story stability levels on the patient stability monitor were dropping
sharply. Aileen watched Kim Dokja sleeping with an unknown expression
and inserted a new story into his veins.




Fortunately, the third stage of Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint was
connected properly. Aileen had done her work properly. By the way…

Asmodeus' energy was blazing in front of me. I was in a state of tension,
unlike my previous declaration. The opponent was 'Asmodeus'. I felt a bit
of regret for using words that were too impressive at the beginning but now
it was too late for regret. Asmodeus finally opened his mouth.

[Demon King of Salvation?]

I nodded with Yoo Joonghyuk's head. I felt Yoo Joonghyuk's soul
struggling in one corner of the ego but I forced him to fall asleep. Yoo
Joonghyuk couldn't pop out at this time.

[I am the Demon King of Salvation.]

The use of my true voice consumed an excessive amount of probability but
I pretended to be calm. I deliberately used my true voice in order to not be
pushed back by his momentum. The bonus was that maintaining my true
voice made me look strong. Asmodeus glanced at me with surprise and
asked again.

[…He is really your incarnation?]

[That's right.]

The unconscious Yoo Joonghyuk would be furious if he knew this but I
didn't think and said it anyway. There was no better answer in the current
situation. At least, that's what I thought.

[I didn't hear that you have such an incarnation.]

[Your information network seems to be slower than I thought. This person
is my incarnation.]

Asmodeus had definitely come here to 'talk' with me. The credibility of his
words couldn't be determined but this was the only way for Yoo Joonghyuk
to survive. If he really came to 'talk', he wouldn't do anything unnecessary
like touching my incarnation.

[Hrmm…]

Asmodeus didn't seem to accept my words as his energy gradually became
strong. I desperately recalled the information about Asmodeus that I knew.

「 An indulgent madman. 」

「 A member of the gourmet association. 」

「 He has a slight acquaintance with the Underworld of Olympus. 」

「 The owner of crooked libido. 」

There were a few things that could be of some help but there was nothing I
could use right now. Either way, it would be best to solve this confrontation
as smoothly as possible. I raised my senses as much as possible and
searched the vicinity for anything that could help me. The only thing that
stood out was the small stuffed doll attached to my shoulders.

…What is this? That jerk Yoo Joonghyuk actually collected such things?
Then the doll suddenly looked at me.

[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' is so moved she has a
nosebleed.]

…Wait. Surely this doll…

[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' is rubbing her cheek against
you.]

The doll softly touched Yoo Joonghyuk's cheek and I felt it through Yoo
Joonghyuk's body. I was panicked. Why was Uriel here?

Asmodeus opened his mouth. [I guess the rumours are true if you're not
shrinking back before my 'status'. You became narrative-grade in the tenth
scenario… I can't believe it is true.]

[I don't know. It might be more than rumours.]

I pulled the Uriel doll and quickly hid her in my arms. The atmosphere was
strange but it would be difficult if Uriel did something. Asmodeus licked
his lips.

[Huhu, the story about your tongue seems true. It is to my taste. By the
way… how are you alive? I heard from the constellations that you died.]

[I have good luck.]

[…You also like having secrets.]

[I hate people who keep trying to pry secrets from me.]

[Is this person your new incarnation? I heard that children are your taste.]
[What bullshit is that?]

[Then my hard work preparing this wasn't worthwhile.]

Asmodeus smiled at me in a charming manner while looking down at his
child's incarnation body. He had the appearance of a pretty child. If Han
Myungoh was right, this child must be Han Myungoh's daughter.
Fortunately, she didn't resemble Han Myungoh at all.

[There seems to be some misunderstanding… many false rumours have
spread.]

The rumours spread about me taking Shin Yoosung as my incarnation. He
understood what I was saying and Asmodeus smiled at Yoo Joonghyuk's
face.

[Indeed, I can bend my taste if it is this beautiful body.]

At this point, it was clear that a normal conversation was impossible. I
spoke roughly. "Stop talking with your true voice. There won't be any
incarnations left around me."

[Why?]

"This is now my industrial complex. I want you to stop killing my citizens."

Officially, Gilobat died because of 'Kim Dokja' and this became my
industrial complex.

[You are the new owner of the industrial complex.]

In fact, these messages were actually rising. Of course, I actually needed a
good excuse to stop using my true voice. Asmodeus spoke with a small
smile, "Hrmm, yes. I'm sorry."

Asmodeus did it half-heartedly but he was polite when he had a purpose. At
least, until his purpose was met.
"Then why did you come for me?"

"It sounds like you already know. Right?"

"…How should I know? I'm not a prophet."

"I know you have a similar power to the prophet of Asgard."

He was probably talking about Anna Croft. I didn't know how much of my
story had spread and twisted. Whatever the rumours, it was clear that now
was the time to lay the foundation on this side.

"Maybe it is because of the 'Demon King Selection'."

Asmodeus grinned at the answer. It wasn't hard to guess. It was because
shortly after the industrial complex had fallen, the following message was
heard.

[You are currently a 'Demon King Candidate' of the 73rd Demon Realm.]

[A new scenario is currently pending.]

"Are you aiming for a new throne?"

"Huh? I already have the 32nd Demon Realm. It is pointless to gain one
with a lower rank."

"Then what?"

"I want to help you become a new demon king."

As expected, he said it. Han Myungoh had told me something similar.

–The demon king… he told me to make the '73rd Demon King' with my
own hands.
I thought for a moment before shaking my head. "I'm sorry but I don't need
help. I currently have no desire to participate in the competition."

"I don't think you have the veto rights? You have to participate in the
selection as soon as you become a duke."

"I can survive with my own strength."

"Well, you might've been lucky until now. Will it continue in the future?"

"…"

"Do you think Duke Melledon and Bercan have the same thoughts as you?"
It was known that nebulae were already attached to them. They were also
nebulae hostile towards me. Asmodeus laughed. "You need my help. You
will die if you refuse.

It was unknown who would kill me but he seemed certain I would die.
Fucking bastard. Did he come all this way only to grab my ankle?

[A small number of constellations are watching your choice.]

[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' is watching your
choice.]

[The constellation who likes to change sex is watching your choice.]

I moved to this location and asked Biyoo to expand the channel. Thus, the
constellations were watching my choice. Most constellations felt reluctant
towards demon kings. My future story would be determined depending on
the choice I made here.

I took a calm breath and asked, "Is your purpose the giant story?"

Something stirred in Asmodeus' eyes at my words.

"…I'm surprised that you already know about such a thing."
"It is the only reason why guys like you would cut off their nose in the
blink of an eye."

I smiled bitterly.

A giant story. If the stories I had accumulated so far were in the category of
general stories, there was a new field in the Star Stream called giant stories.
For example, things like Olympus' Gigantomachia and Asgard's Ragnarok.

By building a small stake in a giant story, the constellations could gain
enormous power and probability. If they occupied a large stake then they
would become a huge power. This was why the constellations rushed with
fiery eyes every time the apocalypse scenario occurred.

The Demon Realm's 'Demon King Selection' was one such giant story. It
wasn't comparable to Gigantomachia but it was large compared to general
stories.

Asmodeus nodded. "You are correct. I need the shares of a giant story."

Asmodeus was already a demon king and belonged to a higher level
scenario, so he couldn't participate in the selection. However, he could help
me in exchange for a 'stake' in the story.

Originally I would've refused the proposal. The giant story that could be
accumulated through the Demon King Selection would become the key
foundation for my future fight against the nebulae. If I gave a share in it to
the wrong person, it was likely I wouldn't be able to obtain anything.

However, Yoo Joonghyuk of the 12th regression had mumbled.

「 'At that time, we shouldn't have pretended to support the Demon King
Asmodeus'.」

I wanted to grab the collar of the 12th regression Yoo Joonghyuk and ask
what he meant, but the person now was only in the third regression.
In the end, I had to make a choice. Should I grab the hand of the demon
king or not?

I slowly opened my mouth.
                 Chapter 225: Ep. 42 - Asmodeus, V


"How funny. I'm not even a 'demon king' yet. How can I give away the
stakes in a giant story I don't have?"

"You can do it if I help." Asmodeus had an arrogant confidence on his face.
It was an expression that made becoming a 'demon king' simple. I watched
his face and followed up with,

"…Okay, I will give away a stake if I become a demon king."

At this moment, the stars in the sky were flashing.

[A few constellations are greatly disappointed in your judgment.]

[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' is looking at you with
troubled eyes.]

[The constellation who likes to change sex wants to change your sex.]
The constellations showed a strong reaction as I expected. However, I
couldn't help it for now. Unless I knew how to not lost against Asmodeus, I
couldn't do anything that would antagonize him.

Asmodeus laughed like he was satisfied with my answer. "Good thinking.
How much will you give away?"

"30%."

Light disappointment flashed across Asmodeus' face. "It is too little."

"Don't you think you're being too greedy?"

"50% and write the contract here."

What a shameless swindler. If I gave away half of a giant story, I wouldn't
be able to draw on its strength without Asmodeus' permission. I firmly
shook my head. "I can't sign that agreement."

"Why?"

The pebbles started to float into the air. This was blatant intimidation but I
wouldn't have come here if I would be caught by such intimidation. I stared
up at the sky and kept speaking, "I won't give a stake to just you."

A deep silence instantly fell at my words. Asmodeus' face was blank and he
didn't understand what I meant. The stars all around me were holding their
breaths and demanding clarification.

"30% of the giant story will be released as competitive shares."

"…Competitive shares?"

"It means whoever helps me can gain part of those shares. The extent
that they obtained will depend entirely on their contribution to the
story." The gazes staring at me from the sky started to change on by
one.

[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' is making a interested
expression.]

[A few constellations are greedy after hearing your words!]

'Competitive shares' was the last card I could offer. If I had to take a beast
with me while moving forward, it would be better to expand the choice of
beasts. Asmodeus noticed my intentions and his expression hardened. "…I
was deceived."

"I didn't lie."

The pebbles floating in the air rushed towards me, to be precise, towards
Yoo Joonghyuk. It was a strong attack that couldn't be easily blocked. It
might've been hard for me in the past but not now.

It was because now I wasn't alone. The stones flying through the air were
caught by invisible hands.

[A few constellations are staring at the Devil of Lust and Wrath.]

It was a situation where I declared a competitive share in a giant story. The
constellations aiming for those shares wouldn't just watch Asmodeus'
actions. Asmodeus gritted his teeth. However, even Asmodeus didn't want
to waste probability in this place against a large number of constellations.
In addition, there was a formidable constellation present.

[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' is staring at the Devil
of Lust and Wrath.]

Asmodeus stared at the air for a while before taking back his strength. The
stones lost their support and instantly fell to the ground.
[The demon king 'Devil of Lust and Wrath' is disappointed in you.]

Asmodeus spoke with a terrifying expression, "You have made a mistake.
You are not the one who will become demon king. You just threw away an
important opportunity."

It was a tone that suggested he could give the opportunity to someone else
at any time. Certainly, things would become complicated if Asmodeus
joined hands with someone else. Nevertheless, I didn't back down. "Well, I
think you are the one throwing away the opportunity, not me."

I thought about why Asmodeus must've chosen me. Common sense said it
was more advantageous for Asmodeus to be attacked to Bercan or
Melledon rather than me. I was a human and a constellation while Melledon
and Bercan were demons.

Yet Asmodeus extended his hand towards me first. There was a compelling
reason for Asmodeus to choose me. In fact, Asmodeus' expression seemed a
bit strained at my refusal. "…It is really unpleasant. Don't you know that I
am a demon king?"

A great demon was making this type of expression. It was an extremely rare
scene from the perspective of Ways of Survival. I slowly shook my head.
"It doesn't matter if you are a demon king or constellation. I just want my
story to be the best story."

"The best story?"

"You should know what I mean since you belong to the Gourmet
Association."

Asmodeus' expression changed at the words I deliberately mentioned. It
was a face that was both bewildered and delighted. Asmodeus gazed at me
with an expression that was hard for humans to describe and opened his
mouth a few dozen seconds later.
[…A candidate will test the cooking skills of a demon king…?]

I held my breath at the formidable killing intent aimed at me. It was like the
whole time and space of the area was in the demon king's grasp. The
confused constellations squeezed out light but the darkness around them
was so dense that their power couldn't reach.

This was the real power of a demon king. If Asmodeus truly used all his
power here, I was convinced that Yoo Joonghyuk and I would've vanished
regardless of the Prisoner of the Golden Headband's presence. He was
revealing this power now as a type of proof and warning.

[The Demon King 'Asmodeus' reveals a subtle liking towards you.]

It was a warning that he could kill me at any time. Asmodeus laughed from
inside the darkness.

[I like it. I will leave for today.]

Fortunately, the situation seemed to be wrapped up. I didn't pretend to
support Asmodeus and he didn't one-sidedly lose his shares of the story.
There was plenty of room to change things…

[However, I should clean up the garbage before I go.]

Asmodeus moved his fingers and an explosive sound was heard from my
chest. It was the sound of a doll popping. There was a throbbing pain
around my heart but Yoo Joonghyuk's body didn't receive any apparent
damage. Asmodeus' body scattered into ashes as he left these last words.

[I can't see that thing wandering around in front of me.]

I gazed at the disappearing Asmodeus before hurriedly touching my chest.
"…Uriel?"
I pulled out that Uriel doll that was already tattered. Not long afterwards, I
felt something being disconnected from the doll. I saw the messages rising
in front of Yoo Joonghyuk's eyes.

[The connection with the constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' has been
temporarily disconnected.]

[The personal scenario has been automatically terminated.]

I was able to see how Yoo Joonghyuk came here. I didn't know why but
Uriel gave him a personal scenario to go to the Demon Realm. Yoo
Joonghyuk received that scenario and came here. The problem was the
scenario had just been forcibly terminated.

Sparks started appearing around my skin. I instantly realized what would
happen.

"Uriel! Wake up!" I desperately shook the doll but there was no reaction
from Uriel. The symbolic body was excessively broken and the connection
with the body was forcibly terminated.

"Shit."

Cracks were spreading over Yoo Joonghyuk's hard body.

[You have left the main scenario.]

I hurriedly looked around. This couldn't continue. At this rate, Yoo
Joonghyuk would surely die.

[The exile penalty has begun.]

It was different from me. Yoo Joonghyuk didn't have the Fourth Wall.
There wasn't anyone to protect him after becoming an exile.

"Hey! Anybody is good!"
I hurriedly shouted towards the sky. However, Yoo Joonghyuk's body was
destroyed and my voice didn't emerge. The cracks that started in the legs
spread to the neck and paralyzed the vocal cords.

It was a penalty that prevented me from asking the constellations in the
night sky for help. The whole universe was intensely hoping for Yoo
Joonghyuk's death, as if it was going to take away his stories and kill him.

…Was it up to here? I couldn't let it. Everything was over if Yoo
Joonghyuk died here.

In less than one second, the pages of Ways of Survival passed through my
head. The letters on countless pages flew towards me and I reached out to
them. Yes, this was the only way. I didn't have it but Yoo Joonghyuk was
different. I was forced to ask him for help.

[The constellation 'Demon King of Salvation' is looking at Yoo
Joonghyuk's sponsor.]

I wanted to use my true voice but now I had no strength. I was forced to
hope that my story would reach that existence.

[The sponsor of incarnation 'Yoo Joonghyuk' is looking at you.]

A huge presence was looking at me. It was somewhat familiar but also
unfamiliar. Before I could open my mouth, a darkness came over me.

[The exclusive skill, 'Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint' stage 3 has been
forcibly released.]




A space covered with darkness. I had this experience once before. When
was it? It happened when I exited from the constellation banquet.
[ ■■… ]

[ How to change… ]

[ …No. ]

Dammit, what the hell did this mean―




"Heok!" I shot up and gasp like I was going to vomit. My heart was beating
like crazy and there was a cracking sound from my neck. My eyes were full
of tears.

I was alive. To be precise, Aileen saved me. However, I felt more desperate
than relieved. I shouted in a thick voice towards the outside of the treatment
room.

"Aileen!"

Aileen, who had been waiting outside, rushed over at my call. She was pale
when she saw me pulling out the catheter. I shook off her hands and
shouted, "Quickly get me up. I have to go to the Gilobat Industrial
Complex."

"What are you talking about? A person who just woke up―"

"There is no time, quickly!"

Dozens of thoughts crossed my head. Let's ask the Great Sage, Heaven's
Equal for help. If not, let's call Hermes. I hated it but I might be able to get
a favour using the shares of the story. I just had to get to Gilobat right
away. It wasn't too late yet. Go right now―
"There is no way for a person who has been unconscious for one week!
You will have to rest for at least one week to stabilize your body!"

"…What?"

It felt like my heart stopped beating. I thought it was an auditory
hallucination. The world that I read was collapsing. The letters that lost
their place were pushing at me.

"…How much time has passed?"

"A week. You have been unconscious for a week."

I looked blankly at the floor before picking up the smartphone that Irene
created. I turned on the panel and checked the file.

–Three Ways to Survive in a Ruined World (1st Revision).txt

The title of the text was unchanged. The second revision didn't come and
Yoo Joonghyuk's lines were the same.

There was a moment of despair as I realized that nothing had changed.
Really? Yoo Joonghyuk really died?
                 Chapter 226: Ep. 42 - Asmodeus, VI


My hands were trembling but I took a deep breath and regained my
composure. No. Yoo Joonghyuk couldn't be dead. Above all, the message
that caught my attention was evidence.

[You are currently waiting for the next main scenario.]

Based on common sense, Yoo Joonghyuk shouldn't be given the exile
penalty. It was because Yoo Joonghyuk would've entered a new scenario
like me.

There might be variations for individual scenarios but he became a duke as
soon as I became a duke. It meant that like me, Yoo Joonghyuk was a
'demon king candidate'.

[There is currently a delay in the compensation due to an error in the Star
Stream system.]
However, there was this one message. It was very rare to acquire a story or
achievement through 'impersonation' in the Star Stream. This time, Yoo
Joonghyuk and I impersonated each other and made achievements in each
other's name.

What if the main scenario of the Star Stream was twisted because of this? I
entered the main scenario safely but what if Yoo Joonghyuk didn't enter?
Was that why the exile penalty began?

"Are you okay?"

"…Do you have a glass of water?"

Aileen stared at me with disbelieving eyes for a moment. "Don't pull out the
catheter again while I'm gone."

Aileen left the room and I calmly reexamined the situation. I had to be
composed. It wasn't clear whether Yoo Joonghyuk had died or not. It was
likely that he had been killed by the start of the exile penalty just prior to
the release of Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint, but absolute certainty was a
taboo in the Star Stream. I needed to first confirm Yoo Joonghyuk's life or
death properly.

"Biyoo."

Biyoo had expanded the channel to the Gilobat side. If Biyoo helped, I
might be able to see the area using the eyes of a constellation.

"Biyoo. Do you hear me?"

Did something happen? There was no response from Biyoo. I couldn't even
hear the messages from other constellations. I felt uneasy for a moment.
What happened to Biyoo while I was away?

…Huh? I listened quietly and could hear Biyoo breathing near me. Biyoo's
transparent body was lying on my chest, fast asleep.
I sighed with relief. I would've been devastated if something happened to
Biyoo.

"…I'm sorry." I stroked Biyoo's head. According to Ways of Survival, a
dokkaebi must sleep for at least half a day when it was just born. I was
sleeping so it wasn't strange for Biyoo to have fallen asleep.

It was a situation where Biyoo had exhausted her strength due to
overworking.

I decided to use the second method.

[The exclusive skill, 'Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint' has been activated!]

Then my temples started throbbing.

[The skill is cancelled due to accumulated damage.]

…Damn, this didn't work either. It seemed that I suffered a huge blow when
my link with Yoo Joonghyuk was severed.

In the end, I picked up the smartphone again. It was the first time I felt so
helpless. I didn't know if Yoo Joonghyuk was dead or not and the only
thing I could do was read the novel.

No, don't think like this. Kim Dokja, please wake up. You've survived so
far thanks to this novel.

I bit my lips and opened Ways of Survival again. Everything came from
this story. Thus, the answer would be in the story.

[The attribute effect has increased 'speed reading'!]

I read the book with wide eyes, not missing a single word or sentence.

「 'At that time, we shouldn't have pretended to support the Demon King
Asmodeus'.」
It was hard to see it as Yoo Joonghyuk and I pretending to support
Asmodeus this time. I might've deceived him but in the end, there was a
nuance that he would still cooperate with us. I couldn't be sure that Yoo
Joonghyuk was dead with this sentence alone.

The 13th round.

The 134h round.

…

Yoo Joonghyuk's regressions continued. It took longer than before but his
spirit was gradually worn down by the continuous regressions.

「 'It is hard'. 」

The 18th round.

「 'I want to quit now'.」

The 21st round.

「 'Dammit, dammit, dammit!' 」

…

I read about Yoo Joonghyuk's despair and also felt my heart burning. As
time went by, Yoo Joonghyuk returned to his original pessimistic form. A
regressor who survived every regression using the principles of only
thinking about himself.

「 'I can't change anything'. 」

He went back, went back and went back again. In the second half of the
novel, there was no big difference with the Ways of Survival that I read
before. Apart from the first half that I influenced, Yoo Joonghyuk made
similar mistakes and regained similar tendencies.

「 'Damn, a few more times…' 」

I spent several months with Yoo Joonghyuk but I was only able to have this
much influence on the novel. I wanted to reach out to the frustrated Yoo
Joonghyuk but Yoo Joonghyuk was in a place I couldn't reach. The 25th,
26th, 27th rounds… Yoo Joonghyuk constantly repeated the regressions
and I had to stop reading.

It was painful to read. The original Ways of Survival was a story like this.
How did I read all 3,149 chapters?

Due to my irregular breathing, Biyoo attached to my chest was moving
uncomfortably.

I remembered the page number before scrolling down to the bottom. It
might be burdensome to follow this story right now but there was
something I had to check first.

Did Yoo Joonghyuk reach the proper ending in the first revision? Did the
author write the epilogue?

The screen hitched badly while I was scrolling due to the poor performance
of the smartphone. How long did I scroll down? I finally reached the spot
where the original ending should be. However, I only found a huge void.
「 Current being edited. ㅠㅠ 」

There was a one line message. I was swept away by two different emotions.

"…Haha."

The emoticon that followed the word 'edited' angered me but some of the
possibilities that came from the message made me excited. This story could
still be changed. There was a way even if Yoo Joonghyuk was dead.
Somehow I had to bring him back to this regression.

I scrolled through with a determined feeling. Then the sentences that were
written in the section before the ending caught my attention.

「 Before the end of the scenario, Yoo Joonghyuk recalled countless
memories of his death. 」

「 'In the third round, I almost died the first time I met Asmodeus'. 」

I had too many thoughts.

…Eh? Wait. This was currently the third round…

There was a knock on the door and I raised my head to see Mark. He saw
that I was awake and waved. "R-Revolutionary! You woke up? It is
fortunate."

"What is going on?"

"Nothing. I just wanted to let you know that someone came to see you."

I was busy and wanted to tell him to come back later when Mark continued
speaking. "The owner of the industrial complex is looking for you."

"Huh?"

"The owner of the industrial complex has come to visit you."

What did he mean? Wasn't I the owner of the industrial complex?

"Get out of the way."

The next moment, someone pushed past Mark and entered the room. It was
a presence that changed the atmosphere just by standing there.
I stared blankly at the man with my mouth gaping open. Yoo Joonghyuk,
who I thought was dead, was standing in front of me.




It took me a bit more time to come to my senses. Aileen, who came back,
glanced at us and disappeared after arranging the table while the blankly
standing Mark also avoided this place. Once the surroundings became
quiet, I opened my mouth first. "When did you come here?"

"Two days ago."

I was ashamed of myself for freaking out in the last 10 minutes. The man I
had been worried about was walking around the same industrial complex
while I had all sorts of delusions about his death.

"…How did you survive? It was a situation where you couldn't survive."

"I received a bit of help."

"From who? Was it your sponsor?"

"That guy has never helped me once."

I asked for his help but I didn't think he would actually help. From the
beginning to the end of Ways of Survival, all he did was make Yoo
Joonghyuk regress. Yoo Joonghyuk's wounds had healed and he looked
quite healthy.

"A constellation helped me."

"A constellation? Who?"

"You don't need to know the details."
"What did you give in exchange? None of them would help for nothing."

"I just received a slight penalty."

"Penalty?"

"Until the Demon Realm scenario is over, I will disappear for 10 minutes a
day."

"Disappear? What does this mean?"

"Something like that. In any case, I have now entered the main scenario and
the scenario error has been resolved. There is no need to worry about it."

Yoo Joonghyuk's expression while speaking seemed like he had solved
something. It was somewhat troubling. I had fallen asleep for a week and
Yoo Joonghyuk survived with the help of someone unrelated to me. Then
he came here to finish become the ruler of the industrial complex.

"…"

Perhaps it was because it was rare to talk to Yoo Joonghyuk like this. An
awkward silence filled the treatment room. Yoo Joonghyuk stared blankly
down at the table while drinking tea.

I wanted to ask why he came here. I wanted to ask what he would do in the
future. However, completely different words emerged from my mouth.

"The others… are they doing well?"

In fact, Yoo Joonghyuk couldn't know. He was a person who only filled his
head with the scenarios. Such a person wouldn't care about what other
people were doing. I deliberately wanted to nag at him. Please don't live
your life alone. If he lived like that, he could never reach the end of the
scenario. I meant to give this speech. By the way…
"Lee Hyunsung went to the army." Yoo Joonghyuk started talking. "Jung
Heewon and Lee Jihye are training new incarnations. They are
strengthening their power in preparing for the future disaster scenarios."

"…Eh?"

"Yoo Sangah and Han Sooyoung are in contact with government officials."

"The two of them are together?"

It was the first time I saw Yoo Joonghyuk saying so many words. Maybe
this was why I fell into his story.

"Gong Pildu is buying land in Seongnam to build a huge castle. He seems
to really think he is a king."

"Haha, that ahjussi is really…"

"The two children are doing well. They seem to throw a coin every time
they are bored."

I was fascinated as Yoo Joonghyuk continued to speak in a blunt voice.
Some stories were easy to understand while others took a bit more time.
Nevertheless, they were all stories of someone I knew. The people I liked
were living stories in a place where I didn't exist.

As I listened, I felt somewhat sweet, sad and nostalgic. "Everybody is busy
living."

I felt a strange loneliness at the end of the story. I see. Everyone was living
well.

[The exclusive skill 'Fourth Wall' is shaking.]

I realized that I was an 'outsider' of this story.

「 The 25th regression Yoo Joonghyuk said, 'I can't change anything'. 」
Without me, people were still continuing the scenarios. Just like Yoo
Joonghyuk repeated the regressions. The 4th, 5th, 6th rounds… it led to an
endless story where I could be easily forgotten. Meanwhile, people would
move towards the ending. It was natural. It might be natural but I felt
pained at the reminder.

I bit my lips and tried to say something. I'm glad. The words didn't emerge
from my mouth. Then I heard Yoo Joonghyuk's voice. "In addition,
everyone is telling your story."

I slowly raised my head at the words. Yoo Joonghyuk's face was still
expressionless. "They say it a lot. Your story."

I smiled slightly while covering my eyes with both hands. I didn't appear so
on the surface but I wanted to say that I was smiling. In the small darkness
created with both hands, Yoo Joonghyuk's voice was heard again as he
drank tea.

"Let's go back to Earth, Kim Dokja."
        Chapter 227: Ep. 43 - Breaking the Sky Sword Saint, I


After the completion of the senior-grade dokkaebi test, Bihyung was
somehow lazy. All he had to do was manage the 'Korean Peninsula
scenario' that was left to him by the former Seoul branch manager, Baram.
Sometimes, all he had to do was lie down and watch the scenarios he made.

–Heewon-ssi! It's this way!

–Damn, I missed one. One person is going to the north!

On the screen, one of the scenarios on the Korean Peninsula called
'Catching the Mole' was in full swing. It was a scenario where they had to
catch all the
'bomb moles' that escaped within a certain

time.

A terrible explosion would occur if one was missed but the constellations
on the Korean Peninsula didn't seem distressed.
–Titano found it. I'll take care of it with Yoosung.

The incarnations showed perfect organization and teamwork. It was
different from some countries where a quarter of the land was blown away
from similar scenarios. Of course, this scenario wouldn't be approved if it
had such extreme difficulty.

"Damn, why is it like this…"

Bihyung grumbled as he bit his fingers. In fact, he could increase the
difficulty of this scenario much higher. It could blow up half the Korean
Peninsula and lead the incarnations to a terrible disaster. However, he didn't
do so.

'I should've saved Kim Dokja at that time… if I raise the difficulty here,
they will surely die'.

It was too late to regret it now. No matter how many preparations were
made, it was impossible to live outside the scenario.

[Constellations of the Korean Peninsula are supporting 'Kim Dokja's
Party'.]

[Constellations of the Korean Peninsula have sponsored 2,000 coins.]

The reason why Bihyung's channel was maintained was due to the
subscribers Kim Dokja left behind. The constellations were steadily
supporting the scenario, regardless of whether they were interesting or not.
However, the channel didn't only have such constellations.

[Many constellations are bored with the progress of the scenario.]

[Some constellations have left the channel.]
Kim Dokja had disappeared and Yoo Joonghyuk left the Korean Peninsula
scenario. Thus, the number of constellations abandoning the channel grew
every day. In other words, Bihyung was slowly dying.

'I need to make changes. But how?'

Of course, he knew how. If he raised the difficulties of the scenarios like
before and tricked the constellations, the subscribers would increase again.

Nevertheless, Bihyung no longer wanted to lead the scenario that way.

'Maybe I've changed as well'.

He had changed from his old self who only pursued unconditionally
stimulating scenarios and didn't care much about the life and death of the
incarnations. Bihyung wanted to tell a different story. He wanted to forget
the 'cider' that the bureau mentioned and see different scenarios. Just like
the scenarios made by the first generation dokkaebis, something that would
be remembered for a long time by the dokkaebis… –Bihyung.

Bihyung heard something through the dokkaebi communication and
reflexively rose.

–You look good. Have you been well?

The face that emerged on the panel was Baram, former Seoul branch
manager who left the Seoul Dome after becoming a 'great dokkaebi
candidate'. The astounded Bihyung quickly acted politely.

After leaving the Seoul branch, Baram entered the senior administrative
bureau. It was a place where the wisest dokkaebis around the world
gathered.

Baram on the panel seemed more impressive than he did before.

–I contacted you because I have a few messages.
"A few…?" Bihyung was a bit nervous. It was because he never received
good news when Baram spoke in such a meaningful manner.

–There are signs of a giant story.

"…Isn't there still a lot of time left until Gigantomachia or Ragnarok?"

–It isn't those stories. The giant story is being set up in the Demon Realm.

Bihyung's expression changed at the words 'Demon Realm'.

"Is it the Demon King Selection?"

Bihyung watched Baram nodding and gulped. Unlike the giant stories that
appeared on a regular basis, the Demon King Selection was a very rare
scenario. Bihyung had never seen the Demon King Scenario in person.

'The last selection tournament was already 800 years ago'.

Just imagining the giant story caused his heart to shake with excitement.
Baram read Bihyung's heart and laughed.

–Are you looking forward to it?

"I'm looking forward to it but I also feel regret. Who is the dokkaebi
responsible for it?"

The Demon Realm had been the domain of the wenny people since ancient
times. It was a barren scenario area where channels almost never opened.
This was the Demon Realm. Then the broadcast of the Demon King
Selection…

–This time is different. The bureau has decided to dispatch dokkaebis to the
Demon Realm.

"Huh? That…"
The dokkaebis didn't interfere in the work of the wenny people and the
wenny people didn't interfere in the work of the dokkaebis. This was the
'Promise of the Horizon'. Now Baram's words were directly contradicting
the covenant.

–I was originally planning to open a channel after signing a new agreement
with the wenny people but it has become more complicated. They broke the
promise first.

"They broke the promise?"

–An illegal channel has occurred in the Demon Realm.

"…Huh?"

It was something that couldn't happen according to common sense. There
were no dokkaebis in the Demon Realm. Then how was a channel opened?

–I'm not sure about the exact details. That's why the bureau is in an uproar
right now.

"If the wenny people stole a channel, can't you close it from here?"

The operating rights of the channel were limited to the dokkaebi. Even if
the wenny people stole a channel using a strange trick, the bureau could
easily handle it by closing one or two channels.

–The problem isn't the wenny people.

"It isn't the wenny people? Then who opened the channel?" –

It seems there is a dokkaebi in the Demon Realm.

"…Dokkaebi?"

Wait… perhaps? No, no. It wasn't possible. Baram kept speaking.
–In any case, that is why I've dispatched dokkaebi from the bureau to the
Demon Realm.

"I see. By the way, why are you telling me this?" –

You are on the list to be sent.

"I'm in charge of the Korean Peninsula."

–Other dokkaebis will take care of the Korean Peninsula for a while. Take a
few intermediate dokkaebis and go to the Demon Realm.

Bihyung was silent for a moment. Leave the hottest Earth scenario and go
to the Demon Realm? This was the same as a demotion.

–Aren't there a few incidents on the Korean Peninsula anyway? Don't feel
too sorry. Your dream of going higher can be achieved if you do this
properly.

"…You told me a similar story last time. Why me?"

–I don't know the exact reason but the elders pointed to you directly.

There is no refusing if they have decided. Bihyung's expression became
depressed. He had to go to that dangerous area?

–I know what you are thinking but don't be too depressed. It isn't a
demotion. Rather, I have one more piece of information that you might like
to hear.

Bihyung raised his head without any expectations while Baram spoke in a
strange voice.

–The Demon King of Salvation has appeared in the Demon Realm.
We were silent for a long time. 30 minutes passed after Yoo Joonghyuk's
words before I finally opened my mouth. In these 30 minutes, I saw Aileen
enter and leave the room once.

"…Yoo Joonghyuk, did you bring the Uriel doll?"

Yoo Joonghyuk silently pulled out the doll at my question. I carefully
examined the doll. The arms and legs were all torn apart. It might be a
symbolic body but Uriel's real body would've been impacted by such a
blow. An archangel with such pride was suffering like this in the Demon
Realm.

"…I can't go back now."

"I see."

He answered as if he already knew. I turned my head and saw that Yoo
Joonghyuk was also watching the Uriel doll. We didn't speak but we could
clearly tell what the other person was thinking.

"Are you going to take part in the Demon King Selection?"

"…That's right."

The Demon King Selection. It was a scenario I had to go through to
confront the constellations in the future.

"I'm sorry for the party members but I have to get a giant story here." I
spoke while carefully attaching Uriel's torn arm. "This way, I can prepare
for the future destruction scenarios."

My choices would be limited if I returned to Earth. I could get opportunities
here and build up my power so it wasn't efficient to go back now. The
scenario difficulty had already become more terrible than the original
novel. I would only lose time from my work if I returned to Earth.
Yoo Joonghyuk stared at me for a moment. "It isn't a bad idea."

His tone showed he understood many things. Perhaps Yoo Joonghyuk
understood my heart more than anyone else. It was because he lost his
precious things when he was weak.

I asked, "What are you going to do?"

"I"m going to stay in the Demon Realm for a while. There is a
personal scenario here so I can't leave right away." Hoh, I see.

"Really? If you don't mind, why don't you help me out?"

"I am helping myself, not you."

I looked up at Yoo Joonghyuk because I wanted to know what he meant. It
was clearly the same expressionless face as before but something felt
different. "…Are you also planning to participate in the Demon King
Selection?"

"It is natural."

My mind became complicated. This jerk, he was thinking about taking part
in the Demon King Selection…?

"Wait! You told me to go back to Earth…"

Yoo Joonghyuk ignored me and got up to go to the window. The faint light
of the sunset cast a dark shade on Yoo Joonghyuk's face. According to
Ways of Survival, Yoo Joonghyuk pretended to have a cool face when he
was caught.

This bastard, he wanted to send me back to Earth and become the demon
king. The shameless back looked like it wanted to flee.

Then Yoo Joonghyuk opened his mouth. "They're coming."
A cold surged from outside the window as Aileen and Mark ran through the
door of the treatment room. I was able to know what was going on without
listening to them. It was because Biyoo had woken up and was staring at
me nervously.

[The constellation 'Founder of Humanity' is looking at the Yoo Joonghyuk
Industrial Complex.]

[The constellation 'The Last Pharaoh' is looking at the Yoo Joonghyuk
Industrial Complex.]

[Constellations of certain nebulae are looking at the Yoo Joonghyuk
Industrial Complex.]

More than a dozen stars twinkled in the sky and one of them let out an
intense burst of light and sparks. After a while, a huge shape started to
appear at the entrance of the industrial complex.

It was the direct descent of an incarnation body. It was a giant mummy with
a golden crown on its head. The height surpassed the walls and the
incarnations in the industrial complex started screaming.

If I remembered correctly, this constellation belonged to Papyrus. In
addition, Papyrus had joined hands with Bercan.

Yoo Joonghyuk spoke in a terrible tone, "…I guess they have come to
protest."

There was no need to ask what the protest was about. It was already the
prelude to the Demon King Selection.
     Chapter 228: Ep. 43 - Breaking the Sky Sword Saint, II


[Who is… the industrial complex's… new master?]

The colossal voice was heard and Yoo Joonghyuk and I simultaneously
looked out the window. Judging by the noisy streets, the use of a true voice
was quite tough. Yoo Joonghyuk muttered in a small voice, "A
constellation of Papyrus."

"If it is the Last Pharaoh, it is probably that woman?"

A giant mummy with an old, golden crown. Everything was covered with
bandages apart from the high nose. It was just like what I read in Ways of
Survival. It was clear that the body belonged to Cleopatra, the last pharaoh
of Egypt.

[Who… is… Yoo Joonghyuk?]

Once again, the true voice rang out through the industrial complex. It was
certainly great but neither of us were discouraged. Cleopatra was a
historical-grade constellation at most. Yoo Joonghyuk and I were no longer
nervous regarding great constellations.

"Yoo Joonghyuk. Can you win?"

It was an opponent I couldn't afford to go against while I currently had
story packs hanging from my body. Yoo Joonghyuk shook his head. "It is
impossible right now. It will soon be time."

"Are you talking about the penalty? The one where you disappear for 10
minutes a day?"

Yoo Joonghyuk didn't answer. I accepted it as agreement and looked at
Cleopatra. "Then that person…"

"She won't do anything."

"Why?"

"The Demon King Selection hasn't started yet."

Naturally, the incarnation bodies of the constellations who weren't part of
the scenario were constrained by probability. As long as the giant story
hadn't opened yet, they couldn't act freely. Even so…

"Hey, have you already forgotten about Asmodeus?"

"Not everyone can act like Asmodeus."

I knew that much. It was because the demon kings had much fewer
restrictions than the constellations in the Demon Realm. The problem was
the constellations could consume extra probability to overcome these
constraints.

"Isn't Cleopatra a member of Papyrus? If she borrows the probability of the
nebula…"
"Kim Dokja. You have already forgotten what they have done."

"What?"

Before Yoo Joonghyuk could answer, I heard Cleopatra's voice in the air.
[Tell the… new ruler of the industrial complex. He will surely die… if he
participates in the Demon King Selection.]

Cleopatra's body started to disappear with these words. Like a massive sand
castle collapsing, the body returned to dust.

[Keep this in mind… Papyrus will never… warn you twice.]

Then why are you leaving so gently? It was strange. Usually, she would
leave after killing hundreds of incarnations.

Yoo Joonghyuk opened his mouth like I was pathetic. "Have you forgotten?
They forced fate on you."

"Ah."

That reminded me, there was such a thing. Papyrus, Vedas and Olympus
used a massive amount of probability to force my fate on me. It was the
reason why Cleopatra easily disappeared. They now lacked probability.

Yoo Joonghyuk spoke in his distinctive somber voice, "We've bought some
time before the Demon King Selection."

I nodded. At least for now, the constellations wouldn't attack this side. I
checked the message logs.

[The 'Demon King Selection' is currently being prepared.]

[Remaining Preparation Time: 28 days, 17 hours and 12 minutes.]
If my prediction was correct, the Demon King Selection would consume
the 21st to 24th scenarios. It was a giant story so it was natural to eat the
scenarios. I measured the time remaining and said,

"The two of us alone isn't enough."

"I know."

Once the Demon King Selection started, the constellations would start to
flock here. A historical-grade constellation might be lacking in strength but
they were still much stronger than normal incarnations. Moreover, once
many of them started to appear, it would be difficult for only Yoo
Joonghyuk and I to deal with them. "Do you have an idea?"

Yoo Joonghyuk shook his head. There was a way to bring colleagues from
Earth but Lee Hyunsung and Jung Heewon still lacked the ability to fight
against transcendents or constellations. They needed time to become
stronger by alternating between personal scenarios and main scenarios. A
full-scale power management would be possible when they entered the
latter scenarios. I needed to find colleagues I could use right away.

"Have you gathered any colleagues here?"

"Ah, there is…" Speaking of which, where was Jang Hayoung? I twisted
my sore body and looked around. "I sent him to search for group members.
It is time for some results…"

"Be prepared. I'll be leaving in a second."

Before I could ask where he was going, Yoo Joonghyuk disappeared from
my view.
I worked out my plan and left the treatment room after sorting out my
bandages. Aileen said I should rest for two more weeks but my physical
condition wasn't that bad, perhaps because I was relaxed.

[The attribute 'Lamarck's Giraffe' has increased the recovery effect.]

…Ah, it was due to the effect of the attribute. The alarmed Aileen rushed
over as I stepped outside and stretched. I interrupted her before she could
open her mouth. "Don't worry. Rather, can you heal this?"

Aileen received the Uriel doll and cocked her head. "…What is this?"

"A constellation's symbolic body."

Aileen made the mistake of dropping the doll to the ground. She hurriedly
picked up the doll again and asked me, "…Will I be punished for dropping
it?"

"Don't worry, she is a good constellation. Please firmly repair it."

The constellation was nice. The words were strange to say but I was talking
to Uriel, not other constellations.

I said I would go for a short stroll and emerged onto the streets of the
industrial complex. The streets of the industrial complex were bathed in a
dim light and seemed different from before.

A few people recognized me and nodded lightly. I could see a vigour that I
never saw before on their faces. Perhaps this was the expression of those
who decided to live.

"Hey Yoo Joonghyuk! Did you wake up?"

I turned around and saw someone running over here. Jang Hayoung walked
up to me and gave me a clumsy headlock. I tried to pull Jang Hayoung off
me. "My name isn't Yoo Joonghyuk."
"Oh, now you want to reveal your real name?"

"…You know?"

"Well, I'm not the only one using a pseudonym."

I stared at Jang Hayoung for a while before speaking in a meaningful
manner. "My name is Kim Dokja."

I spoke nice words but Jang Hayoung had a dazed expression. "It is a
strange name. I seem to have heard it before…"

"…It's fine. What were you doing?"

"Oh, I was chatting to a few people and got a tip about this area."

"A tip?"

"You don't know because you have been sleeping? Interesting things have
happened in the industrial complex in the meantime."

I heard from Jang Hayoung about what happened in the past week. Of
course, the most interesting thing was about Yoo Joonghyuk.

"He rejected the ruling rights?"

"That's right. He said he would become the duke but he wouldn't rule here.
Thus, everyone was in an uproar."

The situation was clear. Maybe Yoo Joonghyuk was practicing his motto of
'dominate but don't rule'. That's what he said. The idea was good. However,
the situation was bad.

"The order of the industrial complex must be out of control. If the situation
isn't organized, that declaration would just create a security problem."

"That's why the citizens are excited right now."
A powerful dictator had the power to control people's desires. Since
a dictator gave up his power, the piled up desires of the citizens
would burst out at once.

「 "Do you think the darkness of the industrial complex will disappear if I
die?" 」

These were the words of Duke Syswitz in Ways of Survival. I once again
thought he was right. The industrial complex wouldn't suddenly change just
because the ruler changed. Rather, the oppressive dictatorship had vanished
and the people's hidden desires would become even more exposed.

"Hey, give me that fragment!"

"I-I don't want to. I picked it up."

Voices burst out like they had been waiting and Jang Hayoung and I
simultaneously turned our heads. A large number of people were lynching
an incarnation in an alley. The situation was obvious. They were fighting
over a story fragment that came from the Factory. I was about to move
when

Jang Hayoung restrained me. "Wait. Just watch."

"…What?"

"I told you, there was a tip."

"What is the tip?"

"The 'Punisher' will show up here."

"Punisher?"

I had never heard of such a position. There was no such position in the
Revolutionary scenario or Ways of Survival. Jang Hayoung noticed my
doubts and added. "It's a nickname created by the citizens. A great
beauty appeared a few days ago and has been maintaining the peace…"
At this moment, a man's shout was heard from inside the alley.

"Kill him and steal it!"

The men pulled out their weapons and it seemed to be a full-fledged
lynching. I would rather move first instead of waiting for the punisher. The
moment I moved my hand to the sword at my waist, a slender shadow
appeared in the alley.

"Stop."

A woman with a black cape covering her body was standing on the wall. I
wasn't sure about her equipment because of the cape but her face was very
clear. It was a face that seemed to be on a different dimension from the
world around it. I watched the woman's waist-long hair flapping in the wind
and moved slowly in great shock.

…Was there such a figure in Ways of Survival? All of a sudden, the
meaning of every praise word became clear.

Deep sultry eyes were set beneath neat eyebrows. All the standards that
determined beauty in the world were collapsed at the same time. It was a
face that couldn't be described using the modifiers of a constellation. To my
chagrin, there was only one way to express this face.

「 There was no doubt it was a beauty that would slap¹ Yoo Joonghyuk on
the cheeks three times. 」

There wasn't such an expression in Ways of Survival. In Ways of Survival,
Jang Hayoung was at most described as 'two slaps on the cheeks'. I was
stunned with shock while the person who would slap Yoo Joonghyuk twice
whispered, "She came. That person is the punisher."
The men were overwhelmed by the woman's beauty and belatedly woke up.
Their lips moved and I knew what would emerge. Before their mouths
could
open, something moved. Then something fell. It was a little bit later that a
man screamed. "U-Uwaaaack!"

The man who had his arm cut off screamed terrible while the other people
identified the situation and started fleeing. They noticed it was an enemy
that couldn't deal with. Even the rescued man was terrified and ran out of
the alley. In an instant, only the man's fallen arm and the woman remained
in the alley.

Jang Hayoung watched the woman silently holding the sword and let out a
burst of admiration. "Look, isn't she really amazing? You told me to look
for some useful people. I tried to talk to her yesterday but she just
disappeared―"

The swordsmanship was brutal but moved along a fixed course. The
amazing thing was the speed of the swordsmanship. I murmured, "An
incarnation can't have that level of swordsmanship."

"What?"

Jang Hayoung might've missed it but I definitely noticed. At this point in
time, this speed was only possible for transcendents. My heart thumped
loudly.

I didn't know the identity of this woman but if I could make her my
colleague, she would surely be a great power in the Demon King Selection.
The moment the woman in the black cape turned around, I jumped into the
alley without hesitation. "Hey!"

I was planning to use Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint to get information
while talking to her. It would be easier to persuade her if I could see her
Attributes Window. Then if I was lucky―
"Kuek…"

Before I could approach the woman and use the skill, I had to stop in place.
The woman's eyes were looking at me. I trembled from the terrible
emotions that were transmitted to me. Tremendous resentment and anger
shot towards me. I was struck dumb by the sheer waterfall of emotions.

…What was this girl? Did she know me?

…Rather, why did she hate me so much?



[1] Slap on the cheeks – Korean idiom meaning "to put someone's beauty
to shame."
     Chapter 229: Ep. 43 - Breaking the Sky Sword Saint, III


I resisted the waves of anger and resentment and shouted towards the
punisher, "Wait! Just wait!"

Then the messages of the constellations entered my head.

[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' is astonished.]

[A few constellations are worried over your judgment.]

[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' is having an
intense allergic reaction to your gaze'.] Huh? What? All of a sudden…

[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' has entered the channel.]
…Ah, Uriel!

[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' is surprised!]

[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' is surprised!]
[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' is surprised!]

It wasn't strange for Uriel to enter the channel since it had been a week
since the Asmodeus incident. The problem was the messages from the
subsequent constellations.

[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' is asking about what is
happening.]

[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' says he doesn't know
much.]

[The constellation who likes to change sex is giggling.]

[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' is heading towards the nebula
'Asgard'.]

The sudden outpouring of messages from the constellations woke me up.
What was this situation? Why were they pointing in my face…

The punisher quickly disappeared from the alley while I was confused by
the messages of the constellations.

"Ah, wait!" It was a pity. This was a chance to get a good colleague.

Jang Hayoung belatedly chased after me and asked, "How is it? Isn't she
beautiful?"

"When did she appear?"

"Three or four days ago. The rumour that she is a beauty as well as having
incredibly ability quickly spread. She is also elusive."

"Will she come tomorrow?"
I hadn't been able to figure out her swordsmanship but she would definitely
be a great help in the Demon King Selection. By the way, where did this
person come from? She wasn't in the original Ways of Survival…

"She comes every day so she will probably come tomorrow. Were you
fascinated by her?"

"It's not like that."

"I'm joking, I'm joking. I know. You don't like girls."

"…Who said that?"

Where did such a rumour…

[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' is looking at you.]
…I think I knew where the rumour came from.

"It has been a while, Uriel."



[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' is raising her nose with an
'ahem'.]

I listened to Uriel's indirect messages while heading to the treatment room
with Uriel.

[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' is praising herself.]

Most of Uriel's stories were about how she convinced Yoo Joonghyuk to go
to the Demon Realm. As expected, it was Uriel who persuaded Yoo
Joonghyuk to save me. It was as I thought. He wouldn't come here on his
own to save me.

"Your symbolic body is currently being repaired. You'll be able to enter it
again when it's done."
[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire''s is touched to tears.]

"By the way, what personal scenario did you give Yoo Joonghyuk? It
would be dangerous for an archangel to release a personal scenario in the
Demon Realm."

In fact, it was dangerous for a high-level constellation like Uriel to come to
the Demon Realm.

The nebula Eden had a truce with the 72 demon kings of the Demon Realm.
Perhaps Uriel was conscious of this face and manifested herself as a
symbolic body instead of an incarnation body. Uriel wouldn't have been so
helpless against Asmodeus if it wasn't for this.

[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' is making a sullen
expression.]

[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' says it doesn't matter
anymore.]

Once the link between Yoo Joonghyuk and Uriel was cut off, Uriel's
personal scenario had been forcibly erased. Yoo Joonghyuk said that he
received another personal scenario.

I was listening to Uriel's story when Jang Hayoung interrupted. "How did
you become so familiar with the constellations?"

"I am also a constellation."

"…What? Are you joking?"

"Didn't I tell you?"

Jang Hayoung had a complicated expression on his face. "A constellation…
the beings in the sky? The same as the mummy who appeared in the
morning?"
"That is usually the case.

"That's why there is a modifier. A constellation lives in the context of that
modifier…"

Come to think of it, there was that setting. The nature of the constellations
was inside the context of the modifier. I had become corrupted as soon as I
became a constellation so I couldn't see the context…

"That's right. Those constellations."

"What is your modifier…"

Jang Hayoung was conscious of my status as a constellation and became
cautious. I couldn't help smiling. This bastard would probably be surprised
to know who I am.

[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' is alert towards the
incarnation 'Jang Hayoung'!]

[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' is warning incarnation 'Jang
Hayoung' not to be too friendly!]

"Uh…!" Jang Hayoung was intimidated by Uriel and quickly moved away
from me.

[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' is making an angelic smile.]

Why did the angel say this to him? I entered the treatment room and was
able to see Yoo Joonghyuk leisurely sitting at the table while drinking tea.
"You're late."

"What? You are already here?"

I didn't know where he went but Yoo Joonghyuk's boots were covered with
dirt. The tea had also been changed. Was there herbal tea here? Thinking
about it, this guy's taste was very delicate.
Yoo Joonghyuk glanced at Jang Hayoung behind me. "Is he the one you
mentioned?"

"That's right." I answered and Jang Hayoung stepped forward.

"…This is the new duke? Hello, I'm Aslan."

"You're a rude jerk."

"Sorry, I'm actually a bitch."

Their gazes clashed in the air. I felt the atmosphere become awkward and
quickly interrupted. "Is this the first time you've seen each other? Yoo
Joonghyuk, didn't you come here a few days ago?"

"There was no time for greetings. Then your new colleague is someone who
doesn't know if he is a man or a woman?"

"That's right."

"I hate weak guys."

"…I'm not weak?" Jang Hayoung puffed up his chest but he didn't enter
Yoo Joonghyuk's eyes. He might have the Unidentified Wall but his power
was still insufficient compared to the transcendent Yoo Joonghyuk. They
were both main characters but Yoo Joonghyuk was the first one.

Yoo Joonghyuk quietly lowered his teacup and spoke in a cold voice. "He
isn't worth waiting for. Surely this jerk isn't the only one?"

I quickly responded instead of the offended Jang Hayoung. "Oh, there's one
more. I haven't talked to the person yet but I've found a decent colleague."

"Who is it?"

"She is called the punisher. She appeared a little while ago and I think she
will be quite helpful."
Yoo Joonghyuk's expression became complicated at my words. "That
person is impossible."

"What? Why?"

"I tried to get her but failed."

"What did you say to her? Were you mean? Something like: I will kill you
if you don't become my colleague―"

I fell silent at Yoo Joonghyuk's furious expression. Yoo Joonghyuk must
have a good reason if he was saying this. I didn't know but perhaps he had a
previous love or hate relationship with her. Who was that woman to have
such a relationship with Yoo Joonghyuk? She wasn't in the original… no,
the original had changed a bit and there might be a new story. I should look
for it soon.

"Then there is only one way left…"

Jang Hayoung received my gaze and replied with a sulky expression. "Why,
what is it?"

"Did you do what I asked correctly?"

"I did."

"What about the transcendent I told you about?"

"I got a response. Come and look."

Yoo Joonghyuk raised an eyebrow as he listened to the conversation
between Jang Hayoung and I. "Transcendent? What are you talking about?"

"Ah, this person can communicate with beings of other scenarios. Isn't he
quite useful?"

It was a scheme to appeal Jang Hayoung's ability to him but Yoo
Joonghyuk's expression was still sour. "So?"

"It isn't limited to colleagues or incarnations. If we recruit constellations or
transcendents―"

"The constellations aren't possible. I can't trust them."

"Then you are okay with transcendents?"

"Have you thought of someone?"

I nodded. "I will go to First Murim."

"…The First Murim?"

"It is a place where transcendents are the most abundant."

"I know what you're thinking but there is no guarantee that they are all
superior to the constellations. There are many big evils and big demons
present."

"I know but aren't there others?"

"Do you think they will all help you just because they have a touch of a
chivalrous spirit? I don't remember seeing a decent human among those in
Murim."

I felt a deep resentment in Yoo Joonghyuk's voice. Well, it wasn't
unreasonable since he already experienced the First Murim in the last
regression. However—

"Well, at least one person might help."

I watched Yoo Joonghyuk's distorted expression and spoke in a joyful
manner. "I'm going to ask for help from the Breaking the Sky Sword Saint."
Breaking the Sky Sword Saint. One of the most powerful transcendents in
all of Ways of Survival. She wasn't at the top at this point in time but her
skills were enough. It was because the Breaking the Sky Sword Saint was
none other than Yoo Joonghyuk's master.

"Why that person?"

"She is an unconventional existence that isn't tied to righteousness or
unrighteousness. Also, isn't it natural to pick your master?"

Yoo Joonghyuk's expression was worse than when the story of the punisher
came out. The sight of the disconcerted Yoo Joonghyuk… it was really
unusual. Yoo Joonghyuk was pale and his forehead was sweaty.
"Absolutely not."

"Why?"

"If I say no then you can't. That person can absolutely never…"

Of course, I read Ways of Survival and knew why Yoo Joonghyuk was
acting like this. It couldn't be helped. This time I had to move according
to my plan. "No, we have to go. I've already obtained the ticket." Biyoo
floated in the air and made a sound.

[Baat!]

A new scenario message followed.

[A new sub-scenario has arrived!]

The First Murim was a scenario area where people frequently came and
went so I was able to purchase portal tickets from the Dokkaebi Bag,
although it required 50,000 coins. However, the advantage was that I could
come and go at will.
"Yoo Joonghyuk, think carefully. It might not necessarily by the Breaking
the Sky Sword Saint. There are quite a few useful things you can obtain
there."

The First Murim was a place where a variety of warriors from the 20th to
the 40th scenarios gather. If we went there at this point in time, there would
certainly be a lot of information and hidden pieces available.

Yoo Joonghyuk was troubled for a long time before asking, "When are you
going?"

I smiled and replied, "Right now."
     Chapter 230: Ep. 43 - Breaking the Sky Sword Saint, IV


The preparations were soon over. I entrusted the Yoo Joonghyuk Industrial
Complex to Aileen and the Kim Dokja Industrial Complex to Mark and
some council members.

…Rather, it felt strange hearing the Kim Dokja Industrial Complex. Was
there really an industrial complex with that name in the Demon Realm? I
thought the people would be unhappy.

"Damn, I'm just a pub owner. Is it possible to leave that to me?"

"It is just like running the pub. It is only until I come back. I have
transferred some of the rights so you should be able to handle security."

Mark had an unconvinced expression despite my words. "Still, wouldn't it
be good for you to show your face? The people of the industrial complex
will be quite confused."

"I don't have time to go there right now."
"If a new revolutionary appears…"

"The whole area has passed onto the next scenario. A revolutionary won't
appear for a while."

Mark seemed convinced by my words. It was slightly uneasy but it would
be enough to leave the industrial complex to Mark for a while. It was Mark
who was the greatest help to the damaged industrial complex in the original
novel. Kim Dokja was already in a panic due to the devastation caused by
Yoo Joonghyuk so people like Mark were needed.

Mark led the council members towards the Kim Dokja Industrial Complex.
Han Myungoh watched their backs and suddenly opened his mouth, "Then
we should depart."

"We?"

I looked back at Han Myungoh with a frown.

…When did this person pack his bags?

"I won't stay here alone."

"…"

"I also have a good eye when it comes to martial arts. I read many martial
arts novels when I was young."

In fact, I knew why Han Myungoh wanted to follow. To be precise, it was
Han Myungoh's boss, not Han Myungoh.

[The demon king 'Devil of Lust and Wrath' is looking at you.]

[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' is looking at Demon King
Asmodeus.]
I felt sorry for Uriel but I couldn't help right now. It was best to maintain a
good relationship with Asmodeus for now, as I didn't know about the
development of the third regression in the revised version. There was also
something more worrisome than Uriel and Asmodeus.

"There are too many dregs."

"Do you complain about the world?"

Jang Hayoung and Yoo Joonghyuk were glaring at each other. I sighed. My
purpose was meeting the Breaking the Sky Sword Saint which meant Yoo
Joonghyuk had to come along. Jang Hayoung was also necessary as a
liaison. Above all, this journey would be a great help to Jang Hayoung's
growth.

"Then let's depart." I sent a signal and Biyoo opened a portal in the air with
a 'baat' sound. There was a whirling sound and a portal was created. It
wasn't the size of the Great Hole but it was enough for the four of us to go
across.

Yoo Joonghyuk hurriedly ended as soon as the portal appeared. Jang
Hayoung watched Yoo Joonghyuk disappearing and spoke in a tense voice,
"…I've never left the Demon Realm before."

After the first dimensional movement, Jang Hayoung always lived in the
Demon Realm. I wanted to give words of encouragement but Han
Myungoh unexpectedly opened his mouth first.

"Believe in me. I've read more than 300 volumes of martial arts novels.
You just have to follow me."

I smiled at Han Myungoh's words.

…Over 300 martial arts novels. I didn't know it if would be similar to the
First Murim.
"Let's go."

The three of us plunged into the portal at the same time. My vision
darkened and the landscape of the universe unfolded before me. I crossed
the universe as a ray of light. It was the Star Stream galaxy where countless
stories were spoken. A few stars stared at me passing by and once I came to
my senses, I was touching the rough ground.

"Wow, I'm dizzy…"

Jang Hayoung was retching to the side while Han Myungoh looked like he
had climbed a mountain.

I didn't see where Yoo Joonghyuk had disappeared to.

…He probably didn't want to meet the Breaking the Sky Sword Saint.

"Ohh, this place…" The overexcited Han Myungoh urged us forward with a
childlike expression. I probably looked like this at the beginning of Ways of
Survival.

[You have arrived at the Blue Dragon Castle.]

The portal in the sky closed with this message and I started examining the
area.

「 The Blue Dragon Castle is one of the four great fortresses of the First
Murim. 」

According to the description in Ways of Survival, this was one of the
largest castles in the First Murim. Based on the size of the square, the city
must be enormous. It was a sprawling city centered around the big palace.

The markets and lively streets were selling various things. There were
Murim people sitting in front of small and large houses. No one
showed apparent hostility but I could guess how powerful they were.
[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' is making an
interested expression.]

[Some constellations are nostalgic at the sight of the First Murim.]

The First Murim was a place were countless strong people were born and
raised. Perhaps some of the constellations had passed through this place.
Jang Hayoung glanced around the surroundings like he was overwhelmed
by the atmosphere and opened his mouth. "…It is a Chinese style? Is it
originally like this?'

"The 'martial arts' background is originally like this."

Despite saying it was the Chinese style, the red lanterns were Japanese-
style while some Southeast Asian architecture was mixed in. Of course,
there were things unique to China. For example, the Chinese dress…

[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' is looking at you.]

I walked while pretending I didn't hear it. The fortress was so wide that I
couldn't get a feel for the size. However, if I read it correctly, the Breaking
the Sky Sword Saint shouldn't be in this area.

First… we should go towards the market. We came all the way here and I
wanted to try the dishes of the First Murim. The best things to eat were
dumplings and chicken broth. These two dishes were the food that Yoo
Joonghyuk ate the most in the First Murim.

He often described the scene of him eating dumplings with hot chicken
broth. At night, I would hold my hungry stomach and go to the convenience
store to buy a 1,000 won steamed bun.

"Hmm, I don't see anyone training in martial arts."

"They won't carelessly show off martial arts. You won't know if you had
read 300 volumes of martial arts novels."
"Then are you an expert at the Murim World? Is there some type of
relationship?"

"Yes, of course."

"I'm looking forward to it."

I stared at Han Myungoh with pitying eyes. This man seemed to think that
this 'Murim' was the 'Murim' he knew. Not long afterwards, Han Myungoh's
expectations started to slowly crumble.

"…Something is strange."

"What do you mean?"

Han Myungoh looked closely at a passing incarnation like he had seen
something that shouldn't be seen. "Why are the Murim people wearing
jeans?"

"Why can't they wear jeans?"

"No, there can't be jeans in China during this time period…"

"They are probably tourists like us."

It wasn't just jeans. Most people wore earphones or large headphones while
there are also incarnations using smartphone-like devices. There were those
who pursued the so-called Murim fashion but approximately half of them
didn't fit the world like us.

Han Myungoh felt despair as his romance was destroyed in front of him and
I briefly sighed. "I know what you were imagining but this is what Murim
is like these days."

"I-Is that so?"

"Of course. The cities are all like this now."
"This wasn't the Murim that I wanted…"

"In fact, everything in the world is disappointing."

Han Myungoh didn't give up despite my words. He learnt an interpretation
skill and talked to a street vendor. His way of speaking matched the Murim
World. "Excuse me, where do I go to find a martial arts hall?"

The merchant who was dozing off against the pile of goods on a shabby
stand stared at Han Myungoh with wide eyes. "Um? I guess you just came
here."

"Yes."

"Why do you want a martial arts hall? Do you want to learn martial arts?"

"Since I came to Murim, shouldn't I learn the sword?"

"Ahaha, indeed. That's right. Your words are correct."

Han Myungoh's mouth curved upwards at the reply.

[The character 'Chu Gukmyung' has triggered 'Bargaining Lv. 4'.]

It was really bad quality from the start. "However, you seem to be
misunderstanding something. These days, we don't learn martial arts from
martial arts halls."

"Huh? What does that mean?"

"Haha, the sweaty traditional martial arts teaching methods are used only in
the 100th rural Murim World. No one learns martial arts like that these
days. You seem to be from a dark world so I will give you special
information. You're lucky."

Han Myungoh was confused. "Then how do you learn martial arts these
days?"
"We use this."

The merchant brushed off the dust accumulated on the goods. The box that
the merchant held contained something that was similar to a small mp3.

[Heaven and Earth Ice Spirit Sword Unopened Set]

[-A recording engraved with information directly from the brain of the
martial artist, the Ice Flower Goddess!

–Repeated learning is the best! If you keep studying it from childhood, you
will gain enlightenment!

–Six month installments are possible! At 500 coins per month, anyone can
be a master!]

"…What is this?"

"It is a fad among young people these days. It is rumoured that anyone can
become a master if they use this 1,000 times."

"Is that true… really?"

"Of course it is true. I lived in Murim for over 10 years. Would I lie? Do
you see the young people walking around with earphones?"

"Yes, I've seen them. Don't tell me?"

The merchant nodded significantly at Han Myungoh's question. "Everyone
is currently listening to it. The youngsters are busy reading these days."

"Huh… I see. That's what it was. I'm behind the times."

"Huhu, this is a limited edition because it was directly recorded by the Ice
Flower Goddess. Do you know the Ice Flower Goddess? She is the public
girlfriend of Murim. Here, I'll let you have a listen. It is very effective even
when you aren't sleeping."
Han Myungoh stuck the earphones in his ears while Jang Hayoung
rummaged through the merchant's goods.

[Phantom Flyer Home Training 6 Months Set]

[-You can be a master if you follow it 10,000 times!]

[Follow the South Palace Sword King's study!]

[-Use the safest and fastest way to reach the peak by listening to the online
lectures of the top teacher of the South Palace!]

–The 24 hours question and answer board is in operation. There is no need
to worry about coins. Feel free to contact us anytime!

Come to think of it, these recordings were at the peak popularity during this
time. They were known to stimulate the unconscious learning of martial
arts so they sat at home, listened to lectures and practiced it comfortably…

The merchant stared at Jang Hayoung who was recklessly rummaging
through the goods. "Hey there, young miss or mister… in any case. Don't
mess it up if you aren't buying. They are expensive."

"Can we really become a master with something like this?"

"Don't you see the reviews here? They are all products certified by
professional agencies."

I remembered the first time I read about the listening devices in Ways of
Survival. The views of the Murim people were also shown.

–Baek Youngshin (12 years old, male): I listened to it because of a friend. It
was very good. I have been first in my private academy since the third
month.
–Tanlangmiyo (32 years old, female): Honestly, I listened for three weeks
and thought it took too long… From the sixth week, I started to hear the
martial arts that I didn't know!!!

–Hwa Wang Bangun (24 years old, male): After hearing this, my
performance in the scenarios became better. What about the scenario
difficulty?? I'm not afraid of the dokkaebis anymore!!!

They were clearly false advertisements but it was a temptation for any
incarnation who actually visited the First Murim for the first time. They
were incarnations who had come through tough scenarios.

However, it wasn't easy to learn martial arts techniques profound enough to
reduce the difficulty level of the scenario with a few coins.

Han Myungoh complained that he didn't like this Murim, changed his mind.
"Would you like to listen to it once? It feels like the martial arts enters
really easily―"

"Huhu Mister, you are in good shape. It is known as the lightheaded
phenomenon and usually occurs after three weeks."

"Ah, is that so? Then how much in a lump sum— "

I was about to stop him when a terrible voice was heard from behind me.

"If people can become experts using such a thing, the First Murim would've
never been destroyed."
      Chapter 231: Ep. 43 - Breaking the Sky Sword Saint, V


The merchant frowned as he looked towards the voice in the back. As
expected, Yoo Joonghyuk was standing there. My expression changed as I
warned him, "Hey, don't go around talking like that."

The destruction of the First Murim that Yoo Joonghyuk mentioned was a
scenario that hadn't happened yet. In the original novel, the tragedy would
occur in a few more years. Of course, Yoo Joonghyuk witnessed this in the
last regression and the future became the 'past' for him.

"Don't waste unnecessary time. You know that people can't become
stronger with that trash."

"I was just letting the group take a look."

"We aren't here to be tourists. Have you forgotten?"

As he spoke, I managed to see something in Yoo Joonghyuk's hand. It was
a paper wrapped with a hot and sweet smell coming from it.
…Dumpling? Yoo Joonghyuk ate the dumpling with an unapologetic face
and continued talking, "There are three hidden pieces that can be found in
the First Murim at this time. The Annihilation Emperor's martial arts book,
the Black Demon Spirit's Black Heavenly Demon Sword and the Blood
Demon School's Demon Spirit Bead."

The merchant cut in after Yoo Joonghyuk's words.

"Hahaha! The Annihilation Emperor's martial arts book and the Black
Demon Spirit's Black Heavenly Demon Sword? The Blood Demon School's
Demon Spirit Bead? There is still someone searching for such things…!"

"…"

"Wake up! They are literally legends! They completely disappeared during
the old days of Murim!"

Yoo Joonghyuk didn't bat an eyelid despite the merchant's laughter. It was
because Yoo Joonghyuk knew they really existed. He even knew how to
obtain a few of them. He shamelessly mentioned it in front of other people
because he knew they wouldn't believe him anyway.

I replied to his words, "The Blood Demon School's Demon Spirit Bead has
a low utility even if obtained. You might be able to absorb it but if I or the
other party members eat it incorrectly, qigong deviation is likely to occur."

Yoo Joonghyuk made the expression that I wanted. On the other hand, the
merchant's expression was embarrassed as he heard us calmly discussing
legends. I continued talking, "The Annihilation Emperor's martial arts
book is very difficult to obtain. You can get it but you can't stay there for
long." "I see."

"Finally, the Black Demon Spirit's Black Heavenly Demon Sword… maybe
you are trying to obtain it because your sword is broken but have you
forgotten that there is a weapon that is easier to obtain with a similar
performance?"
Yoo Joonghyuk's complexion changed at my words. He noticed what I was
trying to say. "…Do you really intend to go there?"

"Yes. This time, the power of the Breaking the Sky Sword Saint is
essential."

"I'm not going."

"Do what you want. However, can you guide me to the school?"

Yoo Joonghyuk made a grim expression and the merchant interjected again.
"Are you going to find the Breaking the Sky Sword Saint?"

"That's right."

"Hah…" The merchant watched us with a slightly weary expression. Then
he shook his head and withdrew his products. "That's it. Give that to me. I
won't sell them to you."
Han Myungoh, who was listening earnestly to the Ice Flower Goddess, was
embarrassed as the earphones were suddenly pulled out. The merchant
smiled at Han Myungoh. "I'm surprised that there are still friends who want
to stick to the old ways. It isn't too bad to feel the change of the times in
person. Good luck with your hard work."

The merchant spoke unknown words and dragged his stall to another place
to solicit customers. I stared at the merchant's back for a moment. Han
Myungoh asked, "…What the hell does that mean?"

"Department Head, you said that you like Murim novels?"

"Huh? Well, that's right."

"Then it'll be great. The person we are visiting now is the only one in
'Murim' who adheres to the old training methods."

I said this while chasing after Yoo Joonghyuk walking ahead of me. Was it
because he came to the First Murim after a long time? Yoo Joonghyuk had
a nostalgic look on his face as he looked at the surroundings with distant
eyes.

The streets gradually grew quiet. The buzzing of the marketplaces died
away and there was the faint smell of animal feces.

How long did we walk? Yoo Joonghyuk's footsteps finally stopped. It was
in front of a shabby residence that couldn't be compared to those on the
busy streets. There was a small hut in the center of the grounds. I read the
small nameplate set up in front of the hut.

[Breaking the Sky Sword School.] –

Recruiting disciples at all times.

This was where the Breaking the Sky Sword Saint lived.
"It is up to here for me." Yoo Joonghyuk spoke these words and climbed up
a cherry tree nearby.

He really didn't want to meet the Breaking the Sky Sword Saint.

Han Myungoh spoke in a suspicious tone, "Something so

shabby…" "Originally Murim masters stay in shabby places," I

replied.

Jang Hayoung asked with an expectant expression, "Is there someone here
who gave me the martial arts technique?"

Come to think of it, Jang Hayoung had received the Breaking the Sky
Sword's Immortal Body through the wall. Someone had taught it to him but
I didn't know how it was possible. Even Yoo Joonghyuk had struggled to
learn it…

"Breaking the Sky Sword Saint, are you here?" I knocked on the door.
"Breaking the Sky Sword Saint! I need your help!"

There was no answer from the Breaking the Sky Sword Saint to my loud
shouts. However, I couldn't go back just because there was no answer. I
shouted brazenly and opened the door. "I will take this as signal to enter!"
There was a creak as the door opened and revealed the interior. The interior
of the residence was better than I thought. There weren't any signs of a
person living there. Instead, an unexpected existence was waiting for us.

Jang Hayoung cried out happily, "Aw, there is a dog?"

A dog was lying on the floor and staring at us. It was a medium-sized dog
dressed in a dark blue uniform with its tongue stretched out.

Han Myungoh nervously stuck to my side. "Is that the Breaking the Sky
Sword Saint?"
"No."

I gazed at the panting dog and recalled the contents from Ways of Survival.

「 Black coloured fur with reddish brown eyes. The watchdog lay down in
a manner that was as elegant as a person. 」 There was no doubt.

"This dog is a disciple of the Breaking the Sky Sword Saint."

"…Disciple?"

"If I remember correctly, he is called the Breaking the Sky Master."

Han Myungoh asked with an absurd expression. "No, why is a dog a
disciple?"

"It happens when people are worse than dogs. In the first place, the idea
that people are better than dogs is a human ideal." I read the curious air
around the dog.

[The exclusive skill, 'Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint' has been activated!]

Old folktales gathered and became stories. Fragments of folktales in the
area became an original story told to me.

[The story 'Dog who Grows Up at a Village School for 3 Years can Recite
Poetry' in in effect.]

For example, what if a dog accompanied the strongest person in Murim for
a long time? What if the dog started to follow the master's actions one day?
He followed and copied for 10 years, 20 years, 30 years… and finally, 100
years passed.

Jang Hayoung murmured with astonishment. "W-What is this…?!"
The dog stood up on two legs and looked at us like he was a human. He had
strange eyes that couldn't be read at all. I couldn't sense any hostility from
him but it was difficult to see him as benevolent. Han Myungoh frowned at
the strange sight. "I don't think this is a welcome greeting. I will deal with
him."

"…Department Head?"

"I'm also a demon earl. Don't look down on me."

An earl-grade demon certainly wasn't weak. An earl should at least have a
decent story.

"Haaap!"

Han Myungoh ran forward and confidently revealed his story. I wasn't sure
about the exact identity of the story but he had picked up a few
historicalgrade stories and were using them. He was still a member of
Asmodeus' household so if I checked Han Myungoh's skills…

"Kuaaack!"

Before I could finish the thought, Han Myungoh's body flew through the air
with a loud sound.

[The character 'Breaking the Sky Master' has used Hundred Steps Godly
Fists Lv. 10!]

[The character 'Breaking the Sky Master' has used Red Phoenix Shunpo Lv.
10!]

…Oh my god. The dog blew Han Myungoh out of the house and rushed
towards Jang Hayoung. I reflexively pushed Jang Hayoung and activated
Bookmark.

[The exclusive skill 'Way of the Wind Lv. 10 (+1) is activated!]
The momentary wind sensation made the dog's movements look dull. I
pulled Jang Hayoung and moved along the path created by the wind,
avoiding the dog's paw. There was a fearsome power in the dog's paws as
sparks occurred. Who could believe that a lowly looking dog was using the
power of the Breaking the Sky?

"Wait a minute! We have no intention of fighting!"

Then the dog picked up a piece of paper that was rolling around.

–Recruiting disciples at all times.

I finally realized what was happening.

"…Shit. It is the disciples' recruitment period."

If I remembered correctly, there were quite a few people yearning for the
old Murim who visited the Breaking the Sky Sword Saint. Most of them
weren't even able to enroll because of this dog.

「 "I won't accept any person as a disciple if they aren't as good as a dog."
」

In other words, the dog… the Breaking the Sky Master was the checkpoint
to enter the Breaking the Sky Sword School.

The dog was stimulated by my movements and growled. Faint sparks
appeared around the dog.

The startled Jang Hayoung asked, "W-What is this? Is that really a dog?"

I was also surprised. Based on the way the sparks were turning yellow,
there was no doubt. This was 'transcendence stage one'. I never thought the
Breaking the Sky Master would be this strong, dammit.
I could deal with him if I revealed my power but my body hadn't recovered
yet. I also couldn't excessively use my stories to deal with the dog. In the
end, there was only one method.

"Yoo Joonghyuk! Help me just once!"

Yoo Joonghyuk was quiet. This jerk wasn't responding?

"I'll help you find the Blood Demon School's Demon Spirit Bead if you
deal with this guy!"

Yoo Joonghyuk still didn't respond. Then the dog moved. It was so fast that
I couldn't avoid it using Way of the Wind. It happened when I was going to
invoke Electrification. Yoo Joonghyuk appeared in front of me and used the
Heavenly Sword of Gathering Clouds to block the dog's paws.

"The Demon Spirit Bead is still insufficient. Add the Black Demon
Spirit's Black Heavenly Demon Sword as well." Shit. this stingy person.

"…I understand. Just take care of the dog."

Yoo Joonghyuk lightly shook his sword to shake off the dog and took a
kendo position with an arrogant expression. Yellow sparks started to flow
around Yoo Joonghyuk's body. As expected, Yoo Joonghyuk also passed
transcendence stage one. Originally, it shouldn't be possible for him at this
point in time.

The Breaking the Sky Master was tense when the same power appeared.
The confrontation between man and dog was filled with unbelievable
tension.

A formidable magic power started to encroach on the surroundings. In the
original work, Yoo Joonghyuk had also competed with the Breaking the
Sky Master.

「 The Breaking the Sky Sword Saint has two disciples. 」
It was the first time he came to the Breaking the Sky Sword Saint to learn
swordsmanship.

「 One is Breaking the Sky Master, the dog raised by the Breaking the Sky
Sword Saint. 」

He probably lost at that time.

「 The second is Supreme King Yoo Joonghyuk. 」

Now it would be different.
     Chapter 232: Ep. 43 - Breaking the Sky Sword Saint, VI


The Breaking the Sky Master was strong. It sounded ridiculous but there
were probably no dogs in the Star Stream stronger than the Breaking the
Sky Master. Of course, there were few people stronger than the Breaking
the Sky Master.

Yoo Joonghyuk and the Breaking the Sky Master collided. The sparks from
transcendence stage one hit each other and the landscape started to distort.

The path that transcendents walked caused interference. They were
existences who reached transcendence by walking on only one path. Thus,
battles between transcendents was always a continuation of denying each
other.

Your path is wrong, my path is right.

Through such denials, the transcendents became stronger, harder and
broken at the end. As the presence of the transcendents dominated the area,
Yoo Joonghyuk's thoughts flowed into my mind.
「 It's been a while, apprentice. 」

Anyone who heard it would laugh. He was calling a dog, not a human, his
apprentice. However, Yoo Joonghyuk didn't laugh.

The expression that faded away hit at his heart. The memories that had been
suppressed because he didn't have time to dwell on the past were released.
Yoo Joonghyuk encountered the Breaking the Sky Sword Saint and learnt
martial arts with the Breaking the Sky Master in his second round.

「 In this place, Yoo Joonghyuk learnt a bit about human feelings. 」

Here, Yoo Joonghyuk learnt, trained and lived with his non-human master
and non-human fellow apprentice. If there was a bit of warmth left inside
Yoo Joonghyuk right now, it was probably from the First Murim training.
Likewise, the First Murim was probably the cause that deprived him of the
warmth of humanity.

「 …I didn't want to see you again. 」

The strongest dog Breaking the Sky Master and the Breaking the Sky
Sword Saint died fighting against the returnees alliance.

Yoo Joonghyuk moved. The paws of the dog collided with the Heavenly
Sword of Gathering Clouds. The footsteps of the Red Phoenix Shunpo that
reached another state of polarity tangled together. The sparks in the air
became more intense as the number of encounters between the dog's front
paws and Yoo Joonghyuk's sword shot up. Not long afterwards, the energy
started to decline little by little.

As expected, a main character was a main character.

The story of the dog that grew up following the Breaking the Sky Sword
Saint couldn't stand against the story of a man who lived to prevent the
destruction of the world. The time of Yoo Joonghyuk, who lived a lonely
life looking only at the scenarios, was found in every swing of the sword.
「 I won't look. 」

Yoo Joonghyuk's time didn't contain any mourning because he would have
to suffer through the same time again anyway.

Fight, fight again and keep moving forward. It was the best mourning
possible for this guy's past.

The Breaking the Sky Master was unable to tolerate the weight of the sword
and moaned. Yoo Joonghyuk's offensive became faster. The
swordsmanship became more persistent and he dug into the weak points in
a ruthless manner.

Jang Hayoung was blankly gaping from beside me. "…Wow, this is real."

It was probably the first time he had seen this type of battle. It was a great
battle but it was too early to feel admiration. This was just passing
entertainment when considering the fights ahead.

In the end, the Breaking the Sky Master was pushed back in the power
struggle and whined. Yoo Joonghyuk didn't miss this opening. Yoo
Joonghyuk's successive strikes overpowered the Breaking the Sky Master's
paws and he narrowed the gap. Rough breathing emerged from the dog's
mouth. Then Yoo Joonghyuk's final blow pierced the Breaking the Sky
Master's waist.

…To be precise, it was about to pierce it.

An eerie sensation suddenly went down my spine. Someone was standing
behind me.

…When did this existence stand behind me?

[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' is surprised.]

[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' is curious.]
[A a few constellations are wary of the energy they can feel.]

"The sky is noisy today. What spectacle can I see?" The owner of the voice
stood there in a leisurely manner, like she had been drinking.

Her body was much bigger than Yoo Joonghyuk. The tall woman who was
around three meters tall passed by me and gave off a colossal pressure. It
was so obvious that no one had to ask.

The presence in front of me caused my heart to throb. She was one of the
strongest transcendents in Ways of Survival, the Breaking the Sky Sword
Saint.

An ether storm moved through the air and Yoo Joonghyuk's Heavenly
Sword of Gathering Clouds froze.

"Are you beating a dumb dog like this? You are a man without any
principles."

The Heavenly Sword of Gathering Clouds was trembling. The Breaking the
Sky Sword Saint's two fingers held Yoo Joonghyuk's sword like it was a
toy.

Woof woof!

The Breaking the Sky Master lay on the floor and stretched out his tongue
again.

On the other hand, Yoo Joonghyuk had thrown away the Heavenly Sword
of Gathering Clouds and activated Red Phoenix Shunpo to leave the place.
It was the fastest I had ever seen Yoo Joonghyuk move. An interested smile
appeared as the Breaking the Sky Sword Saint watched Yoo Joonghyuk
running away.

"You are a quick guy. I should grab him last… let's see."
The Breaking the Sky Sword Saint's nonchalant gaze moved over our party.
The moment I met her eyes, the Breaking the Sky Sword Saint appeared in
front of me. Her speed was enough to make me sweat. I couldn't be faster
even if I used Electrification.

"First of all, there is one guy whose appearance is unclear."

She just grabbed my chin but my vision shook. I staggered while the
Breaking the Sky Sword Saint was already holding the chin of Jang
Hayoung beside me.

"Kuek…?"

"Oh, this is my type? You pass."

The Breaking the Sky Sword Saint's movements left only afterimages. This
must be the Movement Transposition I had only heard about. Suddenly, the
Breaking the Sky Sword Saint was poking the fallen Han Myungoh in the
face with a branch.

"…You look like a monster species. Will I get something if I kill you?"

"…W-What?!"

"For the moment, you have the death sentence."

Han Myungoh from unconscious after being struck by the branch and the
figure of the Breaking the Sky Sword Saint disappeared into the forest.
There was the sound of condensed air bursting and a great explosion in the
distance. After a while, the Breaking the Sky Sword Saint came back with a
big gust of wind.

"Phew, he was pretty fast. First, his face is qualified…"
Yoo Joonghyuk had bruises all over his face and was caught in the grasp of
the Breaking the Sky Sword Saint. Yoo Joonghyuk's body was damaged but
he was still using the Red Phoenix Shunpo in such a situation.

Nevertheless, Yoo Joonghyuk's feet only hit empty air. It was because the
Breaking the Sky Sword's huge hand was carrying Yoo Joonghyuk on her
back.
I knew why Yoo Joonghyuk was reluctant to meet the Breaking the Sky
Sword Saint. Thinking about it with common sense, there were many
dangers when encountering the Breaking the Sky Sword Saint at this point.

Yoo Joonghyuk had learned how to use the sword from the Breaking the
Sky Sword Saint in the second round. The Breaking the Sky Sword Saint of
the third round didn't know Yoo Joonghyuk at all.

"…How do you know my techniques?"

Yoo Joonghyuk didn't answer. Instead, he glared at me with eyes that
contained great resentment.

「 Kim Dokja! Do something! Quickly! 」

For reference, the 18th regression Yoo Joonghyuk was killed by the
Breaking the Sky Sword Saint.

It was the end of the guy who used to say he surpassed his teacher by
becoming a transcendent early.

I decided to cut to the chase. "Breaking the Sky Sword Saint, we are
gathering transcendents to fight against the nebulae."

"…Hrmm, is that so?"

"I need your help."

The Breaking the Sky Sword Saint stared at me like I was an unusual toy.
Then she rummaged around and pulled out a huge smoking pipe. Tobacco
smoke rose. The Breaking the Sky Sword Saint stared at me before
suddenly blowing the smoke towards me.
"You are mistaken about something. I'm not a volunteer. Get lost if you
haven't come to be my disciple."

The fine particles of smoke contained the Breaking the Sky Sword Saint's
mysterious magic power.

The smoke surrounded me. There was no doubt that it would strike at me
the moment I spoke nonsense. Of course, I had to speak nonsense.

"Do you really need disciples?"

"…What?"

"In fact, you're not expecting too much."

The tobacco smoke surged like a wave. I continued to speak like I was
provoking her. "Maybe you will be the last master of the Breaking the Sky
Sword School. It is because Murim will soon be destroyed."

At this point, curiosity filled the Breaking the Sky Sword Saint's eyes. She
frowned as she looked between me and Yoo Joonghyuk held in her arms.

"It is an interesting story."

"Do you want to hear it?"

"It is interesting but I'll hear it a bit later. First, I need to look at this guy in
my hands."

The Breaking the Sky Sword placed Yoo Joonghyuk on her shoulder and
walked into the house while hitting his butt with the smoking pipe. Yoo
Joonghyuk's bloody cry echoed in my head.

「 Kim Dokja!! 」
"Treat these people like friends."

Woof woof!

The tobacco smoke quickly filled the area around the hut as the Breaking
the Sky Sword Saint disappeared into it with Yoo Joonghyuk. It was a type
of disappearance spell that surrounded the hut. I would only be lost in the
smoke if I chased after them.

Jang Hayoung seemed anxious. "I-Is it okay to leave him? Will he die?"

"He will be okay… probably."

It was regrettable that the Breaking the Sky Sword Saint didn't listen to my
story first but it wasn't the worst situation. It wouldn't be bad to give the
two of them time. I hoped she would tease Yoo Joonghyuk properly.

"Shall we sit back and relax?"

Jang Hayoung and I lay down after helping Han Myungoh. Then something
touched my legs.

I turned around and saw the Breaking the Sky Master holding a bowl of
dumplings.

…I think this was what Yoo Joonghyuk bought. Great, I happened to be
hungry. The Breaking the Sky Master looked up at me with glib eyes and
barked.

Woof woof!

「 Eat. 」

It was polite enough to impress me. I picked up a dumpling in a slightly
embarrassed manner and the drooling Breaking the Sky Master's head
followed the dumpling. He was a really patient dog.
"Do you want to eat one?" I asked as I split one dumpling in half.

Woof woof!

「 You are a good person. 」

The Breaking the Sky Master smiled and sat down beside me. He stretched
out his feet like a human and blew on the dumpling. I spoke towards the
dog, "This place is very quiet." Woof woof!

「 It has been a long time since a disciple came. 」

A few steps away, Jang Hayoung was looking at me like I was a madman. I
smiled at him and placed a finger to my lips as a sign to keep quiet. The
Breaking the Sky Master once again barked.

Woof woof!

「 It wasn't like this in the old days. 」

The Breaking the Sky Master licked the dumpling skin with a foolish
expression while looking outside the fence. I followed his gaze and saw the
scenery beyond the broken fence.

It was the path we had walked. My eyes could only see spider webs and
dust but the Breaking the Sky Master who spent 100 years here probably
saw a different landscape. I could roughly guess the landscape.

Woof woof!

「 There were many martial arts halls. 」

Woof woof!

「 There were many disciples. 」
This was originally a 'martial arts hall' street. It was a street where young
people filled with chivalry practiced martial arts. They were passionate and
able to devote themselves for years or decades to become masters.

「 They sweated, tried hard and were rewarded. 」

However, now there was nobody here. I didn't need to ask why. The
countless sights I saw here showed me the reason for the decline of this
street. It was lonely.

「 Now nobody wants to learn martial arts using the old ways. 」

"Indeed."

I knew why this was happening in Murim but it was a natural consequence.
Those who were once grand masters in Murim fell to the constellations
using the system and those who practiced martial arts for decades were
defeated by the incarnations who gave coins and learnt skills in only five
minutes.

「 That's why I'm happy you came. 」

…It seemed to be a misunderstanding since I didn't intend to learn any
martial arts here. I told him so. "Um… The old ways aren't always great. It
is good if people can easily become stronger."

「 What do you mean?! An easy thing is unconditionally bad! Everything
that the dokkaebis and constellations brought are bad! 」

Perhaps a dog who learnt martial arts for 100 years would develop the
watchdog philosophy

"I know you don't like the dokkaebis and constellations but the old ways
aren't always right. The old Murim wasn't very fair either."
「 In the old days, people could become a master if they put in effort!

」 I just laughed. "Do you really think so?"

I knew what the Breaking the Sky Master wanted to say. I also knew that it
had some value. However, I couldn't agree with this idea. If I left it like
this, the Breaking the Sky Master and Breaking the Sky Sword Saint would
be buried in the flow of the era and meet the ending of the original novel. I
didn't want to let it happen in the third round.

At this moment, the expression of the Breaking the Sky Master changed. I
thought he was angry at me but it wasn't something that good. It was due to
a dangerous aura felt outside the grounds. Someone was coming this way.

[ Breaking the Sky Sword Saint. Give up your techniques.]

The gate opened and a few dokkaebis appeared. I thought it was
approximately the time for them to appear but they were already here. The
Breaking the Sky Master raised his magic power and barked.

The dokkaebis told him, [The nearby martial arts halls have already sold all
their techniques! How long will you defend your old martial arts? I told you
that you will miss the timing if you keep being stubborn. How long will we
keep offering to buy it for an expensive price…]

By the way, the appearance of one dokkaebi was very familiar. The eyes of
the dokkaebi shook greatly when he saw me.

[You…?]
                   Chapter 233: Ep. 44 - Swindler, I


Yoo Joonghyuk's master, the Breaking the Sky Sword Saint was very
patient. It was the same 100 years ago and even 200 years ago. That's how
she was able to make a group of sword techniques. As other martial artists
sold their skills and left Murim, she stayed here alone and broke through
transcendent heights.

"So who the hell are you?"

Her big finger poked Yoo Joonghyuk's cheek as he hung in the air. It was
just a finger but it was the finger of a transcendent. Thus, there was no way
it couldn't hurt. Nevertheless, Yoo Joonghyuk didn't react.

「 "The teacher and disciple. The two of you are the same." 」

They were the words spoken by one of the Murim's 10 Grand Masters, the
Heavenly Demon. Perhaps the Heavenly Demon saw them accurately.

"You aren't saying a word. You will be spanked if you don't talk."
The Breaking the Sky Sword Saint raised the large smoking pipe. Yoo
Joonghyuk's butt couldn't endure the pressure and he couldn't help letting
out a pathetic sound.

'Damn Kim Dokja. I will surely kill you'.

Slap! Slap! Slap!

The sounds were like jokes but the power contained in the pipe wasn't a
joke. Before long, blood trickled from Yoo Joonghyuk's mouth. Then the
Breaking the Sky Sword Saint's eyebrows formed a strange curve. "You are
a man of character."

She was a bit impressed. "I will ask you again. Where did you steal and
learn the power of the Breaking the Sky Sword School?"

"…"

"I will spare your life if you tell me honestly."

Yoo Joonghyuk slowly raised his head at these words.

The Breaking the Sky Sword School was originally a non-humanistic
organization. As an outsider, Yoo Joonghyuk couldn't have learnt it.

Now the Breaking the Sky Sword Saint said she would spare him. Her
meaning was clear. The Breaking the Sky Sword Saint was currently trying
to take Yoo Joonghyuk as a disciple.

'Teacher'.

Yoo Joonghyuk understood his teacher's mind better than anyone. It was
hard to find a proper disciple in the declining Murim. Then a transcendent
person who learnt her martial arts suddenly showed up. It was natural to be
interested.

'But…'
Yoo Joonghyuk bit his lip. Maybe it wasn't bad to move according to Kim
Dokja's intentions. He knew the Breaking the Sky Sword Saint better than
anyone. If he took the chance and told her the story, he would surely find
himself in the Breaking the Sky Sword Saint's good graces. However, Yoo
Joonghyuk didn't want to do that.

"Hrmm, it is a fiery gaze."

"…"

"Do you desire me?"

Talking such bullshit in the middle of this situation, it was certainly his
teacher. Yoo Joonghyuk kept biting his lip.

'You will die if you meet me here'.

Yoo Joonghyuk remembered his teacher's last appearance. A transcendent
wounded alone after years of hard work. No matter what, her stubbornness
refused to be broken.

–Dumb disciple. They are existences that you can deal with.

His teacher fought alone against the returnees alliance after being turned
down by the strongest in Murim, the Heavenly Demon and Blood Demon.

–Live, Joonghyuk.

At the time, Yoo Joonghyuk hadn't fought with her because he was weak.
He was too weak.

"…Your eyes are sad."

Yoo Joonghyuk trembled at the sudden words. The clear eyes of the
Breaking the Sky Sword Saint faced Yoo Joonghyuk. The Breaking the Sky
Sword Saint was a mixture of a human and giant god. Thus, she had one of
the abilities of the Neanderthals.
"Lonely, arrogant, deeply wounded."

She had the Mirror Eyes that could read the emotions of others. The
Breaking the Sky Sword Saint was staring at Yoo Joonghyuk with these
eyes.

"Who are you?"

Yoo Joonghyuk harshly bit his lips like he was digging up his agony. He
shouldn't say it. Never, he absolutely couldn't say it…

[The constellation 'Demon King of Salvation' is looking at you.]

Yoo Joonghyuk looked up at the message.

[The constellation 'Demon King of Salvation' says it will be okay.]

…It would be okay?

[The constellation 'Demon King of Salvation' says this round will be
different.]

[The constellation 'Demon King of Salvation' is telling you to trust your
teacher.]

This round would be different. He wouldn't have believed it if it was
spoken by someone else. Then why? He wanted to believe what this person
was saying.

[The constellation 'Demon King of Salvation'…]

"This fly… shut up."

The Breaking the Sky Sword Saint flicked her fingers at the air and all the
sound in the area disappeared completely. All outside sound was cut off
with magic power. It was possible for a transcendent at the Breaking the
Sky Sword Saint's level. Kim Dokja's voice wouldn't be heard for a while as
long as the dokkaebis didn't adjust the channel frequency. From now on, it
would be left to Yoo Joonghyuk's own judgment.

"…My name is Yoo Joonghyuk." Yoo Joonghyuk took a small breath
before releasing it. "I was your disciple."

"Hrmm… what does that mean? I have never seen you before. I naturally
have no memories of taking you as a disciple."

"It is literally what I said. I learnt the techniques from…"

The moment Yoo Joonghyuk was about to speak, sparks flew around his
body.

[The story 'Disciple of Breaking the Sky Sword Saint' is activated.]

Yoo Joonghyuk's lips twisted as the ending of his words were forcefully
changed to a honorific.

"…Teacher."

Yoo Joonghyuk's expression distorted. He recalled the conversation he had
with the Breaking the Sky Sword Saint in the last round.

–You said that you are a regressor. If so, we might meet again someday.

–I won't become your disciple next time.

–This angry fellow. You should say sweet words… and why aren't you
adding honorifics? Do you want to caught in your next life?

Perhaps this story remained because of his previous conversation with the
Breaking the Sky Sword Saint.

[You have to use honorifics for the incarnation 'Breaking the Sky Sword
Saint'.]
It was funny. He hadn't been formal with the Breaking the Sky Sword Saint
at the time yet this story remained with him.

–At that time, become my disciple again.

His heart throbbed as old memories poured out like a waterfall and knocked
on his heart. He couldn't hear the indirect messages but he felt Kim Dokja
looking this way.

'Companion'.

Yoo Joonghyuk had long forgotten what it felt like to believe in someone.
He slowly blinked before opening his mouth. "Aren't you wondering about
who I am?"

"Of course, I am terribly curious."

"Then I will open my mental barrier. Take a peek. It is possible with your
Mirror Eyes."

"…Hrmm. You know about the Mirror Eyes?"

"Just five minutes. I can't give you any more time than that."

The Breaking the Sky Sword Saint's eyes were tinged with suspicion. "Are
you planning to use a strange trick?"

"You can subdue me even if I used a trick."

The Breaking the Sky Sword Saint's eyebrows raised at the provocative
tone. "Okay."

It wasn't just the constellations who loved stories. There weren't many
chances to peek at another transcendental existence. This transcendent
suddenly appeared in Murim and used the same techniques as her. There
was no way she wasn't curious.
"I will look at you."

Soon after, the Breaking the Sky Sword Saint's Mirror Eyes shone. Yoo
Joonghyuk felt like his hair was being pulled out.

A memory transfer through the Mirror Eyes was dangerous for Yoo
Joonghyuk and the Breaking the Sky Sword Saint. Nevertheless, Yoo
Joonghyuk was committed. Perhaps the spirit of the Breaking the Sky
Sword Saint would be broken. She might not believe what she saw. She
could deny everything and erased Yoo Joonghyuk. However, if this gamble
succeeded, he might be able to change the Breaking the Sky Sword Saint.

A dozen minutes passed until the clear energy of the Mirror Eyes in the
area disappeared. The light of the Mirror Eyes was turned off but the
Breaking the Sky Sword Saint didn't talk. She just stared at the floor with a
lowered head. Had she gone crazy? Or…

There was an unknown emotion in the Breaking the Sky Sword Saint's eyes
as she raised her head. It was the first time he had seen this expression in
the third round.

A moment passed before Yoo Joonghyuk realized the meaning of the
expression.

"You said you wouldn't be my disciple again…"




Yoo Joonghyuk and the Breaking the Sky Sword Saint talked for a long
time.

"You've worked hard."

"…Stop with the flimsy comforting. It doesn't match you."
"Okay. You are unmistakable my disciple."

The Breaking the Sky Sword Saint of the second round regression had died
and would never return again. The current Breaking the Sky Sword Saint
wasn't the same as the Breaking the Sky Sword Saint of the second round.
Even so, the two people spoke like they weren't conscious of this fact.

"…I got revenge. The Heavenly Demon and Blood Demon, I beat them
both in the 35th scenario."

"Yes. I saw. I'm not satisfied since you found it hard to win."

"Then you shouldn't have died."

It wasn't a normal conversation between a teacher and student but there was
a gentle smile on the Breaking the Sky Sword Saint's face. "You've changed
a lot, Joonghyuk."

"Nothing has changed."

The Breaking the Sky Sword Saint flicked her finger at the answer. Then a
portion of the barrier around the hut distorted and a panel reminiscent of a
large telescope lens popped up. On the small panel, the outside scenery was
shining.

"Is it due to that child that you came to see me?"

It was Kim Dokja talking to the dog while eating dumplings. Yoo
Joonghyuk watched the scene and opened his mouth.

"Is he your new friend?"

"There is no such thing as friend. This person is just…"

"He is already brave enough to think about fighting against the nebulae."

"…"
"Do you think he can do it?"

As the first friend of her blunt disciple, the Breaking the Sky Sword Saint
looked closely at Kim Dokja's face. Then the barrier shook and a loud voice
was heard.

[ Breaking the Sky Sword Saint. Give up your techniques.]

The surprised Yoo Joonghyuk rose from his seat.


"…The dokkaebis." The Breaking the Sky Sword Saint spoke like she was
tired of this. "The techniques buyers came again."

"…It is faster than planned. How long has it been?"

"A while. I'm the only one left around here."

Martial arts were valuable in Murim. It was because they were all types of
stories made up of history. The deeper the origin, the greater the value. The
dokkaebis were well aware of this and coveted the Breaking the Sky Sword
Saint's techniques.

Yoo Joonghyuk pulled out the Heavenly Sword of Gathering Clouds and
opened his mouth. "Kim Dokja and I will handle it."

"The opponents are dokkaebis. You can't do anything."

"It is possible for Kim Dokja."

Instead of answering his teacher's question, Yoo Joonghyuk watched the
dokkaebis on the panel. One of the dokkaebis looked familiar.

'It is that guy from Seoul Dome'.

Kim Dokja probably wouldn't let him go. Then Kim Dokja's voice came
from the screen.
–I didn't know you were still alive. Didn't you go to be punished?

As expected, Kim Dokja's characteristic 'messing around with people' had
started. Kim Dokja scratched his chin and spoke to the dokkaebis like it
was interesting.

–Hmm, yes. Did you come to buy the Breaking the Sky Sword Saint's
techniques?

Yoo Joonghyuk shrugged at his teacher. Kim Dokja would've sorted it even
without Yoo Joonghyuk coming out. He didn't know what Kim Dokja was
trying to do but Kim Dokja was going to do another weird trick to deal a
proper blow to the dokkaebis.

The next moment, Kim Dokja said something strange with an unexpected
smile.

–Okay, I'll sell it, the techniques of the Breaking the Sky Sword Saint.
                  Chapter 234: Ep. 44 - Swindler, II


[You… perhaps at that time…]

I saw the trembling expression of the dokkaebis and remembered some bad
memories. Biyoo floating beside me was also frowning. It was natural for
her to be furious. This was a dokkaebi behind the tragedy of the 41st Shin
Yoosung 'disaster'. His name… was it Paul?

I thought he would go to purgatory and be severely punished…

The bureau's punishment was like hitting cotton. What type of punishment
was joining the Murim Redevelopment Team?

"You've lost a lot of weight in your face while I haven't seen you?"

[Uhh, kuooooh…!]

"You were an intermediate dokkaebi back then. Now you are…
lessergrade?"
[You! You…!]

I saw his agitation and felt like asking for the 'solo meeting rights' to beat
him up again. The story of this guy being beaten up, was the wenny person
reading it well?

[Stop and back off, Paul.]

Another dokkaebi moved forward on behalf of Paul who was unable to
speak.

[Are you Kim Dokja?]

I looked closer and this dokkaebi was also familiar. I had heard this voice
somewhere before. Eh? Wait… this guy?

"Uh, was that you? The person working under Bihyung… The name…"

[Youngki. Indeed! You are Kim Dokja!]

The dokkaebi happily greeted me. I dimly remembered. He was the
dokkaebi responsible for the sub-channels under Bihyung.

[I heard rumours that you were alive. I didn't expect to see you at a place
like this…!]

"Is Bihyung doing well?"

[He was visibly gloomy after you disappeared.]

I felt a little sorry that Bihyung had become depressed. That guy Bihyung
must've liked me. "Haven't you cleaned up well? You previously didn't
even know how to update the scenario."

[Ahaha. That is a shameful story. I am now an intermediate dokkaebi.]
He was an intermediate dokkaebi. This guy was part of the Korean
Peninsula scenario so Bihyung must've received a high-speed promotion. It
felt like a lot of time had passed but it had been less than one year.

[By the way, Dokja. What do you mean by selling the skills?]

Youngki watched me with calm eyes. No matter what, a dokkaebi was a
dokkaebi. I couldn't take it easy.

"I meant it literally. I will persuade the Breaking the Sky Sword Saint to
sell you the skills."

[How will Dokja…]

"I have my ways. What skills do you need? The Red Phoenix Shunpo? Or
the Hundred Steps Godly Fists?"

[We already have the Hundred Steps Godly Fists. What we need is…]

"The Breaking the Sky Swordsmanship?"

Youngki nodded at my words. It was as I thought. The Breaking the Sky
Swordsmanship. It was the name given to the Breaking the Sky Sword
Saint's Breaking the Sky. One of the top-ranked skills in the First Murim
that anyone would covet was Yoo Joonghyuk's Breaking the Sky
Swordmanship.

I felt the Breaking the Sky Master growling by my side and quickly agreed.
"Okay. I'll sell it. No, I won't sell it. I'll give it to you."

The Breaking the Sky Master looked up at me with absurd eyes. Youngki
was astonished.

[R-Really?]

"Instead, do me two favours in exchange. The first one, place the Breaking
the Sky Swordsmanship as the prize for the scenario you will soon open."
[Huh?]

I smiled at Youngki's stupid expression. Did he think I would just give him
the Breaking the Sky Swordsmanship?

"Aren't you going to open the 'Martial Arts Competition' scenario soon?
The
Black Heavenly Demon Sword is included in it."

[H-How do you know…!]

"Why are you so startled? You always do this. It is a regular scenario for
Murim. A precious sword of Murim will appear and a huge crowd of
people will fight for it."

[That is true but… how do you know about the Black Heavenly Demon
Sword?]

How did I know? The Martial Arts Competition was an event scenario that
Yoo Joonghyuk repeatedly participated in when he came to First Murim. I
didn't know how many times I made a comment telling the author to skip
the competition.

"It doesn't matter how I know. In any case, add the Breaking the Sky
Swordmanship as a prize. Give it as the first place prize."

Youngki's eyes rolled quickly. It was probably a great suggestion for him.
There were a limited number of things that the dokkaebis could do with the
techniques bought from the Breaking the Sky Sword Saint. They could
secure additional subscriptions by adding it to a large scenario or sell it at a
high price through the Dokkaebi Bag. Youngki was currently figuring out
which one would be more profitable.

[Okay. I have nothing to lose if I do this. It will be saving on the cost of
buying the technique. Only…]
"Only?"

[You said two favours. What is the second one?]

I laughed softly at the prudence. He had become pretty clever since
reaching intermediate level. "The second condition is simple. I want
everyone here to participate in the Martial Arts Competition scenario."

[Everyone here…?]

Youngki's eyes narrowed. He finally figured out my ploy.

[It is an interesting suggestion but… it is difficult.]

"Why?"

[I don't know about the other incarnations but it can't be the Breaking the
Sky Sword Saint.]

I thought he would say this. The Breaking the Sky Sword Saint was likely
to win if she participated in the martial arts competition. The participants of
the martial arts competition would naturally be reduced and the dokkaebis
would suffer losses. I acted like I was yielding a big thing. "Then everyone
apart from the Breaking the Sky Sword Saint."

[Then it's fine. The martial arts competition is in two weeks. Until then,
please prepare the skills of the Breaking the Sky Sword Saint.]

I responded to the waiting Youngki. "I understand. Don't forget to properly
invite us to the scenario."

[Of course. Then I'll see you again soon.]

"Give my regards to Bihyung."

[Haha, understood.]
Maybe he was glad that things went well. Youngki laughed joyfully as he
disappeared. The dokkaebis that followed him also started to leave. Paul
was staring at me the whole time and I glared as hard as I could.

After a while, the dokkaebis disappeared and Jang Hayoung standing next
to me grabbed my collar. "Hey, what the hell did you do just now? Sell the
techniques? Enter the martial arts competition? What the hell…" Woof
woof! Woof woof woof!

「 We won't sell our techniques! What the hell are you thinking? 」

The dazed Breaking the Sky Master responded too late. It was the expected
reaction. In fact, this much was what I guessed.

"Kim Dokja!"

…It was as expected. Yoo Joonghyuk caused a huge cloud of dust as he ran
over and grabbed my neck. He shook me like a man betrayed. I flapped like
a paper doll without strength and said, "Let me speak."

"Shut up! What the hell are you thinking? Selling the techniques…!"

"Please calm down. I did it because of you."

"…What?"

"Don't you know what we just got?"

Yoo Joonghyuk's hands stopped for the first time at my words. Then a
message came to my ears.

[A new sub scenario has arrived!]

[The sub scenario 'Martial Arts Competition' has begun.]
Yoo Joonghyuk read the details of the scenario that just arrived and was
silent for a moment. "…The Black Heavenly Demon Sword?"

"Yes. You said you wanted it."

"…"

"If you look closely, there is also the Demon Spirit Bead. It is the third
place prize but I don't remember well…"

Yoo Joonghyuk's eyes were greatly shaken as he watched me. He suddenly
released me. This jerk, you didn't need to be so moved.

In any case, he seemed to be persuaded. The problem was the other side. I
turned and saw the Breaking the Sky Sword Saint standing with a stiff
expression.

「 An existence born with the power of a giant god. The Breaking the Sky
Sword Saint's existence is no different from a god. 」

There was nothing wrong with the description from Ways of Survival. She
felt overwhelmingly threatening just standing there.

I smiled and waved my hand. "Did the conversation between teacher and
student end well?"

"…You aren't sane."

"Listen to my story before saying anything."

"I have no time to mix words with a person like you."

The heavy fog around us was thickening. I quickly added, "Breaking the
Sky Sword Saint, it isn't possible to maintain the old ways forever."

The Breaking the Sky Sword Saint's thick eyebrows were fiercely curved.
"Is it so important to keep the non-humanistic principle? What if you lose
everything you have because of it?"

Yoo Joonghyuk looked at me like I was mentally ill. "Kim Dokja! Don't say
anything else!"

Of course, I kept talking.

"In the first place, your real strength isn't the Breaking the Sky
Swordsmanship, right? You've abandoned it for a long time after reaching
transcendence. Why don't you sell it for something?"

The ground around me started vibrating. Eventually, Yoo Joonghyuk placed
me behind him as protection and raised the Heavenly Sword of Gathering
Clouds.

It felt as if the gravity of the whole area was strengthened. It felt like a giant
mountain was pressing on my shoulders. Jang Hayoung and Han Myungoh
couldn't even scream as they sank into the ground. The group would be
wiped out if this continued.

"Teacher, wait…!"

Yoo Joonghyuk cried out but the Breaking the Sky Sword Saint didn't stop.

…Was she going to do this? She was really stubborn.

[The constellation 'Demon King of Salvation' has triggered the status of a
constellation.]

Sparks appeared around me and the surrounding gravitational pressure was
temporarily relieved. I smiled at the startled Breaking the Sky Sword Saint.
I might have an incarnation body but I was still a narrative-grade
constellation. "I haven't sold it yet so don't be too harsh."

"You were hiding."
"In any case, you can regain the martial arts technique if you win the
competition. Won't you win the competition?"

The Breaking the Sky Sword Saint looked calmer and the pressure she gave
off subsided. It wouldn't be a problem for her to overpower me if she used
her real strength but she seemed to take me as Yoo Joonghyuk's colleague.
She told me, "I can't participate in the competition."

"It would be no fun if an adult plays with kids."

"The children of Murim are much stronger than you think."

"I'm aware. However, your disciple is strong."

The Breaking the Sky Sword Saint understood what I meant and I patted
Yoo Joonghyuk's shoulder as he stood next to me. "There will be
Joonghyuk in the competition."

Yoo Joonghyuk turned and stared at me with wide eyes. I didn't know why
he was surprised. Did he think he wouldn't participate?

The Breaking the Sky Sword Saint's eyebrows wriggled again. "He's still
weak."

"You can make him stronger. He is your disciple anyway."

"I never said I would accept him as a disciple…"

At this point, Yoo Joonghyuk stared at the Breaking the Sky Sword Saint
with wide eyes. In any case, the teacher and student were both not honest.
[The exclusive skill, 'Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint' has been activated!]
Well, I knew that not being honest was their virtual.

「 It is too early for him. 」
「 Joonghyuk will die if he goes to the competition. 」

「 He isn't at a level to compete with the 10 Grand Masters. 」

I couldn't fully hear the Breaking the Sky Sword Saint's thoughts because of
my low understanding level. Even so, it wasn't hard to know what she was
thinking. In the end, I had to do this for the teacher and student.

"If you accept Yoo Joonghyuk as a disciple, I will let you meet your clan."

"…What does that mean?"

"Exactly what I said. You haven't found your clan yet, correct?"

The Breaking the Sky Sword looked at me with a strange expression. "I
don't know how you know this but my clan has been wiped out. There are
no giant gods left."

"No, there are still some left."

"What…"

I looked up and spoke,"Master of the Underworld, are you still watching?"
Hades was now in my channel. I owed him for last time so it was time to
give a greeting. However, it wasn't Hades who responded to my call.

[The constellation 'Queen of the Darkest Spring' is looking at you with a
strange smile.]

"…It has been a while, Persephone."

Damn. This queen was hard to deal with. When did she enter? I was about
to open my mouth when I heard more messages.

[The constellation 'Queen of the Darkest Spring' says she has heard the
story.]
[The constellation 'Queen of the Darkest Spring' will listen to your request.]

As expected, Persephone was quick when it came to good stories. The
problem was that this queen never did anything without an ulterior motive.

[The constellation 'Queen of the Darkest Spring' says there is a condition.]

…As expected.

"…Please say it."

[The constellation 'Queen of the Darkest Spring' is inviting you to the feast
of constellations.]

Feast of constellations? It was strange. Was now the time for a constellation
banquet to be held? Persephone's message followed as an answer to my
question.

[The constellation 'Queen of the Darkest Spring' is inviting you to the
Gourmet Association.]
                 Chapter 235: Ep. 44 - Swindler, III


From the next day onwards, Yoo Joonghyuk was absorbed in training
with the Breaking the Sky Sword Saint.

The Breaking the Sky Sword Saint kept maintaining a serious expression
from the moment she heard her clan could be found. Yoo Joonghyuk knew
her heart but devoted himself to meditation instead of comforting his
teacher.

'Originally, I was going to meet the ancient giant gods in person but…'

In any case, it wouldn't be bad to leave it to Kim Dokja. Yoo Joonghyuk
would've had to pass through 40 scenarios in order to meet an ancient giant
god if he followed his original plan.

'That guy, I didn't think he would have such a relationship with the
Underworld'.
Kim Dokja really had unknown corners. How the hell did he succeed in
charming all those constellations…

[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' is laughing.]

Just look at this archangel. The Demon-like Judge of Fire wasn't such a
constellation during the second round. She was a strict and lofty archangel
full of justice. Yoo Joonghyuk couldn't understand why such an existence
was so ruined this time.

"Are you really thinking about participating in the competition?"

Yoo Joonghyuk nodded silently at the Breaking the Sky Sword Saint's
question.

"You might die. The competition scenarios are never easy."

"I am much stronger than I was at this point of time in the last round."

"It isn't at a level to deal with the 10 Grand Masters."

Yoo Joonghyuk was well aware of the 10 Grand Masters of Murim. One of
them was the Ice Flower Goddess whose techniques were sold by the
previous merchant who welcomed visitors. There was also a grand master
from the Namgung Family, a distant relative of the Breaking the Sky Sword
Saint. They would appear when the martial arts competition opened.

In addition, the martial arts competition was a commodity so he had to
consider the incarnations of famous constellations participating.

[Some constellations are looking forward to the martial arts competition.]

[Some constellations are tired of the martial arts competition.]

Fortunately, the stronger constellations were tired of these scenarios. As a
scenario that repeated every year in Murim, there weren't many
constellations paying much attention to the martial arts competition.
The Breaking the Sky Sword Saint read Yoo Joonghyuk's heart and opened
her mouth. "You have to open transcendence stage two."

"I've opened it before so it won't be difficult."

"It is different from breaking through stage one."

"I will do it somehow. I've already reached stage three in the last round."

"…Stage three?"

The Breaking the Sky Sword Saint's eyes shook. The third stage of
transcendence wasn't a step that could be reached with talent alone. It took
an enormous amount of 'time' to pass through the third stage. On the other
hand, Yoo Joonghyuk couldn't have experienced such a large amount of
time in the last round…

Yoo Joonghyuk understood his teacher's question and replied, "I used a
time fault in the Dark Dimension."

A time fault in the Dark Dimension. It was often called the 'cemetery of
Murim'. There were two types of Murim people who went to that place. In
that prison of enormous time, there were those who hit the wall of talent
and became crazy or those who went beyond the wall. Yoo Joonghyuk was
the latter.

"…I can't imagine how hard your training was. How many years were you
inside there?"

"Around 100 years."

"Stage three in 100 years… no wonder why you are so arrogant."

100 years. It was a long time for ordinary humans but it wasn't the same for
transcendents.
There were many people who lived for 200 or 300 years in this world who
couldn't reach transcendence no matter how much they built up their martial
arts. It was a wall that couldn't be overcome by improving the physical
body with all types of spiritual medicine. There was a thick wall in
transcendence yet Yoo Joonghyuk crossed that wall three times in 100
years.

"I will shorten it if I enter the time fault again."

"It's a crazy idea! Using a time fault will numb the soul. Haven't you seen
the martial artists who went mad in the time fault? Don't you know that
there is a fine line between insanity and transcendence?"

"…In the last round, I couldn't surpass you even after entering the time
fault."

"Of course! 100 years is too early to catch up with me!" The Breaking the
Sky Sword Saint struggled for a moment before saying, "In any case… you
have reached the third stage, it is better to teach you than an ignorant
person."

Yoo Joonghyuk's expression wasn't very bright despite his teacher's praise.
The Breaking the Sky Sword Saint felt something fishy and questioned
him. Yoo Joonghyuk eventually told her the story.

The Breaking the Sky Sword Saint heard the story and asked as if it was
absurd, "Your spiritual awakening was while you were exhausted?"

"Well, I don't remember exactly."

In the end, he didn't know who he broke through into stage three. The
Breaking the Sky Sword Saint's expression wasn't good. "Are you confident
you can trust your unconscious mind and break through to stage three
again? That sounds like the pseudo-cult followers of the Ice Flower
Goddess.
"That's why I need you. Please teach me your techniques again."

"What?"

"Using the same method as before is difficult. It takes too long."

The Breaking the Sky Sword Saint was stunned by her disciple's shameless
words. "I don't know if I should help. You've crossed the wall of
transcendence so you know that transcendence is never done in one way.
All transcendents have to find their own way to transcend."

"You can still help. Isn't there the 10,000 Streams¹ will Gather Together
School."

"It means we will have to find one of the many branches. There is no such
enlightenment in the world. Just as there is no such story."

"Still, if there are 10,000 branches, can't we catch one of them? I've already
found one in the past."

Yoo Joonghyuk said this and thought he was somehow talking like Kim
Dokja. He didn't originally talk this way. Maybe he was influenced while
they were together. The Breaking the Sky Sword Saint sighed at her silent
disciple. "Were you originally so talkative? It won't be easy. You should've
seen from the previous round that the Breaking the Sky Swordsmanship
wasn't originally for men."

Yoo Joonghyuk also knew it. That's why it was very difficult to learn the
skills of the Breaking the Sky Sword Saint in the past. However, this time
was different.

"The problem of gender can be resolved to some extent."

"What does that mean?"

[The constellation who likes to change sex is snorting.]
Yoo Joonghyuk frowned at the indirect message. Complex emotions and
enormous anger rose every time he thought about it but he had to take
advantage of everything he could.

"It is time to wrap this up."

After a while, the astonished Breaking the Sky Sword Saint's mouth
dropped open. Yoo Joonghyuk took out his sword with a blank expression.

"You can never tell that guy out there."




[In the Kim Dokja Industrial Complex, there are people who doubt your
achievements.]

[The story about the 'Swindler Kim Dokja' is spreading in the Kim Dokja
Industrial Complex.]

I woke up from my nap due to a message in the air. Based on the message,
it seemed that a bad rumour was circulating in the industrial complex while
I was away. It was natural since the industrial complex had changed rulers
but the new ruler never showed his face.

By the way, Swindler Kim Dokja… Why did it feel like people who didn't
know my face knew me better?

"Kim Dokja. What are you doing?"

Someone kicked me and I got up with a groan. I saw Yoo Joonghyuk whose
upper body was bare and covered in sweat. It was probably from the hard
training under the Breaking the Sky Sword Saint.

"…I was just thinking for a moment."

"You're being lazy."
"I have to be lazy now. I'm a patient."

It was an excuse but it was true. I had yet to fully recover from the exile
penalty. The recovery was also delayed due to what happened with the
Breaking the Sky Sword Saint. I was increasing the proficiency of
Lamarck's Giraffe and steadily ingesting story fragments, so recovery
wouldn't be too late.

I looked at the people training hard in the front yard of the place. "How
about those guys?"

The sweating Jang Hayoung was sparring against Han Myungoh. The
Breaking the Sky Master was supervising and pointing out any mistakes.
"That girl has a fair amount of talent. Her strange attribute means she is
learning it very quickly."

"That isn't a girl. He's a man."

"Sometimes I don't know where your eyes are."

What an idiot. He was a man, right? It was like this in the original novel. I
was about to speak when Yoo Joonghyuk wondered, "Rather, what is
happening with the constellations?"

"…I'm thinking."

It had already been a week since I received Persephone's message.

[The constellation 'Queen of the Darkest Spring' is inviting you to the
Gourmet Association.]

[In one week, the Gourmet Association Festival will be held at Oro Castle.]

[Please decide if you will depart by tonight.]

An invitation to the Gourmet Association. I expected it to happen someday
but it was earlier than expected.
The Gourmet Association. It was a gathering of constellations who loved
gourmet food. At first glance, it was like the 'constellation banquet' but
reality was completely different.

If the constellation banquet was official, the Gourmet Association Festival
was unofficial and the intensity of the events that happened was also
different.

[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' is worried about you.]

Above all, there was no Uriel in the Gourmet Association.

[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' is wondering about
your choice.]

There was no the Great Sage, Heaven's Equal, no Secretive Plotter. Was
there… the Abyssal Black Flame Dragon? I couldn't remember it well.

In any case, the atmosphere of the place wasn't as favourable to me as the
'constellations banquet'. There was nothing more dangerous in the Star
Stream then going to a gathering of unstable constellations.

Yoo Joonghyuk read my expression and asked, "Are you frightened?"

"No way."

I wouldn't have come all the way here if I didn't participate in the Gourmet
Association for that reason. I silently watched Jang Hayoung and Han
Myungoh sparring. Han Myungoh was hit continuously hit and let out a
scream. Yoo Joonghyuk watched along with me and stated. "It's because of
this place."

"…That's right."
According to Persephone's message, the Gourmet Association Festival was
exactly one week later. As it happened, the date was exactly the same as the
martial arts competition.

It meant I wouldn't be in the First Murim on the day the martial arts
competition scenario occurred. If something happened…

"Go and come back, Kim Dokja."



[1] 10,000 Streams will Gather Together – Korean idiom meaning "all
things will eventually return to the same point."
                 Chapter 236: Ep. 44 - Swindler, IV


I reflexively raised my head at Yoo Joonghyuk's decisive words. "…Is it
okay?"

"The scenario we are facing right now isn't the Demon King Selection but
the Martial Arts Competition."

I had been thinking this but once I heard Yoo Joonghyuk say it, I felt a
strange sense of relief and pride. "You… have really become a person. At
the very least, I won't die for the time being."

Yoo Joonghyuk ignored my words and continued, "The only thing that can
be obtained from the competition is the Black Heavenly Demon Sword.
Getting the Black Heavenly Demon Sword doesn't mean we can win the
Demon King Selection."

Yoo Joonghyuk was right. Winning the Murim competition didn't mean we
could win the Demon King Selection.
"That's why you have to go to the Gourmet Association. We need
colleagues for our nebula. You might be able to gain allies if you go to the
Gourmet Association."

I understood what he was saying. Go to the Gourmet Association and come
back with some usable constellations. There was one worrisome point.

"…Our nebula?"

"Didn't you say you would make one last time?"

"Kim Dokja's Company?"

"I'll quit right away if it is really named that."

Yoo Joonghyuk turned his head away with a frown. I felt pleasantly
surprised.

[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire'' is wiping her tears with a
handkerchief.]

It was something that was unthinkable when he first grabbed me by the
neck. Yoo Joonghyuk and I really became colleagues. In any case, it was
funny that I was hesitating when Yoo Joonghyuk told me this.

I stood up and declared, "I'll go."




That night, I was greeted by a Gourmet Association Guide who flew
through the portal. The guide drove a small carriage with a black horse,
while dressed in a western cowboy costume. He seemed to be one of the
subordinates of the owner of Oro Castle.

The guide descended from the carriage and bowed politely to me.
[Are you the Demon King of Salvation?]

"That's right."

[Take the carriage. The journey is quite long and you can rest.]

The guide didn't show any particular surprise or responses towards me. Was
it because he was a guide of the Gourmet Association that he wasn't
surprised by 'Demon King of Salvation'? The guide got on the carriage and
turned to ask me.

[I will pick up some passengers along the way. Do you mind?]

"Uh, that's okay."

Some passengers… who? I missed the opportunity to ask as the guide
immediately started the carriage.

The interior of the carriage was spacious and comfortable. There was no
shaking at all and it was like I wasn't moving. It was great. I could read
Ways of Survival on the journey.

I read Ways of Survival during these few hours. Maybe it wasn't a few
hours but a few days. It was difficult to measure the time because I didn't
know how fast the carriage was moving.

「…Thus, the 15th regression Yoo Joonghyuk thought as he died, 'I wasn't
lucky'. 」

「 …At the end of the 19th round, Yoo Joonghyuk thought, 'Next time'. 」

「 …Yoo Joonghyuk finished his 25th life and murmured, "It really will be
next time." 」

…I had to cancel calling him a person. This jerk, he was still a sunfish in
the first revision. It was the same whether I helped him or not.
I didn't forget to find the information I needed on Yoo Joonghyuk's death.
There weren't many details about the Gourmet Association. Yoo Joonghyuk
visited the Gourmet Association in the later stages but it was to kill them,
not get along with them. Those sections were mostly filled with
"Kuaaaack!" 「 The Flying Fox said, "Constellations are all bad. However,
the Gourmet Association are the worst among them." 」

It was also impossible to find any favourable contents about them. The
more I read, the more I was uncertain that going to the Gourmet
Association was the right thing to do. Anyway, I continued reading Ways
of Survival.

「 Yoo Joonghyuk was thinking, "It would've been nice if he had come
with me'. 」

If there was a difference in taste between the original and the revision, it
was the moment these words came out. They were traces of when I
intervened in the original work. I paid particular attention whenever these
lines appeared. It was because there were only a few scenes where the 'third
regression' was mentioned.

「 'You must do this. He said this is the right way'. 」

…The right way? What did this mean?

[It is time to eat. If you don't mind, I've prepared something simple.]

"Thank you."

The carriage stopped and the guide provided me with a meal. It was a type
of in-flight meal. It resembled high-quality ham and smelled very fragrant.
Of course, it wasn't really ham.

[The Last Gladiator of Planet Selegedon.]
It was a story meal typical of the Gourmet Association. It seemed to be a
pretty strong story based on the concentration that I could feel…

I touched the soft ham with a fork that the guide gave me. At this moment,
some of the story contents flowed into my head.

–S-Spare me. Please spare me…!

A city that crumbled in a horrible manner due to the turmoil of the
constellations. The appearance of incarnations bursting under huge
pressure. The dying gladiator who lost all dignity…

The bodies of torn incarnations pouring into the mouths of wickedly
smiling constellations. The last scene of the world that had already
disappeared. The screams and despair of the incarnations gathered together
at the end of my nose.

I looked down at the ham and quietly put down the fork.

[…The food doesn't suit your taste?]

"I'm not hungry right now." I answered with a calm smile.

[I'm sorry. I didn't account for your taste as a constellation. New food…]

"No, I'll eat what I brought."

The guide took away the plates in a regretful manner and sat back down on
the driver's seat. Once he was completely gone, I barely relaxed my
expression. It felt like I was going to vomit.

A sentence I had just read in Ways of Survival passed through my head.

「 "it is a nightmare for the incarnations." 」

Once again, I realized where I was going and who I was dealing with. I
foolishly acted like I was going on a picnic.
I touched some of the stories that were in my pocket. Compared to the
stories they ate, the stories abandoned in the 'Story Horizon' were almost
colourless and odourless. They were the plain stories of ordinary
incarnations living and dying in a normal way, just like trash. There was a
reason why the Gourmet Association abandoned them.

I absorbed the story fragments using Lamarck's Giraffe and quietly closed
my eyes. Somehow, I felt like I was going to have a nightmare.




The trip continued for a few days and I used the interlude to look at some of
the things I hadn't maintained.

[Coins Possessed: 1,252,353 C.]

First, I checked the coins that I hadn't paid attention to lately. It was a really
huge amount of money.

1.2 million was enough to buy the Great Demon's Eyes. However, Anna
Croft had already obtained it. I had a better skill so I didn't need it. But…

I wondered how to use the remaining coins. It wasn't bad to increase my
overall stats but the efficiency of the stats started to fall once the average
exceeded 100. From then on, investing in skills was much better than
investing in stats.

Of course, there were times when the accumulated overall stats were
overwhelming. Once I convinced the Fourth Wall, I should properly check
my Attributes Window.

[A new passenger is going to enter. It is okay?]

I was so immersed in my thoughts that I wasn't aware the carriage stopped.
"Yes, I"m fine."
The left door of the carriage opened at my reply. I was a bit nervous as I
looked at the people who were going to join me through the cracks in the
door. The possibility of it being a constellation was high.

"Ah! I've been waiting a long time. Why are you so late?"

[I'm sorry. The road was a bit rougher than I thought…]

A voice that was somewhat familiar entered my ears. It was a high female
voice mixed with a Russian accent.

I could see three people through the cracks in the door.

[There is someone who has already boarded. I hope you have a pleasant
journey.]

Whether it was lucky or unlucky, I didn't feel any constellations. In other
words, they were all incarnations with stories.

A woman with a gentle smile boarded the carriage first. "Excuse me.

The woman who greeted me politely had brown hair that fluttered in the
wind. The moment the woman raised her head, I reflexively asked, "Selena
Kim?"

Selena Kim. She was one of the American representatives at the
constellation banquet. Perhaps it was due to my changed face but the
woman was confused for a while before exclaiming,

"Ah, you…?"

"Do you remember who I am?"

"Of course! Kim Dokja! It's been a while! Were you invited?"

"Yes, that's what happened."
I shook hands with Selena and studied the rest of the group. The person
who followed with a girl with twin ponytails.

"What are you… eh?"

As expected, I had seen this person before. It was the Russian girl I met at
the constellation banquet.

Her name… what was it? I remember her having the nickname of Red
something.

I ignored the girl and checked the remaining person. At this moment, I got
goose bumps.

"This is the first time we've actually met."

There was an immeasurable depth in the calm and relaxed voice. I knew
this person well. One of the strongest incarnations in Ways of Survival
along with Yoo Joonghyuk. I had even met this person before.

"I saw you in a dream one day. I don't remember since it was too long ago.
At that time, you said we would meet…"

I remembered. In the Green Zone scenario, I saw her after eating the
Specter's Stone. I told her, "I remember."

"I'll formally greet you. It is nice to meet you, Kim Dokja. No… Demon
King of Salvation."

She smiled while a yellow demon eye flew above her blond hair. It was a
very beautiful smile but I couldn't accept it. It was because I knew better
than anyone the disturbing thoughts behind the smile. "I am Anna Croft."
Asgard's prophet. The head of the Zarathustra, Anna Croft was here.
           Chapter 237: Ep. 45 - Gourmet Association, I


Anna Croft was silent on the way to Oro Castle. She sometimes smiled
strangely when our eyes met but she didn't speak first.

I wished I could read her thoughts but my understanding of Anna Croft was
so low that I couldn't activate the second stage of Omniscient Reader's
Viewpoint.

I didn't like Anna Croft in the original novel. I couldn't count the number of
times she killed or backstabbed Yoo Joonghyuk with the fingers on both
hands.

The atmosphere in the carriage was awkward because both Anna Croft and
I weren't speaking. Selena Kim was sweating.

"…Thus, we came together. The incarnations of Asgard were invited."
Selena Kim's good nature meant she couldn't stand this type of atmosphere
and she kept saying things that weren't asked for. In any case, it was good
for me to hear a lot of information.

"I see. Are you part of Asgard?"

"Yes. It was Anna's arrangement."

"You picked a good nebula."

"Ahaha, I was just lucky. Thanks to it, I can enjoy this great luxury. The
other incarnations weren't invited…"

Selena Kim looked slightly excited. Well, the invitation to the Gourmet
Association had a different meaning from the constellation banquet. If the
constellation banquet was a gathering for the entire nobility, the Gourmet
Association was similar to a gathering of the upper nobility.

Still, it wasn't necessarily a good thing. I wondered if Selena Kim could
continue thinking like this once she arrived.

"Iris, why aren't you saying anything? You said you wanted to meet
Dokjassi again."

"Блин! (Damn!) Since when did I say that?"

"This child… haven't you been talking about Kim Dokja since the last
banquet? You haven't seen each other for a while so say something."

Iris' face turned red at Selena Kim's teasing. Iris noticed my gaze and
carefully opened her mouth. "You are the Demon King of Salvation…
right?"

I had doubts that this person was the cheeky kid from back then but I
decided to be polite. "Correct."

"…Is it uncomfortable for you to be with us?"
"Why would I feel uncomfortable?"

"We are just incarnations. The Demon King of Salvation is…"

Selena Kim's expression was also changing. I had forgotten for a moment
but I was different from them. The gap between incarnation and
constellation was like the gap between heaven and earth.

Other constellations would've said, "These little bugs finally realize who
they are talking to." Of course, I wasn't like that.

"It's fine. I was once an incarnation."

Selena Kim seemed to sigh with relief at my words. Iris gained some
courage and opened her mouth again. "Then… can I ask one question?"

"Please ask."

"Do you have an incarnation you signed a Sponsor Contract with?"

"Why are you asking?"

"Uh, that…"

Selena gave a hint for the hesitating Iris. "Iris. Do you have a sponsor yet?"

"I-I'm just asking! It is out of curiosity!"

The twin ponytails moved as Iris twisted her head while Shin Yoosung and
Lee Gilyoung on Earth came to my mind. Those guys, please stay well…

I spoke with a nostalgic heart. "I have an incarnation on the Korean
Peninsula."

Iris' expression changed at my words. "Ah, perhaps that little kid…"
I nodded. It seemed the rumour of Shin Yoosung had spread everywhere.
The constellations had already told their incarnations.

Then Anna Croft opened her mouth. "Have you ever thought about
changing your incarnation?"

Selena Kim and Iris stared at Anna Croft with surprise. Anna Croft
continued speaking, "There are many good incarnations in the Asgard
nebula. There are many talented friends. Iris is one of them."

It was an unexpected proposal. Why was Anna Croft suddenly making this
offer? Maybe Asgard was talking about me. Well, I hadn't formally made a
nebula yet.

"Are you telling me to join the Asgard nebula?"

"It isn't necessarily the same thing. There are many good incarnations in
Asgard. I'm just saying that it isn't bad to accept one of them. Can't you
withdraw the Sponsor Contract at any point?"

The disappointed Iris once again stared at me with sparkling eyes. I replied
with an emotionless face. "I have no intention of cancelling my Sponsor
Contract."

"Do you like that girl? Is she called Shin Yoosung?"

I didn't answer and Iris' face filled with deep disappointment. My
understanding of her might be very low but the change in emotions was
easily caught.

By the way, Anna Croft made a strange remark. "For example, if an
incarnation suddenly dies…"

There was an unknown smile on Anna Croft's face. "Don't look so
surprised. It is just an example. It is a possibility. An unexpected accident
or a sudden disaster can cause the death of an incarnation… It is a common
thing. If that happens, don't you think you'll change your incarnation?"

"An unexpected accident?"

"Yes, an unexpected accident. An accident that happened accidentally."

I stared at Anna Croft. Shin Yoosung's death… I never thought about it.

"That won't happen as long as I live."

"You don't know. It is unclear how and when Fate will work."

…Fate? The atmosphere momentarily shook. The surrounding air filled
with an ominous aura and the entire carriage trembled. Iris and Selena
Kim's expressions stiffened. They had goosebumps on their arms as they
watched me with a frightened expression.

I hadn't wanted to do this. I didn't want to scare them by seeming like a
villain. However, Anna Croft crossed a line she shouldn't have crossed.

[If something like that happens.]

Sparks of probability appeared as I used my true voice.

[The nebula 'Asgard' is concerned.]

[Constellations of the 'Asgard' nebula are warning you!]

I heard the indirect messages of the Asgard constellations enter my ears.
Nevertheless, I didn't stop.

[If that happens, I will destroy all the worlds that caused that Fate.]

The impact of the shock caused the windows of the carriage to burst at the
same time. The startled driver looked back this way. There was even vague
astonishment on Anna Croft's normally calm face. Perhaps she wasn't
aware of exactly how much 'status' I had.

Shortly afterwards, the carriage stopped and the voice of the guide was
heard.

[We have arrived at Oro Castle.]

I smiled at the three people who were still stiff. "Let's go."




We got down from the carriage and was guided into Oro Castle.

Oro Castle. The castle was one of the main homes of the Gourmet
Association scattered all over the world and was owned directly by a
member of the Gourmet Association. Perhaps it was… I remember that it
was one of the 72 demon kings. Was it 'Immeasurable Austerity?

[They have been granted permission to enter.]

[I've confirmed it. Come in.]

The interior of the castle had more of a modern than medieval style. It was
reminiscent of a luxurious hotel lobby. The forms of the intermediate
symbolic bodies could be seen scattered around.

[Some constellations are paying attention to your presence.]

We were guided to a waiting room in the corner of the first floor lobby.
Perhaps some people hadn't arrived yet. The three incarnations of Asgard
and I were the only ones present.
[Please wait in the waiting room. There are still more incarnations
arriving… ah, the Demon King of Salvation is a constellation. I will
arrange a separate waiting room for you.]

"No, I'm fine. I'll just be here."

The guide stared at me like I was strange but soon disappeared. Frankly, it
was more comfortable here. I needed some time to prepare my mind.

There were panels hung on the wall of the waiting room. They played sub
scenarios currently going on all over the dimensions…

"Excuse me, earlier…" It was Selena Kim who spoke. She might be
hesitant because of what happened in the carriage but there was nothing
wrong with the setting of Ways of Survival.

I smiled softly and replied, "It's fine. I was a bit too much."

Selena Kim's expression slightly softened. "No, we were too rude. I'm
sorry, Demon King of Salvation."

Her words were much more formal than before. I didn't mean to refuse the
apology but something felt bad. Selena Kim did nothing wrong. She was
one of the few people I liked in Ways of Survival. The one I hated was the
shameless person standing in the corner and watching this scene.

Then the door of the waiting room opened and another guide appeared.

[Incarnations of Asgard, please follow me.]

The constellations of Asgard were probably looking for them. Selena Kim
and Iris nodded to me before leaving.

On the other hand, Anna Croft watched me without leaving the room. "You
have too many constellations as enemies."

"It isn't something for you to worry about."
Anna Croft slightly frowned at my assertion. She didn't seem daunted
despite what happened before. She was a mere incarnation but she had
contracted with an entire nebula. Perhaps the top-ranked Asgardians were
protecting her from my 'status'.

"As companions moving towards the same goal, I am seriously advising
you.
You might not like it but it is time to cooperate with other constellations."

The same goal…

"Well, I don't know your goal so I can't answer it."

"Protecting this world. Aren't you fighting for this as well?"

Instead of answering the question, I glanced at the panel on the wall of the
waiting room. There were images of incarnations torn apart by disasters and
constellations. I didn't answer and Anna Croft brushed by my side.

At this moment, I opened my mouth. "I have to see if this world is worth
protecting or not."

Anna Croft's expression hardened at my words. She looked between the
anxious guide and me before giving a short sigh. "…I hope we have a
chance to talk later."

She disappeared and only I remained in the waiting room. Once left alone, I
quietly organized my thoughts.

I recalled the Gourmet Association constellations mentioned in Ways of
Survival and thought of the constellations that could be persuaded. I didn't
forget their characteristics or their modifiers.

I was fortunate at the constellation banquet but there was no guarantee it
would happen again.
If the Gourmet Association was expressed as a social circle, this would be
my full-fledged debut.

Depending on the impression I made here and what I talked about, the
direction of the following scenarios would change.

At this moment, the door of the waiting room opened.

I thought it was a guide but this time, an unexpected presence was waiting
for me. The moment I was about to say something, the other person spoke
first.

[It's been a while, Kim Dokja. I've been waiting for a long time.]

I heard the bright tone of the True Voice and realized what the other
person was. Really, the queen of the Underworld was too mischievous. I
sighed and asked, "…Why the hell do you look like that?"
           Chapter 238: Ep. 45 - Gourmet Association, II


Persephone laughed softly.

[Why? Don't you like it? The neighbouring archangel told me that this is
your taste.]

"It is an absolute misunderstanding."

[Hrmm…]

Persephone's voice sounded regretful. For reference, Persephone was
currently in the form of Yoo Joonghyuk. It was just fortunate that she
wasn't wearing a Chinese dress.

[Then how about this?]

"Wait…!" Before I could finish, Persephone's appearance changed once
again. I thought she would turn into Yoo Sangah in a Chinese dress but this
time it was unexpected. "No, this…"
Persephone smiled and I flushed, despite knowing the other person was
Persephone. Persephone was in the form of the 'punisher' that I had seen a
while ago.

[I noticed that you couldn't take your eyes off her at the time. Is it like this?]

The white skin was revealed through the side of the dress and I reflexively
closed my eyes while shouting, "…Stop teasing!"

[Huhu, it is really funny.]

Persephone laughed like a child before once again transforming. This time,
it was the appearance of Yoo Sangah. She had a tidy office look instead of
the Chinese dress and garter belt. I saw this appearance from the days of
Mino Soft and felt complicated. Yoo Sangah always spoke to me in this
attire.

Yoo Sangah-ssi, please be well. I was a bit worried that she was with Han
Sooyoung… still, it was Yoo Sangah so I believed she would be okay.

Persephone kept smiling.

[Follow me. I came to pick you up.]

I nodded and followed behind Persephone. I walked out of the waiting
room and felt a bit nervous at some of the gazes of the constellations. I
walked with Persephone and saw the constellations. I felt like I was her
young servant for some reason.

Soon after, Persephone and I reached a huge elevator in the middle of the
lobby. Maybe the Gourmet Association Festival would be held on the top
floor of this castle.

The door of the elevator that resembled a huge crystal ball was opened and
Persephone and I boarded. My body felt a bit heavier and the darkness of
the Dark Dimension spread outside the transparent crystal wall. Beyond the
horizon of the dimension, the magnificent world of the Star Stream was
revealed.

[You are looking forward to it.]

"Rather than looking forward to it, I am a bit nervous."

Persephone laughed as if she understood my heart.

[I'm glad you are alive. Last time you were an incarnation and now you are
a constellation.]

"I'm still a newbie. I'm not sure it is okay for me to come here."

I meant to be humble by Persephone's expression hardened at my words.

[What do you think my position is in the Gourmet Association? Is it hard to
take in a new member?]

"That's not what I meant…"

[I'm just joking.]

"Please stop making fun of me."

[Think of it as investing in advance since I don't know how promising a
constellation you will be in the future. It is something you will have to
suffer one day.]

I felt it before but I didn't know why this queen was so good to me. The
only thing she asked for in exchange for taking the Breaking the Sky Sword
Saint to Tartarus was to participate in this Gourmet Association Festival.

Maybe she knew. In fact, the condition of attending the Gourmet
Association was beneficial for me, not her. She made a full-fledged debut
for me as a constellation.
Persephone's obsidian eyes were sparkling.

[How much is your status now? It can't be narrative-grade.]

Perhaps the other constellations didn't know that I was narrative-grade. I
thought for a moment before replying, "I will be on the second floor at the
next constellation banquet."

Persephone's eyes widened at my eyes. She guessed I would be
historicalgrade at most. It was quite pleasurable to see the queen of the
Underworld look so embarrassed. However, there was also deep concern
mixed in her eyes.

[There will be constellations who feel jealous of you.]

"…"

[Some constellations will try to draw you to their side.]

"I'm expecting it."

I was prepared. The constellations I would meet in the future wouldn't be
easy. They might be jealous of me or trying to pull me to their side. Either
way, it was dangerous.

[However, most of the constellations will be indifferent to you.]

"…Huh?"

[Until now, you haven't been able to feel it because you've gone to places
where the influence of the Korean Peninsula scenario is great… Don't
forget, this is the Gourmet Association.]

The Gourmet Association. This was a grand gathering of high-ranking
constellations in the Star Stream.

Suddenly, Persephone's laughter seemed scary.
[I won't act as a nanny like I did at the constellation banquet. This time, I
want to see you act with your own strength.]

The door of the elevator opened with a ding and Persephone disappeared
into the banquet hall. Left alone, I hesitated before getting out of the
elevator.

[Some constellations show curiosity towards you.]

Some constellation glanced at me when I got off but the interest soon
disappeared. It was rather fortunate. It would be hard to move if excessive
interest was poured towards me.

Just as on the first floor lobby, there were no constellations who existed as
symbolic bodies. Everyone was a humanoid or living being of this world.
There wasn't a single constellation here conscious about using probability.

Some of the constellations that occupied the banquet hall looked like those
I read about in Ways of Survival. The first one to stand out was the man in
a Viking outfit that occupied the center of the banquet hall. It would be
stranger if I didn't recognize him with the giant hammer on his back.

[The best of the first generation stories is naturally the 'Dragon Eating the
Hammer'.]

The constellation of the nebula Asgard, Thursday's Thunder was speaking
in an excited voice. Then a woman replied from the other side.

[What do you mean? The best is obviously the 'Children of Dawn'. The
rating is also the highest.]

She was a goddess wearing a white dress embroidered with stars. If I
remembered correctly, she was a constellation of the Guardian Tree nebula,
the 'Morning Star Goddess'.
It seemed there was a controversy over which story was the best. Fighting
over which story was the best, it was exactly the same as what I read in
Ways of Survival. It was clear what this place was like after seeing the
highranking constellations that were hard to see on the Korean Peninsula.
Even the powerful 'Persephone' was just a normal constellation in the
Gourmet Association.

[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' is cheering for you.]

Luckily, the sole comfort was that the 'channel was still functioning. Yes, I
couldn't be discouraged in a place like this.

I quietly approached one of the central groups in the Gourmet Association
and talked to one of the surrounding constellations.

"Ex…"

However, no one looked at me. It was as if I didn't exist to the constellation
here. I gathered my courage and tapped on the shoulder of the constellation
besides me.

"Excuse me."

This time, there was a reaction. The constellation looked at me before
brushing past my shoulder and walking to the center of the hall.

「 Kim Dokja knew this feeling very well. 」

I felt like I was alone in this world. Suddenly, the voices of the many
constellations felt distant. They were clearly in the same place but they
were elsewhere. I understood what Persephone meant by 'indifference'. The
Gourmet Association was building their own barrier to prevent new people
like me from entering.

[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' is looking at you with sad
eyes.]
…But I couldn't give up. I had to somehow create a crack.

I broadened my vision and looked around the periphery of the Gourmet
Association. In addition to the constellations chatting in the center of the
banquet hall, there were also people standing alone. They were also
members of the Gourmet Association and would certainly be powerful.

The edge of the banquet hall contained numerous panels like those seen in
the waiting room. They were videos of scenarios taking place all over the
world. I looked closer and saw the moment I became the Demon King of
Salvation displayed on a small screen in the corner.

However, no constellations were watching it. The Korean Peninsula
scenario that I went through was just one passing story. The panel next to it
was showing a real-time broadcast of the Korean Peninsula. It seemed to be
Bihyung's channel.

On the screen, a good-looking girl with a bob was speaking nonsense.

–That jerk Kim Dokja, I'm sure he is feeling delighted right now.

I couldn't help smiling at the familiar voice. Han Sooyoung wouldn't be
able to talk this crap if she knew where I was right now.

–Hey, are you doing well picking up the Abyss Stones? You have to gather
it well. You will be glad when you need to use it later.

–…Did Dokja-ssi really give this order?

–Of course!

I felt great longing as I saw Han Sooyoung and Yoo Sangah on the screen. I
thought I would be more depressed if I kept watching and turned to another
panel.
The screen contained a common 'mass-produced story'. The story was
called 'Legend of the Legendary Return from Another World'. It had a
third-rate smell just from the title and the contents were obviously about a
returnee who saved the world and was happy Still, it was worth watching. It
somehow resembled Ways of Survival… the protagonist's speech was
similar to Yoo Joonghyuk. I watched the story and a message emerged.

[Do you want to enter a star rating?]

Oh, it was a system that gave stars to every story. I placed my hand
carefully to the 'star point' box next to it. At this moment, someone's voice
was heard.

[This is my favourite story.]

I looked back and saw an old man standing there. I responded lightly, "It's
an interesting story."

[Huhu, is that right? This friend has good taste.]

In fact, it was a story that didn't fit the Gourmet Association that I knew.
The Gourmet Association didn't like these mass-produced stories. The
constellations of the Gourmet Association were sick and tired of it once
concepts such as 'ninth circle' and 'sword master' came out. This Legend of
the Legendary Return from Another World had both of them.

"Are you the contributor of this story?"

[That's right. Keke. I show it every year. I just wanted to know one more
person to know the story. It is a really nice and fun story but I don't know
how to say it.]

"That feeling, I understand it."
Somehow, I was glad. I also posted about Ways of Survival on every
community site I went to while reading it. Most people just swore at me
but… in any case, this old man was similar to me.

The old man sighed and added, [These guys just scoff if I recommend it.
The younger ones already have high eyes… they are busy with the first
generation stories.]

It was a really unexpected remark. Certainly, there was an uptight part to
the Gourmet Association. The higher their position in the Star Stream, the
stronger the tendency.

At this time, the mutters of passing constellations were heard.

[The steady person is here again.]

[Tsk tsk, he has no idea about a good story because of his age…]

…Steady person? It seemed to be a nickname for the old man by my side. I
recalled that there was a constellation with a similar nickname in Ways of
Survival…

[Get this thing off! It isn't a story and should fuck off!]

At this moment, the star rating attached to the Legend of the Legendary
Return from Another World changed.

★ 1.3/5 -> ★ 1.1/5

The rating became lower. It was obvious who was doing it.

[T-These guys!]

It was the so-called 'star point terror'. The old man screamed at the
disappearing constellations. I thought I understood the old man's feelings
and brought a hand to the star point section.
"I don't think the story is terrible enough to get this score."

There was a beep and the star point increased. The old man turned his head
towards me at the sound.

"In fact, I'm not sure why there is a score on the stories. Every story has
value. It is a story that is interesting to some people and salvation for
others."

The old man was startled by my words. He licked his lips a few times
before murmuring with admiration.

[You aren't like young constellations these days… you have a great sense of
value…]

"It's nothing."

Everyone would think like me if they endured a story like Ways of
Survival. The old man's mood relaxed and he smiled at me.

[You seem to be good company. What's your modifier? I didn't have a
chance to ask.]

Was this going to be a good story? I smiled and declared, [I am the Demon
King of Salvation.]
          Chapter 239: Ep. 45 - Gourmet Association, III


The expression of the old man changed at my words.

[…Demon King of Salvation…?]

It was difficult to read the exact emotions due to the old man's intricately
folded wrinkles. The old man was first surprised, then angry and finally
looked admiring. To be exact, every emotion was contained in one
expression.

[That's right. You are… huhu, I see.]

The old man seemed to know me. I didn't expect anyone in the Gourmet
Association other than Persephone to know about me… yet he had a
surprising awareness?

"Can I ask for your modifier?"

The old man gave an unknown smile instead of answering my question.
[Do you like the coat I made?]

"…Huh?"

[The coat you are wearing.]

I reflexively looked down at my white coat.

[Infinite Dimension Space Coat]

It was a coat I was awarded with after defeating Myung Ilsang. The name
of the constellation who made this coat was…

"…Mass Production Maker?"

The old man laughed at my surprised tone.

[I am called that.]

He pointed his thumb at himself and I was slightly discouraged. The Mass
Production Maker. He was mentioned in the list of constellations who had
the greatest influence on the Star Stream scenario.

It was difficult to describe his combat ability as being of the highest level
but he was an existence with a close connection with many nebulae and the
bureau. To make matters worse, I killed Myung Ilsang who was the
incarnation of the Mass Production Maker in the fifth scenario.

[Huhu, you don't have to look like that. I won't eat you.]

The Mass Production Maker seemed to have noticed what I was trying to
say.

[I know what you're thinking. Don't be alarmed. It is common in the Star
Stream. He wasn't the type of person I was interested in anyway.]

"…"
[He had no guts, had a weak will and always searched for the easy way.]

I felt a complex amount of emotions. There was relief that the Mass
Production Maker didn't care much about it and disillusioned that even a
constellation like the Mass Production Maker thought of incarnations as
tools…

I pretended to be calm. "Thank you."

[Don't thank me for that. No matter how lousy, he was still my
incarnation… by the way, I saw the story you made.]

"My story?"

[Yes, you are great at leading the scenario in unexpected directions and
creating a mess. Thanks to you, I haven't been bored for a while. I gave you
five stars.]

I didn't know if it was praise or mockery but I thanked him.

[This is your first time here. Who introduced you?]

"The queen of the Underworld."

The eyes of the Mass Production Maker shone.

[That old hag… huhu, doing this thing through all means. Bringing a new
entrant like you at a time like this…]

I seemed to know what he meant but I deliberately trembled. "What is
happening in the Gourmet Association?"

[They are always doing things. Rather, did that old hag abandon her new
entrant to see what you could do? Tsk tsk… in any case, she is an
Olympian. Come on. I'll give you a brief introduction.]
Unexpectedly, things were going well. I followed behind the Mass
Production Maker and looked around. I shouldn't forget my purpose for
coming here just because there were many spectacular attractions. I came to
recruit constellations to help in the Demon King Salvation.

Let's see. The first thing was to talk to the constellations…

[You know who that drunkard over there is, right? He is Thor. The vigorous
and stern woman over there is Vakarine…]

I felt a thrill every time the Mass Production Maker called out the name of a
constellation. The real names of the constellations had the power to attract
their attention. The problem was they might like it or be angry. I sometimes
called out the names of constellations like Persephone but not like this…

[They don't like me very much so I can't introduce you to them. They
scared just by me approaching.]

In fact, Thursday's Thunder and Morning Star Goddess seemed to be
avoiding the Mass Production Maker. I roughly knew the cause.

[Tsk tsk, they don't know what good stories are…]

In any case, I felt that the reaction of the constellations was noticeably
different just by moving with the Mass Production Maker. It was also easy
to enter the center of the banquet hall, which was difficult to get into
before. However, now everyone would run away before I could even
speak…

Ah, I remembered that Asmodeus was a member of the Gourmet
Association… where is he?

[It looks like the main event is going to begin.]

The Mass Production Maker smiled alone and grabbed my sleeve. I sat at a
nearby table and the guide immediately gave me food.
[Eyes of the Ninth Circle Great Sage Merbatos.]

I took a quick look at the food before putting down my fork. Several of the
surrounding constellations laughed at me. They seemed to be despising that
fact that I barely touched the food and couldn't eat it. The Mass Production
Maker just ignored the gazes and chewed on the eyeballs.

[This has a good taste. Look, that friend is today's host.]

A light lit up the stage and the host appeared. The face was familiar. It was
the constellation who pushed past me earlier. It was a young lady dressed in
a gorgeous gothic lace dress with a cute face.

[Gourmet Association members, hello~ I am today's host, Euphrosyne!]

I heard the name and knew who she was. The goddess of joy and
celebration, Euphrosyne. She was a constellation belonging to the Olympus
constellation.

Along with the applause, some constellations lost their dignity and
screamed.

[Ohhh, Euph-ssi! Over here!]

To be precise, it was the Mass Production Maker next to me.

Suddenly, a memory from Ways of Survival came to mind. In the original
novel, there was a time when Euphrosyne emerged as the host of the
Gourmet Association Festival. At the time, Yoo Joonghyuk…

[Thank you for attending while you're so busy! Thank you for the owner
of Oro Castle, Immeasurable Austerity for lending us this place!]
Maybe he killed her.
[There are two main events today. Before that, I would like to introduce a
special guest. Maybe you've heard of these constellations? Today's guest is
from a planet that is emerging as a hot spot recently!]

I had an ominous feeling as firecrackers burst in one corner of the stage.

[Please clap for Anna Croft, a prophet from Earth!]

The noisy constellations fell silent simultaneously. I saw Anna Croft
climbing the stairs to the main stage.

…I see. I seemed to know why Anna Croft came to the Gourmet
Association at this time. She truly was a woman I couldn't like.

Anna Croft looked at the audience with her uniquely calm gaze and greeted
her with a bright smile.

"It is nice to meet you, constellations of the Gourmet Association. I am
Anna Croft, an incarnation of the nebula Asgard."

She looked dignified but the constellations were already frowning from the
moment she opened her mouth.

[The Gourmet Association has really fallen. I can't believe the food is
talking on the stage.]

[The Star Stream is degenerating these days.]

This was the Gourmet Association. It was a banquet of carefully
selected 'stories' for the gourmet constellations. It was a natural story but
the 'fresh incarnations' were the main ingredients of the story.

Anna Croft came to this place knowing it. "I might be lacking but I am the
host of the first event."

That's why this woman was scary.
[I don't know what food you have prepared.]

[Take it out now!]

The atmosphere heated up and it was Euphrosyne who tried to quickly
intervene.

[Now, everyone. Don't be too excited… isn't it okay to listen to the words
of the prey? Shouldn't you have some patience with your food?]

Euphrosyne smiled in a cheerful manner and the agitated
constellations paused for a moment. The clever Anna Croft didn't
miss this gap. "In recent years, the Star Stream is flooded with
obvious stories."

The provocative beginning caused the constellations to focus on her. Anna
Croft continued speaking. "The returnees, reincarnators, sword masters, 9th
circle magicians… even the same prophets. It all starts from being stronger
than others…"

There was a faint smile on Anna Croft's face.

"It is the reality of today's Star Stream, which is flooded with stories that
are created for the sake of fleeting fun."

The constellations looked impressed. It was as if they were amazed that
their food was telling a story. However, Anna Croft's story was just
beginning.

"it wasn't like this before. At the very least, the trend was different during
the first generation stories."

As if possessed, the constellations waited for Anna Croft's next words.
"In those days, the constellations loved stories. It was because the stories
were worthy. The dokkaebis gave a theme and the constellations explored
the form and aesthetics of it. At that time, the stories definitely reached the
realm of 'art'."

…Art. She was a truly scary woman. I could say this from the position of
an incarnation. The constellations looked nostalgic at Anna Croft's words.
Persephone could be seen among them. All of them were constellations
who survived those days.

[Interesting. Then you have a story that can satisfy our appetite?]

The person speaking was a demon king leaning against a corner of the hall.
Anna Croft wasn't panicked by the provocation and smiled.

"That's right. I am going to give you back the lost 'first generation' stories."

The constellation's expressions changed. Everyone doubted their ears.

"You don't like sword masters or 9th circle magicians. You like stories with
a theme of blood, sweat, tears and effort. I came here today to present you

with such a story."

The constellations reacted in different ways to Anna Croft's words. Some
shouted about how an incarnation was making a fool of them while others
were interested in what she was saying. There were also constellations who
responded skeptically, just like the Mass Production Maker by my side.

[…She is telling a stupid story. The current Gourmet Association won't find
such stories interesting. Isn't that right?]

"I agree."
There were certainly some great stories among the first generation but times
had changed. The constellations who already experienced stimulating
stories wouldn't be touched by stories that mimicked the first generation.

Still…Anna Croft couldn't be unaware of this. She was the most competent
incarnation in all of Ways of Survival.

I recalled the parts of Ways of Survival that were about her. In the original
novel, Anna Croft never held such an event at the Gourmet Association
Festival. However, there must be something similar to this.

At this moment, someone grabbed my shoulder. "Demon King of
Salvation!"
           Chapter 240: Ep. 45 - Gourmet Association, IV


I looked back and saw a woman with a familiar face. "Selena Kim?"

"Please, please save Iris!" The hand holding my shoulder was trembling.
The kind and calm Selena Kim was making this expression? "If this
continues, Iris will die…!"

At this moment, scenes of Ways of Survival crossed my mind.

「 "Anna, why did you do this… it didn't have to be this way!"

"It is a necessary thing."

"No, it isn't. This… the incarnations don't know anything! How can you do
this?"

"This is also to save humanity. Don't forget Selena. We were thrown into a
herd of predators that can eat us at any time." 」
It didn't happen in this round. However, the original version had already
been revised. In other words, it wasn't unusual for the work of another
round to occur in this round. Moreover, the story of the third regression was
deleted in the first revision.

"Selena Kim. Please tell me exactly precisely. What happened?"

Before Selena Kim could speak, the voices of the angry constellations
around me were heard.

[How dare an incarnation…!]

Fearsome gazes were pouring towards me and Selena Kim. Selena Kim
stiffened like a stone statue and turned pale. The Mass Production Maker
raised his status in order to protect me and sparks of probability appeared
around Selena Kim.

This 'central hall' was only for constellations. For a moment, I had forgotten
this was the Gourmet Association.

Selena Kim shut her mouth like a frightened goldfish and was dragged
away by a guide. Selena Kim was unable to rebel and stared at the stage
with resentful eyes.

I didn't know if the story that Selena Kim was about to tell me was the same
as Ways of Survival. Only one thing was certain. The reason why Selena
Kim came to me was involved with why Anna Croft was on the stage.

As I looked at the stage with troubled eyes, Anna Croft continued to talk
with blank eyes. "The story I'm going to tell you is the Bracelet
Expedition." The constellations made a fuss.

[…The Bracelet Expedition?]

"That's right."
[Are you going to parody the first generation story, Evil Blight Bracelet?]

Evil Blight Bracelet. It was mentioned in the original Ways of Survival and
was a story that was more of a classic than the Dragon Eating the Hammer
or Children of the Dawn Star. It was older than the first generation and was
closer to the zero generation.

The Bracelet Expedition was a typical expedition story where a group of 15
people went to burn a bracelet that was the source of a disaster.

The Mass Production Maker heard her words and muttered, [Huh… she
wants to reproduce that boring story?]

However, Anna Croft continued speaking without being concerned about
the reaction of the constellations. "I will introduce the Bracelet Expedition
that will lead this story."

Anna Croft clapped and a large panel appeared behind her. It was a huge
panel that covered the entire wall on one side of the hall. The panel showed
a vast forest where 15 incarnations were gathered.

–…Where the hell is this place?

–Are you sure Anna is right?

–Everyone, wake up. If we play well, we can get the highest rank sponsors.

I seemed to know what they were talking about. Looking closer, the
frightened Iris was among them. That's right. This was why Selena Kim…

A system message soon emerged like it had already been approved by the
dokkaebis.

[The sub scenario ― Bracelet Expedition has begun.]

[This scenario can acquire new stories depending on the success or failure.]
  * A total of 15 incarnations will participate in the scenario.

  * All incarnations must arrive at the volcano in the center of the
  huntingground through cooperation.

  * The expedition owns the Absolute Bracelet and the scenario is
  onlycompleted by throwing the bracelet into the volcano lava and
  destroying it.

  * Any incarnations who complete the scenario can make a wish to
  theGourmet Association.


The contents were just like the novel I knew. In the first place, the story
of the Evil Blight Bracelet was a homage to the novel… The scenario
message continued.



  * There are a large number of evil spirits in the hunting ground.
  Thescenario will fail if the expedition is destroyed by the evil spirits.

  * If the Absolute Bracelet isn't destroyed in the time limit, the
  scenariowill fail.


[Hoh… you have prepared this scenario. Interesting.]

Some of the constellations responded favourably. I considered it a poorly
designed scenario but there was a flavour in it that the constellations could
find. It was the replay of an old story. Anna Croft's aim was to ignite the
memories of the constellations of the Gourmet Association.

However, it was barely enough to satisfy the constellations of the Gourmet
Association.
[…Still, something is lacking. What do you want us to do? Don't tell me it
is just to watch this boring game.]

"As you can see from the panel, there are incarnations waiting for your
choice."

[Are we supposed to be their 'sponsors?']

"Of course, you can make that choice but it won't be much fun."

[That means…?]

"The constellations can directly participate in this scenario and taste the
freshest incarnations."

Along with Anna Croft, additional scenario messages were printed.


  * A total of 15 evil spirits will appear in the scenario.

  * All constellations in the Gourmet Association can apply for the
  'evilspirit' role on a first come, first served basis.


I was appalled the moment I heard the scenario message. Anna Croft was
aiming at this from the beginning. It was a scenario that brought out the
scent of the first generation while solving the desires of the constellations.

The constellations became heated up. There was a sense of excitement
different from the previous bustle. Even the Mass Production Maker
showed an interested expression.

One of the constellations asked. [What do you get from this scenario?]

"Nothing. I just hope that all of you will enjoy it."
The shameless smile shook me. There was no way she didn't want anything.
She was just trying to raise her position by saying this.

[Constellations of the Gourmet Association are showing favourability
towards incarnation 'Anna Croft'.]

Anna Croft's plot surpassed the cruelty of the constellations. She didn't care
about what she sacrificed for her own purposes. She had stabbed Yoo
Joonghyuk in the back more than 10 times.

"Then I'll start the scenario in one minute. Constellations who want to
apply, please sign in the selection window."

At Anna Croft's words, a selection window appeared in front of my eyes.

[Would you like to participate in this scenario?]

[Current number of applicants: 2/15]

At the place where a story was being made, there was an opportunity to
devour the subjects of the story. The number of applicants was rapidly
rising.

[Current number of applicants: 5/15]

I was once again reminded of why I came here. I had to make allies for the
Demon King Selection. In order to do this, it was better to participate in the
scenario. I would be able to become closer to them by sharing stories with
other constellations.

[Hahaha, I will eat the artwork.]

[It isn't expected?]

It might be time to admit it. I had become the 'constellation' I hated.

[Current number of applicants: 9/15]
Then I heard a 'baat' sound in my ears and a small panel popped up. It was
Biyoo's screen that only I could see.

–I will start the 857th competition!

It showed Yoo Joonghyuk attending the martial arts competition. Perhaps
he had become much stronger in the meantime because Yoo Joonghyuk
was continuously beating his opponents with the least movements possible.
I stared at his calm movements and thought as usual:

What would Yoo Joonghyuk do? At this moment, I seemed to meet Yoo
Joonghyuk's eyes. Of course, Yoo Joonghyuk wouldn't know that I was
watching. Even so, Yoo Joonghyuk seemed to talk to me.

「 "No matter how many times I return, my choice is the same." 」

No, maybe he already told me. In fact, I saw him make the same choice
many times.

「 "I will kill all of you, not leaving a single one." 」

So far, I had always made a different choice from Yoo Joonghyuk. I wasn't
Yoo Joonghyuk. Amidst the strong backlash, I always walked on a different
path.

Persephone was watching me from afar. She was waiting for something
interesting to happen. The constellation who lived for a long time knew
where the really interesting stories would start. Thus, she understood what I
was going to do from now on.

[Current number of applicants: 14/15]

I raised my hand towards the selection window.
Iris Vladimirovna Rebezova was born in Moscow. She grew up listening to
stories of revolution. Her favourite revolutionaries were Che Guevara and
the early Karl Marx.

However, the world she was born in wasn't the era of revolution. It was a
world dominated by desire and capital and determined by the owners of the
capital. Iris realized from a young age that there was no 'revolution' in this
era.

This was until the dokkaebis showed up.

–Haha, this is an interesting place. A world in which plant fibers are king.

Iris saw the collapse of many nations and realized that the revolution she
had been waiting for had begun. The world, which had been a place of the
haves and have-nots, once again melted back into turbulent currents.

The revolution could happen. The world could be changed. The young Iris
was convinced of this, at least until today.

"Aaaack!"

"Help me! Please!"

The upper body of an incarnation was completely separated.

[It is very fresh meat.]

The incarnations were torn apart by big teeth. The evil spirits wiped the
stories flowing from their lips and chuckled.

[I'm disappointed. Is this the story you wanted me to eat?]

[Hasty friend. Please wait. The scenario has just begun.]

[How am I supposed to wait? This is a parody story…]
"A-Ahh… ahhh…"

Her frightened companions urinated before the colossal 'status'. It was the
first time she thought that the word 'revolution' was so empty.

She couldn't resist. No one could stand up to such things.

"Iris! Run away! Run!"

Iris had the cries of her colleagues and ran. The twin ponytails she was
proud of were messed up by blood and sweat but she didn't care. At the
same time, she had the screams of her colleagues scattered through the
woods.

The footsteps of the evil spirits were coming closer. It was obvious what
would happen to her.

Run away? Damn, where could she escape to? In this small stage, where
could she flee? A vast array of trees surrounded her. No matter where she
ran, she couldn't leave this stage.

Iris cursed something that wasn't 'capital' for the first time. She cursed the
constellations. She cursed the Star Stream. She cursed this story.

Nevertheless, she still begged. Please, someone, change this story. Even a
very small salvation was okay, please. Please.

[The constellation 'Demon King of Salvation' is looking at you.]

To her surprise, salvation faced her.

[The constellation 'Demon King of Salvation' wants to establish a 'Sponsor
Contract' with you.]
           Chapter 241: Ep. 45 - Gourmet Association, V


Iris was confused.

Originally, she was supposed to sign a contract with a constellation of
Asgard. It was a lesser-grade constellation that wasn't well-known and Iris
didn't like the contract. That's why she participated in the Bracelet
Expedition hosted by Anna Croft. Anna said that if Iris showed a great
performance here, Anna could change her intended sponsor.

Now in this unexpected place, a chance came to Iris.

[The constellation 'Demon King of Salvation' wants to establish a 'Sponsor
Contract' with you.]

Thinking about it, there was no way constellations could only contract with
one incarnation. Some constellations had two or three depending on their
capacity. Of course, the power of the constellation was divided so the
incarnations received weakened stigmas.
Even so, Iris wasn't in a position to regret something like this. "I accept!"
[The constellation 'Demon King of Salvation' states that this contract is
only for a limited time.]

[The constellation 'Demon King of Salvation' states that this contract is
valid until the end of the Bracelet Expedition.]

Temporary contract…

'Yes, now isn't the time to be greedy'.

Iris bit her lips and nodded. By the way, the words of the constellation
weren't finished.

[The constellation 'Demon King of Salvation' says there is a condition.]

[The constellation 'Demon King of Salvation' wants the 'wish' to
be transferred to him after the scenario is completed.] Iris' mind
was complicated.

…It was a temporary contract and he wanted the wish? A strange regret
passed over her but she wasn't in a position to pass up this chance. The
Demon King of Salvation's condition was based on completing the
scenario. It meant he would keep her alive, no matter what happened.

"I'll definitely give it to you."

At the same time, a holographic contract descended in the air. Iris ran over
and signed the hologram.

[The Sponsor Contract has been completed.]

Power flowed into her body and she felt that someone was supporting her.
She felt confident that she could do anything. However, Iris' confidence
quickly disappeared at the cries from behind her.
[The incarnation hunting has begun.]

There were screams as incarnations were torn apart by evil spirits.




[Current number of expedition members remaining: 6 people]

In the original novel, this game was called 'Hunting and Chasting'. This
wasn't a Gourmet Association event, it was an event hosted by Anna Croft.
In this round, Anna Croft decided to skip the process and start from the
Gourmet Association.

I continued to mutter towards the air and the Mass Production Maker asked
me, [Hoh, you participated?]

"…Did you participate?"

[Huhu, I'm too old to run to scenarios like that. And… it doesn't suit my
tastes.]

In fact, not all members of the Gourmet Association were enthusiastic
about this scenario. On one side, there were the constellations who disliked
Anna Croft. On another side, there were the constellations who disliked the
event itself.

[Hmm. I don't see your modifier on the list of evil spirits…]

There were 15 constellations who participated in the scenario. However, the
number of constellations who chose the role of the evil spirit was only 14. I
nodded and the eyes of the Mass Production Maker slowly widened.

[Indeed, there was a reason the old hag Persephone brought you here. But is
it okay? You are here for the first time…]
I replied with a smile. "The more brilliant my debut, the better."

Then the system message arrived like it had been waiting.

[The story 'Gourmet Association Heretic' has been acquired.]

Maybe Anna Croft would be listening to messages similar to mine.

「 There is always a story in a place where many constellations gather. 」

This was the first principle of generating a story. The level of the story was
determined by combining the risk to the story subject and the form of the
story. Anna Croft was currently an 'incarnation' and she was walking a
tightrope. If her scenario was successfully completed, it might be a
legendary story such as 'Follower of the First Generation' or 'Story
Manipulator'.

I closed my eyes and saw what was happening with Iris.

[The constellation 'Demon King of Salvation' is looking at his incarnation.]

I felt sorry when I saw her shaking shoulders but I didn't have any good
memories for this child. I wasn't good enough to show kindness to her.
That's why this was just a gesture for 'trading'.

[The constellation 'Demon King of Salvation' says to stay calm.]

Iris gulped and replied.

–I don't know if I can do it.

[The constellation 'Demon King of Salvation' says there is no hopeless
scenario.]

All scenarios had holes to escape out of. The hole was small and tiny so it
was highly difficult to clear on the first try. This meant there was a chance
to clear it after trying a few times and I was a person who knew more about
this world than anyone else.

The sound of the evil spirits moving could be heard in the distance. Iris'
physique was at the limit and the only stigma I could pass on was
Sacrifice's Will. Dammit, that stigma wouldn't help in the current situation.
However, stigmas weren't the only things that constellations could give.

[The constellation 'Demon King of Salvation' is giving his incarnation the
'Assassination King's Cloak.]

Iris was surprised to see the gift that emerged in the air. It was an item I
bought for 150,000 coins from the Dokkaebi Bag. It had a usage limit of 30
minutes a day and lacked the ability to deceive the constellations, but the
current situation was different.

[…Here?]

The constellations emerged from the grass as if they were waiting. The
constellations that became evil spirits looked different. There were a giant
horned demon and a spirit with a bull's head holding a small scythe. The
only thing they had in common was that they had no feet and were
shrouded in a black cloak.

[Hmm, strange. It was definitely around here.]

[Did you see it properly?]

Iris disappeared and the constellations who were evil spirits couldn't
discover her traces at all. The constellations who played the role of evil
spirits were under strong restrictions. The constellations in the role of the
evil spirit could only one-tenth of their current 'status'.

For the constellations, a game wasn't fun if it was too easy. Just as there
were no humans who would rejoice in stepping on 15 bugs. They didn't
hesitate to impose constraints on themselves for entertainment. This was the
constellations of the Gourmet Association.

[It seems she must've done something. Let her run a bit more. The scenario
should be stacked up to taste better.]

[…Huhu, I'm looking forward to it.]

The constellations searching the grass soon gave up and Iris received a
system message.

[The expedition member Iris Vladimirovna Rebezova has survived an evil
spirit once.]

[The story 'Bracelet Expedition' has accumulated.]

This scenario was made up of classic stories. The longer Iris stayed in the
scenario, the more the energy of the classic story would permeate her.

–I-I lived!

[The constellation 'Demon King of Salvation' says you were lucky this
time.]

If these guys were high-ranking constellations, it would've been impossible
to hide from them using the Assassination King's Cloak.

However, just like Persephone and the Mass Production Maker, the really
high-ranking Gourmet Association constellations wouldn't run like dogs
towards this scenario. It was also interesting to watch other constellations
vent their desires in this event. In other words, they were the real audience I
should aim for.

–Thank you for the gift.

[The constellation 'Demon King of Salvation' says it is a loan.]
–…Yes.

[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' is sympathetic to your
incarnation.]

[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' reproaches your
harshness.]

The scenario would start from now on.


As the number of expedition members continued to decrease, Iris moved
towards the volcano while avoiding the eyes of the constellations. She also
had the good luck of collecting the bracelet from the expedition members
that died along the way.

[Current number of expedition members remaining: 2 people]

It was natural since I was participating in the scenario while reading Ways
of Survival in real-time. It was because Ways of Survival contained a very
detailed account of the Evil Blight Bracelet, the prototype of this scenario.

I analyzed the terrain using the scenario map and moved Iris along the most
efficient path towards the volcano.

[Haha, this is a fun story. Wasn't there a lot of delicious food? I'm
drooling…]

The other constellations seemed to notice that someone was involved on the
'expedition' side. Nevertheless, none of them were panicked.

[The expedition member 'Merves Lutier' has died!]

Shortly afterwards, Iris was alone.

[…It smells delicious.]
The scattered evil spirits were gathering near the volcano. They knew that
the last expedition member had to come to the volcano. Now the time of the
Assassination King's Cloak was almost up. I gave a signal to Iris.

[The constellation 'Demon King of Salvation' says to do it now.]

Iris started running towards the volcano. I stared at the back of the running
girl. All the constellations of the Gourmet Association were watching the
little girl running with all her might.

Perhaps, everyone knew. This girl, she had no choice but to die here.

"Ah…"

She was 100 steps away from the volcano when the privilege of the
Assassination King's Cloak finally ended. The 10 evil spirits wandering
around instantly gathered.

[I will eat first!]

Iris watched the incoming evil spirits and backed away with terror. Her last
desperate gaze was towards the sky.

[The constellation 'Demon King of Salvation' is asking to lend him your
incarnation body.]

Iris gasped as her mouth opened.

[The constellation 'Demon King of Salvation' says it isn't an 'advent'.]

If I manifested in the form of an 'advent', I would also be constrained by the
scenario. Thus, I wouldn't do it as an 'advent' this time.

I had a skill that was more efficient and consumed less probability. I
deliberately pulled out a few stories that made up my incarnation body in
order to deal myself a serious blow.
[Exclusive skill, Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint stage 3 has been
activated!]

[The 1st person supporting role viewpoint has been activated.]

[Your understanding of 'Iris Vladimirovna Rebezova' has increased!]

I opened my eyes to Iris' point of view. Maybe my body in the Gourmet
Association was currently sleeping. Thus, I had to end this game in the
shortest amount of time.

[Some constellations have noticed your presence!]

At the same time, there was an outpouring of true voices towards me.

[There was someone helping her. Who are you?]

[Hoh, is it an advent?]

[This windfall…!]

Iris received the accumulated stories and her body shone golden. I laughed
bitterly as I looked down at myself.

One way for a newcomer in the Gourmet Association was to grow step by
step. However, if I dragged it on like that, I might not be able to reach the
end of the story after 3,000 chapters.

[Did that Anna girl plan something? The person I just killed was a sword
master.]

One constellation walking in the distance spoke as he threw the incarnation
in his hands. Perhaps he was the last expedition member to die.

[You look like a new recruit. It is best for you to leave this place. Or else
your body will suffer a great blow.]
The head of the dead expedition member rolled towards me. It was the head
of the incarnation who fled to the end but eventually didn't survive. I
carefully picked up the head and one of the constellations sneered.

[Do you pity him? Huhu… this guy doesn't know art.]

"Why should their lives be your art?" I stroked his head and the memories
of the dead incarnation flowed in. The memories soon became a story that
dwelt at my fingertips.

[A fragment of the story 'Grudge of a Brutally Murdered Sword Master' has
been acquired.]

The constellations drew back with a frown.

[…You like dirty stories.]

"Dirty? You gave it to me."

Why did this person easily become a sword master? It was simple. He
originally received it from a constellation.

"The story is boring. The scenario is too slow. It is the power that all of you
gave them."

The things that were received gathered. Someone became a sword master.
Someone became a great magician. Then the sword master and great
magician became the sin. They all became the prey of these beings.

[What are you trying to do? Stop eating!]

A hot-tempered constellation raised the power of the evil spirit. Originally,
Iris couldn't defeat them. The expedition could never win against the evil
spirits. However—

The evil spirit screamed and retreated from the burning sword.
[Kuaaaack!]

In my hand was the sword I had purchased along with the Assassination
King's Cloak.


  [Item Information]

  Name: Eoren's Sword - Replica

  Rating: SS+ (Specific scenarios only)

  Description: A sword energized by a first generation story. Only female
  incarnations can use it and it can generate a force that resists evil spirits
  for 10 minutes.


It was a sword that cost 200,000 coins. It was also a sword that was useless
apart from in this scenario. Normally it was an item I would never buy.
[…A first generation sword?]

[Hey, don't be scared! It's just a replica version!]

In fact, I was really worried about it.

[Many constellations are astonished by your actions!]

I had wondered if it was worth taking this risk for this scenario. I measured
what I could get from it.

[Some members of the Gourmet Association are showing a strong hostility
to you!]

Some things should be calculated and some shouldn't. Then I made a
choice.
"You knew I would come to the volcano." I decided not to calculate things.
"Then did you know? I also knew you would be gathering here."

No matter what penalties were received or if the opponents were
constellations. I couldn't afford to pay attention to it.

Nevertheless, I smiled like always. "Let's start the real hunting."
            Chapter 242: Ep. 45 - Gourmet Association, VI


There were 10 constellations gathered here. I didn't know where the
remaining four were but maybe they were scattered somewhere in the
scenario area.

[If you don't yield…]

[I'll eat you too.]

The true voices of the constellations flowed from the mouths of the evil
spirits. I didn't hesitate and infused magic power into the sword.

[The exclusive skill 'Purest Sword Force Lv. 8' has been activated.]

It was Iris' magic power instead of mine. Still, Iris was an incarnation who
came all this way and her potential was considerable. The white energy was
added to Eoren's Sword and the aura around it became more abundant.
Eoren's Sword was a weapon that could deal a powerful blow to evil spirits
for 10 minutes. However, a powerful weapon didn't necessarily mean I
would dominate this place.

A constellation saw my sword and laughed.

[Hahah, slow down! Small constellation. Please entertain these old people!]

[What old people? I haven't lived 500 years yet. There are those older than
us.]

Was it because this was the first time I was attached to a young girl's body?
My sword could only draw a clumsy trajectory through the air.

The constellations might not be able to use all their power but a
constellation was a constellation. They ranged from historical-grade to
lesser-grade.

The constellations who gathered to become evil spirits released their status.
Iris' movements started to stiffen as the 10 constellations released their
energy. Her body thrashed like she was caught in an invisible spider web.
The spiders who trapped her were approaching.

I looked at Iris' body that was trembling regardless of my will and bit my
lips. It was always like this but this time would be different.

[Don't look down on me. I am also a constellation.]

So far, I had never properly released my status. I had been fighting my way
through the Demon Realm scenario in a sick state. However, I had been
steadily recovering my stories while riding on the Gourmet Association's
carriage. Thus, I might not be at a 100% state but I could use a 'status' that
was almost equal to it.

[The constellation 'status' is released.]
Some of my stories started responding to the situation.

[The historical-grade story 'Gourmet Association Heretic' is rebelling
against the surrounding oppression!]

[The legendary-grade story'Demon King of Salvation' is responded to
incarnation Iris' situation!]

The surrounding ground was split apart with a loud sound and the nearby
forest shook. The constellations were astonished by the flood of sparks in
the area.

In this scenario, the descended constellations could only use 10% of their
power. On the other hand, I used 'Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint' instead
of 'advent' and was able to release my original status.

[How can a newcomer have this much status?]

[…Is this really the 'advent' state?]

The constellations didn't know this fact and were almost terrified. They
were mistaking the current status as 10% of my original strength. It was the
reason I was pushing myself in such an unreasonable manner.

[Either die or get lost. Choose one or the other.]

I had to get them right not before they stopped being fooled.

[C-Cheeky bastard…!]

[…The Star Stream is really wide. Where did a guy like this pop up from?]

Some of the constellations shrank back from the pressure I gave off while
others were burning with enthusiasm.

[Ahahaha! The best dish. Today's Gourmet Association Festival is the
best!]
The constellations emitted terrible shrieks and the arms of the evil spirits
stretched towards this side. I hurriedly stepped back and swung my sword
but couldn't cut off the incoming arms. Iris' voice was heard in my head.

'S-Sorry! I'm a terrible swordsman…!'

Shit. This was why my movements were like this. Blood splashed as Iris
was wounded. Did they realize something from my movements? The
momentum of the constellations was changing.

[…Something is strange?]

The constellations spread out and carried out sporadic attacks using the
bodies of the evil spirits. I tried to defend by swinging the sword but it
wasn't easy since Iris' swordsmanship skill level was too low.

The result was quite different from when I was in Yoo Joonghyuk's body.
Once again, I realized how great Yoo Joonghyuk was.

[Indeed. only that guy's status is high. Get rid of him!]

[There is no need to worry about the sword. Hahaha, today we will eat!]

The worst situation that I wanted to somehow avoid was unfolding. The
attacks of the evil spirits flew from everywhere. There was a small scythe
that grazed my legs. A boomerang turned around and aimed at my back. A
long spear pierced through a gap and struck my side. In less than a minute,
Iris' body was covered with wounds and bruises.

My physical strength was rapidly dropping. I hurriedly opened Bookmark
and Way of the Wind but it felt awkward in Iris' body. Eventually, my
footsteps became twisted up and I was disoriented. The constellations
aimed for this short gap and stretched out their arms towards me.

"Kuek…"
Iris was caught by the neck and hung helplessly in the air.

[You have bad luck, newcomer.]

The constellations acted like it was over as they opened their mouths.

[It is eating time.]

Grotesque fangs grew and digestive juices dripped from their mouths. Since
they could customize the appearance of the evil spirits, it was really the
worst taste.

I opened my mouth without hesitation. "I will activate the fifth bookmark."
In fact, I didn't want to use this skill here. I wasn't sure if Iris' body could
endure it, nor did I want to consume an excessive amount of probability.
Nevertheless, there was no other way.

[The fifth bookmark is activated.]

The moment that Bookmark was activated, an unexpected message arrived.

[The skill is not suitable for this person.]

[The exclusive skill 'Miniaturization' is cancelled.]

[The exclusive skill 'Electrification' is cancelled.]

The power of Bookmark disappeared with the sound of sparks. Sometimes
a skill wasn't compatible with the chemistry of the body. But why did it
have to happen now? I never expected this.

[Is this your last hurrah? Yes, give it a try.]

Along with the ridiculing voice, a long tongue slipped out from the mouth
of the evil spirit and started to strangle Iris' throat. My prayers were blocked
and I turned blue. I could feel Iris' consciousness blurring. The connection
with Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint was weakening.
[The attribute effect has accelerated your thinking ability.]

Dozens of thoughts crossed my mind during this crisis until something was
caught in the net.

…I didn't know if it was possible. My understanding of the character was
still low. Still, I could try it.

"I will release Knight of Revolution Mark Javier from the sixth slot."

I released my 'status' as much as possible and instantly escaped from the
capture of the constellation. Then I continued speaking. "I will place the
Breaking the Sky Sword Saint Namgung Minyoung in that spot."

[The number six bookmark is activated.]

An immense presence permeated me. I felt all the things I've read, felt and
experience become one and nestle in my body.

[Your understanding of this person is insufficient!]

It felt like the first time I loaded Kyrgios Rodgraim.

[W-What…?!]

[…What power is this?]

Astonishment filled the eyes of the Gourmet Association constellations.

[The level of the character is too high to fully reproduce the skill level.]

[The level of the character is too high so only a part of the skill is
activated.]

[The duration of the bookmark is reduced due to a low understanding of the
character.]
The original Breaking the Sky Swordsmanship was a skill that could only
be used by women.

Yoo Joonghyuk overcame it with effort but it was unreasonable for me.

[Your current body configuration is similar to the physical makeup of the
character in question.]

To be exact, it would've been impossible with my original body.

[The exclusive skill 'Breaking the Sky Swordsmanship' Lv. 10 (+1) has
been activated.]

Thunder fell from the sky and nestled in Eoren's Sword. I released the
maximum amount of power possible at the optimum time. Everything was
over before the constellations even noticed the situation.

[The exclusive skill 'Breaking the Sky Thunder Sword' Lv. 10 (+1) has
been activated.]

The blue thunder that could overturn the earth flew from the sky and struck
everything in the area. The words of Ways of Survival passed through my
head.

「 The Murim don't consider the Breaking the Sky Sword Saint as one of
the 10 Grand Masters. 」

The bodies of the evil spirits scattered into ashes without even screaming.

「 The Murim people think of the Breaking the Sky Sword Saint as a type
of disaster. 」

Born as a small human and facing the constellations after hard work. This
was the strength of the Breaking the Sky Sword Saint, a disaster of Murim.

[The skill has exceeded the talent of the incarnation body.]
I felt something twisting as blood flowed. The result was obvious. It was a
force that Iris and I couldn't use because we weren't transcendents. The sky
blinked like a power failure had occurred.

The dazzling thunderbolts disappeared and there were no evil spirits left in
the surroundings.

[The constellation 'Brash Swamp Predator' has been eliminated from the
scenario.]

[The constellation 'Tranquil Island Gourmet' has been eliminated from the
scenario.]

[The constellation 'Forgotten Lord of Envy' has been eliminated from the
scenario.]

…

[A total of 10 constellations have been eliminated from the scenario.]

[You have earned an unbelievable achievement!]

[A series of impossible feats have been accomplished in a row!]

I was barely breathing as I looked up at the sky.

[The Star Stream is paying attention to your achievements.]

[A new story for you is being prepared.]

The constellation's status might've been extremely limited but they still
massacred the incarnations. Thus, there was no way I wouldn't get a story.

Blood emerged from my mouth while pouring simultaneously from my ears
and nose. Blood poured out from many holes and I almost became used to
the taste. Fortunately, the probability allowed by the Gourmet Association
meant I could still endure.
I plastered Iris' broken body with fragments of the story. The shock from
the Breaking the Sky Sword Saint's technique had already caused Iris'
consciousness to disappear.

[Constellations of the Gourmet Association are astonished by the contents
of the scenario.]

[Some constellations of the Gourmet Association have become hostile to
you.]

I knew I would be hated. However, there was always something to gain
from losing something.

[Some constellations of the Gourmet Association are very curious about
your story.]

[Some constellations of the Gourmet Association feel favourable towards
you.]

I stumbled away with Iris' body and headed towards the volcano. Iris would
survive once this scenario was completed. In order to complete the
scenario, I had to throw the bracelet into the volcano lava.

There wasn't much distance remaining. 40 steps, 30 steps, 20 steps…

My face became hot as I neared the lava. The cliff that I could throw the
bracelet was clear when I felt someone's presence. I expected them to
appear now. There were still four evil spirits that I hadn't finished off.

[Demon King of Salvation, you are doing something really interesting.]

The familiar voice entered my ears as I tightly gripped Eoren's Sword. I
looked back and a familiar looking girl stood there. She was an evil spirit
but her basic appearance hadn't changed at all.

I opened my mouth. "Asmodeus."
Asmodeus was ecstatic, as if feeling pleasure that his name was called.

[…Ah, let me call you again.]

The person who damaged Yoo Joonghyuk's body and was the main culprit
behind the third round failing.

I felt Asmodeus' status slowly approaching. This was the power of only
10%. As expected, one of the 72 demon kings was on a different
dimension.

I took a step back and vigilantly watched my surroundings. It was still a
difficult situation. Even if I removed this guy, there were still three more
evil spirits remaining. My chances of winning were gone if they came. So
before that…

[Don't be so vigilant. There are no other constellations.]

Three small heads were hanging from the small hands of the smiling
Asmodeus. The black cloak billowed around the severed heads. They
weren't the heads of incarnations.

A chill rose very slowly from the tip of my toes. In this brief moment, I
understood why Asmodeus was described as a madman in Ways of
Survival.

There was a cold smile on Asmodeus' face that was smeared with the blood
of constellations.

[I devoured all of them.]
          Chapter 243: Ep. 45 - Gourmet Association, VII


He ate all of them…

There was no guilt on Asmodeus' smiling face as he spoke such words.

[Several members of the Gourmet Association are strongly condemning
Asmodeus.]

[A small minority of the Gourmet Association are delighting in Asmodeus'
brutality.]

The members of the Gourmet Association were worn out by the years and
they varied in tendencies and taste. At first glance, the 'first generation'
stories seemed the best but there were some constellations like the Mass
Production Maker who preferred SSS-grade stories while others liked
unexpected developments like now.

[Huhu, the body of a constellation has a different physical quality. It isn't
real but…]
This was why demon kings like Asmodeus were accepted in the Gourmet
Association. Constellations, transcendents or demon kings, the Gourmet
Association was a place where stubborn children were more concentrated
than any other group, but they respected all types of gourmet delights.

I gulped as Asmodeus stepped into puddles of blood and slowly

approached. [The special effect of Eoren's Sword will end.]

I might've used the Breaking the Sky Sword Saint's techniques but it
worked properly thanks to Eoren's Sword. Without the sword, there would
be no way to deal with the evil spirits.

After half a dozen steps, Asmodeus licked his lips as he stared at me.

I stated, […You didn't come here to eat me.]

[Hmm, how can you be sure?]

[You can't get the giant story if you kill me.]

Asmodeus made a promise to me regarding the Demon King Advancement.
Thus, he couldn't kill me here.

[I promised a 30% stake. Why are you in this place?]

[There is no certainty that I will receive 30%.]

[Do you not have the confidence to compete with the other constellations?]

Asmodeus' expression hardened at my provocative words.

[Now you are provoking me?]

Asmodeus had a threatening air but I didn't feel nervous.
[If you are really a demon king, don't be a pushover. Compete properly to
obtain your share.]

In the first place, it was apparent that Asmodeus had appeared here to 'help
me'. He might be

Asmodeus but the act of attacking fellow members of the Gourmet
Association couldn't help being burdensome. Even so, he acted in such a
manner while pretending to be a 'maniac'.

Asmodeus' complexion paled as he shouted, [Demon King of Salvation…
You seem to be mistaken about something. I can eat you right now—]

[Don't repeat the same words and get the fuck out.]

Asmodeus' eyes widened. I continued without stopping.

[If you really want to eat me, kill me right now.]

The past me would've thought I was crazy if he saw this. This was
Asmodeus, not someone else. Nevertheless, there was a reason I acted like
this.

The 'status' of Asmodeus burned towards me. I got goosebumps from the
formidable force but believed in the 'story' that I read more than my senses.

「 At that time, we should've treated Asmodeus differently. 」

The revised version of Ways of Survival. I had found such a sentence in the
49th Yoo Joonghyuk's record.

「 Asmodeus loves beings who don't compromise. 」

「 The more he faces such a being, the greater the desire to beat them. 」

I didn't know how Yoo Joonghyuk gained such insight but if he was right,
all of Asmodeus' actions were understandable.
[Your understanding of the character 'Asmodeus' has increased.]

Then a phenomenon occurred.


[Your understanding of the character 'Asmodeus' has increased.]

[Your understanding of the character 'Asmodeus' has increased.]

The explosive indirect messages occurred as I started to understand the
inner surface of a demon king for the first time.

[Exclusive skill, Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint stage 2 has been
activated!]

「 I want to eat. 」

「 No. 」

「 I want to eat. 」

「 No. 」

「 Ahhhh… 」

A tremendous amount of thoughts rushed into my ears. It was appalling that
so much greed could exist in one being.

[It is really amazing…]

Asmodeus moved like the wind as he held a handful of Iris' hair and took a
slight breath.

[Haaaah… good. Yes, this is enough for today.]

"…"
[Still, keep this in mind, Demon King of Salvation. Next time won't be the
same as today…]

I didn't listen to Asmodeus' words and ran towards the volcano. I couldn't
miss this opportunity that I had barely gained. The lava could be seen right
in front of me. Way of the Wind caused the bracelet at my fingertips to fall
down the cliff. The bracelet melted with a clear sound.

[The sub scenario has ended.]

[You have obtained 150,000 coins as compensation.]

[Your awareness in the "Gourmet Association' has greatly increased!]

[You have acquired a new story!]

I poured the Ellain Forest Essence into the mouth of the completely
exhausted Iris. Her physical condition was a mess but recovery would be
fast due to not consuming much probability.

[The 1st person supporting role viewpoint has been released.]

There was the feeling of my environment being crushed and I returned to
the banquet hall of the Gourmet Association. My senses returned and the
first thing I heard was the voice of an old man.

[Young man, I enjoyed it.]

I realized I had returned when I saw the Mass Production Maker laughing
heartily. I looked at him for a moment before slightly bowing my head.

"…It is all thanks to you."

[Hrmm, what are you talking about?]

"It is this."
My hand was holding the 200,000 coins of garbage that Iris used just now,
Eoren's Sword. For reference, the grip of the sword had the following
message engraved:

―made by Mass Production Maker.

The Mass Production Maker laughed. [It was just business. Who knew that
sword would be sold today?]

"It was a recommended product in the Dokkaebi Bag."

[Huhu, how can a constellation know about the work of dokkaebis?"

I didn't know if this was the consideration of the Mass Production Maker or
not. One thing was for certain. This sword had saved the lives of Iris and I.

[By the way, things have become a bit difficult.]

I looked around. The atmosphere around me was tense.

[Who is the Demon King of Salvation?]

The constellations were running wild as they looked for me with fiery
anger. Among them was the constellations who had lost their bodies and
returned from the scenario.

[The constellation 'Brash Swamp Predator' reveals hostility towards you.]

[The constellation 'Tranquil Island Gourmet' is glaring at you.]

Euphrosyne was standing dumbfounded on the stage while Anna Croft was
pale. Now some of the constellations were watching me while wondering
what I was going to do. The sub scenario was over but for them, this
situation was an extension of the game. Of course, I wouldn't betray their
expectations.
[You have gained the 'wish ticket' according to the contract with the
incarnation 'Iris.]

[You can make one wish within the category allowed by the Gourmet
Association.]

It was within the category allowed by the Gourmet Association…

The meaning of this was obvious. I naturally couldn't wish for the
constellations to be killed.

[This is beyond the probability allowed by the wish.]

I couldn't wish for all the constellations to be on my side or to be their
master. It was naturally a wish that wasn't possible.

[This is beyond the probability allowed by the wish.]

In other words, this 'wish' was a type of diplomatic card. I had to identify
the possible and impossible areas and find the best wish for me.

[Some members of the Gourmet Association are showing a strong hostility
to you!]

[Many constellations are looking forward to your choice.]

Even the constellations in my channel were tense.

[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' is looking forward to
your choice.]

[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' is wriggling her fingers in a
trance.]

In front of all these eyes, I slowly opened my mouth.

[I wish that the Gourmet Association will show me courtesy.]
For a moment, a tremendous silence filled the hall. I didn't panic and looked
around in the silence.

[The probability of the Gourmet Association is activated!]

[Your wish has been received.]

Sparks filled the hall of the Gourmet Association. No, looking closer, they
were thunderbolts, not sparks. Then a loud voice was heard.

[Ahahaha! A really fun guy!]

Thursday's Thunder was holding a glass of beer while laughing.

[A story that was boring became worthwhile to see a bit. Why are you
complaining about and persecuting this small constellation?]

Some of the constellations rebelled strongly against his words.

[But the rules…!]

[The scenario is just a scenario. In addition, that scenario has ended. That's
all that my hammer and I know.]

Thor's hammer made a deafening sound like it wouldn't accept any
arguments. Thor of the Asgard nebula had one of the most powerful stories
in this place. No one here wanted to resist his hammer.

[It is unpleasant to agree with this rough thunder's words but this time, I
feel the same.]

The person who spoke was the Morning Star Goddess. Star powder fell
from her finely twisted hair as she moved.
[The scenario should end in the scenario. If you want to fight, fight in the
scenario. I don't want to see the Gourmet Association becoming uglier.]

The two top-ranking constellations present stood up so the
other constellations couldn't help wavering. Moreover, the
'wish ticket' had already been activated.

Some of the constellations were still glaring at me but they showed no signs
of hurting me. The atmosphere calmed down and the eyes of the Morning
Star Goddess turned to me.

[Still, I would like to ask one thing.]

It was an unexpected question and I reflexively looked at her.

[Demon King of Salvation. Why are you showing us such a scenario?]

The eyes of the goddess seemed to contain a galaxy. Now they show like
she had found a new star.

[In my eyes, you seem to have something to say. However, my eyes are
dark and I can't figure out the scenario you showed me. If you don't mind,
I'd like to hear it from your mouth.]

She didn't say that the scenario I showed was crude and this was probably
due to her innate humility. I could see Persephone smiling at me from
beside the Morning Star Goddess.

…I told you to do things yourself and this is the only way I can help you.

All the constellations of the Gourmet Association were looking at me. It
was the situation I had been wanting since I came here. What should I say
to gain favour with them? It would be stupid to think they would help me if
I just brought up the Demon King Selection story.
「 At that moment, Kim Dokja thought for the first time about what he
really wanted to say. 」

It was too far away and not yet visible. However, for at least one person
who walked on the path, it was clear. He failed thousands of times while
feeling frustrated and desperate.

There was someone who tried to take this road before me. I recalled the
man who walked on the road that no one else walked on and laughed. Then
I very naturally came up with some words.

[I…]

No, perhaps this was the only thing I had to say.
                  Chapter 244: Ep. 46 - New Story, I


[I will create a 'new story' that never existed before.]

The constellations shut their mouths at my words. It wasn't just because
they were shocked. Rather, they didn't understand what I was saying.

The first one to speak was a constellation drinking beside Thor. [What do
you mean by a new story?]

According to Ways of Survival, the Dokkaebi King left these words a long
time ago:

「 There are no new stories in the Star Stream. All stories are just based on
old stories. 」

This old saying was the humility of the dokkaebis and was a phrase that
needed to be overcome.

I hesitated to answer and a hot-tempered constellation came out first.
[Is there a sword master in the story?]

Sword master… I nodded at the unexpected question.

[There is.]

Some constellations sighed at my response while others had shining eyes.
Then another constellation asked. [Is there a great magician?]

[Maybe one will appear.]

[A reincarnator?]

[Yes.]

[An SSS-grade hunter? For reference, I like friends who are rewarded for a
reasonable effort.]

[It is a possibility. I don't dislike this who try hard.]

[A returnee will naturally come out?]

The various questions continued for a while, as if it was fun. In the process,
there were those who smiled and those who shook their heads. No matter
their expression, they were all imagining a story.

It was a story that hadn't been created yet. However, it was a story that
might exist. Was it because it had been a long time since the Gourmet
Association jumped into such 'imagination?' For a while, there was a gentle
atmosphere in the hall that didn't fit the Gourmet Association.

However, the atmosphere didn't stay like this.

[I don't understand. Aren't there many of these stories already?]

The one who poured cold water on it was the Morning Star Goddess.
[Sword masters, great magicians reincarnators, returnees… what is new
about this story? I don't know how such a product can be considered as
'new'.]

I thought for a moment before replying, [It isn't just new materials that
make up a new story. Aren't the first generation stories that the Gourmet
Association likes also made up of ordinary materials?]

[Are you comparing the first generation of art with your story?]

[I don't mean to compare it. In the first place, I'm not trying to make art.]

Some constellations looked disappointed at my words. The Morning Star
goddess laughed like it was ridiculous.

[You are speaking vulgar words. Yes, good. Then what is new about your
story?]

The atmosphere of the constellations was changing again. As expected, I
couldn't throw a few things around casually. I faced them and declared in
my true voice,

[In the story I'm creating, there will be an end to all scenarios.]

The end of all the scenarios. The atmosphere instantly froze.

[H-How dare you…]

Some people muttered while other constellations became pale. There was a
backlash that didn't occur even when I mentioned the first generation.
Perhaps it was because I broke their taboo.

I felt the gazes pouring towards me and closed my eyes. This wouldn't
dramatically change the situation. However, my story would remain deep in
the mind of the constellations. It was enough for now.

[…Crazy bastard.]
By the way, it seemed that the impression I gave them was too deep. The
voice filled with hostility continued.

[I knew that there were all types of crazy people in the Gourmet
Association but this time it is quite good. Are you in your right mind to say
such words?] It was a green doll with a dragon's head. It was the Brash
Swamp Predator. A constellation who was active in the previous scenario.
His smile was full of ridicule as he continued,

[Then what do you want us to help you with? Let's go together to the end of
the scenario, is that what you want to say?]

[That's right. I came here to find constellations who will reach the end of
the scenario with me.]

My calm declaration caused the countenance of the constellations to
change. Some of them had already joined a nebula. Thus, my words would
sound like a provocation.

[Nebula? What is the name of the nebula?]

[There is no name yet. I haven't formally established it.]

[Hmm… how many founding members are there?]

[Two.]

The scorn of the constellations increased. I felt a bit upset but I put up with
it

In any case, this was considered 'courtesy' in the Gourmet Association. I
didn't think any of them would just accept it.

The Morning Star Goddess asked, [One is you and the other person? Is it a
constellation?]

[It isn't a constellation…]
I hesitated to reveal Yoo Joonghyuk. The Brash Swamp Predator wondered,
[Perhaps it is that guy?]

Images were playing from a panel on the screen. It was playing the finals of
the martial arts competition in First Murim.

–It is finally the confrontation you are waiting for!

The camera focused on a man as the moderator spoke.

–The disciple of the Breaking the Sky Sword Saint, Supreme King Yoo
Joonghyuk!

As expected, Yoo Joonghyuk had safely reached the finals. Then the
opponent…?

–One of the Murim's 10 Grand Masters, the Ice Flower Goddess, Zhuge
Lingling!

A splendid spotlight shone on Zhuge Lingling, who was dressed in a light
tshirt and jeans.

The Ice Flower Goddess wasn't an easy opponent. She was one of the
transcendent existences that represented Murim. Originally, Yoo
Joonghyuk wouldn't have been able to compete with her. It depended on
how much progress he made in the Breaking the Sky Swordsmanship in the
meantime…

[Cough…]

My mind became wide awake the moment someone made a sound. I looked
around. Then I gradually became angry.

…Dammit. Someone had uploaded this video. I stared at Anna Croft who
was standing in a corner of the stage. However, based on her expression, it
didn't seem to be her. If so, the video…
[Huhu… a feast of mortals…]

The Brash Swamp Predator laughed.

[Gosh, this is really losing steam. An existence that just reached the
narrative level and a trivial mortal is discussing the 'end of the story'?]

Several constellations laughed like they had been waiting. It was a laugh
that denied all the words I had spoken. Maybe I expected it to be like this. It
might've been wrong to expect anything from the constellations in the first
place.

[Hahaha, what is the modifier of this constellation? Was it Demon King of
Bragging?]

[Queen of the Underworld! You brought a very delightful friend!]

On the screen, Yoo Joonghyuk was confronting the Ice Flower Goddess.
The Brash Swamp Predator chuckled like he thought it was cute.

[This scenario seems tough for him, let alone the end of the scenarios.]

I quietly clenched my fists. I knew the path Yoo Joonghyuk would walk
and the achievement he would make in the future. I knew very well that the
hardworking guy would one day kill every member of this damn Gourmet
Association.

Yet in the eyes of the constellations present here, the current Yoo
Joonghyuk was just a trivial mortal.

[This worked out well. I am bored because the scenario is over. Do you
want to make a bet? Who will win between the two bugs?]

[Oh, good, good!]

A number of constellations agreed with the proposal of the Brash Swamp
Predator. Then a system message appeared.
[A new sub-scenario has arrived!]

[The sub scenario ― Gourmet Association Betting has begun.]

Numerous selection windows emerged in front of the constellations.

[I'll bet 50,000 coins on that female.]

The moment the Brash Swamp Predator cried out, the other constellations
laughed and bet a few coins. Then the Brash Swamp Predator glanced at
me. [Newcomer. You should also bet.]

[I already did it.]

[Who did you bet on?]

[100,000 coins to Yoo Joonghyuk.]

The fact that I bet twice as much as him caused the Brash Swamp Predator's
eyes to widen.

[Cheeky fellow. You will regret it.]

He seemed to know how this bet would turn out. In the distance, Anna
Croft was watching me with serene eyes. Yoo Joonghyuk's struggle was
entering the mid-stages on the screen.

[Hoh, he is fairly decent? Should I make him my incarnation?]

Yoo Joonghyuk seemed to be pushed at first but his momentum was slowly
becoming stronger. Some of the constellations admired the unexpected flow
of events. Then they shut up as soon as the Brash Swamp Predator glared at
them.

As expected from Yoo Joonghyuk. His encounter with the Breaking the
Sky Sword Saint was much earlier than planned and his Breaking the Sky
Swordsmanship had reached higher than the original level.
Inside the stadium, the Breaking the Sky energy exploded and the Ice
Flower Goddess coughed up blood as she rolled through the dust. The
situation had completely tilted to one side. The story flowed to an
unexpected place and the expression of the Brash Swamp Predator changed.

[…Hmm, it isn't fun like this.]

The moment I had an ominous feeling, sparks appeared around several
members of the Gourmet Association, including the Brash Swamp Predator.
I quickly realized what they were doing. Their sparks spread to the screen
showing the martial arts competition. To be exact, it was to the Ice Flower
Goddess.

–Aaaaack!

The Ice Flower Goddess screamed and this was followed by the host's
words.

–W-What is this?

Yoo Joonghyuk also seemed surprised. Yoo Joonghyuk's expression
stiffened as the Ice Flower Goddess mutated into a monster. I stared at the
Brash Swamp Predator and spoke in a cold voice, [Didn't you say this was a
bet?] The Brash Swamp Predator laughed.

[I didn't say there could be no interference.]

Thanks to the probability supplied by many constellations, the body of the
Ice Flower Goddess was covered in green scales.

Both Yoo Joonghyuk and I knew what it meant. It was a constellation's
'advent'. It was the same in Peace Land and Dark Castle. At the time, Yoo
Joonghyuk and I fought together but not anymore.

[Exclusive skill, Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint has been activated!]
[You can't connect with the current target.]

…Damn jerk, what was he doing at a time like this? It was impossible to
use Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint because Yoo Joonghyuk wasn't
thinking about me at all.

On the screen, the Ice Flower Goddess who was half a green dragon roared.

The Brash Swamp Predator. The ancient being who was born on the planet
'Selegedon' was a constellation who just reached the narrative-grade like
me. However, the number of stories he accumulated was far beyond me so
our abilities were on a different level.

With one breath, the monster half-destroyed the venue of the martial arts
competition. Maybe he signed a Sponsor Contract with the Ice Flower
Goddess for a short period of time. The low rate of synchronization meant
not a lot of his strength was expressed. Still, it would be nothing to end the
competition since it was strengthened with such a degree of probability.

It would be hard to deal with a narrative-grade constellation who had
accumulated such stories, even if it was Yoo Joonghyuk.

[You look uneasy. Don't you believe in your

colleague?] I looked around and saw Persephone

smiling as usual.

I didn't believe in him? It was a natural story. I couldn't believe in that
sunfish who often died…

[I believe in him.]

Even so, I answered it like this. Persephone's eyes flashed at my natural
answer.

[In the first place, I came here because I believed in him.]
I stared at Yoo Joonghyuk on the screen. It didn't matter how many times
he was defeated, broken or felt despair. He was a person who didn't give up
until the end. If I couldn't believe in him, who could I believe in the first
place? Even if this round failed…

This guy would surely see the ending of this world eventually.

I slowly closed my eyes before opening them again.

[I'll raise my bet. I'll make it one million coins.]
                 Chapter 245: Ep. 46 - New Story, II


[The constellation 'Demon King of Salvation' has placed one million coins
on the incarnation 'Yoo Joonghyuk'.]

The system message resonated in the hall and the attention of the
constellations focused on me. I bet my money on a fight that was obviously
disadvantageous. My actions intrigued some of the constellations.

[The constellation 'Thursday's Thunder' is showing favourability to you.]

[The constellation 'Morning Star Goddess' is showing favourability to you.]

However, only a few constellations showed such a response. Most of the
constellations were swept away by the heat of the gambling.

[Hahaha! You are crazy! If so, I'll bet 500,000 coins!]
The Brash Swamp Predator, who bet on the Ice Flower Goddess from the
beginning, opened his mouth first. Then the watching constellations started
to join one by one.

[The constellation 'Tranquil Island Gourmet' has placed 20,000 coins on the
constellation 'Zhuge Lingling'.]

[The constellation 'Master of the White Castle' has placed 30,000 coins on
the constellation 'Zhuge Lingling'.]

…

The messages were pouring out. Most of them were messages giving coins
to the Ice Flower Goddess, Zhuge Lingling. I was the only one who was on
Yoo Joonghyuk's side.

[The constellation 'Queen of the Darkest Spring' has placed 300,000 coins
on the incarnation 'Yoo Joonghyuk'.]

…Huh?

I reflexively glanced at Persephone who was giving a mysterious smile. I
asked in a slightly worried tone, […Will it be okay?]

[Um? Why are you asking if it will be okay?]

I was the one who had nothing to reply. Maybe it was nothing for
Persephone to bet 300,000 coins. By the way, there was a meddlesome man
beside me.

[Hum, old hag. Doesn't Hades nag you when you spend money like this?]

[I'm not a grandmother so the Mass Production Maker should mind your
words.]

[An old woman at your age should eat moderately…]
[Watch your mouth unless you want to be stuck in Tartarus… wait, did you
bet as well?]

The Mass Production Maker laughed at Persephone's question.

[The constellation 'Mass Production Maker' has placed 150,000 coins on
the incarnation 'Yoo Joonghyuk'.]

The Mass Production Maker looked at me and said, [I didn't bet a lot
because I didn't receive that much gold from this month's Dokkaebi Bag
settlement.]

In fact, he bet the exact price of Eoren's Sword that I bought. Maybe there
would be no income apart from the commission fee.

In any case, I was grateful to them. Thanks to this, more excited
constellations were betting coins.

[The constellation 'Goddess of Joy and Celebration' has placed 50,000 coins
on the constellation 'Zhuge Lingling'.]

The coins placed on the bets snowballed and soon surpassed six
million coins. Now the constellations of the Gourmet Association
couldn't help shifting their gaze to one place. [Die! Kill him quickly!]

[I'll kill you if I lose my coins!]

They were no different from the human spectators in the arena… I felt
strangely excited despite experiencing these 'stories'. The Mass Production
Maker laughed as if he read my heart.

[I've gone through these 'stories' so I'm hungrier for these stories.]

[…Maybe not.]
[Whether it is a constellation or human, they are all just children in front of
the story. By the way, is there a chance of winning?]

[Do you feel uneasy?]

[No, it isn't like that…]

[If there isn't a chance to win, I'll have to make it.]

To be precise, I had to make it a high multiplier. If Yoo Joonghyuk died,
this round would be ruined. If the situation was like this, it was better to do
it properly.

[The exclusive skill, 'Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint' has been activated!]

We couldn't lose.

[You can't connect with the current target.]

Shit, Yoo Joonghyuk… I was still getting this message. However, it wasn't
the only method.

"Biyoo."

[Baat.]

As I waited, Biyoo moved her hand and a personal panel popped up in front
of me. The screen soon unfolded.

The Brash Swamp Predator cried out strangely and let out a terrible
poisonous fog.

–Uwaaaack!

Everyone touched by the smoke screamed as they oxidized. Judging from
the Brash Swamp Predator's state, he was using roughly one-third of his
status. One-third was enough to ruin the venue. The surrounding
constellations were also supporting his use of probability.

The grounds of the venue were split apart by the monster's feet. It was a
terrible destructive power. However, it wasn't as strong compared to Peace
Land or Dark Castle. At those times, the outer gods had descended.

Still, there was no guarantee that this situation was better than Peace Land
or Dark Castle. In Peace Land, there was the Paradox Baekchung, Kyrgios.
In Dark Castle, there was Goryeo's First Sword.

…Then who was present now?

[The constellation 'Demon King of Salvation' is looking at incarnation Yoo
Joonghyuk.]

Yoo Joonghyuk frowned at my message. "…Kim Dokja. Is your work
finished?"

[The constellation 'Demon King of Salvation' says it is still in progress.]

"Still?"

At this moment, a shadow of suspicion filled Yoo Joonghyuk's eyes. Yoo
Joonghyuk stared at the Brash Swamp Predator and asked, "Perhaps…
did this guy appear because of you?" The bastard noticed quickly.

"…Kim Dokja?" He was filled with tremendous anger.

I reached out as an apology.

[The constellation 'Demon King of Salvation' has sponsored 100 coins to
the incarnation 'Yoo Joonghyuk'.]

"I don't need it!"
Then the Brash Swamp Predator moved. He was an ancient lizard that
governed all the swamps on his planet. The embodiment of his head was
suddenly rising from the back of the Ice Flower Goddess who had become a
lizard.

There was a terrible scream as the incarnation was deprived of her body.
The lizard screamed and rushed forward, swinging a huge tail towards Yoo
Joonghyuk. The tail of the lizard smashed through Yoo Joonghyuk's Strong
Self-Defense and he was hit hard.

"Kuk…"

Yoo Joonghyuk didn't seem to have reached the second stage of
transcendence yet. Well, it would be impossible for even Yoo Joonghyuk to
reach the second stage of transcendence in just two weeks.

It could be called a devil's talent that he could drive the first stage Ice
Flower Goddess to such a state.

Then there wasn't much time.

[The constellation 'Demon King of Salvation' is making a request.]

Yoo Joonghyuk had experienced Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint several
times and should I what I was asking for. By the way, Yoo Joonghyuk's
reaction was unexpected. "I don't want to."

[The constellation 'Demon King of Salvation' says if this continues,
everyone will die.]

"I won't die."

[The constellation 'Demon King of Salvation' says it isn't the time to be
stubborn.]

I wasn't convinced I could knock down that monster even if I used
Electrification in Yoo Joonghyuk's body. There might be a way to use the
Fourth Wall like last time but it was only possible for constellations who
used mental skills.

Yoo Joonghyuk used swift footwork to attack and the Brash Swamp
Predator once again prepared his poison. Based on the number of sparks
around his mouth, this was a really devastating attack.

I urged Yoo Joonghyuk but Yoo Joonghyuk was adamant. "Go and do what
you have to do, Kim Dokja."

I panicked at the unexpected action. No, why was this bastard so stubborn
today? I hurriedly looked around. Since it was like this, I had to borrow
another hand, even if the martial arts competition was ruined.

In this place, there was only one person strong enough to help us. The
Breaking the Sky Sword Saint, Namgung Minyoung. She was a
powerhouse who wouldn't be pushed by Kyrgios or Cheok Jungyeong.
Thus, she could deal with this monster alone. Soon afterwards, I found the
Breaking the Sky Sword Saint sitting in the audience while eating
dumplings.

[The constellation 'Demon King of Salvation' is asking for help.]

Despite my message, the Breaking the Sky Sword Saint just kept chewing
the dumplings. She sometimes fed dumplings to the Breaking the Sky
Master lying next to her. In the seats below them, Jang Hayoung and Han
Myungoh were sitting beside each other while also eating dumplings.

…What were these humans doing? Then I once again sent a message.

[The constellation 'Demon King of Salvation'…]

At this moment, Yoo Joonghyuk spoke. "…Shin Yoosung. Are you
listening?"
Biyoo appeared along with these words.

[…Baat?]

"Turn off Kim Dokja's screen."

Biyoo glanced at Yoo Joonghyuk like it was difficult. I didn't know how
much of Shin Yoosung's memories survived but when I thought about it,
these two people had a very complex relationship.

Nevertheless, this was a story from before her rebirth. Now it was different.
There was no reason for Biyoo to listen to Yoo Joonghyuk when she was
my dokkaebi. Yet Biyoo sitting on my shoulders suddenly looked at me
with a sorry expression. [Baat, baaat…]

"…Biyoo?"

[Baaat… Ku…kuooh…]

There was absurd acting and Biyoo pretended to fall asleep. At the same
time, my personal panel turned off and Yoo Joonghyuk's appearance
disappeared.

[You have been disconnected.]

"No, what is this…!"

I didn't know what was happening. Why did Biyoo act like this all of a
sudden? There was no mention of this situation in the revised Ways of
Survival?

–Waaahhhhhhhh!

There was a sudden scream and I turned my attention to the panel installed
on the stage.

[That…?]
The surprised constellations started moving towards the panel. Persephone
and the Mass Production Maker were also approaching the panel. The
screen was completely obscured by the more than 100 constellations
gathered in front of it.

[No, wait a minute! Let me look!]

I tried to enter any gaps but the cluster of constellations was too hard. All I
could hear was the sound of thunder from the screen. Still, it was clear from
the sound alone.

It was the Breaking the Sky Thunder Sword. It was the real thunder sword,
unlike what I had stolen. It seemed to be a devastating hit as the Brash
Swamp Predator let out a huge scream.

The answer was obvious even without looking. Fortunately, there was the
Breaking the Sky Sword Saint.

I let out a sigh of relief. Yoo Joonghyuk was unharmed because the
Breaking the Sky Sword Saint had acted. Thanks to this, the martial arts
competition would be cancelled but it was better than Yoo Joonghyuk
dying.

Then someone suddenly shouted,

–Oh, the disciple of the Breaking the Sky Sword!

–Breaking the Sky Sword Beauty!

…Breaking the Sky Sword Beauty?

[We shouldn't disparage an incarnation's martial arts.]

[H-How is this… wasn't it only the power of transcendence…?]

[Hahaha, it is an interesting ability. Is it something that Asgardian person
did?]
[It isn't to my taste.]

The true voices in the halls were becoming heated up for an unknown
reason.

[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' is astonished.]

[The constellation who likes to change sex is struggling with pleasure.]

[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' is shedding resentful tears.]

The channel and the banquet hall. I was dizzy from the indirect messages
coming from everywhere.

[My coins! No! My coins…!]

[Uwaaaaaah!]

No, what the hell was going on? I held my breath and used my 'status' to
move through the constellations. I barely reached the front of the panel and
another tremendous lightning attack came from the screen. The entire
screen turned white from the powerful lightning.

The light slowly faded and once it disappeared, black ashes were scattered
like snow. In front of my eyes, one man was standing still. It was the
appearance of Yoo Joonghyuk who had raised his sword with an arrogant
expression.

Under his feet while a giant lizard charred by lightning. Yoo Joonghyuk
stepped off the lizard's body and walked to one corner of the venue, pulling
out something black that had been plugged in.

–There is no second place in this competition.

It was the Black Heavenly Demon Sword.

–Thus, this is mine.
Then the host's voice rang out.

–The winner of the Martial Arts Competition has been decided!

I didn't know how such a thing was possible. I rubbed my eyes and glanced
again. The situation was still the same. It wasn't the Breaking the Sky
Sword Saint but… Yoo Joonghyuk?

–The winner is the Breaking the Sky Sword Beauty, Yoo Joonghyuk!

No, what the hell was the Breaking the Sky Sword Beauty…? My questions
didn't last for long. It was due to the overwhelming system messages that
entered my ears.

[The sub scenario ― Gourmet Association Betting has been completed.]

[You have won the bet.]

[You have acquired a new story!]

[The story 'Miracle Gambler' has been acquired.]

Then there was the sound of coins falling.

[The sub scenario compensation has been acquired.]

I reflexively checked my number of coins. The numbers slowly creaked up,
as if it was too hard to handle.

[Coins Possessed: 1,986,725 C]

…

[Coins Possessed: 2,790,876 C]

…
[Coins Possessed: 3,890,875 C]

The coins that the constellations bet were being stacked up like snow on my
balance.
                Chapter 246: Ep. 46 - New Story, III


[Coins Possessed: 5,490,875 C]

The endlessly climbing coins finally stopped at the peak. I doubted my eyes
several times as I stared at this unbelievable number.

[…Young man, how much did you earn?]

I looked around and saw the Mass Production Maker's blank expression.
The old man must've made a great profit since he bet 150,000 coins earlier.
The dividend must be at least five times…

[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' envies you.]

[The constellation 'Loan Shark Aiming for the Heart' is craving your coins!]

Even the always stern looking Persephone was smiling. For reference, the
queen of the Underworld bet 300,000 coins.
…The Underworld must've gained a lot?

[Nonsense! This is ridiculous!]

Most of the constellations were filled with great despair apart from the
three of us. I just needed to see their expressions to know how much coins
they had lost. The constellations who bet a small amount to relieve their
boredom looked sad but those who bet over 100,000 coins…

[Uwaaah!]

They were filled with anger. There were some constellations on the verge
of bankruptcy. For example, that guy.

[The constellation 'Brash Swamp Predator' is revealing enormous hostility
towards you.]

[Grab that guy!]

The constellations who lost their coins, including the Brash Swamp
Predator' were approaching me. He lost his reason along with the coins and
was prepared to throw himself into Han River.

The constellations who noticed withdrew from my side. However, there
was one constellation who didn't back down. It was the queen of the
Underworld, Persephone.

[Everybody back off. How long are you going to act so ugly?]

Her 'status' was reminiscent of the cold night air and the approaching
constellations faltered. However, some constellations were so agitated that
they couldn't be cooled by the night breeze.

[Queen of the Underworld! Did you win some coins just now?]

[Get out of here! It has nothing to do with you!]
The atmosphere became heated and some of the watching high-
ranking constellations intervened. [Maintain your courtesy.]

It was the Morning Star Goddess who was familiar with Persephone.
Nevertheless, the Brash Swamp Predator had already lost his senses and
didn't hesitate.

[…Courtesy? Fuck courtesy…!]

As soon as the Brash Swamp Predator released his status, the other
constellations also raised their status. Powerful sparks filled the air as a
notice of the imminent conflict.

[The wish ticket used by the constellation 'Demon King of Salvation' is in
effect.]

Suddenly, intense sparks filled the hall and the movements of the agitated
constellations stopped. A portal opened on the white ceiling while everyone
hesitated. Beyond the portal was a sinister aura. It wasn't an outer god but it
was clearly something immense.

Who was this? This was obviously above the highest ranked
constellations…

The atmosphere tore apart and a strange creature appeared through the
portal. The mysterious aura around his body was unmatched but he was
neither a god or constellation. The man was dressed in a magician's
costume with an old-fashioned cane.

[…A dokkaebi?]

It was a dokkaebi.

[It has been a while, constellations.]
The hall fell silent with a single sentence, like cold water had been poured
on it. It was an overbearing silence. The enraged constellations who had
just been screaming were holding their breaths.

[The rules of the Star Stream binds all constellations of the Gourmet
Association.]

All the constellations present were constricted by the probability. It was
absolutely impossible for an ordinary dokkaebi, even if they had the
channel operating rights.

[U-Uhhh…]

The Brash Swamp Predator, who didn't falter despite the threats from high
ranking constellations, was taking a step back with a white face. I had seen
a description of this dokkaebi in the original novel.

「 Most incarnations think there are only four ranks of dokkaebis. The
lesser-grade, intermediate grade, semi-advanced and senior dokkaebis.
However, there are dokkaebis above them. 」

「 The dokkaebis of the Star Stream, those with up to twelve coloured
horns are the 'first seat'.」

This dokkaebi had seven red horns coming from his head. The Star Stream
called them 'great dokkaebis'.

[Sorry but the party will end here.]




As I read Ways of Survival, I had a question about the relationship between
the constellations and dokkaebis.
The dokkaebis might have special powers but a high-ranking constellation
could kill one or two dokkaebis. Yet even the strong constellations didn't
touch the dokkaebis. No matter how annoying the scenario, they never tried
to kill the dokkaebis.

…Why? The reason was right in front of me. A single hand gesture trapped
all of the Gourmet Association in a net of probability.

I had never seen such dense sparks before. This was the power of the 'story'.
Perhaps it was a story borrowed from the most powerful beings in the
world.

Whether it was narrative-grade or historical-grade, they clearly couldn't
escape from the storm of sparks without being destroyed.

The high-grade constellations such as Thursday's Thunder or Morning Star
Goddess didn't complain and only showed unpleasant expressions. It was
Persephone who opened her mouth first. [Great Dokkaebi Halong. It's been
a while.]

The great dokkaebi slowly looked around.

[It has been a while, Queen of the Underworld.]

[Is the Story King well?]

[The king is safe.]

Due to the opponent, Persephone's expression was in a state of tension that
I had never seen before.

[Why did you come here? In addition, leading dokkaebis of the executive
branch…]

The dokkaebis of the executive department whom I had once seen were
standing in a line behind the great dokkaebis. The fearsome pressure they
emitted was no less than the Gourmet Association constellations. It was
natural.

The dokkaebis of the executive branch were once constellations. Instead of
replying immediately to Persephone's words, the great dokkaebi swept over
the constellations.

[We are here to pick up the constellations who borrowed coins.]

[…Coins?]

Several constellations groaned and started to run away. The Mass
Production Maker muttered with understanding.

[They are really foolish…]

It seemed that some constellations had borrowed coins from the dokkaebis
to make their bets. Funnily enough, one of them was the Brash Swamp
Predator.

[Uhh… move, move out of the way!]

He rushed to a sparkling wall and tried to rip apart the net of probability.

[Kuaaaack!]

The great dokkaebi's net was powerful. The moment he reached the net of
sparks, the Brash Swamp Predator screamed. The dokkaebis of the
executive branch bound his incarnation body.

[R-Release me!]

I stared at the rows of constellations and thought about why the dokkaebis
appeared here. I didn't know the exact reason but I wondered if it was
because the probability was influenced by my wish. In this world, the
dokkaebis were the most sensitive to probability.
In a flash, the dokkaebis arrested all the people who owed debts and started
to transport them across the portal. It was a swift move like there was
nothing to see.

The great dokkaebi didn't say goodbye. He stared as if warning the
constellations before turning to leave.

The moment before the portal was about to close, the great dokkaebi
glanced at me. Beyond his cool eyes, someone was talking to me.

「 Don't be too loud, baby. The 'king' is watching you. 」




The great dokkaebi left and the Gourmet Association ended its meeting. It
was natural for the party to end. It was time for the respective constellations
to go back.

I took advantage of the chaos in the banquet hall to slip out of the castle. A
significant number of constellations were dragged away by the bureau but
there were still some hostile to me. Thus, I needed to get out of here before
there was trouble.

However, I stood at the entrance of Oro Castle and encountered a difficulty
I hadn't thought of.

…How did I get back?

There was no guide or carriage. If I delayed here, I might be caught by
other constellations…

At this time, there was an engine sound and something appeared around the
corner of the castle. It
was a luxury sports car with a streamlined body. It was a car reminiscent of
the SSS-class Ferrarigini.

Wait, the person who made that car…

The sports car stopped in front of me with a loud sound. The window rolled
down and an elderly man wearing sunglasses appeared.

[Get on, young man.]

It was the Mass Production Maker.




The moment the rear doors opened, the central body of the car behind
longer and changed into the form of a limousine. I felt pure admiration at
the sight as I got into the back seat.

How many people could ride in this? Was he selling this car? Now I had
money…

The body was made from solid protective material that adhered not just to
the outside but the inside as well. I drank ice tea from the refrigerator in the
limousine and looked around the vehicle.

The Mass Production Maker was in the driver's seat while Persephone was
in the passenger's seat. Persephone had been communicating with someone
since earlier. Perhaps it was related to the great dokkaebi who appeared.

"Mass Production Maker, thank you for your consideration. Still, I have a
question."

[Hmm, what is it?]

"…Why is this woman with you?"
I glared at Anna Croft who was sitting next to me. The Mass Production
Maker smiled sweetly. [Huhu, I promised to give her a ride. Don't fight too
much.]

It was a very unpleasant situation but I couldn't complain. I sighed and
examined my companions. There were three Asgardians along with myself
in the back seat.

There was the exhausted Iris and stunned Selena Kim. Anna Croft looked at
their condition before suddenly speaking to me. "…Iris would've lived even
if you didn't help."

"I know. Perhaps Thursday's Thunder would've saved her. Isn't that right?"

Anna Croft bit her lips at my words. Anna Croft was a more brutal woman
than anyone else but she didn't lose those who were her 'own'. In face, Anna
Croft's colleagues didn't die in the similar event that she held in the original
novel.

Rather, they awakened through the scenario. It was the other people who
died.

"It was Iris' chance to get a good sponsor and you ruined everything. The
future I saw wasn't like this…"

"She wouldn't have wanted to get a sponsor in that way."

"You don't know who the constellation was."

[Tsk tsk. I told you to get along but I guess it isn't possible.]

The form of the limousine changed and my seat showed strange
movements. My vision blurred and I was sitting in the passenger's seat
where Persephone had been. The Mass Production Maker had changed my
position with Persephone.
Maybe he didn't want to hear fighting or perhaps there was a sound barrier
between the front and back seats.

The Mass Production Maker told me, [You're on bad terms with
incarnations as well as constellations. Don't make too many enemies.]

"I don't want to make enemies either."

In fact, I came here to seek 'colleagues' rather than enemies. As a result, it
turned out like this…

The Mass Production Maker took out an electronic cigarette and spoke, [I
felt anger in your story. There is a strong rage against this world and the
constellations.]

I tried to say something but fell silent.

[I know that you saw many things that shouldn't be seen today.]

"Not at all'.

The Mass Production Maker laughed. I somehow felt awkward and took
out my smartphone. The darkness was like a screen in the front of the car.
The Mass Production Maker gazed silently at the darkness and there was a
slight sadness.

[Still, don't hate them so much.]

It took some time for me to understand his words.

[They just couldn't stand the loneliness. Whether it is a garbage or a noble
constellation… they all acted like that because they like the story.]

I was confused because I didn't know the Mass Production Maker would
say such words. A strange feeling of betrayal filled my chest. "This doesn't
mean they can trample on the lives of incarnations."
If they liked the story, they could do their own scenarios. Instead of ruining
the scenario of others, they could move on to the next scenario. Turning to
another scenario and selling their minds was just avoiding reality.

I tried to say this. At that moment, the smartphone turned on and Ways of
Survival came into view. The last sentence I had been reading was on the
screen.

I stared blankly at the sentences and the Mass Production Maker asked,
[You are always looking at that. Are you going to write something on an
empty notebook?]

I couldn't find a way to answer the question, but I soon smiled weakly and
replied, "…I just feel steady when I look at this."

In the distance, the darkness of the Dark Dimension could be seen. A light
emerged from an empty window.

Finally, it was time to go back.
           Chapter 247: Ep. 47 - Demon King Selection, I


It had been a week since I went to the Gourmet Association. During this
week, I was very busy. There were only four days left until the Demon
King Selection. Until then, I had to complete all of my preparations.

Apart from the Black Heavenly Demon Sword in Yoo Joonghyuk's hands,
there were some usable hidden pieces in Murim. I opened the first revision
of Ways of Survival in order to find the sub scenarios that would let me get
the hidden pieces. During this time, I read the revised text and reviewed the
important parts but there were still many missing pieces.

"You're busy as soon as you come here. I've barely seen your face." Jang
Hayoung, who was wearing large sleeveless clothes that didn't fit him,
followed after me for 30 minutes.

I stared at him with a frown and asked, "Shouldn't you be training?"

Jang Hayoung stretched out his lips and replied, "…Haven't I been working
hard?"
"What is hard? You were eating dumplings."

"Can't I do closed door training while eating dumplings?"

I wondered why he was bothering me when something came to mind. "Oh,
I heard you finished third in the competition? It is a big deal."

Jang Hayoung shrugged and pretended to look elsewhere. "It wasn't a big
deal."

However, the curve of his mouth showed that he felt pretty great. I knew
why he was chasing after me like this… dishonest guy.

"Did you get it? The Demon Spirit Bead?"

"Yes.

"Give it to me."

"Why?" Jang Hayoung stepped back with a suspicious look.

I sighed and told him, "I'm not going to take it away. You can't eat it like
this anyway."

Based on his dark expression, he had already heard about it from Yoo
Joonghyuk. I'm sure he told the story while picking out the Black Heavenly
Demon Sword.

「 If you eat it, you will experience a qi deviation and all the blood vessels
in your body will explode, killing you. There is only one person here who
can safely absorb the Demon Spirit Bead. 」

…I thought this and understood why Jang Hayoung was acting like this.
"You don't have to give it to me if you don't want to. You are the one who
earned it yourself."
It couldn't be helped if Jang Hayoung didn't believe me since not enough
trust had been built up yet. At this moment, Jang Hayoung extended a small
hand. "…It isn't like that. In the first place, I wouldn't have gained this if it
wasn't for you."

A small pill fell into my hand with a thud. This was one of the three major
drugs of First Murim, the Demon Spirit Bead. I spoke with a smile, "Wait
and see."

It was a drug that a terrible person from the Blood Demon School made in
the past by refining the blood of 1,000 people. It was a cursed pill that
could gain the best power out of the Conception Vessel¹ but turned the
person who took it crazy due to the curse of the souls.

In the original novel, Yoo Joonghyuk always found it delicious but Jang
Hayoung would surely die if he took it.

"Let's see…"

However, as with any scenario, it wasn't impossible to use a cursed item. In
fact, I clearly remembered a scene from Ways of Survival where the Flying
Fox absorbed this tribulation.

「 All I need is three Great Return Pills. After all, everything is about
balance and harmony. If demonic energy is a problem, we can supply it
regularly. 」

The curse could be avoided if three Great Return Pills were ground together
with the Demon Spirit Bead.

It was easier said than done. The problem was how to get the Demon Spirit
Bead, one of the top three drugs, along with three Great Return Pills.
However, this wasn't a big problem for me.

"Biyoo."
I called Biyoo and opened the Dokkaebi Bag. The Great Return Pill was
already on the 'Recommended Goods List'. The dokkaebis' big data was
scary.


  [Recommended Products List]

  * Great Return Pill―200,000 C
  Stock: 5



200,000 coins. I normally would've been distressed by the price but not
anymore. I deliberately switched the screen to public and purchased the
goods.

[600,000 coins have been consumed.]

[You have purchased three Great Return Pills.]

Then channel messages kept appearing.

[Some constellations envy your overspending.]

[A few constellations are curious about the performance of the Great Return
Pill.]

[Some constellations say they will sponsor 500 coins if you tell them the
performance of the Great Return Pill.]

"6-600,000 coins?!" The passing Han Myungoh shook while holding a
bowl of dog food. He was probably preparing a meal for the Breaking the
Sky Master. "That… I heard you were rich."

"Things turned out well. Please take this and grind it together."
"W-What is this? Is it a panacea?"

"Don't be curious. If you eat it wrong, you will be cursed by a demon king."

Han Myungoh paled after hearing about the demon king's curse and acted
quickly after taking the pills from me. The four pills were turned into a fine
powder. I held out the bowl towards Jang Hayoung who told me, "I can't eat
powder."

"Endure it this time. Block your nose and swallow it with water."

"By the way… can I really eat this?"

"it won't be much help to Yoo Joonghyuk or I if we eat it. You're different."

Yoo Joonghyuk already had enough of a magic power system in place even
if he didn't eat the Demon Spirit Bead. Meanwhile, I had the Broken Heart
of a Young Gold Dragon. However, Jang Hayoung was suffering from a
lack of magic power.

Jang Hayoung kept hesitating so I told him, "If you don't want to eat it, give
it to me. Anyhow, you have no courage."

"I'll eat it!" Jang Hayoung poured the powdered medicine into his mouth
and swallowed the bitter taste with water. The moment Jang Hayoung put
down the bowl, the Breaking the Sky Master who had been waiting for the
opportunity rushed over and eagerly licked the bowl.

Jang Hayoung looked at his condition and cocked his head with a slight
smile. "…I don't feel anything special?"

"The efficacy should appear by tomorrow. It will take time for the pills to
mix with the body's energy."

Jang Hayoung nodded like he understood. Then Han Myungoh stepped in
again from where he was listening. "Look, Dokja-ssi."
I glanced back and something I expected had showed up.

"This car… it is from the Gourmet Association?"

The car he mentioned was the X-grade Ferrarigini left in one corner of the
yard. I stared at the sleek black body that could even cross the fault lines of
the Dark Dimension and the words of the Mass Production Maker suddenly
came to mind.

–Don't make too many enemies.

He was definitely a different type from the constellations I knew. I
would've had a better memory of him if he had given me this car for free.

"Is the Gourmet Association a charitable organization? I bought it with a
lease."

"Lease? H-How much…"

"It is 50,000 coins a month."

"5-50,000 coins? How many coins did you earn?"

"Roughly 4.8 million coins."

Jang Hayoung and Han Myungoh's mouths dropped open as they heard '4.8
million coins'.

Jang Hayoung asked, "Excuse me… do you have an incarnation?"

"Why? Do you want to be my incarnation?"

I smiled at him and Jang Hayoung shouted, "I was just wondering! In
addition, I've already decided on a constellation."

"Constellation? Who?"
I asked with slight nervousness. I didn't want Jang Hayoung as an
incarnation but things would become complicated if Jang Hayoung picked
the wrong constellation. Then Jang Hayoung unexpectedly replied, "The
Demon King of Salvation."

"What?"

"I want to be his incarnation."

I wanted to make a joke when I saw Jang Hayoung's intense eyes. Then I
thought about it and realized that he still hadn't heard my modifier. In the
original, he was a person with great senses…

No, there was no reason for him to think I was the Demon King of
Salvation in the first place. I s uddenly wanted to tease this person. "Will
he accept you? Have you contacted him?"

"Not yet…"

I saw Jang Hayoung's blushing face and realized he really didn't know who
I was. It was a complicated feeling.

Then the watching Han Myungoh interrupted. "You still don't know his
modifier?"

"I don't know it. Should I know?"

Before I could stop him, Han Myungoh pointed at me. "That friend is the
Demon King of Salvation."
For the next two days, Jang Hayoung avoided me. The usually lazy person
suddenly never emerged from his training. Thus, I was stressed because I
was left alone with Yoo Joonghyuk in the training field.

"You must've done something useless again, Kim Dokja."

"…It's nothing."

Yoo Joonghyuk scratched the ground with the Black Heavenly Demon
Sword and left. It was an action that appeared when he was in a good
mood… this jerk, he seemed excited about his new sword. In the training
field, the sound of Jang Hayoung punching a pile was heard repeatedly. It
sounded similar to when I kicked my futon every night.

"You didn't seem like a constellation but you have their habit of peeking."

I turned around and saw a super tall woman. I was about to open my mouth
when the Breaking the Sky Sword Saint spoke, "If you don't add 'nim', I
will hit your arse."

"…Breaking the Sky Sword Saint-nim."

I couldn't be like Yoo Joonghyuk just because of a single syllable. "Have
you gone to Tartarus?"

"Not yet. However, I got an appointment with the 'Queen of the
Underworld' thanks to you."

"I'm glad."

Perhaps it was due to the anticipation that she would meet her kin but a
mild shadow passed over the Breaking the Sky Sword Saint's face. The
harvest of this journey was that I obtained her.
The Breaking the Sky Sword Saint was one of the strongest transcendents
in Ways of Survival. Her presence alone might we might be able to
somehow get through the Demon King Selection.

I opened my mouth, "I have a question. Can I ask it?"

"I'll allow it."

"Why did you teach Jang Hayoung your martial arts?"

"That person has talent. It is possible to achieve a new type of
transcendence if I polish him well."

I knew what she meant. Perhaps the Breaking the Sky Sword Saint felt the
'wall' that was inside Jang Hayoung. However, that shouldn't be the reason.

"You know that he is a man."

Originally, the Breaking the Sky Swordsmanship was only for women. Yoo
Joonghyuk might be the exception but this school had never accepted many
disciples.

"You're still young. There isn't only one interpretation of a story."

The words were cryptic. Maybe the Breaking the Sky Sword Saint noticed
that Jang Hayoung was a woman in his previous life. Then the story of the
Breaking the Sky Sword Saint began. "I remember a man I knew before."
"A man?"

"Yes, a man."

At this moment, I fully understood the meaning of 'there isn't only one
interpretation of a story' spoken by the Breaking the Sky Sword Saint. The
word she chose was confusing because it could be a man or her man, i.e. a
lover… no, the Breaking the Sky Sword Saint shouldn't have a lover.

"He was very handsome."
In the original novel, the Breaking the Sky Sword Saint never mentioned a
man so I felt something strange.

"You aren't trying to say that… Jang Hayoung is like your former lover,
right?"

I was joking but unexpectedly, the Breaking the Sky Sword Saint answered
seriously. "His handsome looks are a resemblance."

At this point, I wondered if she accepted Yoo Joonghyuk just because he
was handsome. The Breaking the Sky Sword Saint didn't care about my
disappointment and continued, "He was very handsome but a poor person
because of his small size."

"…Small?"

I was thinking about her ex-boyfriend when something flashed through my
mind, causing me to feel astonishment. A person who had a connection
with the Breaking the Sky Sword Saint in Ways of Survival. In addition,
'small' was the most appropriate word for him.

No, wait a minute. I thought their relationship wasn't good…

At this moment, a loud sound was heard from outside. An unimaginable
aura dominated the area of the Blue Dragon Castle, including this estate.
The Breaking the Sky Sword Saint and I ran outside at the same time and
Yoo Joonghyuk looked my way.

"Kim Dokja."

In the sky, a vortex was appearing. It was a vortex I knew very well. It was
a cursed outlet that only opened when a 'disaster' appeared in the scenario.

Yoo Joonghyuk spoke in a low tone, "…The Great Hole."
The 'disaster scenarios' were originally only seen in the early scenario areas.
There was no 'disaster' in the First Murim. There were no disasters in
scenario areas that had passed the 20th scenario.

In such an area, there was only one really why the 'hall' would open.

"…Run away."

The 'Great Disaster' scenario of the First Murim was going to begin.



[1] Conception Vessel in traditional Chinese medicine is one of the eight
meridians, which were believed to be a network of channels in the body
through which Qi flowed.
          Chapter 248: Ep. 47 - Demon King Selection, II


There were two types of 'disaster scenarios' in the Star Stream. The first
was the apocalypse scenarios named after the relevant nebulae and had
become a type of myth, such as Ragnarok and Gigantomachia.

The second was a destruction scenario that occurred irregularly. This was
the case with the Great Hole before my eyes.

"It isn't a constellation." The Breaking the Sky Sword Saint stared up at the
raging sky that had become dark.

If it didn't have the aura of a constellation, there was only one answer. "An
outer god."

Now I had become a constellation. I could feel the power of the outer god
casting shadows from the hall. It was one I had encountered a few times.
However, the feeling I felt now was different in dimension. The blind
wasn't too blinded when looking at the sun. For the first time, I hated that I
had become a constellation.
Yoo Joonghyuk muttered, "…Why is the destruction scenario beginning
now?"

Yoo Joonghyuk had gone through the first and second rounds and knew the
future of the First Murim.

In the original novel, the First Murim was destroyed by an outer god.

However, it was still too early. In the original novel, it happened in a few
years. Now something pulled that timeline forward. What was it? What the
hell went wrong…

…Wait, perhaps? Yoo Joonghyuk had similar thoughts and asked me, "…Is
my idea correct?"

"It seems to be the case." I replied nervously.

The 'destruction scenario' was a scenario that tested the possibilities of the
incarnations. If the accumulated probability value was never filled up, the
'disaster' would never begin. In this Blue Dragon Castle, there was only one
thing that recently triggered probability.

The Breaking the Sky Sword Saint opened her mouth. "It was the martial
arts competition."

The martial arts competition. The probability that the Brash Swamp
Predator and other constellations used eventually triggered the disaster. [A
few constellations who dislike you are enjoying the situation.] Damn
bastards.

"Kim Dokja. What the hell did you do there?"

Yoo Joonghyuk didn't know exactly what happened at the Gourmet
Association and was angry at me. I had no excuses. There was no way to
reverse a scenario that had already begun.
[In a few moments, the destruction scenario will begin!]

[The 'Outer God' is preparing to attack!]

[All non-participants in the scenario should quickly leave the scenario
area!]

The messages were heard from the sky and a disturbance began in the Blue
Dragon Castle.

"Crazy! What is this?"

"Hurry and flee!"

Unlike other scenarios, the 'Great Destruction' scenario had the option of
participating. Incarnations like us were quickly leaving the area. Even the
merchants selling the files containing the martial arts and the martial artists
of Blue Dragon Castle… Their expressions changed the moment the Great
Hole appeared in the sky. The concept of 'skilled' and 'unskilled' was
meaningless in front of this existence.

"What happened…"

Jang Hayoung and Han Myungoh belatedly ran out into the yard.

"We have to get out of here. Prepare quickly."

"Heok…" Jang Hayoung gulped as he pointed to the sky.

Many tentacles were extending from the Great Hole. It was undoubtedly the
outer god I encountered on Peace Land and in Dark Castle.

[I wi ll ex plore this sto ry of li ving things.]

I was overwhelmed by the terrible presence that permeated the syllables.
The colossal greed caused the escaping people to collapse and piss
themselves.
"U-Uwaaaaah!"

It was huge chaos that disrupted the spirit just from the true voice. Of
course, it was unreasonable to confront such a person, no matter how strong
Yoo Joonghyuk was. Even a weak outer god had the power to trample on
constellations. It was hard to expect a chance using the Fourth Wall like I
did with the Devourer of Dreams.

[There are 30 minutes until the start of the destruction scenario.]

We had to run away from here. Maybe that was the better choice.

"Breaking the Sky Sword Saint."

I gazed at the Breaking the Sky Sword Saint and she was looking back at
me. It was an unfathomable expression.

「 To the Breaking the Sky Sword Namgung Minyoung, the First Murim
was home. 」

All I knew were the sentences written in Ways of Survival. According to
those sentences, there was no reason for the Breaking the Sky Sword Saint
to defend this place.

「 Of course, not everyone likes their 'home'. 」

To her, the First Murim was just the breeding ground of a corrupt world. It
was a world that lost recognition and compassion.

「 "Murim was already destroyed long before the First Murim was
destroyed. 」

So far, there was no reason for the Breaking the Sky Sword Saint to stay
here. The First Murim would perish. To be exact, it had to perish.

"Teacher." Yoo Joonghyuk's voice pushed for us to leave.
Then why didn't the Breaking the Sky Sword Saint move? She stood like a
mountain as she silently stared at the street across from her. The city was
chaotic from rioting and desertion. Then I saw a group of people
approaching. They were those who were looking at transcendence or had
seen transcendence.

I sensed the youthful aura around their bodies and noticed who they were.
"Breaking the Sky Sword Saint, it's been a while."

The heads of the powerful clans of Blue Dragon Castle had come to visit
the Breaking the Sky Sword Saint.




It wasn't hard to guess why they came here. The outer god had come to
Murim and the destruction was scheduled.

There were two types of reactions before Murim was destroyed. Run away
or fight.

Those who didn't have much to lose would flee but the incarnations who
had been here for a long time were different. They built up forces, gathered
wealth and created stories. They were those who reached the peak in power
of one area.

"Breaking the Sky Sword Saint. We need your help."

From left to right, they were the Zhuge Family, Murong Family, the
Sichuan Tangmen School, the Hwangbo Family and the Namgung Family.

The heads of the five main forces of the First Murim had gathered, which
was probably a rare event throughout all of Murim. Behind them were the
chiefs of the big schools.
"I beg you, lend Murim your strength."

Namgung Minyoung clenched her fists and replied. "You need my
strength…"

Some of the heads of the distinguished families recoiled at the cold voice.
The quickest one to react was the head of the Zhuge family. "Please help
us.
I'm asking you."

I understood why they came out like this. The Ice Flower Goddess, who
was the best martial artist of this area, was defeated by the Breaking the
Sky Sword Saint's disciple. There was also an overwhelming gap in skill.

Perhaps the impact of the martial arts competition alarmed the countless
masters who had been running along the easy path. Yoo Joonghyuk showed
the power to defeat even a descended constellation.

The old masters felt nostalgic at the old path of transcendence while the
adventurers who came to visit were reminded of those who had reached the
peak.

"Master's ancestor, please help your descendants."

In the end, the one who spoke was a member of the Namgung Family,
which was the same family as the Breaking the Sky Sword Saint Namgung
Minyoung.

It was a middle-aged man with a fierce face. Perhaps this was Namgung
Jincheon, one of the 10 Grand Elders. It might be only half but the blood of
his family also flowed through the Breaking the Sky Sword Saint. For that
reason, the eyes of the Breaking the Sky Sword Saint were shaken.

I wasn't able to watch any more and went forward. "How funny. Weren't
you the ones who previously abandoned the Breaking the Sky Sword
Saint?"
Normally, I would've acted on their shared feelings. I would've devised a
way to take them together with me to the Demon King Selection. However,
now the Breaking the Sky Sword Saint was more urgent.

"Sadly, you forget everything you did when the constellations and
dokkaebis first visited here."

"What… who are you?"

Some of the family chiefs changed their expressions after realizing the true
meaning of my words. Maybe they also remembered. Why did the Breaking
the Sky Sword Saint, who ruled at the top of Murim, open a martial arts hall
in a fallen area?

Yoo Joonghyuk knew the circumstances and bit his lips at my words. The
Breaking the Sky Sword Saint Namgung Minyoung's expression distorted
and her heroic spirit stopped.

I couldn't blame her for being swept away. She didn't pursue honour or vain
lust. Thus, she was used by the Murim people and eventually abandoned
here. As the symbol of the fallen Murim, the distinguished families left her
in this place and built their own castles.

"The Namgung Family's master, it is the same for you. Master's ancestor…
you have never called the Breaking the Sky Sword Saint that before, right?"

"T-That…"

"If you had any thoughts, you wouldn't have come here. I don't know if
you're brave or stupid. Don't you know why the Breaking the Sky Sword
Saint split apart from your Namgung Family?"

A child born between a giant god and a human. I knew better than anyone
the trials that the Breaking the Sky Sword Saint experienced as she grew
up, perhaps even more than Yoo Joonghyuk.
「 How is a female…! 」

「 It is the cursed blood of the giant gods. 」

The Breaking the Sky Sword Saint made a questionable face. She must be
wondering why I knew these things. Usually, it would be a dangerous
remark but now her question was beneficial for me. The Breaking the Sky
Sword would follow me in order to resolve this question.

"What do you know…?!"

"Shut up! Breaking the Sky Sword Saint, who is this person?"

The agitated family heads approached to threaten me and Yoo Joonghyuk
raised the Black Heavenly Demon Sword. It was a good thing. If there was
a conflict here, we could get out of here peacefully.

Before the furious Yoo Joonghyuk could deal a blow, the Zhuge Family's
head suddenly fell to the ground. "Breaking the Sky Sword Saint, I am
reflecting on the mistakes of those days. I understand that we can't undo our
actions."

…Damn, there were still smart guys in this world. The other family heads
were baffled by the Zhuge head's actions. The head of the Zhuge Family
was begging to the Breaking the Sky Sword Saint with a desperate
countenance. It was as if he was praying to the god of Murim. "If you don't
help, the First Murim will be destroyed…!"

He could ask for a god's compassion at any time but he was a disciple ready
to abandon his faith at any time.

Then the god of Murim responded, "At one time, small trees came together
to form a forest."

The head of the Zhuge Family looked up at the Breaking the Sky Sword
after hearing the unexpected words.
"Now that the small trees are uprooted and only a few large trees that have
occupied the land have covered the sky with their branches."

The Breaking the Sky Sword Saint looked at the Blue Dragon Castle with a
blank expression. The spires of the distinguished family's homes rose
higher than the walls. It was as if they were looking down on the residents
on behalf of the heavens. Then I understood the words of the Breaking the
Sky Sword Saint.

"The leaves and branches are plentiful but now there are only a few trees
left. What do you think? Can this still be called a forest?"

Murim had died a long time ago. The Breaking the Sky Sword Saint had
declared it just now. "Let's go."

The god of Murim turned her back and betrayed this world. It seemed
easier to resolve than I expected. I was satisfied and followed after the
Breaking the Sky Sword Saint. Yoo Joonghyuk was watching me while
Jang Hayoung and Han Myungoh packed quickly as they ate dumplings.

At this moment, a strange message was heard.

[Your actions have had a profound impact on the direction of ■■.]

…What?

[The 'second revision' update will begin.]
          Chapter 249: Ep. 47 - Demon King Selection, III


The second revision update. The message appeared at an unexpected time
and made me think for a moment.

Another revision meant the future would keep changing due to my actions.
In other words, after receiving the first revision, I contributed to the
creation of a new future.

My heart throbbed at the thought. Did I succeed in the third round? Would
it once again start from the fourth round? Did Yoo Joonghyuk reach the end
in the story I changed?

…The author, why did he keep sending me these things?

[The 'second revision' update is in progress.]

I couldn't be sure of anything since the file hadn't updated yet. Things
might've gotten better or worse. The thing I had to think about right now
wasn't the direction of the new revision but the immediate development.
"Breaking the Sky Sword Saint! Are you going to flee now? You are going
to abandon the world you have been living in!"

As I was briefly distracted by Ways of Survival, the masters rose in unison.
The most serious change occurred in the Zhuge head who had been the first
to kneel. "…Run away? You are saying this to me?"

"What are you doing right now if it isn't running away?!"

"How funny, child."

There was a deep mockery in the voice. The Murim people responded to
the voice and raised their aura. Every one of them were first-class masters
in First Murim. The magic power of the family heads combined and a
threatening earthquake spread through the area.

The Breaking the Sky Sword Saint stepped towards the family heads who
were raising their pressure.

"Kuheeok!"

It was an incredible sight. The shock waves that spread from around the
advancing Breaking the Sky Sword Saint precisely offset the seismic waves
emitted from the other side, causing internal injuries to all the masters with
a magic power that was several times the opponent.

Everything was done with a simple footstep. This was the power of the
Breaking the Sky Sword Saint who was called a disaster. The fallen masters
coughed up blood and stared resentfully at the Breaking the Sky Sword
Saint.

"B-Breaking the Sky Sword Saint!"

"Don't throw us away! Please!"
They believed that this type of power would surely prevent the 'destruction'.
In the pale countenances, there was the shadow of hope rather than despair.
The Breaking the Sky Sword Saint stared down at them blankly while the
Great Hole in the sky became bigger and bigger. Now I couldn't delay any
longer.

"Biyoo."

Biyoo appeared out of thin air and started to open a portal. The problem
was the location of the portal. No matter how much I looked, there were no
portals around us. The first one to speak was Jang Hayoung, who confirmed
the location of the portal using Hundred Lanes that he learnt through the
Unidentified Wall.

"…I think the portal opened that way. Do we have to run to the square?"

Jang Hayoung was pointing to the square that we first arrived at when we
came to the Blue Dragon Castle. I urged Biyoo.

"Biyoo. Can't you move the portal to this place?"

[Baang.]

Biyoo shook her head with a grim expression. Independent dokkaebis might
be constrained in strength. Or perhaps it was because Biyoo was still a
young dokkaebi. In the end, we have to move back to where we first passed
through the portal.

The Breaking the Sky Master barked. I turned back and saw the Breaking
the Sky Master was pushing his head out from the passenger seat of the X-
grade Ferrarigini.

"Get on, quickly!"

Han Myungoh called out to us from the driver's seat. We quickly boarded
the vehicle.
"Depart."

The magic power engine of the X-grade Ferrarigini roared. The masters
chased after us using their techniques but no matter how high their level,
they couldn't catch up to the work made by the Mass Production Maker.
[There are 10 minutes remaining until the start of the 'destruction' scenario.]

I could see the landscape of the First Murim outside my window. The sky
was red. Things like meteorite debris were falling from the Great Hole. A
market exploded from the shockwave and flames spread. The giant spires
built by the distinguished families were paying the price for challenging the
sky.

"Aaaaaaack!"

Buildings collapsed and the ground shook. Some people were covered by
the collapsed buildings. There were people crying over dying people and
others shouting that they should flee. I could see little children who
abandoned everything and sat down on the spot.

I was watching the fall of a world like I was turning pages.

One day, Asmodeus had stated,

「 "The scenario is a small destruction to prevent a greater destruction." 」

How many more had to suffer destruction in order to end this story? I
turned my head and saw that the Breaking the Sky Sword Saint and Yoo
Joonghyuk were watching the same scene as me.

"Flee quickly!"

"But…!"

The voices of several young people came from the window. The men and
women injured by the debris were looking around for help. Han Myungoh
stepped on the brakes and Jang Hayoung opened his mouth. "…Can't we
give them a ride?"

I thought he would say this. I shook my head. "No."

Han Myungoh stepped on the accelerator and we started moving again.
Jang Hayoung spoke in a voice filled with faint resentment.

"…There's plenty of room in here."

"We are 'separate' from this scenario so we can leave. Those people are
different."

"However, this master was born here and can leave with us."

"She is a bit special."

I glanced at the Breaking the Sky Sword Saint. The Breaking the Sky
Sword Saint was an existence with the blood of a 'giant god'. She wasn't
born in the Murim scenario and could receive other scenarios if she left this
place. Outside the window, I could see male and female martial artists.

"The people here will die anyway."

Those who were born here and only received scenarios here couldn't escape
from the First Murim.

Even if they managed to leave here, they would instantly die due to the
'exile penalty'. There was helplessness in Jang Hayoung's expression.

"Then…"

I knew Jang Hayoung's feelings. I have lived with these emotions for a long
time. In front of any crisis in the world, the only thing we can do was turn
over the pages of the world.

[There are 8 minutes until the start of the destruction scenario.]
[Your story of destruction is descending.]

The darkened sky was flashing. In the meantime, the number of tentacles
that emerged through the Great Hole had exceeded four. Jang Hayoung
shook as he gazed at the growing hall and Yoo Joonghyuk was immersed.
The hairs on my skin were standing up.

「 Kim Dokja thought: I can't compete with that. 」

Who did I have to fight against? What strength did I need to obtain in the
future? I once again realized it.

Maybe this was one of the giant stories. It was a story that I couldn't afford
yet. This 'story', which descended to end a world, was completely different
from every story I had ever used.

[ There is no pl ace to run, po or sla ves of the sce na rio. ]

The windows of the Blue Dragon Castle were destroyed by the resounding
true voice.

[ Des truc tion will fo llow you. ]

Even the body of the Mass Production Maker's car couldn't overcome the
shock of the true voice and shook.

[There are 5 minutes until the start of the destruction scenario.]

"The portal!"

Fortunately, we arrived at the portal in time. Now we just had to escape.

"Let's go."

I got the Breaking the Sky Sword Saint and made my debut in the Gourmet
Association. I also built up many coins. The finish was tough but I had no
solution at this time. The First Murim was a world that would someday be
destroyed and now I had no way of stopping that destruction.

At this moment, the Breaking the Sky Sword got out of the car.

"Breaking the Sky Sword Saint?"

Her expression was still unreadable. Still, I knew her thoughts without
needing to read her expression.

[All residents of Murim should gather immediately in the square.]

Her divinity echoed through this world like a lion's roar. It was extremely
powerful and was reminiscent of a constellation's true voice. The fleeing
martial artists instantly looked this way after hearing her voice.

"B-Breaking the Sky Sword Saint!"

"Breaking the Sky Sword Saint!"

For a moment, the Murim people had mixed feelings of joy. I got off the car
and shouted, "Wait a minute!"

I was confused. Why did the Breaking the Sky Sword Saint make this
choice? Was it because of something I did?

Several thoughts passed through my head. Perhaps the second revision
being updated was because the Breaking the Sky Sword Saint died in this
place?

[The 'second revision' update is in progress.]

I gritted my teeth. The second revision still hadn't arrived.

"Breaking the Sky Sword Saint! We must go together!"
The Breaking the Sky Sword Saint would die if she remained here. Then
the Breaking the Sky Sword Saint replied, "Young constellation, one tree
doesn't make up a forest."

Amidst the sinister feeling, the Breaking the Sky Sword Saint directed her
words to me. "Then how many trees need to gather to become a forest?"

Of course, I never thought about such a thing. Instead, all I saw were the
tiny trees being broken by the falling meteorites. The very small trees had
been covered by such big trees that it was unknown they even existed. The
trees were shouting towards the Breaking the Sky Sword Saint. "S-Save me.
Please save me!"

I had forgotten. What type of person was the Breaking the Sky Sword
Saint? 「 Her heroic spirit is so high that she sometimes makes other
people's definition of justice shabby. 」

Every transcendent had something they couldn't concede and this was it for
the Breaking the Sky Sword Saint. However, understanding her justice
didn't mean I condoned her actions. Just as a few trees couldn't be called a
forest, one tree couldn't block a landslide.

"Have you forgotten your promise? Didn't you say you would help me if I
let you meet your people?"

"I remember and I'll keep it." The Breaking the Sky Sword Saint replied as
she stared up at the sky. Since the complete 'great destruction' hadn't begun
yet, the 'oldest ones' wouldn't appear. Still, it was certain that beyond this
sky was an ancient god. At the very least, it was similar to the Devourer of
Dreams caught by me and Yoo Joonghyuk.

"I will go to you after stopping them here."

…Could the Breaking the Sky Sword Saint beat an existence that didn't fall
to Cheok Jungyeong's Three Swords Style?
"Teacher!" Then Yoo Joonghyuk came forward.

However, the Breaking the Sky Sword Saint was stubborn. "Leave. The
lesson for this time is over."

"I need you." The Breaking the Sky Sword Saint's eyes were faintly shaken
at the honest words. "It is very fascinating. If only it wasn't for this type of
situation."

"I can't break the 46th scenario alone. You must…"

From these words, I realized what the Breaking the Sky Sword Saint meant
to Yoo Joonghyuk. The Breaking the Sky Sword Saint faintly smiled at
Yoo Joonghyuk. It was as if her disciple was special.

The giant hands of the Breaking the Sky Sword Saint covered Yoo
Joonghyuk's head like a lid. "You're not alone."

The eyes of the Breaking the Sky Sword Saint stayed on me for a very short
time. She continued speaking. "I will stop the destruction of this place."

Just as Yoo Joonghyuk knew the Breaking the Sky Sword Saint, the
Breaking the Sky Sword Saint knew Yoo Joonghyuk. Thus, she knew the
words to send Yoo Joonghyuk away. "I will stop the destruction of this
world."

"Breaking the Sky Sword Saint…!"

"Stop it and go."

Yoo Joonghyuk didn't move. The many emotions pouring out of his heart
were conveyed to me.

[There is 1 minute until the start of the destruction scenario.]

In the end, I pulled at Yoo Joonghyuk. I didn't want to leave this way but if
I didn't make this choice, the third round would end here.
"…We must go, Yoo Joonghyuk."

The person who stiffened like a stone statue didn't move and Jang Hayoung
and Han Myungoh eventually came out. Yoo Joonghyuk was dragged into
the car and the Breaking the Sky Sword Saint stared at me. "Please look
after my disciple."

The Breaking the Sky Master barked from the car. Yoo Joonghyuk was
staring this way with a completely distraught expression.

"You too, leave."

The person who always looked down on people was now looking up at a
place higher than herself. Then the sky gazed down at her.

[In te res ting crea tion… who a re y ou?]

The foreign god was asking for the name of a god. In a situation where the
constellations would be stunned, the Breaking the Sky Sword Saint opened
her mouth without retreating.

[I am the god of Murim.]

As if she heard her disciple leaving, the lonely tree that guarded the forest
for a long time spoke towards the sky.

[I am the Breaking the Sky Sword Saint.]
