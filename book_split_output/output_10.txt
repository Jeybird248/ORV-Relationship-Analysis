449: Ep. 85 - The Final Wall, I


[95th Main Scenario has concluded!]

After the scenario ended, the Great Sage and the 'Outer Gods' gathered in
the center of the Tongtian River to celebrate.

[Those with the identity of 'extras' in the Giant Story ⸢Journey to the West⸥
has now been freed.]

Outer Gods that became the scenario's slaves under the <Bureau>'s and
<Emperor>'s combined suppression were now being freed.

[OhOhOhOhOhOh]

[MonkeykingMonkeykingMonkeyking]

Some of them even happened to be the ones that followed the 'Secretive
Plotter' and joined the scenario belatedly. And as his Status grew weaker,
they naturally began gravitating towards the Great Sage Heaven's Equal
after he emerged as a new Outer God.

[Reward distribution will now commence!]

Incarnations saw the 95th scenario's reward items descending from the sky
and their lips stretched wide in huge grins. Unfortunately for them, though,
their joy was short-lived. Their gazes soon drifted over to a certain group of
Incarnations receiving that huge cache of rewards over yonder.

"Wow, that…"

"I should've joined that Story chamber…"

It was <Kim Dokja's Company>'s group. Each one of them received one
million Coins as individual rewards, while some of them even acquired
<Emperor>'s Star Relics, as well.

Since the rewards were being distributed according to the rules, none here
could complain about this procedure, either.

[Nebula, <Emperor>, is protesting the scenario's fairness to the Bureau!]

No, there was someone who could – it was none other than the host
themselves, <Emperor>.

Of course, they would feel wronged by the fact that the rewards of the
largescale scenario they organised for themselves had ended up in the hands
of a small Nebula.

[<Star Stream> is ignoring the <Emperor>'s complaint.]

A portion of <Emperor>'s Constellations couldn't hold back their rage and
were about to unleash their Statuses, but then, someone unexpected stopped
them.
"Please, that's enough, everyone. We have lost." It was the greatest
Incarnation of <Emperor>, Fei Hu. "What would our Myth-grade
Constellations think if they witnessed our current actions?"

<Emperor>'s Myth-grade Constellations didn't participate in this 'Journey to
the West' scenario. They were simply watching the proceedings from the
Final Scenario.

"Behave yourselves in a way that won't bring shame to our honour."

<Emperor>'s Constellations heard the resolute voice of their Incarnation
and lowered their heads belatedly, their cheeks flushing.

A bit further away, Jung Heewon and Lee Jihye were observing that
spectacle.

"…That's a surprise."

"You can say that again."

All the influential individuals from the large Nebulas they had run into so
far didn't want to acknowledge their victory. But it was a different story this
time.

Maybe he sensed their gazes, Fei Hu formed a sheepish grin and
approached the two.

"Incarnation Jung Heewon."

Jung Heewon got tense and held the Steelsword tightly. He was easily one
of the strongest enemies she had ever faced so far.

But he began speaking in a warm voice. "Incarnation Jung Heewon. Our
battle this time left a deep impression on me."

"…Oh, okay."
"If an opportunity arises in the future, I'd love to invite you over to China
and treat you to a hearty meal."

One could spot slightly flushed cheeks in between Fei Hu's sideboards. Lee
Jihye definitely caught that, and through [Voice Projection], spoke up in
pure admiration.

–          …Wow. Even though the world went down the crapper, a guy
like him stillmanaged to survive.

Jung Heewon dazedly stared back at him. Meanwhile, he couldn't dare to
meet her gaze and began fidgeting slightly.

Lee Jihye lightly elbowed Jung Heewon in the side.

–         Eonni, what are you doing?? He's probably the best out of all the
menwe've seen so far, you know? Sure, he's far below my Master in the
looks department, but still…

"I'm sorry, but…" Jung Heewon replied in a polite voice as if she was an
expert from Murim. "I've decided to dedicate my life to the sword, so…"

"It's the same story for me."

"…Pardon?"

"I'd like to invite you to China and share our views on the ways of the
sword for the whole night."

Fei Hu's eyes burned passionately as he began his long-winded speech,
prompting Jung Heewon to feel a bit repulsed for a moment there. She
glanced to her side and discovered Lee Jihye, who used to be cheering on
with her sparkling eyes, now shaking her head in helplessness. If this whole
thing was nothing more than their misunderstanding, fine, but if not, then
something rather bothersome might happen in the future.
Tsu-chuchuchut…

Her Sponsor was unable to watch this anymore and the sounds of her
making a move could be heard next.

[Constellation, 'Demon-like Judge of Fire', is…]

'It's fine, Uriel. Please be still'.


If Uriel unnecessarily stepped up here, then the dying embers of the war
might light up again. If it was left up to her, though, she might just fight
him
one-on-one now and nip the bud right away, but the gazes of the
Constellations nearby were fixed on them, so…

"I'm sorry, I'm already…"

Just as she got that far, the Steelsword she held suddenly began vibrating.
Lee Hyunsung had transformed into this sword. For some reason, though,
she felt just a little resentful.

Why couldn't this sword be a talking sword?

"What the heck is this? Get out of the way!"

The one to help her out was, surprisingly enough, Han Sooyoung. It was
unknown when she entered the scenario, but regardless, she shoved Fei Hu
away and made her entrance before throwing out a question, her eyes
scanning the surroundings.

"Where is Kim Dokja?"

…Kim Dokja?
Jung Heewon shifted her gaze to a certain Incarnation Body slumped on her
back.

Fei Hu glared at the uninvited guest Han Sooyoung with unhappy eyes.
Jung Heewon alternated her gaze between him and Kim Dokja on her back
and a nice idea suddenly popped up in her head.

"My liege!"

As if she was re-enacting the 'Flag Contest', she quickly embraced Kim
Dokja and shouted out in an impassioned voice.

"My liege, are you alright??"

His pale Incarnation Body sagged limply in her arms and shook around a
little.

"Oh, my king!"

Everyone was now looking at her. Lee Jihye's jaw dropped slightly, while
Han Sooyoung looked dumbfounded.

As for Fei Hu…

"Ah…"

He looked as if he understood everything now.

"I see, Incarnation Jung Heewon. So, that's how it was…"

His gaze shifted from Jung Heewon, Han Sooyoung and to Lee Jihye,
before eventually landing on Kim Dokja's face next. He sneakily bit his lip.
Like a tragic extra feeling envious of the chosen protagonist, he slowly
lowered his head and turned around to leave.

Lee Jihye watching that sent a [Voice Projection] to Jung Heewon again.
– It's alright now, eonni. He's gone. Looks like he's fallen into some kind of
a weird misunderstanding, though.

However, Jung Heewon didn't stop.

"My liege! Wake up! My liege! If you don't wake up, I'll kill you!"

Slap! Slap! Slap! Slap!!

Kim Dokja's left cheek began swelling up after her palm kept hitting him
there.

Han Sooyoung stared at her with a less-than-impressed expression and
asked. "…What are you doing?"

"Revenge."

She nodded her head in acceptance, and took over from Jung Heewon to
grab hold of Kim Dokja's neck and shook him around hard.

"Hey, you."

"…"

"I told you that I'd create your new Modifier, didn't I? But then, you
couldn't wait and got yourself a new one anyway?"

"…"

"Were you listening to my narration? Did you hear that last part? How was
it? It's fine to come out clean, you idiot. I know you were moved to tears.
Weren't you?"

Kim Dokja still didn't reply. Han Sooyoung frowned deeply and began
slapping the other cheek that wasn't swollen yet.
Shin Yoosung couldn't watch this sight any longer and hurriedly ran over.
"What are you all doing?!"

"Don't worry, he's still breathing. He's not dead yet."

Despite all this ruckus, he showed no signs of waking up. That caused
opinions to split up among the group.

"Most likely, he's deliberately not waking up here. He knows he's in the
wrong."

"Makes sense. In that case, how about we let him taste pain so unbearable
that he…"

"Aren't you all being a bit too much right now??"

Such a situation carried on for another five minutes. But, even after another
ten minutes, he still showed no signs of regaining consciousness. That's
when the expressions of the group grew serious as well.

"…What's going on here?"

Eventually, the group had to search for one person capable of explaining
this situation for them. It was Yoo Joonghyuk lying unconscious next to
Kim Dokja.

"Hey, Yoo Joonghyuk! Open your eyes! Why isn't this idiot Kim Dokja
waking up??"

Slap! Slap! Slap! Slap!!

His firmer cheek didn't swell up as easily as Kim Dokja's. How long went
by like this? Yoo Joonghyuk's eyes cracked open just a little.

"I am Yoo Joonghyuk…"
"Dammit, what's wrong with this guy now?"

Like a mental patient, he kept repeating the same thing over and over again.

Yoo Sangah belatedly made her entrance and stopped Han Sooyoung.
"Please stop grilling Joonghyuk-ssi like that. His memories got jumbled by
the Story so he's most likely not himself right now."

"Sangah eonni!"

The group belatedly came back to life with the joy of reunion and gathered
around Yoo Sangah. A different type of vibe was now coming off from her
newly-reincarnated body.

Han Sooyoung observed the change and asked a question with a smirk. "I
heard that you're now the 'Sakyamuni's Successor', but you haven't shaved
your head."

"Religions nowadays have gotten rather trendy, you know."

"Welcome back. You were a bit late, but still."

"It was difficult to return just in time before you caused us trouble, but I
made it."

"…I'm not the one causing trouble. It's this guy."

Yoo Sangah shrugged her shoulders and extended her hand towards the
unconscious Kim Dokja. The 'Constrictive Headband' on his head began
emitting a bright glow just then.

Jung Heewon nodded her head in satisfaction. "That's a good idea. I guess
he won't be able to run away now."

"…It's unfortunate, but he seems to have run away already."
"Eh?"

"His soul hasn't returned to his body."

A very thin thread was extending from the headband on Kim Dokja's head
to the sky above. It seemed to be connected somewhere. Yoo Sangah
observed the end of this thread and spoke up. "But, don't worry. He didn't
go far. And it doesn't seem that he left on his own volition, either."

Didn't leave on his own volition – the meaning behind those words was
clear.

Han Sooyoung hurriedly looked around the vicinity and asked. "Where did
the 'Secretive Plotter' disappear to??"




The view of the dimensional portal was moving past me at a rapid pace.

Everything happened in the blink. The moment I deactivated [Omniscient
Readers Viewpoint], something grabbed my soul, and by the time I
regained my wits, I was already jumping through this portal alongside the
'Secretive Plotter'.

Now normally, something like this would've been impossible. But it was a
special case this time.

[You failed to uphold the 'Existence Pledge'.]

[Your soul will be temporarily tied to the Existence Pledge's contract.]

[Your contractor will possess the rights to your soul for the next 24
hours.] I looked at the messages rising up in the air and chuckled

hollowly.

– I had no idea the [Existence Pledge] could be used this way.

The [Existence Pledge] – do not contact <Kim Dokja's Company> during
the scenario's duration or reveal my identity.

That was the only thing I failed to uphold during the scenario.

Since the scenario's contents changed mid-way, I figured there was some
room for differences in opinions, but it seemed the <Star Stream> had
judged that I went against the pledge in the end.

– Are you going to kill me?

The 'Secretive Plotter', now in the form of a boy, was enveloped from head
to toe in bursts of powerful sparks. I sensed countless Yoo Joonghyuks
looking at me from inside his Story. But, I didn't sense any hostility from it.

He clearly wasn't planning to kill me.

Just like what Yoo Joonghyuk opined earlier, if this guy wanted me dead,
there were several opportunities to do so already.

Not too long afterwards, the portal closed. Our destination was a familiar
one. It was a forest covered in the overgrown darkness.

It was the N'Gai's Forest, the home of the 'Secretive Plotter'.

【Go inside.】

Along with those words, my soul got sucked into something.
I blinked, and my eyes moved. However, I had neither arms nor legs. I
wondered what on earth was going on here and looked around, only to
discover my reflection in the mirror on a nearby wall.

…I was now a small Murim dumpling.

Somehow, I got the feeling that it was the same figure that [999] was using
before.

"How does it feel like to end up as a dumpling?!"

Not sure when they popped out, but well, a lynch mob of the kkoma Yoo
Joonghyuks rushed at me and began kicking me around. Thankfully, it
didn't hurt all that much due to them being all kkomas.

I hunkered down to stop the dumpling skin from tearing and shouted out.

– Not sure what you're trying to do here, but you can't stop me. In 24 hours,
I'll return to my Incarnation body, you know. If you want to kill me, you
better do so now.

Of course, I didn't really mean that he should kill me.

I asked the 'Secretive Plotter', perched up on the throne.

– Secretive Plotter, what's your real goal? Why are you keeping me alive?

My question caused the kkoma Yoo Joonghyuks to stop hitting me.

The 'Secretive Plotter' looked down at me. There he was, the strongest
Outer God as well as the Constellation that I knew of. Also, the strongest
Yoo Joonghyuk out of all Yoo Joonghyuks.

– I know that we'd have never won if you really went all out.
Even if Yoo Joonghyuk regained the memories of 1864 regression turns
and combined his powers with mine, it was still impossible to surpass the
Plotter through purely the Status of our Story.

Not only was he the total sum of the histories spanning from 0th turn all the
way up to 1863, but he also endured an uncountable period of time
afterwards, on top of that.

Even then, the 'Secretive Plotter' chose to lose rather than to kill us.

"Because you are a necessity, you fool." [41] listening to me yap on replied.
"You possess the last fragment of the 'Final Wall', that's why."
               Chapter 450: Ep. 85 - The Final Wall, II


Bihyung was in a very good mood. It couldn't be helped, since the
Dokkaebi had witnessed the scenario playing out in the panel right before
his eyes.

– Every time that happens, I'll do my best to fight back.

Accompanying Kim Dokja's voice was the scenario conclusion notice.
Indirect messages from innumerable Constellations flooded in, and the
whole of <Star Stream> was trembling grandly.

A new owner of the Giant Story ⸢Journey to the West⸥ had been decided.

'He did it. That Kim Dokja, he really pulled it off'.

A storyteller was supposed to remain neutral. The thing was, though, all
judges secretly rooted for a team they liked. This was true for Bihyung as
well.
Like a parent looking at his wonderfully-matured children, Bihyung stroked
the faces appearing on the screen with a deeply moved expression.
[Congratulations, Bihyung Director-nim.]

The subordinate Dokkaebis around him offered their congratulations. They
all knew that Bihyung had been watching <Kim Dokja's Company> for a
long time.

[I just knew they would pull through.]

[M-me too. Me too…!]

Not only that, some of them had been cheering on the <Kim Dokja's
Company> alongside him, too. Several carried expressions just as excited
as Bihyung's.

For these Dokkaebis that only sought out new, potential stimulations in
order to find the next story's objective, being this earnest about something
was indeed an exceedingly rare thing.

[These kids are mine. Stop drooling over them.]

[Haha! Of course we wouldn't…]

It was then an urgent piece of news arrived for him.

[Director. The Great Dokkaebi, 'Baram' is…]

[You've been promoted!]

…A promotion?

[Bihyung Director-nim, truly, honestly, congratulations!]

[Looks like the Bureau is doing its job properly for once!]
Bihyung couldn't make heads nor tails while subjected to the outpouring of
messages.

He was an 'upper-rank Dokkaebi', not to mention the director of the Seoul
branch. He had already climbed to the highest-possible position through
one's hard work alone.

However, getting a promotion here could only mean…

[…Director-nim?]

Without a doubt, this should be a good thing.

But why was he overcome with this ominous foreboding?

[Great Dokkaebi is waiting for you.]

Bihyung was guided by lower-ranked Dokkaebis to a portal, and entered it.
Soon, the thick fog receded away to reveal the figure of a Great Dokkaebi
waiting for him at the end of a grey-coloured passage.

[You've come, Bihyung.]

[Baram-nim.]

As if to imply that Bihyung had worked hard, Baram patted him on the
shoulder and spoke up. [Congratulations. Your promotion has been
decided.]

[…Pardon me?]

[We need to do something about your dazed expression. Don't you
understand? It's been decided that you'll be chosen as the last one to
become the 'Great Dokkaebi'.]
The Great Dokkaebi. The highest honour that all storytellers dreamed of
reaching. Something that he only daydreamed about had now become a
reality, leaving Bihyung utterly bewildered and lost.

[…Great Dokkaebi? You mean, I am?]

[That's right. This promotion is unprecedented in the history of <Star
Stream>.]

Baran chuckled contently and took the lead. Bihyung didn't even know
where they were going and simply chased after him. He had so many things
he wanted to ask.

Just where was this place, and also…

[You'll soon become a Great Dokkaebi, so it's about time that you meet that
'person', no?]

Baram smiled as if he could see through Bihyung's thoughts.

[When you say 'that person', could you be…]

Even though he did ask, Bihyung could already guess the answer.

The surrounding air seemed to distort and faint traces of sparks bounced
around in the atmosphere. When he took a closer look, those sparks were
taking on the shapes of letters. Something was before him, a being that he
had never seen before.

[We've arrived.]

They circled around the gallery and went past the fog-covered passageway
to reach a massive hall.

No, could this place even be called a 'hall'?
It was so humongous that its dimensions couldn't even be estimated. And
inside this place, there was a wide wall spanning across it. The length of
this mysterious wall could also not be measured due to its sheer, immense
size.

Letters engraved on the surface of the wall seemed to be burning; many
cracks and various damages, both large and small, could be seen on its
surface.

In that moment, Bihyung got the feeling that he had seen that wall from
somewhere.

[…The Plate of Revelation?]

It was undoubtedly the Plate of Revelation. Although its shape was
different, that 'wall' the Constellations received their revelations from
possessed the similar overall vibe.

However, why was another 'Plate of Revelation' here? And also, what
was up with its humongous size…? [Everyone has gathered, I see.]

The moment he heard that voice, Bihyung prostrated on the floor even
before he realized it. He might have dealt with countless Constellations
until now, but at least this time, he couldn't control his nervousness.

He couldn't even guess the vastness of the Status felt from that voice.

He glanced to his side and saw that all the Great Dokkaebis, including
Baram, were prostrating towards the front as well.

Someone was standing in front of the 'Plate of Revelation'.

Bihyung hid his shivering and slowly raised his head. And that's when he
realized it.

So, that was it, then… Now, he understood it.
That creature was the absolute being that ruled the <Bureau> and controlled
the <Star Stream>.

The 'King of Stories'.

The King extended his lengthy and pale hand to stroke the wall while
slowly opening its mouth.

[The 'One Story' that decides the next world will now be chosen.]


"You saying that I have the last fragment of the 'Final Wall'?"

"That's right."

[41]'s words made me frown deeply.

I could guess more or less on what they were talking about. The 'Final Wall'
– I tried to gather information on that thing during this regression turn, too.
It was one of the things that never got fully explained in the original 'Ways
of Survival'. I was pretty sure of this 'Wall' being the clue that would
determine the end of this regression turn.

And as for this 'last fragment' thing they were talking about…

[Exclusive skill, 'The Fourth Wall', is powerfully activating!]

⸢Kim Dok ja⸥

Don't worry. I'll never hand you over to them.

I slowly blinked my eyes and focused. The 'Secretive Plotter' was staring at
me. He might have lost a lot of his Status, but he was still the strongest
Constellation I knew, and he was an 'Outer God' to boot.
I recalled the first day I arrived at the N'Gai's Forest and opened my mouth.
"We talked about this before, didn't we. You said that I need to figure out
why I had to be brought here before the 'Three Divine Questions and
Answer' came to an end."

【I did.】

"You actually want to see the end of this world, don't you? You might be
saying this and that, but you too have placed your hope on this world-line."
The Plotter's brows quivered ever so slightly.

No matter how hard he denied being Yoo Joonghyuk, he still failed to get
rid of his old habits.

"And for that purpose, you need [the Fourth Wall] that I possess. That's
why you're keeping me alive. Am I right?"

He didn't answer me. If he was planning to behave like that, I could think of
a way to get him to talk.

Tsu-chuchuchut.

"I didn't get to hear that final answer to the Three Divine Questions."

['Three Divine Questions and Answers' has resumed!]

[You have one more right to ask a question.]

Back then, I asked the 'Secretive Plotter' this.

The ⸢Three Ways to Survive a Ruined World.⸥

– 'Secretive Plotter'. Are you someone who knows the epilogue of that
novel?
"'Secretive Plotter'. Just what did you see at the 'conclusion'?"

The 'Ways of Survival' I read ended with the 3149th chapter. However, the
Plotter lived on past that, even though I didn't get to see it. He survived that
unrecorded history and reached the conclusion reserved only for him.

Just what did he see in that place?

What was there that it prompted him to become an 'Outer God' and appear
in this world-line?

[41] stepped forward first to answer my question. He shouted at me with a
slightly angry face. "That question is…!!"

【41st.】

Kkoma Yoo Joonghyuks all shut their mouths up after the Plotter stopped
them. The 'Yoo Joonghyuk' currently in the shape of a boy – the 'Secretive
Plotter' – was looking straight at me.

For a moment there, I felt a bit weirded out. Yoo Joonghyuk's childhood
years had never been fully explained in the 'Ways of Survival'. No, it just
got a few brief passing mentions in the form of reminiscence.

Of course, not getting a proper explanation didn't mean he had no childhood
to begin with.

It was kind of similar to the 3150th chapter of the 'Ways of Survival'. Yoo
Joonghyuk was born in a place I didn't know of, and managed to survive
until he became the story's protagonist.

【Just how much of my journey was described in that novel you read?】

The protagonist with a face I didn't know was asking me.
I hesitated slightly before replying. "…Up until when you were about to
reach the Dokkaebi King."

I recalled the final moments of the 'Ways of Survival'.

He journeyed to kill the Dokkaebi King; wading past the 'Final Fog', Yoo
Joonghyuk rushed into the final phase of the story. There was no further
explanation on what happened afterwards or what he saw there.

That was also the reason why I got flustered back then while reading the
last released chapter. I grew scared, wondering if it really was the end.

【What was I like during those last moments?】

Now that unexpected question got me truly

flustered.

I didn't think he'd ask me about something like that.

"Why would you…?"

【Did it look like I succeeded? Did it look like I'd get to achieve my goal at
the end of it all?】

The moment I heard his question, I was overcome with this unexplainable
stifling feeling. I couldn't understand why the 'Secretive Plotter' asked me
that. My thoughts regarding that were not important at all. Not even by a
small speck…

…Wait, was it really not as important?

"You…"

My lips barely managed to bob up and down.
I wasn't prepared for that question. However, I still needed to answer it
regardless of whether I was ready or not.

⸢In that very moment, she realized that this world had completely left her
hands.⸥
Memories from [Peace Land] came bubbling up – the mangaka Asuka
Ren's expression as she let go of the world she had created. The duty of the
person who had created a new world…

I wasn't like her. I didn't write the 'Ways of Survival', but I was…

⸢This story was able to see the light of the world all thanks to you,
Dokjanim.⸥
…I was someone who had witnessed the story's end.

"You did succeed. Because you gave it your all."

Answering him was the duty of the one who had seen the story until its
conclusion. I carefully and slowly recalled all the sentences I still
remembered.

"Didn't matter which regression it was, you always made the best choice
you could've made. I don't know what kind of a conclusion you reached,
but you were not wrong."

All of Yoo Joonghyuk's regression turns brushed past my mind. Everything
he earned, and then, all the things he had lost during them…

"I'm sure that your companions thought the same, too."

…And also, his lonely back as he reached the final page by himself.

"However…"
Did I possess the qualification to say this, though?

I couldn't tell.

"You didn't look all that happy for some reason during your final

moments." Even now, the scenes I read didn't want to leave my mind.

⸢Finally, Yoo Joonghyuk who had lost everything was looking at the fog.
The hollow answer he'd been searching for was just beyond that fog.⸥
The face of the 'Secretive Plotter' that exactly matched the description from
that scene, was now looking at me.

【I see.】

"…Why did you suddenly ask me that?"

【I was merely curious. You're the only one who had seen 'that' from the
beginning until the end, after all.】

I couldn't say anything back to him.

【I was curious about what my life meant through the eyes of someone
other than mine. That's all.】
              Chapter 451: Ep. 85 - The Final Wall, III


What the 'Secretive Plotter' said felt as hollow as words coming from
someone who had lost all meaning in his life.

I spoke up as if to rebel against that hollowness. "…Your life saved
someone else's."

To someone who had lost so much, the truth of saving a kid whom he didn't
even know the name of wouldn't be much of a consolation. The boy was
someone completely unrelated to him, after all. That boy was not his
companion or his family member.

I tried to open my lips several times, yet I still couldn't say anything else.
The life I lived was no help whatsoever in the quest to save this guy.

The 'Secretive Plotter' looked at me struggling and spoke. 【When I first
saw you, I believed that I needed to bring you under my wings.】
Bring me under his wings. For some reason, I recalled the moments I first
encountered him.


  <Sponsor Selection>

  – Please select your Sponsor.

  – The selected backer will become your dependable sponsor.

  1. Abyssal Black Flame Dragon

  2. Demon-like Judge of Fire

  3. Secretive Plotter

  4. Prisoner of the Golden Headband


…I remembered it.

That did happen. The 'Secretive Plotter' showed up during my first Sponsor
Selection as my third potential choice. He really did try to become my
Sponsor.

【After that, I continued to observe this world-line. Sometimes, I was
surprised. I was just as surprised by the fact that I was surprised. Because I
hadn't been surprised by anything for a long time.】

I knew that. During this world-line's story, he watched what we did and sent
various indirect messages. If I dug through the indirect message logs, I
should be able to read the ones he sent to me.

[Constellation, 'Secretive Plotter', is intrigued by your choice.]
[Constellation, 'Secretive Plotter', is impressed by the level of your
stupidity.]

[Constellation, 'Secretive Plotter', is disappointed by your flippant
declaration.]

[Eyes of the Constellation, 'Secretive Plotter', are sparkling after he heard
your plan.]

[Constellation, 'Secretive Plotter', is curious about your scheme.]

…

Those messages made the first actual face-to-face with him rather awkward
for me. I knew now that [666] and other Yoo Joonghyuks were responsible
for those indirect messages, but still…

【I had to decide – whether to continue observing this distorted world, or to
destroy it.】

"…Was that why you sent me to the 1863rd turn?"

The Plotter nodded his head. His choice led to the beginning of this
'worldline'.

He continued on. 【It was roughly a similar reason why I gave this turn's
Yoo Joonghyuk the information on the 1863rd turn. I had a need to test
you. To find out whether you or this turn's Yoo Joonghyuk was the more
suitable candidate to witness the conclusion.】

"Okay, so your choice was?"

The 'Secretive Plotter' didn't reply and simply stared at me, before opening
his mouth. 【There is a massive wall at the end of this world. It's the 'Final
Wall' that can only be opened when all the keys have been gathered
together.】

– You have acquired answers to all the questions.

– The 'Three Divine Questions and Answers' has ended.

I realized it then. That reply of his was the answer to my 'three questions'.

Sparks dancing around the 'Secretive Plotter' grew more vicious. Certain
information would require the consumption of a great deal of Probability
just by mentioning it. And if the info was related to the end of this world,
then it was only obvious that the Probability cost would be enormous, too.

The 'Final Wall'.

That was the 'Conclusion' the Secretive Plotter had encountered in his
epilogue.

【The 'fragment' you possess is the last key that I've been searching for.】

I got nervous and backed away. As I was in the shape of a [Murim
dumpling], it was pretty hard to take backward steps, but whatever the case
might have been, I simply had to create some distance between us.

If the Plotter's goal was [The Fourth Wall] in my possession, then he…

He, who was busy clenching and unfurling his fists, came across as rather
terrifying for some reason.

Other kkoma Yoo Joonghyuks were also looking up at the Plotter with
tense expressions.
【Far too many things had to be distorted to create this world-line. I
can't decide whether leaving you alone is the right thing to do or not.】
The distorted world-line. The broken Probability.

I heard about those two things lots of times already.

"Okay, so what? What do you want, then?"

I just threw out whatever came to my mind. The important thing was to buy
time. I needed to drag this out as long as possible and return to my original
body. That was important.

"I don't really get what you're trying to say here. I don't get all this
confusing mumbo-jumbo about the end result devouring the cause and
whatnot. However, regardless of what, my companions and I did our
absolute best to come this far. The conclusion is practically around the
corner for us."

I could almost see it, the conclusion to this previously-unwritten story.
【Seeing the conclusion is not everything. The truly important thing is to
witness the correct conclusion.】

"Correct conclusion? Deciding that would be…"

【A story with distorted Probability will always go on to create a
calamity.】

I became dazed from that declaration, something that only a Dokkaebi
would make.

"That's not like you. With something you haven't even seen yet…"

It was then an earthquake suddenly erupted out. Something collapsed with a
loud 'Thud!!'
The wine glass on the circular table tumbled over; the whole forest was
shaking around.

"…What's going on??"

This was definitely not a natural tremor.

The 'Secretive Plotter' slowly stood up from the throne and walked past me.
His empty eyes were now peering deeply at the wide view of the forest.

The N'Gai's Forest was enveloped in the violent conflagration.

His forest was burning up.

[AhAhAhAhAhAh]

[SavemeSavemeSavemeSavemeSavemeSaveme]

All those trees, so tall that they might pierce the heavens above, were now
burning away into ashes. 'Outer Gods' hidden within the forest screamed.
The hall's temperature rapidly shot up from the incredible power of the
flames. This couldn't have been a simple arson.

Even I could sense it.

Someone possessing incredible Status was attacking this place.

But, who could it be?

Something like this was impossible. This was the territory of none other
than the 'Secretive Plotter'. So, who would dare to invade this place, then?

Could it be one of the large Nebulas?

<Vedas>? <Olympus>? Or… <Asgard>?
I quickly went through the list of all the Constellations related to 'fire' in my
head. But I couldn't come up with any Modifiers.

This incredible flame that burned away the entirety of the expansive
forest… Could it be that there was another existence possessing this much
power back in the original story?

[MykingMykingMykingMykingMyking]

[EscapeEscapeEscapeEscapeEscape]

Small 'Outer Gods' quickly gathered around the Plotter. Many Outer Gods
had left him by now, but still, there were quite a lot that chose to remain.
They were like the citizens crowding around to protect their king, having
sensed the imminent fall of their kingdom.

The 'Secretive Plotter' looking at his subjects spoke to me. 【'Demon King
of Salvation'. I too made a mistake like you once before.】

His voice remained relaxed, even as he faced an urgent situation of his
forest burning away. As if, he had predicted all of this beforehand.

【Rather foolishly, I tried to change what had already happened in the
past.】

"…What are you suddenly on about? Are you talking about the events of
the 41st turn?"

If that was the case, then I too knew what happened.

Yoo Joonghyuk from the 41st turn made a deal with the 'Devil of the
Horizon' and sent Shin Yoosung to the 3rd turn. As a consequence, she
ended up becoming the 3rd turn's calamity.
If the 'Secretive Plotter' was thinking about that particular 'calamity', then I
wanted to tell him that there was nothing to worry about.

Unfortunately, [41] next to me was shaking his head. "This isn't from my
regression turn."

"What? But then…"

[41] didn't reply and simply stared at the Plotter.

My head was in a mess. According to my knowledge, the only regression
turn in the 'Ways of Survival' where he interfered with the past that had
already happened was the 41st.

…But now, there was another turn besides that one?

When was that? Did it happen outside the original story?

A sun enveloped in pure flames was rising up high above the wide-open
ceiling of the hall. However, this sun belonged to neither Surya nor Apollo.
And in the center of this exploding sun, ominous-looking sunspots were
growing larger. No Constellations that I knew possessed a Sun that
horrifying.

That was the power belonging to an existence I didn't know of.

[999th turn's 'Yoo Joonghyuk' is sighing in lamentation at the Sun.]

…999th turn??


Abruptly, I recalled something. ⸢Yoo Joonghyuk from the 999th

regression turn. I respect the life you led.
Excluding me, you were the only one who managed to get near the
'Conclusion'.⸥

One of them was what the 'Secretive Plotter' had said, and…

⸢"Even if I regress, this world will not vanish. Meaning, the world will not
reset just because I died."⸥
…And, the other one was what Yoo Joonghyuk had said.

Even if he died, the world would not vanish. Even after he regressed, the
world would still remain.

⸢What if it wasn't only the 'Secretive Plotter' who witnessed the
Conclusion?⸥

⸢What if there was another story that didn't get a mention in the original
storyline?⸥

⸢What if there was another being who, even after Yoo Joonghyuk had died,
remained in that world and continued on through the scenarios? While
fighting over and over again…⸥

The sun now enveloped in jet-black flames suddenly cracked like an
eggshell and blinding rays of light exploded out.

⸢What if there was another being who reached the end of the world and
witnessed his or her 'Conclusion'?⸥
The arsonist responsible for burning down the forest showed itself in the
center of the light. A silhouette simply too beautiful to labelled as a mere
arsonist wavered about.
Another existence possessing power equalling the 'Secretive Plotter'. Such
an existence was spreading out her purest-white wings right before my
eyes.

The Plotter looked up at this creature and spoke.

【The 'Living Flame'.】

The 'Living Flame', he said.

There was such a name among the records written by the 'Recorder of Fear'.

⸢The 'Living Flame' that rises up from the east.⸥

One of the kings that ruled over the 'Outer Gods' alongside the 'Secretive
Plotter'.

The thing was, I never thought about who the other kings could be, or
where they might have come from.

What a stupid moron I was.

All the 'Outer Gods' were beings from the discarded regression turns from
the 'Ways of Survival'. Since that was the case, I should've figured it out
that their kings would also be other beings from the 'Ways of Survival', too.

Ku-gugugugu!

It felt as if my hands were trembling like crazy.

I didn't want to imagine the cause and effect. No, I didn't want to
acknowledge it. Right now, I didn't want to accept that a world as
horrifying as this one could actually exist.

With his trademark disinterested voice, the Plotter addressed me. 【Now do
you understand? This is the consequence of distorting the world-line.】
As his words came to an end, a sword wrapped in the most brilliant,
luminous flames began pointing in our direction.

It was the sword of an Archangel that I was intimately familiar with.

Why didn't I know it? Maybe, I didn't want to know in the first place?

That these flames could be this hot and this merciless?

That the flames meant to burn demons could also burn other beings, too?

The sword [Flames of Retribution], now completely covered in [Hellfire],
was glowing brightly. The owner of the sword was smiling. And with an
utterly terrifying expression that I had never witnessed before, she opened
her mouth to speak.

【I've been searching for you for a very long time, Yoo Joonghyuk from
the 1863rd turn.】

The eyes of the Archangel who judged everything now blazed in pitch-
black flames.

【Oh, the Outer God who ruined my world.】

It was Uriel.
               Chapter 452: Ep. 85 - The Final Wall, IV


That light in her eyes, that killing intent.

They were exactly the same as that of the Archangel I knew, yet they were
also different.

This was Uriel's true appearance, the cold-blooded and cruel judge. She was
the being that burned all the enemies caught by the [Flame of Retribution]
for the sake of righteousness.

⸢This Uriel had reached her own 'Conclusion', and…⸥

[<Star Stream> is observing the entrance of the new 'Outer God'.]

[<Star Stream> is deciphering whether to allow the target's Probability or
not!]

⸢And, she came this far to kill the 'Secretive Plotter'.⸥
[OhOhOhOhOhOh]

[TwokingsTwokingsTwokingTwokingTwokings]

The entrance of another Outer God possessing a similar level of Status as
the Secretive Plotter caused confusion to spread among the small Outer
Gods.

[Constellation, 'Goryeo's First Sword', is greatly stunned by the entrance of
the new 'Outer God'!]

[Constellation, 'Bald General of Justice', is watching this battlefield while
forgetting to polish his head.]

[Constellation, 'Lily Blooming in Aquarius', is opening her eyes wide!]

It seemed that Constellations were just as shocked as me.

…But, broadcasting from this place should've been impossible?

Maybe the barrier preventing the broadcast was undone after the forest
went up in flames.

[<Bureau> is paying attention to the 'N'Gai's Forest'.]

The [Flames of Retribution] moved in Uriel's hands. The blade that melted
the entirety of the forest flew in, but the Plotter lightly shifted his head out
of the way. The weapon missed him by a hair's breadth and instead, blew
away half of the hall and set it on fire.

[GahAhAhAhAhAh]

Outer Gods, shocked by the merciless destruction, screamed out loudly.

The [Flames of Retribution] moved again, this time with enough Status to
blow the entire hall away. Every hair on my dumpling body rose up. Even
Surya back in the original novel's 265th turn was not as powerful as this
when he destroyed Earth.

Kwa-aaaaah!!

This time, a humongous meteor was descending from the tip of the [Flames
of Retribution]. It contained enough power to blow away this forest and
then, maybe even erase this entire dimension along the way, too.

I dragged out every ounce of power within my soul form. Unfortunately,
there was no way I'd properly block such an attack without an Incarnation
Body. Besides, to block an attack like that, you'd need…

[Giant Story, 'Pilgrim of the Lonely Apocalypse', has begun its
storytelling!]

In the end, the 'Secretive Plotter' had to step forward. Pitch-black particles
shot out as he swung the [Splitting the Sky Sword] vigorously. It was the
power of a Giant Story. The dark Status spread out like a huge wall and
defended against the meteor's impact.

Kwaaaa-boooom!!

Violent gusts of wind whipped about near the base of the forest, and the
uprooted trees were flung up into the air. Whirlwinds made out of flames
were completely annihilating everything in the vicinity.

Witnessing a clash of this calibre was indeed an exceedingly rare
opportunity. Even the battle between Hades and Poseidon back in
'Gigantomachia' wasn't this hectic.

[Large Nebulas are paying close attention to the battle between these two
beings.]

Tsu-chuchuchu…!
In the center of where the two Statuses were colliding, sparks grew fiercer
and heavier. The Plotter's [Splitting the Sky Sword] was trembling; he was
being pushed back. It was all due to his Status being reduced after fighting
me and Yoo Joonghyuk.

This was the power of Uriel who witnessed the 'Conclusion'.

At this rate, both the 'Secretive Plotter' and I would disappear from the
<Star Stream> along with the N'Gai's Forest.

[Currently, your soul temporarily belongs to the 'Secretive Plotter'.]

[Time remaining until your soul can return: 20 hours, 31 minutes, 20
seconds]

I still had over twenty hours remaining until my soul could return. Simply
dragging things out wouldn't help my situation at all. Because it didn't look
as if the 'Secretive Plotter' would be able to hold out for too long.

[Exclusive skill, 'The Fourth Wall', is activating!]

I needed to stay calm in moments like this. I decided to get a better
understanding of this situation first.

"Look, man! Why is Uriel attacking you??"

First of all, which world-line did that 'Uriel' come from? And why was she
attacking the 'Secretive Plotter'?

[999th turn's 'Yoo Joonghyuk' is staring at the 'Living Flame' with a
helpless expression.]

For a moment, I felt the inside of my head blank out.

…Could it be?
It was the regression turn that I liked the most. It was almost the perfect
turn with just one blemish to its record – the regression turn that reached
the Conclusion's doorstep.

Uriel began speaking again. 【Oh, I ask you, the Outer God. I hope that
you haven't forgotten about the events of the 999th turn.】

【…I do remember.】

【That's good.】

The blade of the enraged Uriel contained the Story she had compiled so far.
[Giant Story, 'Flames of Eternity', has begun its storytelling!]

Her Giant Story burned fiercely. A story that I had never seen before was
unfolding itself.

⸢"Master, we're almost there. We just have to go a little bit further, you
know!"⸥
That was Lee Jihye's voice.

Words began telling their story.

⸢"Joonghyuk-ssi, just hold on for a little longer. We're almost there!"⸥

999th turn's Yoo Joonghyuk, having lost his left arm, right leg, and both of
his eyes, was there. This Yoo Joonghyuk only lived for the sake of his
companions.

His world was dyed in darkness, but one voice entered it like a ray of light.

⸢[Supreme King, you must stay with us.]⸥

That's right. Uriel was also accompanying them in the 999th turn.
She was Yoo Joonghyuk's companion. For the sake of a man who risked his
everything to fight, the Archangel willingly became his ally.

⸢[The Conclusion to this world is just around the corner.]⸥

I recalled that the 999th turn was something of a miracle.

Even if their luck was good, to think that he managed to almost reach the
Conclusion during only his 999th turn.

But the truth was, it wasn't all due purely to 'luck'.

⸢Yoo Joonghyuk of the 999th turn made a deal with an 'Outer God'.⸥

The reason why I didn't go for the [Absolute Throne], and tried not to do
the 'Other World Pledge' if at all possible, was because I knew how the
'999th turn' had ended.

⸢An unknown godly being, whose name was just as mysterious. The 'Other
World Pledge' made with that godly being eventually took Yoo
Joonghyuk's life.⸥

The original novel didn't specify who that 'Outer God' was. But it was a
creature that spent its own Probability to grant the 999th turn's Yoo
Joonghyuk incredible power and lucky opportunities.

Chills ran down my neck.

– 'Demon King of Salvation'. I too made a mistake like you once before.

– Rather foolishly, I tried to change what had already happened in the past.

That 'Outer God' was none other than the 'Secretive Plotter'.
– Now, do you understand? This is the consequence of distorting the world-
line.

He had entered the past world-line belonging to the original storyline and
tried to distort the Probability. And the result of that was Uriel who
witnessed the Conclusion of the 999th regression turn, showing up here.

【I shall avenge my world-line in this place.】

She was here to avenge her companions' grudges against the 'Outer God'
from then.

【Just like how you stole away all that's precious to me, I shall do the same
to you.】

Her boundless and justified wrath filled her true voice. I felt all my strength
abandoning me.

I could understand where Uriel was coming from. I too clearly remembered
the moment that the 999th turn's Yoo Joonghyuk died.

– Author-nim. This can't be the end, can it? But, isn't Joonghyuk-ie just
toopitiful to end up like this?

999th turn's Yoo Joonghyuk sacrificed his life to guide his companions
towards the Conclusion. But his cost was to never see the conclusion of the
world himself.

It was all because of the damn 'Other World Pledge'. The Probability
flooding in cut his life off before the end.

– Can't he be revived somehow? Like, the Underworld, or
throughreincarnation. I mean, there are lots of different ways, right?
Besides, just what was that 'Outer God' anyway…?
I resented the author, and resented that 'Outer God'. And I despaired while
looking at the dying Yoo Joonghyuk with only a little bit left until the
Conclusion.

The mental shock was so strong that I even ended up hesitating whether to
read the next day's chapter or not.

Now, I was curious.

Why did the 'Secretive Plotter' do something like that back in the 999th
turn?

【I wanted to change it.】

…What?

【I wanted to see a proper Conclusion. Even if that happened in a different
world-line.】

The Plotter once told me this – that I had to be careful with the Probability,
that I needed to create the right Conclusion. But even someone saying stuff
like that had actually wished to change his past.

Just like how I wished to change this regression turn, he too had felt the
same way once.

Regardless of whether the end result devoured the cause or not…

Even if the <Star Stream>'s Probability crumbled…

…He wanted to reach the proper Conclusion at least once. He wished to see
himself reaching the Conclusion together with his companions.

However, it didn't work out that way.
【I'm sure you find me quite pathetic. That I made the same sort of mistake
as you.】

The Plotter's Status was crumbling down. His body was getting even
smaller. All Yoo Joonghyuks sleeping within him were now screaming.
And as if to speak up for those screams…

【I wanted to find the one responsible for creating this tragedy,】 said the
Plotter. 【The one who created this universe. The one that made me
regress, and made me repeat the scenarios. My goal is to kill the one
beyond the 'Wall'.】

That was his true goal.

Stopping the regressions, saving the Outer Gods, opening up the Final
Wall…

All of these were centered around his main goal.

He waved his hand and my soul left the [Murim dumpling]. I got tense. I
couldn't tell what he was thinking of.

I quickly spoke to him.

– The current you can't stop that Uriel. However, if my companions and I
help out…

The Plotter shifted his gaze over to me. 【Do you understand what
you're saying right now?】 – I do.

I was improvising on the fly, but I did genuinely feel that way. Since I
heard his true end goal, it was time for me make my reply.

– From the get-go, the world that peeps on and greedily devours
someoneelse's life is wrong.
The <Star Stream> was wrong. Yoo Joonghyuk's regressions were wrong,
and the stories the scenarios created were unfair.

– That's why I won't sit still. I'll witness the Conclusion. You say I
shouldn't,but I'll see it regardless. I'll definitely jump over that Wall you
failed to cross along with my companions, and as for the being beyond it…
The Plotter was now waiting for me to finish my words.

– …I'll kill that guy. I'll end your 'Oldest Dream'.

Uriel's Status was growing even stronger.

The expansive hall began crumbling down. Like a world breaking apart, the
N'Gai's Forest was disappearing.

Outer Gods moved closer to the 'Secretive Plotter', perhaps sensing that the
end was nigh. Meanwhile, he opened his mouth. 【You said that you
survived because of my story.】

"…"

【In that case, time to pay your debt.】

Just before I could ask him for clarification, Yoo Joonghyuk's Stories
flooded out from him.

[Giant Story, 'Pilgrim of the Lonely Apocalypse', is howling out!]

[Giant Story, 'Hell of Eternity', has begun its storytelling!]

The Plotter's memories were now permeating into me – memories that I
didn't know.

The information he gained after going through the 1863rd turn was now
flooding into me.
– You…!

A portal was generated behind me, one created by the power of an 'Outer
God'. It began to gradually suck me in.

– H-hey, hang on a minute! What are you trying to…!

【I'm not trying to leave this world's Conclusion in your hands.】

At that moment, he no longer looked like the 'Secretive Plotter'.

【I shall regress.】

Right now, he was 'Yoo Joonghyuk'.

【I shall live through the 1864th turn, and then, the 1865th. I'll survive that
turn, witness the Conclusion and become the Outer God once more,
and…】

Eventually, the hall collapsed. Everything was melting away under the
bright light. Uriel's sword sliced through the thick history that totalled
1863rd regression turns, and flew towards the 'Secretive Plotter'.

【To see the Conclusion of this world-line, I shall return.】

His body was defenselessly pierced through. And I had to watch that,
unable to do anything. He was cut down by the [Flames of Retribution] and
his Story was scattering away.

[Constellation, 'Secretive Plotter', is activating Stigma, 'Regression Lv.??'!]

Even though he had become the 'Outer God', he was still a regressor.
The one thing he hadn't done in a long time, regressing, would start again.
He'd wake up in the 1864th turn's subway once more, and go on to create
yet another horrifying world-line.

⸢Kim Dokja thought to himself. 'I can't let that be'.⸥

Before I could unleash the Stories permeating in my soul form, though,
Uriel made her move first.

【You shall not escape to the next turn.】

Her white hands grabbed the Plotter's neck. Black light pouring out from
her hand stopped the Story's disintegration. The light spread out gradually
and encased his entire body. Soon, the light formed a shape of small sphere.

I recognised what that was.

That was the [Sealing Sphere] used back in the 1863rd turn to seal away the
'Apocalypse Dragon'.

Why didn't I think of it before? Uriel was now an Outer God, too. So she
should obviously be aware of the Plotter's, or Yoo Joonghyuk's, ability by
now. She should know that he'd continue regressing and would never truly
die.

Her hand tightened further and further. The jet-black Sealing Sphere soon
emitted pale light.

【I shall seal you away for eternity.】
               Chapter 453: Ep. 85 - The Final Wall, V


The sealing technique that utilised the [Sealing Sphere of the Apocalypse
Dragon]. This was a similar plan to what the 1863rd turn's Han Sooyoung
had devised.

⸢"It'll stop the time of this place, and Earth will be sealed along with the
Apocalypse Dragon. Frozen forever in the 95th scenario."⸥

⸢"And that is the way you can kill Yoo Joonghyuk."⸥

It was the method of sealing Yoo Joonghyuk inside the perpetuity of time
and stopping his regressions.

I reflexively looked at the 'Secretive Plotter'. I wanted to tell him that now
would be a good time to run. Even if it was him, he'd not be able to escape
from being sealed in that thing.

However, why are you… smiling?
[Constellation, 'Secretive Plotter', is looking at his own ■■.]

He was strong enough to survive 1863 lifetimes. But because of that, he
was also exhausted enough to crumble at any given moment.

The eternal slumber. In a certain way, that was what he had been wishing
for his entire life.

– H-hang on!! Uriel! Please stop!

My words prompted Uriel to look in my direction for the first time.

She seemed to be surprised by the fact that an insignificant being had called
out her true name, and opened her mouth to speak.

【Who is this soul form? Is it an existence from this world-line?】

I wasn't sure what to say here.

Before I could, though, the 'Secretive Plotter' seized the initiative first.
【He's a nobody. Let him go.】

For a moment there, he was looking straight at me. Quite unlike his usual
self, his eyes were displaying clear emotions.

He genuinely wished for me to make my escape from here.

However, the situation remained grim – the portal was being shut forcibly
by Uriel.

She alternated her gaze filled with the 'Secretive Plotter' and me, her eyes
remaining unreadable, before opening her mouth again.

【Even after you ruined your own turn and messed up someone else's
worldline, you still have something you wish to protect?】
Her power extended out in an instant and captured me. This might be the
worst possible situation.

【Very well. I shall seal this bastard away with you. Enjoy your eternal
slumber alongside your companion, then.】

– H-hang on a minute! Shouldn't you be listening to my side of the story,
too?!

Uriel glared at me as if I was speaking of nonsense.

I didn't back down and shouted back.

– I do understand where you are coming from. I know how wronged you
feelafter your world-line got distorted, and I get how angry you are.
However, this is wrong. This isn't your world-line. What you're trying to do
is exactly the same as the one you hate, the 'Secretive Plotter'!

As I urgently made my case, I began sensing this stinging pain on my
forehead. My head with no actual physical form was hurting right now. The
sensation from the constrictive headband was getting stronger.

– Why don't we stop this? I mean, it's already not enough to pool
ourstrengths together to destroy the <Star Stream>, so why should we fight
each other like this? Don't you know who the real enemy is? Don't you
know where the true cause of all this tragedy…

【You want to destroy the <Star Stream>? Why do you wish to do
something like that?】

Now that was an unexpected question.

– That's because the world of the <Star Stream> is…
【If the <Star Stream> disappears, the whole universe will fall into

chaos.】 At that moment, a corner of my chest grew icy cold.

I secretly believed that all my companions wished to witness the same
Conclusion as each other. However… what if that wasn't the case?

After Yoo Joonghyuk's death, the 999th turn's companions would have
carried on to reach the Final Scenario, and cleared it.

What was the end of the world they had reached after all of that?

【Such a world-line must never be created. That is the way of Evil.】

Along with her declaration, her Status began to tighten around me.

– …In that case, it can't be helped. We can only fight, then.

【Fight? A creature without an Incarnation Body will…?】

– I'm not the one who'll fight you.

I looked up at the sky and smirked back at her.

– My companions will.

Powerful sparks exploded in front of my eyes. My head got squeezed
tightly as if it'd shatter into pieces, and my vision fell apart. Something was
getting closer.

⸢Prajna… Dokja… Don't-try… stay-put-sutra…⸥

…Here they come.

[Ba-aaht!]
Accompanied by Biyoo's cry, a new portal opened up in the mid-air.
Almost right away, the Black Flame Dragon's pitch-black Breath poured
out. Uriel quickly discarded me and retreated away from that powerful rush
of hot flames.

At the same time, someone snatched away my soul form and flew up.

"Every-freaking-where you go, seriously man… And why do you look like
this now?"

It was Han Sooyoung.

"I guess only the constrictive headband wasn't enough."

And then, Yoo Sangah.


She was carrying my Incarnation Body on her back, currently shackled by
the headband. She seemed to have correctly guessed what my current
condition was.

[Currently, the binding force of the 'Existence Pledge' is in a weakened
state.]

I didn't hesitate and jumped back into my body. My vision crumbled again
for a bit, and the sensations from my limbs returned. Although my
Incarnation Body was not okay, it was still better than not having one.

I saw Uriel activating [Hellfire] through my blurry vision.

Han Sooyoung next to me had her eyes open up wide. "H-hey, what the
heck is this…?!"

"No time to explain. We've got to get out of here, pronto."
Both Han Sooyoung and 'Sakyamuni's Successor', Yoo Sangah, were
powerful beings. Unfortunately, our enemy this time was simply too
strong. With only these two… Kwa-aaaaaaah!!

As if waiting for that moment, [Hellfire]'s flames pounced on my
companions.

"Goddammit!!"

The waves of incredible heat that couldn't be avoided no matter where you
escaped to – its Status was so humongous that Han Sooyoung's [Black
Flame] alone wasn't enough to fight back. It was then, a powerful burst of
reddish flames exploded from the same portal Han Sooyoung had used. It
had the exact same colouring as our enemy's flames. Two powerful sources
of heat clashed and generated a violent storm of fire.

[What the ■ck? Which mother■cker is it?!]

A certain someone coughed her lungs out and appeared from thick, choking
flames. An Archangel waved away the smoke with one hand and revealed
herself.

Wearing a black dress and kitted out in a golden anklet, an Archangel I was
intimately familiar with was standing there, soot on her cheeks and all.
[Huh? Which son of a bi■ dares to hurt my Kim Dok…]

Uriel shifted her gaze beyond the [Hellfire] and soon afterwards, her
expression became dazed. Then her jaw slackened as she muttered out. [I…
am the bi■?]

…I didn't expect her to be a part of the rescue team. The situation had
gotten more complicated this way. Of all things, the two Uriels had to run
into each other here.
【…And you are?】

It seemed that the Outer God Uriel was just as stunned by this.

【I see. You are this world-line's…】

The moment these two Uriels looked at each other, violent sparks exploded
in the air.

It was rather obvious that our side was still in an overwhelmingly
disadvantageous position. Our Uriel was strong, sure, but that Uriel
was someone who had witnessed the end of a world-line. If we don't
find an opening quickly and escape, then… Tsu-chuchuchut!!

An unexpected event happened next.

[<Star Stream> is intrigued by the encounter of these two beings.]

['Disconnected Film Theory' is activating!]

When two Stories met and intertwined with each other in the air, a gigantic
backflow of memories occurred.

⸢[Get up, Yoo Joonghyuk! Hurry!]⸥

Memories from the 999th regression turn were coming through.

Uriel's eyes opened wider at this sudden intrusion of foreign memories.
[Wwhat's this? What's going on?]

Waves of unfamiliar memories were flooding us. Uriel from the 999th turn
was fighting with her back pressed against Yoo Joonghyuk's. Now that was
a fine display of what being companion-in-arms looked like.
Our Uriel couldn't get a hold of herself from the rush of memories flooding
in and staggered unsteadily.

That damn theory, again it's… Before I could complete my train of thought,
though, I realized that the situation wasn't as bad as I expected. Because the
exchange of Stories via that theory went both ways. The evidence of that
was the 999th turn's Uriel, who not only staggered about, but she actually
even plopped down on the ground.

⸢[Kim Dokja! Over here! Sit next to me!]⸥

Definitely.

⸢9158FOREVER⸥

⸢[One's ID shouldn't be too eye-catching, so… Right. Let me go with
uri9158… Alright, it's not so obvious now.]⸥

⸢[…'Squid Kim Dokja's Leg' will be given away as a s-special bonus??]⸥

And there were a few Stories that might shock their viewers mixed in
among them, too.

【T-this, this, what is…??】

999th turn's Uriel was frowning deeply as if she was in pain. Han Sooyoung
didn't miss that opening and, while supporting our Uriel, shouted out. "I
don't know what's going on here, but this is good. Let's bounce outta here. I
mean, she looks seriously strong even at a glance, right?"

Her judgement was definitely correct. However, she forgot one small detail.

"Hang on. Let's take him with us, too."

I pointed at the 'Secretive Plotter' sagging on the ground.
Perhaps the memories of this world-line proved to be too shocking for her,
the sealing sphere Uriel had been constructing had become quite badly
tattered.

Han Sooyoung spoke in pure disbelief. "Are you stupid? Why should we
take him with us?!"

"We need to bring him with us. Only then will we reach the correct
'Conclusion'."

"What bullshit are you…"

Indeed, it was a bullshit-like utterance. I was being obstinate, and my
actions didn't make much sense. Even then, I continued to speak my piece.
"That guy must not die here. He too has the right to see the Conclusion."

⸢All the worlds were simply blaming 'Yoo Joonghyuk'.⸥

Uriel from the 999th turn, everyone from that world-line, too – as the
consequence of spending his entire life to reach his own 'Conclusion', he
had to become the enemy of every world-line.

⸢Out of the 1863 regression turns, was there any turn where he got to be
happy, at least once?⸥
When I regained my wits, I was already sprinting forward.

999th turn Uriel was slowly regaining her own wits too, and I saw her
trying to reignite the [Hellfire].

Han Sooyoung shouted out. "You crazy fool!! We don't have the time!!"

I gave it my all to activate the [Way of the Wind]. Flames from [Hellfire]
began flooding in once more. These dancing flames in the air somehow
looked like ancient letters to me.
– …Author-nim. Wouldn't it be okay, just one time?

I couldn't quite remember how old this memory was.

– I mean, there are so many regression turns, so, just once wouldn't…

…Did I really say something like that? My memories weren't clear enough.
However, just like back then, when all I could do was to type on the
keyboard and press the space bar, I could only run forward like crazy right
in this moment.

– Isn't it okay for him to be happy?

Maybe, that was me whining to a god responsible for creating this world.

– It seems that you weren't happy with what I have written.

Then, the 'god' replied.

– In that case, what kind of a conclusion would you like to see, Dokja-
nim?Which conclusion would be a happy ending for the protagonist?

What did I say back then? I tried, but couldn't remember at all. And even
now, I couldn't be sure of what the right answer was. I didn't have the right
to speak about someone else's happiness, after all.

However, even if it was someone like me who had no right, there was this
one thing I still understood.

⸢This is not a happy ending.⸥

The Secretive Plotter's body was getting sucked into the encroaching heat
from the [Hellfire]. With no time to spare, I managed to grab hold of his
wrist, and then, began running in the opposite direction.
Han Sooyoung's complexion grew pale and she hurriedly summoned the
[Xgrade Ferrarghini]. Meanwhile, Yoo Sangah shouted out. "Dokja-ssi!
Faster!"

【You can't!】

I evaded the rushing flames and placed the Secretive Plotter on my back.
The bottom of my feet was growing insanely hot now. I ran with all my
might to escape from that crazy heat.

"Argh, screw this shit… I don't care anymore! Hurry up and get in!"

Han Sooyoung reached out to me, and I barely managed to jump inside the
vehicle. I saw Uriel in the backseat, shivering away. Almost at the same
time, a tsunami wave of reddish flames pounced on us.

【Stop!!】

I inwardly prayed towards the 'Mass Production Maker'. I prayed that this
vehicle's performance wasn't 'mass-production' in the slightest.

[Constellation, 'Mass Production Maker', is grinning brightly.]

With an explosive turn of speed, the [X-grade Ferrarghini] accelerated
forward. At the same time, Biyoo opened a portal, and we jumped into this
dimensional passageway right away.

The horrifying howl made by 999th turn's Uriel chased us from behind. I
was scared that she was actually chasing us down. Even if we managed to
escape back to Earth unscathed like this, if that Uriel managed to follow
us and went on a rampage… Tsu-chuchuchuchut!

The 999th turn's Uriel stopped giving chase as the sparks crazily whipped
about. While shooting me a terrifying glare, no less.

[<Star Stream> is carefully observing the 'Living Flame'.]
It seemed that she couldn't use this portal. A powerful storm of Probability's
aftermath was holding her back. But that made sense. A being possessing
such a might actually enjoyed less freedom in the <Star Stream>, after all.

However, there was this one thing that kept nagging me. If she was that
restrained, how could she appear in the 'N'Gai's Forest' with such good
timing?

It was as if someone had instigated this whole thing.

…Instigating it?

[Great Dokkaebi, 'Heoju', is keeping a close eye on your whereabouts.]

At that moment, a faint little theory entered my head. What if that Uriel's
appearance was not a coincidence?

[Great Dokkaebi, 'Heoche', is keeping a close eye on your whereabouts.]

[Great Dokkaebi, 'Baram', is keeping a close eye on your whereabouts.]

What if someone within the <Star Stream> wanted it to happen, and they
summoned her to this world-line?

There was almost no organisation in this world capable of moving that
much Probability.

[<Bureau>, is keeping a close eye on your whereabouts.]

The N'Gai's Forest could be seen through the vehicle's windows. 'Outer
Gods' that came from the doomed world-lines were now being
extinguished.

Citizens of a small kingdom were saying their goodbyes to their king.
[SurviveSurviveSurviveSurviveSurvive]
There was more than one Outer God king.

Just like how the 999th turn's Uriel had shown up here, other Kings would
undoubtedly appear, too. Surely, the ones trying to interfere with the
Conclusion I wanted to see would call them to this world.

[<Star Stream> is looking at you.]

I raised my head to find the world that I need to fight looking at me.

This would be a very tough and arduous fight.

Han Sooyoung looked at me through the rearview mirror and grumbled
about something. Yoo Sangah sitting in the front passenger's seat was
looking at me. I quietly nodded my head and gazed at the unconscious
'Secretive Plotter' and the still-dazed Uriel.

Quite likely, no one in this universe would stand on our side.

I saw the portal's exit in the distance.

[Your choice has left a profound impact on the ■■.]

[Your ■■ is leaning towards ⸢eternity⸥.]

And so, the time to prepare for the final pages of the world had arrived.
              Chapter 454: Ep. 86 - The square circle, I


While driving down the dimensional passageway, neither Han Sooyoung
nor Yoo Sangah said much. Thanks to that, though, I was able to organise
my thoughts while gazing outside the window – on what I need to do in the
future, and the things I'd like to do.

Next to me, Uriel finally stopped muttering something with a serious face
only to fall into a snore-filled slumber. Meanwhile, the 'Secretive Plotter'
was half-leaning against her, also unconscious.

It kind of felt weird seeing two of the oldest viewers in my channel sleeping
so defenselessly like that.

Han Sooyoung, checking me out through the rearview mirror, suddenly
spoke up. "What are you grinning like that for? You should be getting ready
to give us a proper explanation once we get back."
Explanation, was it? It was pretty clear what I needed to explain to them, of
course.

"You only have one chance."

I found Yoo Sangah's bright smile rather terrifying.

"We've arrived."

Not too long after that, the Ferrarghini came to a stop.

We were back in Seoul.




A short while later, I was sitting in front of my companions.

The faces that I missed so much, the ones I wanted to see had gathered in
one place. The <Kim Dokja's Company> that experienced the scenarios
together with me, including Lee Gilyoung, Shin Yoosung, Jung Heewon,
and Lee Jihye. And, Lee Seolhwa and Gong Pildu who guarded Seoul while
I wasn't here. Finally, I could see my mother and the wanderers in the living
room a bit further away.

I studied the faces of all my companions and lowered my head 90 degrees
before opening my mouth. "I'm sorry."

"About what?"

"All the things I've done… I'm really sorry."

"H-mm… Well, sure."

…What's this? Weren't they furious at me?
I wasn't sure what's going on here, but well, I thought this was for the best.
I had so many things to explain, after all.

"I'd like to explain a few things, starting from…"

"First of all, tell us whose child that is."

Gong Pildu threw out that question first. I chased after his gaze and saw the
'Secretive Plotter' floating inside a clear sphere near me.

[Currently, this individual's Story is unstable.]

Seeing that he still failed to regain his consciousness yet, it seemed that a
serious problem had occurred after he used up far too much Probability.
Meaning, it was impossible for him to clarify the situation by himself.

Meanwhile, rage began filling up Gong Pildu's eyes when I didn't answer
back. "You said that you'd get rid of the scenarios so I protected Seoul for
you, yet you dare to show yourself here with your child instead?!"

The grief of a man who spent his entire life as a 'Gireogi' dad could be felt
in that voice.

"I see that you're under some sort of a misunderstanding, but…"

"Whose is it?" Gong Pildu glanced at Yoo Sangah with somewhat fearful
eyes. "…Could it be?" He met her smiling eyes and shook his head. "…
Right, there's no way. That means, it's with her, then?"

"You want to die?!"

Han Sooyoung growled angrily, prompting him to flinch grandly.

I didn't miss that opening and quickly jumped in. "Excuse me, isn't it a bit
too much thinking that he's someone's kid? Besides, just where does he
look like a newborn to you??"
"Han Myungoh's kid grew up in the blink of an eye, didn't she?"

Those words caused Han Myungoh's complexion to pale. "That kind of
makes me uncomfortable."

"What bugs me more than that is the kid's face. It's exactly the same as that
jerk-off's."

Gong Pildu shifted his gaze over to the corner of the living room while
saying that.

That's where the cross-legged Yoo Joonghyuk and his glaring eyes were at,
his entire body tightly wrapped in bandages. His trademark scary glare was
locked on me.

– Kim Dokja, what is the meaning of this?

I could only sigh grandly. "It's only natural that he looks exactly the same
as that 'jerk-off'. Because this kid is that jerk-off."

Silence descended on the living room in an instant. Gong Pildu was looking
at me, his eyes asking what kind of rubbish I was spewing out this time.

It seemed that my tale was going to get a bit lengthier than initially planned.

"There are several Yoo Joonghyuks in this world… I guess I should start
my explanation from there."




I started my in-depth explanation from the end of the 'Great War of Saints
and Demons'.
From when I summoned the Outer God that destroyed the Demon Realm,
the 'Nameless Mist', to stop the Apocalypse Dragon. (Gong Pildu: "Are you
bloody insane?")

And then, encountering the 'Secretive Plotter' and him kidnapping me. (Lee
Seolhwa: "Oh my goodness.")

Then, finding out that the Plotter was none other than Yoo Joonghyuk who
had lived through 1863 regression turns. (Jang Hayoung: "…What the heck
are you talking about?")

Forming a contract with him that also contained the 'Other World Pledge'.
(Shin Yoosung: "…I knew something like that would happen, ahjussi.")

Entering the Giant Story ⸢Journey to the West⸥ without informing my
companions. (Lee Jihye: "Ahjussi, you're definitely not cut out to be an
actor, you know.")

The battle between two Yoo Joonghyuks, one from 1863rd turn and the
other, from 999th turn. (Jung Heewon: "Just how many Yoo Joonghyuks
are out there??")

Yoo Joonghyuk of this world-line, who thought that he was in the 3rd turn,
realizing that it's actually the 1864th. (Han Myungoh: "Could it be that you
yourself can't explain this and are just coming up with random stuff??")

Barely managing to clear the ⸢Journey to the West⸥ with my companions'
help, but then, getting kidnapped by the Secretive Plotter again. (Yoo
Sangah, wordlessly sighing.)

And finally, the event of encountering the 999th turn's Uriel in that place,
who had become an Outer God herself.
When I got that far, even I began wondering what the hell I was talking
about. I raised my head to discover that my companions were carrying
roughly the similar expressions.

The first one to react was Han Myungoh. "Hmm, hmm. So that's
what happened. I think I understand everything." …But, that's
plainly not possible?

Everyone was now looking at him. So, Han Myungoh added one more
thing. "It seems to me that you actually enjoy dying or getting kidnapped."

"…Excuse me, I guess it's not just me who don't get it, right? Just what
the heck are you talking about here? There are three of my Masters
running around out there? And what's up with this 1864th turn and
all…?" Perhaps it was natural that they didn't understand.

From the get-go, the fact that the 1863rd turn had split into two was causing
the complications.

Yoo Joonghyuk who lived through the original 1863rd turn went on to
become the 'Secretive Plotter'. Meanwhile, Yoo Joonghyuk that lived
through the altered 1863rd turn regressed once more and became the dude
that we all knew.

Since I read the 'Ways of Survival', I could understand it fine, but it was
natural that my companions would find this all rather mystifying.

Jung Heewon, massaging her head, asked me then. "Okay, so what are you
saying? Is our Joonghyuk-ssi the 3rd turn, or the 1864th?"

That prompted Yoo Joonghyuk sitting on the corner of the bed to reply
curtly. "I don't know."

"Eh?"
"I can't remember."

I activated the [Character List] and confirmed Yoo Joonghyuk's
information.


  <Character Summary>

  Character: Yoo Joonghyuk

  Exclusive Attributes: Regressor <3rd turn> (Myth)…


Surprisingly, his attribute had reverted back to '3rd turn'.

"My memories returned only during the time when I was borrowing Kim
Dokja's Story for a little while. It was similar to watching someone else's
history."

…I had no idea it was like that.

Yoo Joonghyuk continued on. "This is what I think. This is originally the
3rd turn, and I am definitely the 3rd turn Yoo Joonghyuk. Except that,
during a certain point during the world-line, the memories from when I was
living in the 1864th turn have covered up mine temporarily."

Lee Seolhwa, listening in, joined the conversation. "…But, that doesn't
make any sense. You're saying that the 3rd turn has influenced the 1863rd
turn, and in turn, the 1863rd has influenced the 3rd… That's logically
impossible."

"Logically, no." Eventually, Han Sooyoung stepped in, too. "It can only be
valid in the form of written words. What I'm saying is that, such a thing is
only possible because this world used to be a 'novel' originally."
She then shifted her gaze over to the 'Secretive Plotter' surrounded by the
transparent sphere. "It's the same thing as the 'square circle' or the 'triangle
with the total of their interior angles coming at 720 degrees'."

Lee Seolhwa tilted her head and asked her. "But, something like that can't
exist, right?"

"It's more correct to say that you can't even imagine it, actually. However,
as texts, as paragraphs, they certainly can exist. What's happening right now
is just like that. To us, it might be a time paradox, but as texts of a novel,
it's completely possible, you know. I mean, you can just say, there it is, so
deal with it. It's not the issue with understanding it, but rather, accepting it.
So, let's look at it in a simpler way. We're currently stuck inside a crap
novel. Since the original was crap, this is the end result."

I wanted to say something as a rebuttal, but since she spoke of truth, I
couldn't think of anything.

"If I was this novel's writer, I'd have stopped doing the world-line distortion
thing at once or twice. Readers seriously don't like this sort of complicated
stories, you know? Even the Constellations probably can't figure out what's
going on here."

[Constellation, 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon', says that his Incarnation is
truly a smart cookie.]

"A world with broken Probability will collapse by itself. I know of quite a
few stories that ended in that manner. Worlds that even their authors gave
up on."

Han Sooyoung was an author herself so she could say these words. She
might have abandoned such worlds in the past, and she might be regretting
it
'till this day.
When I thought about that, something felt off to me.

The world created by the author of the 'Ways of Survival', tls123, had
become a reality.

– In that case, what kind of a conclusion would you like to see, Dokja-nim?
Which conclusion would be a happy ending for the protagonist?

Could it be that the author couldn't finish his story and was leaving it up to
us?

Jung Heewon scratched her cheek and asked. "Okay, so what's your
conclusion, Han Sooyoung?"

"We gotta fight those bastards that shoved us into this stupid world.
Whether it's the author, the Outer Gods, or even the Dokkaebis."

"The same as it has always been, then."

"Doesn't matter what happened in the original, you can chuck that crap to
the dogs for all I care. We have to see our own Conclusion, anyway. We
simply can't remain stuck in the damn shithole scenarios forever." She was
right. Right about everything.

Whether it was the Outer God King or the <Bureau>, it didn't matter.

[Every star in Nebula <Kim Dokja's Company> is radiating light.]

No matter who our enemy was, we still had only one choice to make. We
fight, win, and reach our answers in our own way.

"Dokja-ssi?"

Before I realized it, my companions were looking at me. They seemed to be
waiting for me to say something.
Their expressions were asking me about what we need to do moving on,
and what we need to make preparations for. Of course, I had been thinking
about those, as well.

However, it wasn't that easy for me to say the first words.

Maybe it was because I felt nervous, knowing that the end was around the
corner. It was fear that, although we reached this far with so much hardship,
one wrong judgement from me and everything could go down the crapper,
just like that. It was also a burden of knowing that I now had to walk on the
path not seen in the 'original novel'.

My lips bobbed up and down several times, and eventually, I managed to
eke out a word. "So…"

"That'll be enough for today." Yoo Sangah stepped in to stop me. "Let us
rest for today, and carry on tomorrow. Everyone, we've returned from a
tough scenario only just now, anyway."




I stayed up that night and made plans.

I was almost lured by the temptation to read the 'final revised' version of the
'Ways of Survival' several times, but in the end, I didn't. I wasn't sure why
not, but then again I did have this hunch.

This gut feeling that, the moment I read the novel, I'd not be able to escape
from its shackles.

"…"

I fell into a slumber so deep that I couldn't even remember when I
succumbed to it. The last bits of the memories were a blur. I might have
dozed off while reading a book, and I thought I drank a cup of warm tea
that Lee Gilyoung had brought in. In any case, it was a rather sweet sleep.

And, I thought I had a happy dream, too.

The dream was about the chat I had with Yoo Sangah some time ago. Set in
a world where all the scenarios had come to an end, my companions were
busy talking about their daily lives. It was really peaceful. It was so
peaceful, in fact, that it didn't feel like real 'peace' to me. And when I saw
the bright smiles on Shin Yoosung and Lee Gilyoung's faces, somewhat
mysteriously I realized the truth.

⸢This is a dream, isn't it.⸥

I bit down hard on my lip, and as if an earthquake had erupted out, the view
of my dream rocked about. Still in the haziness of my consciousness, I
slowly opened my eyes and tried to sit up.

…What's this?

My body didn't want to move.

Also, the faint earthquake I felt inside the dream continued on, too.

I managed to force my eyes open, and the surroundings revealed itself
under the dim darkness. What greeted me was the sensation of plush leather
enveloping my back and the head.

"Hey, Kim Dokja's trying to wake up."

"Put him to sleep again."

I felt someone smacking me in the head, and my consciousness dimmed
again. And as I faded out, I heard a mischievous voice talking to me.

"This is the workers' revolt, you dumbass."
And when I opened my eyes again…

I was inside an unfamiliar mountainside.
             Chapter 455: Ep. 86 - The square circle, II


I began thinking about how this event came to be.

One, I was bound tightly.

Two, I was thrown inside an unfamiliar mountainside.

No matter how hard I analysed it, the end result always came back to
'kidnapping', but who would dare to infiltrate the <Kim Dokja's Company>
and kidnap me? Which could only mean…

"…is…"

"…Dokja…Untie…?"

"Ack?…"

Faint voices could be heard coming from somewhere.
I grunted and struggled to free myself, and then, staggered towards where
those voices were coming from. I brushed past the thickets and around 30
seconds later, ran into a fairly wide campsite manned by my companions.

"Ah, so he came on his own volition, then." Han Sooyoung snickered and
waved her hand towards me. "What are you looking at? Haven't you seen
an industrial strike action before?"

"Hang on a minute, this…"

"What a nice breeze. Dokja-ssi, why don't you come and lie down here?"

Jung Heewon was lying spread-eagled on the ground looking up at the sky
right next to Han Sooyoung. She moved her arms as if they were her wings,
causing the fragrant green blades of grass to fall and get back up again and
again.

Han Sooyoung then began muttering in a reverential voice. "Grass lies
down. Faster than wind, it lies down."

"Ohh."

"Jung Heewon too lies down. Faster than wind she lies down and before the
gust comes she stands up first."

"Not bad?"

While looking at this sudden breakout of a poetry reading competition, as
well as Jung Heewon providing timely support fire, I asked them in a dazed
voice.

"Just what is going on…?"

"This is the workers' revolution, dumbass."
"Okay, you've been harping on about a revolution and whatnot for a while
now, but…"

"Argh, I just want to take a damn break. Do I need to spell it out for

you??" I frowned after she berated me.


Taking a break?

"What are you talking about? Don't you know what era we're in right now?"

"What era are we in, then?"

I wasn't sure what to say when she retorted back like that. What did she
mean by 'what' era we were in?

[Currently, the Nebula <Kim Dokja's Company> possesses the qualification
to enter the Final Scenario.]

[Remaining time to enter the scenario is: 28 days, 12 hours, 15 minutes and
7 seconds.]

I calmly replied to ensure that I wouldn't get sucked into her pace. "We
don't have the time for this. The Final Scenario is literally just around the
corner."

"And that's why we need to take a breather now. If not, when can we be
able to, like this?" said Han Sooyoung, while sighing out grandly. "Look
around you. Don't spend your day buried in your smartphone, alright? You
still wanna work even after coming to a place like this?"

After hearing her, I began scanning the surrounding terrain for the first
time.
Indeed, we were in a fertile, green forest. I wasn't sure which mountain it
was – Jirisan, Seoraksan, or Hallasan… In any case, it was a really
beautiful mountain, alright. The sunlight wasn't too strong, while the wind
blowing felt cool to the skin. It was perfect weather for camping, in other
words.

I hesitated somewhat before speaking up. "Uhm, I'm not saying that we
shouldn't take a break, but… Uh, it's good to rest, but what I'm saying is
that we should finish what we need to do first. Right now, we're…"

"Holy cow. Dokja-ssi, you're really 'kkondae' minded, aren't you? Is every
company representative out there like you?" Said Jung Heewon, while
lightly tapping my shin. "Representative-nim? When you're taking a break,
you're supposed to just do it."

My head became complicated.

Han Sooyoung glared at me when I didn't say a thing and addressed me in a
sour tone of voice. "Sure, you're oh-so-right. Everyone shouldn't be resting
at the same time, so at least one person should be in a scenario. Why don't
you go ahead?"

"What?"

"I'm saying, why don't you do the scenario that you love so much?"

After hearing her, my gaze abruptly shifted up to the air to discover an
actual scenario window floating up there.

[Sub Scenario – 'Workers' Off-day' has been generated!]

I had never even heard of such a scenario before so I quickly accessed the
scenario window.
    <Sub Scenario – Workers' Off-day>
    Type: Sub

    Difficulty: ???

    Clear condition: You're the head representative of the Nebula <Kim
    Dokja's Company>. Due to your exploitation and harsh treatment,
    employees of <Kim Dokja's Company> are currently in a very
    fatigued state. They are greatly dissatisfied with you, the head of the
    Nebula, and are in the middle of a strike. As their boss, you must
    listen to their complaints and appease them. In consideration of your
    weak communication skill, the total goal for complaint resolution
    will be set at 5 people.

    Time Limit: 12 hours

    Reward: Trust from <Kim Dokja's Company>'s employees

    Failure: Death (?)




Death?! What the hell, what kind of a scenario is this…?

I looked up at the sky, and Biyoo went "Baat" up there.

Han Sooyoung grumbled directly aimed at me. "Seriously, man. This guy
needs to be told through a scenario just to understand it."




While feeling anxious, I looked around my surroundings.
My companions seemed to be enjoying themselves. Han Sooyoung was
busy reciting parody poems, while Jung Heewon had fallen asleep among
the grass. Lee Gilyoung and Shin Yoosung were butting heads and
growling at each other.

"Hey, Shin Yoosung. Let's make a bet. Let's see who can catch the bigger
dinner today."

"What are we betting on?"

"The loser grants the winner one wish, okay?"

"Call."

The kids quickly sprinted towards the forest and Yoo Sangah called out to
them. "Be careful."

There was a small valley with a flowing stream next to the campsite; Gong
Pildu sat on the fishing chair he brought along, and while looking at his lure
in the water, he yawned out relaxedly. Han Myungoh sitting next to him
was muttering about this and that.

"If only we were out by the ocean, I'd have caught a seabream this big…"

I heard the refreshing sounds of water flowing in the valley as well as
mountain birds chirping away. It felt as if the calming greenery of the
overgrown mountainside was slowly collapsing on myself.

It was as if I was still dreaming.

This sort of affectionate behaviour felt uncomfortable to me, like some kind
of ill-fitting clothes. Was it okay to be like this? Was it okay to experience
moments like this already?

I searched for Yoo Joonghyuk.
Indeed, we shouldn't be like this. If it was him, he should agree with me. He
must be standing around somewhere while glaring at the group. Along with
that scary light in his eyes, he'd start lecturing everyone, beginning with
"You fools…!"

I quickly located him.

I was about to raise my hand and call out to him, but then, stopped after
realizing something was off there, too.

Chi-eeeik.

He was actually cooking over there. Standing before a large grille, his
hands were moving around in a showy fashion to grill some meat.
Vegetables were sizzling and shuddering inside the frying pan. The
[Breaking the Sky Swordsmanship] capable of destroying the heavens was
now used to chop vegetables and meat.

I even forgot to call out to him and stared at that spectacle in a pure daze.

…Just what in freaking hell was going on here?

In the next second, his eyes shifted over in my direction. He then silently
conveyed his words with that trademark scary glare of his. I didn't need to
resort to the [Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint] to tell what those eyes were
saying – it was most definitely…

You can look all day long, but you aren't getting any of this food.⸥

…That's what those eyes probably meant to say.

His sides were occupied by both Yoo Mia and Lee Jihye, their eyes filled
with deep interest and anticipation.

"Now."
Yoo Mia opened her mouth, and Yoo Joonghyuk moved his chopsticks
with an emotionless face. He was like a mother bird, picking up a piece of
meat to place it in her mouth. She grinned brightly.

"It's really tasty."

Lee Jihye blankly standing around opened her mouth, too. He studied her
for a moment or two, before placing more meat inside Yoo Mia's mouth,
instead. That carried on for four, maybe five more times, and eventually,
Lee Jihye shut her mouth.

"Master, you're too heartless."

Unable to endure it any longer, she personally moved her chopsticks.
However, his frying pan shifted according to the eye-catching trajectory of
the [Red Phoenix Shunpo] to avoid her hands. She grew tearful first before
getting rather stubborn about it.

"Oh, so you wanna have a go, is that it??"

I seriously couldn't tell whether I was inside the world of the 'Ways of
Survival', or the ⸢Ice-cold Handsome Regressor Yoo Joonghyuk Shouldn't
be Doing This⸥ world.

He continued evading Lee Jihye's chopsticks and fed his little sister Yoo
Mia without twitching his eyebrows once, remaining utterly expressionless.
However, there was something I could glean from that.

And I came to a realization, He was genuinely serious about being here.

Even though we are in this sort of time frame, why did Yoo Joonghyuk let
this event happen?⸥

I wasn't the only head representative of <Kim Dokja's Company>. In more
ways that one, Yoo Joonghyuk was a far more obstinate person than I was,
and also, boasted far greater experience in running a group such as this one.
Yet, such a person had willingly participated in this camping trip.

⸢Y ou re ally ca n't t ell, Kim Dok ja?⸥

Accompanying [The Fourth Wall]'s voice, several paragraphs unfolded
themselves before my eyes.

⸢Author-nim, how about going to a beach during this regression turn?⸥ That
was a comment I posted a long time ago.

Even though I remembered so much about the 'Ways of Survival', I had
forgotten all about the comments I posted. Now that I thought about it,
there was one event that Yoo Joonghyuk never missed during his countless
repeated regressions.

⸢"Today, we take a break."⸥

That would be taking an off-day.

It happened during the original 'Ways of Survival', but hadn't happened so
far in this world.

Every time they were about to encounter another important hurdle, he'd
take his companions to a different planet's tourist attractions. Of course, he
had the pretext of finding necessary items for the upcoming scenarios, but
he didn't force his group to do the same things as him.

⸢"Master, come join us and have some fun!"⸥

"Hey, Lee Jihye. Kekeke. Take a gander at my abs, will ya. Even my Black

Flame Dragon praised m…"⸥

⸢"We're going to eat Joonghyuk-ssi's cooking today, right?"⸥

Even Yoo Joonghyuk was like that, yet what was I like?
⸢…We must get ready for the next scenario.⸥

We were always in a hurry as if we were being pursued. We never had any
leeway. And as we got to the latter half of the scenarios, such tendency
grew even stronger. Our goal was 'always' right in front of our eyes. I acted
as if the scenario themselves would break down if we didn't solve whatever
it was in time. But now that I began thinking deeply about it, the scenarios
would've been just fine even if we didn't hurry up and do something about
them.

"H-hey, Lee Gilyoung!! We agreed not to use any skills here, didn't we?!"

"When did I?! You gotta give it your best always!"

I heard the kids' voices as they were returning with hunted prey.

Soon after that, I heard Han Sooyoung's loud call that reverberated
throughout the valley. "Alright, then. The treasure hunt event will now
begin! The prize is a Star Relic from the Black Flame Dragon!"

"Whaa, really? From that Black Flame Dragon?"

"I've hidden it somewhere in the valley, so the first one to find it is the
winner! Ah, right. You're forbidden from using your skills. Got that?
Besides that, there are other prizes too, so…"

"That Star Relic is mine!"

Han Myungoh quickly discarded his fishing rod and jumped inside the
stream, but a little while later, Jung Heewon grabbed hold of his head and
threw him out of the water. In no time at all, Lee Jihye and the kids
returning from their hunting trip all jumped into the valley's water, too.

"Yo, hold up, Jihye noona!! That's [Ghost Fleet]! You think I won't notice it
just because they are tiny now??"
"Lee Gilyoung! Are you seriously taming water bugs? You cheater!?"

"Both of you, disqualified!"

How long had it been since all of my companions were smiling together
like this? Maybe, this could be our first time. They were able to smile even
though the scenarios hadn't ended yet. They were able to chat away in
happiness like that, and share their stories.

⸢And while looking at that spectacle, Kim Dokja suddenly felt lonely for
some reason.⸥

Could it be that I had failed to understand a single thing about the 'Ways of
Survival' – no, wait, regarding my companions, instead? Maybe, because I
was drunk in the fantasy of witnessing the Conclusion, I actually ended up
missing all the countless words that had to be read in order to reach the true
Conclusion?

[You have currently resolved 0 complaints.]

A scenario that previously felt like nothing important suddenly felt as
imposing and difficult as a 'Giant Story' now.

I plopped down below a parasol and dazedly looked on. Someone lightly
tapped me on the shoulder. "How goes it with your scenario?" Yoo Sangah
grinned refreshingly.

I replied with a powerless grin of my own, and she addressed me again.

"Well, Dokja-ssi, your communication skill has always been a little lacking,
so it can't be helped, I guess. You were also like that back when we were
working for the company."

"…I was?"

"You really didn't speak all that much to other people."
I became utterly speechless after she mercilessly carpet-bombed me with
facts. But then again, after giving it a bit of thought, it made total sense. I
grew up without a friend from a young age. I wasn't clued in on how to
socialise with other people, and back then, I only thought about how to
weasel myself out of the company meal get-together. I figured that, rather
than wasting time doing that, I might as well read the 'Ways of Survival'
one more time instead.

⸢Kim Dok ja y ou h ave a fri end no w⸥

And then, here was an inorganic 'substance' that tried to rile me up by
saying that it was my friend.

Yoo Sangah settled down beneath the parasol too, and observed our
companions with a relaxed gaze. Perhaps she was going for the camping
look herself, because rather than the usual Buddhist robe, she was now
wearing a casual one-piece with a wide-brimmed straw hat. She sure knew
how to match the atmosphere regardless of where she was. She was
someone too good to be kept in the <Kim Dokja's Company> run by a
pretty useless leader, at the very least.

"Sangah-ssi, do you by any chance regret getting in the subway that day?"

I wasn't sure why I asked her that. Even now, the events of the very first
scenario remained vivid in my mind.

⸢If only Yoo Sangah's bicycle didn't get stolen.⸥

If she got her start from somewhere else, then she might not have become
<Olympus>'s Incarnation. Maybe, she wouldn't have to die, either. She
wouldn't have to experience the pain of reincarnation, too…

"No, I don't."

I had never seen such a determined expression on her face before.
"So, Dokja-ssi. You mustn't regret anything, either."

"Pardon? Regarding what…?"

"I mean, everything."

I wasn't sure what to say to her. It felt as if I'd only sound like an ass just by
thanking her or expressing my gratitude. The 'Ways of Survival' never
taught me what I should say in moments like this.

As if she could read my mind, she grinned refreshingly and pointed to
someone over yonder.

"I think it'll be for the best that you speak to that person first."
            Chapter 456: Ep. 86 - The square circle, III


"My concerns?"

"Yes. Uhm, like… If you're unhappy about your work, or…"

The first person I went to speak to was Lee Seolhwa. She was wearing an
outdoor scientist garb, and with a small magnifying glass, studied every
nook and cranny of my face as if I was some sort of an unidentified herb.
She then replied to my question. "Mm, well, I don't particularly have one."

She might be saying that, but there was no way that she didn't have any
complaints.

"As the head representative of the company, I can only apologise to you.
I'm aware that you have worked hard to protect Seoul during our absence."

"H-mm."

"It must've been very difficult to…"

"Do you really think so? And not like, staying back in Seoul must've been
so much easier?"
Her voice sounded sharp, prompting my lips to close shut before I realized
it.

"I knew it. That's what you were really thinking of. You were just being
sarcastic, yes?"

"No, never. I wouldn't."

"I know that others had been entering dangerous scenarios. Even if that was
the case, remaining in Seoul wasn't all plain sailing, you know." Lee
Seolhwa lowered her gaze and began searching for something within the
bushes once more. "It should be around here somewhere…"

⸢Lee Seolhwa has never taken a day off.⸥

Her Story began speaking up for her, instead.

⸢After the group departed from the [Industrial Complex], she operated its
sickbay and looked after the patients. Every day, the injured suffering from
similar types of wounds would rush in. She watched them die, and while
looking at their passing, she thought about her companions.⸥

"I won't be much help in the latter half of the scenarios. I'm well aware of
my own potential, and my Constellation is also only a Historical-grade as
well. But, I still do my best every day."

For sure, the intensity of Status floating about her vicinity felt quite
different from before. It wasn't as if her combat abilities had improved, but
well, how should I put this? It was like her pool of knowledge in the skills
had gotten even more profound.

"Whoever it is in the <Kim Dokja's Company>, I can save that person as
long as he or she still breathes. I can ensure that no one will die."

It was true that Lee Seolhwa's current growth rate was unmatched in any of
the regression turns from the original novel. If my guess was correct, then
she should soon reach the pinnacle of 'Life and Death Miraculous Doctor'.
Without a doubt, she was a necessary person to achieve my dream ending.

"What kind of a person was I in the novel you read, Dokja-ssi?"

I got flustered for a moment there by the unexpected question. "You were
an important person."

"Okay, by how much?"

Lee Seolhwa was one of the heroines to appear in the 'Ways of Survival'.
However, I couldn't come out and say that she was Yoo Joonghyuk's lover
from the past. From the get-go, I thought that he wouldn't want that to be
known… And most importantly, I wasn't sure if that would be an
appropriate description offor the person called 'Lee Seolhwa'. Who was she,
really?

"Well, that…"

Just before I could carry on, Lee Seolhwa's expression brightened and she
shouted out. "Ack! Found it!"

Her hand was holding a small flower. That must be the herb she was
searching for. I immediately recognised what that was.

⸢White Ghostly Flame Flower. The final ingredient for the 'Life and Death'
pill.⸥
At a casual glance, it looked like an ordinary wildflower. Eating this herb
alone had no effect whatsoever. However, the miraculous elixir that was the
[Life and Death Pill] could never be concocted without this herb.

She began smiling like a little kid. This sense of life that couldn't be felt
from the pages of the 'Ways of Survival' was emanating vividly right before
my eyes.

⸢This is Lee Seolhwa.⸥
That's why I gave up on recalling the words from the novel altogether. And
then, I said some lame things instead. "You're the best doctor that I know
of."

Praise cooked up by a small kid might be better sounding than that.

Even so, Lee Seolhwa grinned back at me. "Thank you. Even if you didn't
mean it."

"I did mean it, though…"

"Please wait for me. I will turn those empty words into reality soon."

I watched her leave in search of another herb, and came to a realization.
What she was curious about earlier wasn't the 'Ways of Survival'. Unlike
me, she didn't need such a novel in the first place.

[You have currently resolved 0 complaints.]

I hadn't made any headway into the scenario, but I didn't feel so bad.

"It's not that easy, right?"

I looked behind and found Yoo Sangah once more.

"…Yes, it's not easy."

"But, that's only natural. If you could finish up all the conversations you
had been putting off as if it's some kind of an event, then that's something
out of a novel, not reality."

"I guess so."

"Even then, you must carry on."

I nodded my head. "Who do you think I should speak to next?"

"It'd been better if you did it yourself, but I'll help you again this one last
time."
She used her hand to shield her eyes and scanned our companions. It was
then, a message entered my ear.

[Currently, <Kim Dokja's Company>'s contracted workers are feeling
dissatisfied.]

…Contracted workers? Did our Nebula have people like that?

Yoo Sangah then pointed to a spot. "Why don't you head over there this
time?"

The moment I looked there, I realized who the 'contracted workers' were.




A short while later, I was addressing three people standing before me.

"I have something to discuss with you."

"What is it? I'm really busy so hurry up. I must go and find that 'Black
Flame Dragon's Star Relic', right now!!"

Han Myungoh raised his voice as if to urge me along. Gong Pildu and his
disinterested face, and the pouting Jang Hayoung were standing next to
him. I could easily tell that they weren't exactly happy about being
summoned here like this.

Even though they had experienced scenarios together with us, they hadn't
joined the <Kim Dokja's Company> properly yet.

"Everyone, there's something you should know first."

I decided to tell them something that they didn't know, a piece of
information that <Kim Dokja's Company>'s companions already knew –
the 'Ways of Survival'.
It was a big decision on my part to tell them about it, but rather contrary to
my initial expectation, Gong Pildu's reaction was lukewarm at best.

"There was a time when I used to believe everything in the land price
pamphlets. I guess you're still too naïve."

"Pardon?"

"Young people these days…"

It seemed that Gong Pildu didn't really get what I was saying.

On the other hand, Han Myungoh seemed to be under a great mental shock.
"S-so you knew everything, yet you just left me to end up in that wretched
state??"

Jang Hayoung also seemed to be surprised, albeit for different reasons. "So,
that's how it was. That's why you knew so much back in the Demon
Realm…"

Thankfully, their reactions weren't as bad as I thought. But then again, they
had already met a regressor and plenty of reincarnators, so maybe, my story
didn't sound so crazy to them by now.

I breathed a sigh of relief inwardly and continued on. "There's only one
reason why I told you this information. I'd like to formally hire you into the
<Kim Dokja's Company>."

My words caused the three to exchange glances with each other.

The first one to speak was Gong Pildu. "On whose authority?"

[Incarnation 'Gong Pildu', has joined <Kim Dokja's Company>.]

…Could it be that the term "being coy" was invented for this ahjussi?

Next up was Han Myungoh. "Are you going to retain my previous position
as a department head?"
"Well, we don't have any ranks like that, but if you want, I can create one
for you."

"Please make sure that you pay your wages on time. As for paternity leave
and overtime…"

[Incarnation 'Han Myungoh', has joined <Kim Dokja's Company>.]

Finally, I shifted my gaze over to Jang Hayoung.

[Incarnation 'Jang Hayoung', has joined <Kim Dokja's Company>.]

"…Okay, so, Flame Dragon-ah, something happened just now, and it's…"

She was using her 'Wall' to send out messages of her employment to pretty
much everywhere.

Congratulatory messages from her friends in the <Star Stream> continued
to flood in. While looking at her being genuinely happy, I grew a lot more
complicated in my head.

If I knew she'd be this happy, then I should've let her join us earlier.

"By the way Kim Dokja, why are you suddenly letting me join you?"

She waited for my answer with sparkling eyes.

I had several reasons why I didn't let Jang Hayoung join the <Kim Dokja's
Company>. But at least for today, I didn't want to think about them. I
definitely needed her. However, I didn't bring her into the Nebula simply
because her presence was a must during the Conclusion.

"I wanted to witness the end of the scenario with you."

Jang Hayoung's eyes grew wider after she heard me.

I felt uncomfortable while watching her pale cheeks tremble like that. As
expected of someone possessing looks that easily slapped Yoo Joonghyuk's
cheeks at least two times in a row.
She blinked her large, clear eyes and energetically nodded her head. "I'll
really work hard!"

She clenched her fists tightly and began typing away once more.

[Congratulations! You have resolved the complaint of the contracted
worker!]

[You have currently resolved 1 complaint.]

I finally succeeded with one.

So, being the head representative was this tough, huh.

[Constellation, 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon', is asking you if the rumour
is true.]

What rumour??

[Constellation, 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon', is asking you if you really
confessed to Jang Hayoung.]

[Constellation, 'Most Ancient Liberator', is asking the maknae Sun
Wukong…]

…Just what kind of a rumour was spreading around here?

I had no idea what she was so busily typing away there, but regardless, I
could see Jang Hayoung diligently tapping on the imaginary keyboard in
the air.

"Hey, you. Come and eat supper!"

Han Sooyoung's loud shout came from afar.

The delicious aroma wafting in from somewhere attracted the companions
and we gathered around one by one. Then, Han Sooyoung stared at Yoo
Joonghyuk as if it was the most obvious thing in the world.
"Well, then. Shall we taste your high-and-mighty cooking skill in action,
then?"

"…And why should I share my cooking with you?" He glared at the rest of
the group with a menacing glare, before turning around to leave while
throwing these following words behind. "…There are leftovers that side, so
why don't you eat that."

We looked over in the direction he was pointing at. And straight away, we
became utterly speechless.

⸢They were now witnessing the essence of cooking.⸥

We all settled down quietly on the table like a bunch of mice that got
entranced by the pied piper, and then, began rubbing our eyes in disbelief.

These were dishes created out of the monster that Lee Gilyoung and Shin
Yoosung caught, as well as with the medicinal herbs Lee Seolhwa had
found. No, hang on… How could he even come up with a feast of this scale
with only those ingredients?

I was pretty certain that the dining table of 'Shi Huangdi who dreamed of
Immortality' wouldn't be as flashy as this one.

"Wow. Master, you gotta come and cook during my funeral, okay?"

"Why your funeral, though? That's really an ominous declaration, you
know."

The group began hurriedly chowing down the grub. Jung Heewon, Lee
Jihye, Han Myungoh, Gong Pildu, even Jang Hayoung… They were all
seriously focused on eating right now.

Even Han Sooyoung and Yoo Sangah, too.

"Hey, hold up. That's my share."
"There's enough to go around for everyone. Why are you being so greedy?"
Some even began fighting over the food, too.

"Ahjussi, please try this one!"

"Hyung, this one, too!"

Lee Gilyoung and Shin Yoosung sat on either side of me and shoved
spoonfuls of food into my mouth without a moment's rest. My cheeks
swelled up like a hamster as I chewed the rice, and of course, I didn't forget
to feed the kids side dishes in the meantime. It was tasty. Seriously tasty. So
tasty, in fact, I was almost thankful that the 'Ways of Survival' had become
reality for a moment there.

Shin Yoosung's eyes rolled around as she chewed the meat, then she
whispered in a small voice. "It's like we're on a school trip…"

When I heard her, I immediately wanted to kick myself to death for feeling
thankful that the 'Ways of Survival' had become reality.

The school field trip – one of the things children had lost in this world.

I placed my hands on the heads of the kids and spoke to them. "You're
right. It's like a field trip."

Although, the one learning from this trip wasn't the kids but me.

"Ahjussi, what would you like to do after the scenarios are over?"

"Hyung will live with me."

"I wasn't asking you!"

What I want to do after the scenarios were over… Normally, I'd have
smiled and glossed over the topic, but for some reason, I… I ended up
uttering out something without realizing it.

"I want to buy a really big house and live together with everyone."
When I raised my head, I noticed that the once-noisy surroundings had
fallen into an eerily silence. Lee Jihye, Jung Heewon, Gong Pildu… even
Han Sooyoung was looking at me, her mouth agape.

Jung Heewon was the first to fire the salvo. "…In that case, Dokja-ssi,
you'll be paying for the house, yes?"

…Huh?

"Ahjussi, you're really loaded, so you might be able to get a house in
Gangnam."

"I'll sell you my land."

"If it's possible, somewhere close to the kids' school…"

I had no idea that something I just threw out there would cause such a
ripple.

And so, the group chatted about the potential house I'd buy throughout the
supper. Stuff about how the interior should look like, or how many rooms it
needed to have…

Washing the dishes was left to me and Jung Heewon, the two losers from
the rock-paper-scissors. I could have won by using [Omniscient Reader's
Viewpoint], but of course I wouldn't do that during this trip.

[You have acquired a new Story!]

[You have acquired the Story, 'the One who Yanked Out the Conscience's
Fur'.]

…Also, it was nice to get a new Story, too.

As I was cleaning the dishes, I spotted something falling in the distant skies
above. It was a shooting star. Falling stars that left behind lengthy trails.

Most likely, those were planets that were falling for real.
The <Star Stream> was marching towards its own oblivion.

Jung Heewon looking up at the sky next to me spoke up. "It's like back then
in the [Cinema Dungeon]."

I nodded my head. For sure, it was kind of similar to that day. We were also
together like this on the rooftop of the dungeon. We were looking at the
falling stars and making our wishes.

"Dokja-ssi, you asked me to become your sword back then."

Indeed, I asked her to become my companion in that place. And after that,
she had become the greatest ally anyone could ask for. Without her, I
wouldn't have been able to arrive at this moment in time.

"…But, someone else became the literal sword instead of me."

Those words made me shift my gaze over to the [Steelsword] laying quietly
on the ground. Even as everyone was taking their much-deserved break, the
sole person to miss out on the festivities was right there. Lee Hyunsung
with his heart not beating – he seemed to regain his consciousness
sporadically, but he remained as a sword and didn't want to move.

"Please do not worry. Before we head off to the next scenario, I'll definitely
wake up Hyunsung-ssi."

"You know of a way?"

I nodded my head.

Lee Hyunsung's issue wasn't the only one we need to deal with, though.

We now required much greater power. Because our goal didn't simply stop
at clearing the scenarios, that's why.

To fight the <Bureau> as well as the entirety of the <Star Stream>, I needed
to start gathering Constellations that would stand with us.
[Constellation, 'Master of Steel', is looking at you.]

And Lee Hyunsung's Constellation backer would be the first to join us.

Jung Heewon spoke up as if my confident expression left an impression on
her. "By the way, Dokja-ssi?"

"Yes?"

"Will it be fine for you to stand around here trying to look cool? I mean,
aren't you in the middle of a scenario? You really aren't a being-
kidnappedand-dying enthusiast, are you?"

"Uhm…"

Along with her words, the scenario window popped up before my eyes.

[The day is coming to a close.]

[You have currently resolved 1 complaint.]

I reconfirmed the failure penalty of the sub scenario once more.


  Failure: Death (?)


I looked up at the shooting star in the sky.

"…Maybe, this might very well be my Final Scenario."
              Chapter 457: Ep. 86 - The square circle, IV


The time limit for the scenario was until midnight today. It was already nine
PM, so there were less than three hours remaining.

…How did the time fly by so quickly, anyway?

I heard that happy moments would pass you by really quickly. It must've
been true.

⸢Four complaints still need to be answered. And only three hours remain.⸥

No matter what, I was cutting it real close. From the beginning, solving five
of such difficult missions was clearly forcing it.

In the end, I decided to resort to 'that'.

"Biyoo-yah."

Dokkaebis had jurisdiction over sub scenarios, so she should be able to
control one just fine.
Also, since the failure penalty was not 'death' but 'death(?)', I was thinking
that they wouldn't kill me for real, and… Biyoo wasn't answering.

"Where are you, our cute little Biyoo?"

[Constellation, 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon', is cackling at your ill
fortune.]

[Constellation, 'Queen of the Darkest Spring', is urging you to seriously
carry this scenario out…]

Seeing that the channel was open, Biyoo must be nearby for sure, but…?

I decided to pull out the hidden trump card.

"Baat."

That caused the empty air to quiver a little, then a ball of cotton with a
small horn attached on top rose out from there.

[Abaat.]

Biyoo popped out with a "Poof!" and began giggling away.

I didn't smile back, though. "Biyoo-yah. I'm sorry about this, but can you,
like, cancel this scenario…?"

[Eh-oh-bah-aht.]

I couldn't tell whether she was trying to say 'eva' or 'over'.

[Constellations agreeing with the applicable scenario's Probability are
rejecting the scenario cancellation.]

…Hang on, could this be a bounty scenario, instead?

[Constellation, 'Demon-like Judge of Fire', is arguing that this scenario is a
necessity for you.]
[Constellation, 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon', is criticising you, telling you
not to use a cowardly method.]

[Constellation, 'Bald General of Justice', is saying that if you're a true
companion to them, then you should use your valour and tenacious spirit

[Constellation, 'Goryeo's First Sword', is simply denying the cancellation.]

…They are in sync with each other only in times like this, aren't they?

"…Yes, yes. I get it now."

[Constellation, 'Most Ancient Liberator', is cheering on his maknae.]

I couldn't really get used to the new Modifier for the Great Sage Heaven's
Equal. We parted ways right away after the 'Journey to the West' scenario
came to an end, but I knew we'd get to see each other soon enough.

In any case… Who should it be? Who should I speak to next? It should be
someone holding the highest amount of complaints towards me, right?

I studied my companions one by one, leisurely sitting around together after
that fulfilling supper. That was when the [Midday Tryst] came flying in my
way.

– What are you looking at?

Okay, let's skip Han Sooyoung for now. Her problems weren't on the level
that I could fix anyway.

– You making fun of me?

I continued to search for the next candidate. The next two I spotted were
Yoosung-ie and Gilyoung-ie. While looking at the two lying side by side
and patting their slightly bulging tummies, it almost felt as if the [Fruit of
Good and Evil] was whispering to me from deep inside my mind.
⸢If it's their troubles, can't I easily solve them?⸥

Even if I set aside the cowardly reason for now, I still needed to have a
serious talk with Gilyoung-ie.

[Constellation Lee Gilyoung's Sponsor is staring at you.]

Although he looked the same on the outside as before, Lee Gilyoung's
Status had a faint trace of demonic aura permeating it. Would it be okay to
talk to him now? However, wasn't it too open here?

[Constellation, 'Master of Sky Walk', is observing your actions.]

[Constellation, 'Lily Blooming in Aquarius', is focusing her attention on
you.]

Not only that, Constellations were watching us, too. I couldn't really
imagine how the channel's Constellations would react if I went and
carelessly got in touch with 'that side' now.

Even then, I should at least talk to him…

[Currently, 'Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint' 2nd Stage is in activation.]

…The inside of my head rang with a "Bzz!" and the skill was activated
forcibly once more. This was happening rather often lately. I wasn't sure
whether it was because I read the 'Ways of Survival' too much, or due to
some other reason, but…

⸢Ba-dump, ba-dump, ba-dump, ba-dump⸥

Their voices soon entered my head.

⸢Dokja hyung will come and talk to me, right?⸥

⸢Is he coming over now?⸥
…Huh?

⸢I better tell him about a biiiig problem.⸥

⸢I must tell him something really shocking.⸥

⸢…What if Shin Yoosung talks about something bigger than mine?⸥

⸢I definitely must say something more shocking than Lee Gilyoung.⸥

My steps came to a halt.

…It was not because I was scared of the kids, though. Anyways. I shifted
my gaze to the person crouching next to them, instead.

⸢…I miss them.⸥

Lee Jihye with a sad expression was looking at the distant sky. She was an
energetic chatterbox usually, so it was rare to see her make such face.

I could guess who she was referring to when she said she missed them.

The first scenario would've been a nightmare to everyone, but it must've
been especially worse for her. Even if the <Kim Dokja's Company> was
here for her, one person couldn't really substitute for someone else.

I wordlessly approached her and lightly poked her on the shoulder. Lee
Jihye looked behind at me. "Uht? what's this, ahjussi? You finished with the
dishes?"

"Yeah."

"H-mm… Wait, did you come here because of the scenario?"

"It's not entirely about that. But…"
"I don't have any particular complaints, so you don't need to talk to me,
though? Why don't you speak to others first?"

Even now, she was worried about others. No matter how badly she was
hurting, she was still thinking of other people's pain first. Lee Jihye from
Chungmuro grew up like that. And she grew up into an adult like that, too.
"You can talk to me any time. If you don't want to talk to me, then it'll be
fine with someone else, too. But you don't have to huddle in a corner and let
it fester inside you."

Maybe she didn't expect me to say something like that, because Lee Jihye
began blinking her eyes next.

"Ahjussi, don't try to act cool, okay?"

She smirked and punched me in the shin with her sturdy fist. I thought my
bone was broken or something.

[You have currently resolved 1 complaint.]

A simple chat on this level couldn't resolve Lee Jihye's troubles. Even then,
I still had to speak to her.

She lightly shook her beer glass around and while standing up, spoke to me.
"…Alright, then. Since I'm full, I should go and stretch my limbs for a bit."

"You shouldn't exercise after drinking, you know."

"I feel fine, though?"

Seeing her swing her sword about like that, she definitely was her master's
student, alright.

…Hang on a bit. Now that I thought about it, there was one guy who should
be the most dissatisfied by me around here, wasn't there?

I quickly scanned the campsite, but strangely enough, I couldn't locate that
idiot no matter how hard I looked.
"Hey, you deaf?? When someone is calling you, you should…"

Along with a resounding 'Slap!' someone smacked me in the back of the
head.

I looked behind and spoke to the culprit. "Hey, Han Sooyoung…"

"What now?"

"Where is Yoo Joonghyuk?"

"Yoo Joonghyuk? He was over th… Uh?"

Only then did she realize it, too. Honestly speaking, that guy usually acted
on his own and often disappeared on us without warning, so this shouldn't
come across as all that surprising. The problem had to with the fact that he
didn't disappear alone this time.

Han Sooyoung looked into the wide-open rear door of the [X-grade
Ferrarghini] and spoke up. "…The 'Secretive Plotter' is gone, too."




The 'Secretive Plotter' surrounded in the transparent Sealing Sphere landed
on the ground with a thud and roughly rolled around in the dirt. He was still
unconscious. Yoo Joonghyuk quietly looked down on him, then slowly
unsheathed the [Black Heavenly Demon Sword] and addressed the Plotter.

"I know that you're already awake."

The Secretive Plotter slowly opened his eyes. Accompanied by faint sparks,
energy from a Story surged throughout his body. For a moment there, his
Stories were returning to him.

【You don't seem to know how to enjoy these brief moments of peace.】
"I don't have a habit of enjoying my peace with an enemy near me."

【Are you planning to kill me? That is indeed a wise move. However, you
should know by now that you can't really kill me.】

That was true. The 'Secretive Plotter' was another Yoo Joonghyuk. Killing
him simply meant the creation of another world-line.

Even then, Yoo Joonghyuk didn't let go of his [Black Heavenly Demon
Sword]. "It'll be far better than watching you mess up this world-line."

The Plotter laughed. They were both Yoo Joonghyuks. They may have
lived two different lives, but their nature as Yoo Joonghyuk was the same.
And that was why they could understand each other's thought process the
best.

【Do you believe that your power alone is enough to kill me? Without Kim
Dokja's Story, the current you can't fight against an 'Outer God'.】

"That might be the case, but killing you will be rather simple. I only have to
shatter that [Sealing Sphere]."

A faint trace of unrest flitted in and out of the Plotter's expression.

Currently, the 'Secretive Plotter' was inside the unstable [Apocalypse
Dragon's Sealing Sphere] created by the 999th turn's Uriel.

"You're deliberately not removing the [Sealing Sphere]. If you break it,
then the 'Hounds Chasing After the Abyss' will appear from the gap in
space and time, that's why."

It only had been for a brief moment, but still, Yoo Joonghyuk got to steal a
glance into the memories of the 1864 regression turns engraved into the
⸢Hell of Eternity⸥. That's where he got to learn partial information on 'Outer
Gods'. The Hounds that chased after the Abyss – he learned about the
Hounds of Tindalos during that time, too.
They were the cleaners capable of detecting the distortion in a world-line.

"They can only intrude from where angles below 90 degrees exist. The
normal you wouldn't be troubled by something like a few Hounds, but with
how weakened you are, the story should change greatly."

The flow of Status loaded onto the [Black Heavenly Demon Sword] grew
thicker. Yoo Joonghyuk too hadn't fully recovered from his wounds, so
fighting the Plotter head-on was impossible.

However, shattering the Sealing Sphere shouldn't pose a challenge.

The Plotter's expression changed, perhaps after figuring out Yoo
Joonghyuk's intentions. It was the face of a man who had accepted
'something'.

And so, just as Yoo Joonghyuk's [Black Heavenly Demon Sword] was
about to make a move…

"Oppa."

Someone's head poked out from the bushes.

"What are you doing?"

Yoo Joonghyuk was taken by surprise and while turning his head towards
her, shouted out. "Yoo Mia! Don't come closer!"

Dismay brushed past his expression next. Because he had focused all of his
perception on the 'Secretive Plotter', he ended up making such an egregious
mistake.

"Go back to where our companions are! This place is dangerous!"

"Don't want to."

She replied in a cold voice, something she had never used before.

Yoo Joonghyuk replied in stupefaction. "…What?"
"You don't even come back to Earth all that often anyway, so stop nagging
me. You promised to stay with me for a few days, didn't you? Both
Sookyung ahjumma and Gyeong-Ran ahjumma are always busy, you
know? And I'm tired of listening to Grandma Bok-Sun's stories of the past,
too!"

Yoo Mia clearly enunciated every single word as she strode forward. Yoo
Joonghyuk's judgement blurred for a moment then.

She seized that opening and quickly ran towards the front of the 'Secretive
Plotter'.

"By the way, he looks exactly like you, oppa. Who are you exactly?"

Before long, she was within the touching distance of the Plotter. Yoo
Joonghyuk grew anxious. He wanted to swing his sword right now and
shatter the [Sealing Sphere], but his little sister might get swept up in the air
current if he made the slightest mistake here.

As he began deliberating on his options, she placed her hand on the
transparent [Sealing Sphere] and innocently asked the figure inside. "Are
you trapped in this thing? You want me to help you get out of there?"

Yoo Joonghyuk dearly wanted to move and pull her away from there right
now. But for some reason, he couldn't.

The 'Secretive Plotter' was staring at Yoo Mia.

His eyes were trembling from a very powerful agitation. Even Yoo
Joonghyuk was surprised to see such an expression appear on the Plotter's
face, someone who had lived through an untold amount of time.

Yoo Mia pressed him further in the meantime.

"Come on now, answer me."
              Chapter 458: Ep. 86 - The square circle, V


Yoo Joonghyuk was prepared to swing his [Black Heavenly Demon Sword]
if the 'Secretive Plotter' tried to do something foolish, but rather
unexpectedly, the latter easily answered back. He didn't even use his true
voice, either.

"You're right. I am trapped in here."

His real, pure voice was heard for the first time.

That prompted Yoo Mia to reply with a bright smile. "Ask my oppa to free
you. He's super strong, you see?"

She spoke in an innocent voice, but he replied with a slow shake of his
head. "…I can't leave this thing."

"What? Why not?"

The 'Secretive Plotter' didn't reply.
"Wait, did my oppa do something to you? He threatened you with scary
words, didn't he??"

"…No, that's not it."

"It's not? What then?"

The Plotter didn't reply again. Without saying anything, he stared at Yoo
Mia. He stared for a long time at the one person that no longer existed for
him.

And for the first time ever, a faint smile formed on his lips.

"It's because I chose to be in here."

Yoo Joonghyuk saw that smile and couldn't say anything. Yoo Mia was
busy asking what he meant, and meanwhile, the Plotter quietly stared back
at her.

The latter slowly raised his hand, and his palm overlapped with hers
through the thin transparent layer. Their hand sizes were fairly similar.
These two palms may have overlapped after transcending time and space,
but they could never truly meet.

"Uh? Uhm…"

It was then, Yoo Mia blinked slowly and began faltering a little.

"Why am I so sleepy…?"

Her body slowly fell to the ground. Yoo Joonghyuk quickly dashed to her
side and embraced her.

"You bastard, what have you done…?!"

【…I only helped her dream of nice things.】

Yoo Joonghyuk studied his little sister. For sure, her Incarnation Body
showed no signs of any strange symptoms. No, she simply was in a deep
slumber, softly murmuring indecipherable sleep-talk like "beach volleyball"
and "squid party", etc.

He glared at the 'Secretive Plotter' with a complicated expression. No
matter how weakened he was, by using Yoo Mia he would have been able
to escape from this situation pretty easily. However, he didn't do that.

He simply stared longingly at the sleeping face of the girl, instead.

"…What happened to Mia in your world?"

【She survived.】

He answered immediately.

【And also died.】

That too was immediate.

"What does that even…"

Just as Yoo Joonghyuk opened his lips, he understood what those answers
meant. So, he shut his mouth right away.

Seemingly-crying sparks ever so faintly danced around. Under the pretext
of the [Disconnected Film Theory], the memories of these two beings
trembled and their Stories shifted.

⸢In one world-line, Yoo Mia survived for a long time. Even after he died.⸥

The world of a man who lived 1864 lifetimes – just what kind of a world
would that be?

⸢However, in another world-line, she died.⸥

A Regressor might have lived far more 'presents' than anyone out there, but
in reality, he was nothing more than a ghost of the past. He was an
existence that had to move onto the next turn because he failed to alter the
past.

0th turn, 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th… and 1863rd.

This being was not a 'Yoo Joonghyuk' from any of those regression turns.
But, he was the 'Yoo Joonghyuk' that belonged to all the worlds, the man
who carried all the worlds as his burden.

And that was why he was more Yoo Joonghyuk than any other Yoo
Joonghyuks.

【You're pitying me.】

"Who would do that to a…"

【Do you believe that my life was a misery?】

Yoo Joonghyuk couldn't tell if that was a form of sympathy directed at
himself. The blade of the [Black Heavenly Demon Sword] he held tightly
was faintly trembling.

Why was he hesitating now? He had come this far already, so what was left
to hesitate? Just because he heard a bit of this bastard's past history…

The 'Secretive Plotter' opened his lips. 【Did you know? There was this
young boy in the front-most subway car that always died during every
regression turn.】

That question came out of nowhere. Yoo Joonghyuk naturally recalled the
events of the subway train. The very first scenario, the very first encounter
with Hell that he had to experience every single time.

However, Yoo Joonghyuk didn't know anything about such a boy. Because
there were simply too many people who died in that manner back then.

【While regressing several times, I tried to prevent his death, but it was
impossible.】
"…"

【He was really a young boy. Younger even than Lee Gilyoung. However,
even such a child had to 'prove his credentials'. For all of the 1863 lives,
that child couldn't even put up a proper fight and had to die. He died, and
died, and died over and over again.】

Yoo Joonghyuk couldn't say a single word.

The Plotter asked him again. 【Between a man who regressed 1863 times,
and a child who has to repeatedly die for 1863 times with no recollections
of it, which one do you think is actually more miserable?】

"That is…"

The Plotter was implying this – that your pity had no meaning, no value
whatsoever.

Even then, Yoo Joonghyuk couldn't readily accept that. Indeed, there was
no meaning in comparing the importance of different miseries. However,
that also didn't mean that 'misery' didn't exist.

【The <Star Stream> tries to make the lives of everyone into 'Gi-
SeungJeon-Gyeol'. However, a life was never supposed to be that. No, it's
an unreasonable thing that can end at any time, whether it's 'Gi(beginning)',
'Seung(development)', or even during 'Jeon(climax)'. And that's why, even
if my life comes to an end here, it shouldn't come as a surprise.】

Did the boy from the subway make the same expression as this man? Yoo
Joonghyuk couldn't tell.

The 'Secretive Plotter' stared back at him with a pair of quiet, still eyes.

Yoo Joonghyuk stared back into those eyes for the longest time, before
averting his gaze away while lowering the [Black Heavenly Demon
Sword].
"…You'll end up seeing that boy's death for the 1864th time if you regress
again."

In the end, he returned his sword back to its scabbard. This could be the
wrong decision. Even then, Yoo Joonghyuk had made up his mind.

Maybe he too didn't expect such a choice, because the 'Secretive Plotter'
remained speechless for a long while.

【You've been greatly influenced by Kim Dokja, it seems.】

"Shut your mouth. I can kill someone like you at any…"

Multiple presences were drawing near. Voices were calling out to him.
They were Kim Dokja and Han Sooyoung, plus those of the <Kim Dokja's
Company>'s people.

【Although it irks me to admit this, let me say that one thing is for certain.
This world-line is different from any that I have lived through so far. It's
possible that you and your group can truly witness what's beyond that
'Wall'.】

"…"

【However, do not keep your hopes up, thinking that you'll see the
Conclusion you desire. And also – even if that Conclusion wasn't what you
initially wanted…】

The Plotter's true voice suddenly grew fainter. His eyelids were slowly
closing up. He was falling into another bout of deep slumber.

Just as Kim Dokja emerged out from the thicket, the Plotter finished what
he wanted to say.

【…Do not think of this world as a failed turn.】
"We played beach volleyball."

That was Yoo Mia's answer after I asked her about what happened here.

"I'm telling you, we grilled squids, and I played beach volleyball with my
oppa. Could it be that one's power of comprehension is lower if you're
ugly?"

I wanted to tell her that there were three things wrong in her statement.
One, we were not near an ocean. Two, I wasn't ugly, and my power of
comprehension was…

"…Well, I guess nothing serious has happened here."

Han Sooyoung muttered in relief.

Indeed, we couldn't see any traces of Yoo Joonghyuk causing an accident,
and the 'Secretive Plotter' was still stuck in a deep slumber.

I put the Plotter back inside the [X-grade Ferrarghini]. There were a few
things that didn't sit well with me, but now wasn't the time to grill the one
responsible.

"Okay, everyone, please gather around! Let's start the campfire!"

The flames rose up thickly and brightened the darkness of the campsite.
Time was approaching closer to midnight. Only then did I remember
something important.

"H-hang on! My scenario hasn't…!"

Dammit, I forgot all about it because of Yoo Joonghyuk.

I could hear Biyoo humming "Baat, baat" just above my head.

[Scenario time limit has elapsed!]

Would I really get killed like this?
[Sub Scenario – 'Workers' Off-day' has ended!]

[You need to resolve a total of 5 complaints.]

[You have currently resolved 1 complaint.]

[You have resolved all of your employees' complaints.]

[New Story related to the <Kim Dokja's Company> is being generated.]

…Uh?

"Seriously, man. It's like you forgot your wits somewhere or some such…"
muttered Han Sooyoung, as she stared at the side of my face.

Companions were giggling to themselves while looking at me.

It was then, I recalled their replies whenever I tried to talk to them.

– I don't have any particular complaints.

That was for real?

"No one here will blame you, you know."

Han Sooyoung's disinterested voice spread out. We sat around soaking in
the bonfire without saying anything else. I thought I could sense their hearts
contained in this silence and that caused my emotions to well up for some
reason.

Jung Heewon added something on top. "Well, if you want me to find
something to talk to you about, then I can think of one, but it's not a
complaint, so…"

Even though the warm bonfire was before me, why did a chill creep down
my back just then?

"In any case, we rested really well today. Someone didn't seem to have
gotten any rest, though."
Yoo Sangah spoke, and Lee Jihye followed her up on that.

"But, is it over like this? Aren't we going to, like, light candles and start
sobbing, or write stuff on a 'rolling paper'?"

"This ain't even a real school trip, so why should we? Besides, the paper…"

While listening to Han Sooyoung's retort, I began thinking.

'Rolling paper' written by her, was it… That might be quite interesting,
indeed.

Han Sooyoung suddenly stopped talking there and looked at me before
asking a question. "You want me to write one for you?"

"Not really. We aren't little kids anyway."

"Wait a minute. Didn't you say you never had any friends and didn't even
go to 'membership trainings' either? I guess you've never received one
before, then."

If the total reserve of my mental energy declined during this trip, then it
was all Han Sooyoung's fault.

A few members of <Kim Dokja's Company> blessed with strong drive had
already purchased pens and large papers from the [Dokkaebi Bundle].
Seriously, though, these greedy Dokkaebis even charged Coins for
something like that…?

Yoo Joonghyuk sitting across me on the other side of the campfire seemed
to be angry as well.

"I won't participate in something like this."

…Although, his reason for anger seemed to be different from mine.
Nevertheless, seeing my companions gathered around closely and
scribbling on their papers gave me this fresh perspective on things. It's like
this was a writing get-together for the poor, friend-less Kim Dokja.

While everyone was writing their names on the papers and passing it along,
Lee Gilyoung suddenly raised his hand up. "Hyung, I bought this off the
[Dokkaebi Bundle], so can I fire it?"

Shin Yoosung discovered the toy in the boy's hand and her expression
brightened up instantly. "Uh? Isn't that the same thing people were firing
around the Han River?"

"Yeah, I remembered that so I bought it."

"Let me try it, too!"

"No way. You buy your own. It's 2000 Coins, you know."

Lee Gilyoung was currently holding onto a 'Parachute Helicopter'. I had
seen that a couple of times before, too. It was a toy that, when you pulled
hard at the attached string and then let go, it'd fly up into the sky while
emitting bright light.

His toy seemed a bit special though, as it featured four large wings shaped
like a square.

…Besides all that, though, that thing cost 2000 Coins??

"Okay, I'm gonna fire it!"

Lee Gilyoung fired the 'parachute helicopter' into the air. The toy flew up
and while spinning around vigorously, dyed the surroundings with bright
light. The light scattered as if it was fireworks going off. Even though they
should've been familiar with far more spectacular sights than this, the group
still looked on genuinely impressed.

The square-shaped wings of the helicopter spun around quickly and formed
a circle.
I thought it looked like a portal. A portal, that led to the world we used to
live in. We might not be able to go back anymore, but still, I felt the
nostalgia of that world from it.

It was around then that a system message resounded out.

[Incarnation, 'Lee Gilyoung', has used the item 'Parachute Helicopter
(Extralarge optical screen)'!]

The spinning wings of the helicopter grew larger and larger, and eventually,
changed shape to that of a huge screen.

Lee Jihye frowned deeply. "What the heck. It was a hologram panel? We
now have to watch a scenario even in this place?"

"Lee Gilyoung, did you even read the user's manual before…"

"N-no, I thought it was just a helicopter, so I…"

Just as the boy tried to make his excuse, a small earthquake suddenly
rocked the vicinity. The expressions on the companions hardened instantly.

"What kind of crap is it this time…?"

Accompanying Han Sooyoung's words, we all focused our attention on the
screen in the air. And when we did, we understood the reason for the
earthquake. First of all, it didn't belong to the Korean peninsula.

The 'optical screen' was now displaying the American continent. And right
before our eyes, that large continent was disappearing in its entirety.

Because of a gigantic island rising up from the deepest part of the Earth.

Along with the entrance of that island, the American continent was being
erased from the map itself.

[The applicable world-line has reached its critical point!]

[Elevation of the forgotten islands has begun!]
Yoo Joonghyuk, his expression hardened, quietly muttered out.

"The end has begun."
             Chapter 459: Ep. 87 - The Heart of Steel, I


We headed back to Seoul right away.

The first thing we confirmed was the safety of the [Industrial Complex].

"We haven't detected any other strange phenomena after that event," said
Aileen, currently in charge of the central situation room.

The display panel in the room was showing the footage shot near the
Pacific
Ocean. A gigantic island was rising up from the part of the ocean close to
the American continent. I had no doubt that this was one of the 'calamities' I
knew of.

Back in the 'Ways of Survival', the master of that island was a very
powerful upper-rank Outer God. Our issue now would be whether it was
the same guy or not,

"My mother?"

"She's currently at the Eastern coastline."
"…Eastern coastline?"

[The rise of the forgotten island has begun!]

As the system message resounded out, we witnessed the waves rushing in at
the other side of the Pacific. An unprecedented scale of terrain alteration
had occurred, so it was obvious that an equally-incredible volume of
tsunami waves would crash into the various parts of the world pretty soon.
Naturally, the one to bear the worst of it was the United States.

– Kwa-gagagagk!

Horrible screams of Incarnation Bodies resounded out and the streets of
New York were being swept away. Tsunami waves weren't the end – using
the waves themselves, the lower-ranked Outer Gods, the 'Nameless Ones'
were rushing in, as well. These low-ranked creatures were flooding in
unchecked to tear and devour the American mainland.

There was no time to ask for help, either. Almost half of the continent had
disappeared in less than thirty minutes after the calamity began. One hour
later, the whole of the USA was covered in a jet-black aura.

The scale of this calamity was so great that the [Dark Castle] or the
[Disaster of Floods] couldn't even remotely compare in the scope.

"Could it be that my mother…"

Aileen nodded her head and added something else. "I'm not… entirely sure
if it qualifies as a good thing, but."

Next up, the display panel switched to the eastern coastline of the Korean
Peninsula. As expected, the tsunami wave had reached this far, as well.
Although the height of the wave was much lower compared to the one that
hit America, and there were no 'Nameless Ones' riding on it, a tsunami
wave still presented an enormous natural disaster all on its own.

– Oh, the Wind God of the Heavens!
As soon as my mother's yell came to an end, powerful gusts of wind
exploded out from the folding fan she was holding. Pungbaek who acted all
stiff and uptight back in the 'Great War of Saints and Demons', was pulling
his weight this time, it seemed.

Even Jo Yeong-Ran, who could be called my mother's right hand, was
taking an active part in the event, as well.

[Giant Story, 'Shindansu', has begun its storytelling!]

<Hongik> must've been paying attention to this event, because the
[Shindansu]'s Story had planted its roots deeply into the ocean and was
blocking the disaster by using the Korean Peninsula's Probability.

While looking as if she just lost ten years of her life, Han Sooyoung
muttered dazedly. "…Anyways, isn't that woman in the United States, too?"

There was only one person that Han Sooyoung would refer to as 'that
woman'.

"Couldn't she have used her [Precognition] to predict that?"

"I was about to speak to you in regards to that matt…"

Even before Aileen could finish, the side door to the situation room opened
up and a certain someone made her entrance. Confirming the visitor's
identity, Yoo Joonghyuk immediately reached towards the [Black Heavenly
Demon Sword].

"We didn't come to fight, so stay your sword, Supreme King."

Her [Eye of Great Demon] vibrated brightly.

They were the Prophet Anna Croft and the 'Zarathustras' she led.
"The alert has been issued five hours ago. Most have escaped to other parts
of the world, but still, many failed to leave on time."

"Why didn't you ask us for help?"

"We simply didn't have the leeway. And also, we couldn't fully trust the
information gleaned from the Precognition, too. It was the first time that
such large-scale information on the future had gone through such a sudden
change, so I…"

Anna Croft looked quite troubled just then.

A sudden change in the large-scale information on the future – that would
be a pretty good indication that even her Precognition didn't possess any
merit when it came to the 'Final Scenario'.

Han Sooyoung asked as if she wanted to nitpick. "What about <Asgard>?
They finished the 'Great War of Saints and Demons' successfully, so they
should've started supporting you once more."

Anna Croft bit her lip hard as her head dropped lower. She then muttered
softly. "…They told me to abandon the USA."

The Final Scenario was about to begin. Most likely, not even <Asgard>
would have the room to dwell on the fate of some continent from one of the
many planets out there.

Because Earth wouldn't be the only planet experiencing the signs of the
impending apocalypse.

The "Ku-gugugu!!" exploding noise came out of the display panel.

[GaGaGaGaGaGak]

[WeareWeareWeareWeareWeare]

The 'Outer Gods' that captured the American coastline began howling out.
I recalled the 95th scenario I experienced during the 1863rd turn. The
invasion of the Outer Gods began sooner in that world-line than ours. And
soon, we'd end up in a similar state. Because that's the story the stinking
<Bureau> wanted to see, after all.

"…Does South Korea have any countermeasures?"

"Still thinking about it."

"I heard that you secretly contacted a King of Outer Gods."

It seemed that she was talking about the 'Secretive Plotter' here.

"Technically speaking, we have 'captured' him, actually."

Anna Croft's eyes visibly quaked when she heard me. She didn't seem to be
aware of that.

"I-in that case… Can this calamity be stopped through him…?"

"He's exhausted a great deal of Probability so that's not going to work.
Besides, he's unrelated to this calamity."

"You know something, don't you?"

I didn't reply right away and simply held Anna Croft's gaze.

One needed to offer up their information first if they wanted to learn
something new from the others. That was the basics of information
exchange.

She must've figured out what I wanted from her, because she suddenly
sighed out softly and began telling her story. "I don't have a lot of info to
give you."

"You can start with those."

"…Firstly, the current locations for the 'Great Apocalypse Scenario' are a
portion of the Pacific and the American continent."
I already knew that.

[Applicable location is currently undergoing the 'Great Apocalypse'.]

I confirmed a transparent dome being generated over the American
continent as well as the whole of the Pacific Ocean. The 'Nameless Ones'
weren't allowed to leave outside the dome, it seemed. That was probably
the extent of the Probability the Outer Gods had been permitted at the
moment.

"Secondly, the 'Nameless Ones' can't be hunted down with regular
weapons. Obviously, the weapons of the past don't work, and even the Star
Relics from lower-graded scenarios are useless, as well."

Actually, the display panel did catch the sight of several Incarnations
desperately struggling against the 'Nameless Ones'. One of them was the
owner of a pretty well-known Star Relic, but his axe failed to cut the flesh
of the 'Nameless Ones' properly.

– But, how…?!

The flesh of the Incarnation Body ripped apart by the sharp fangs splattered
onto the screen, causing Lee Jihye to frown and turn her head away. I didn't
look away but continued to observe the scene closely.

[Exclusive skill, 'Comprehension', is activating!]

On the surface of the 'Nameless Ones' carapaces, I spotted faint letters
floating around.

Yoo Joonghyuk spoke up first. "It's a Stigma."

"It's not just any Stigma, either. If it can stay in an uninterrupted activation
like that, then its already in the 'Visualised Story' stage."

The Visualised Story. Indeed, it was about time that such a level of
Probability would be allowed.
Yoo Joonghyuk nodded his head in agreement. "Most likely, the king of
those 'Nameless Ones' must be a being possessing incredible defensive
capabilities."

The dependents of a king would naturally follow their boss's Story. Just like
how the kkoma Yoo Joonghyuks, the dependents of the 'Secretive Plotter',
had done so.

The 'Outer God' that raised the island in the middle of the Pacific was most
likely one of the five kings mentioned in the book written by the Recorders
of Fear.

⸢The calamity of the western world, the 'Master of the Sunken Island'.⸥

I spoke up as if to reassure my companions. "Please, you don't have to
worry too much. Upper level Constellations should possess weapons that
can kill them."

"However, no Constellations are participating in the battle."

For sure, I couldn't see any Constellations inside the display panel. Not
even the common Historical-grades.

"We should start gathering them, then."

I glanced at Biyoo while getting ready to use my true voice. The channel
was abnormally silent for some reason. Everyone must've seen that
spectacle, yet there was not a single indirect message so far.

…It was possible that they were fearful of the 'king' that hadn't emerged
from the deepest part of the ocean.

"Jang Hayoung."

Our gazes briefly met and she nodded her head. If it was difficult to talk to
Constellations through the channel, then it'd be a good idea to borrow her
powers. And a short while later…
"…No one's replying."

"Not even one?"

But, that was not possible. There were so many Constellations in the <Star
Stream>, after all.

"The Black Flame Dragon was the only one that sent me a reply, but…
even he said that he's too busy and can't talk…"

"Did you contact <Olympus>? What about the <Underworld>?"

"I called them first, but no reply either."

Something was wrong here.

I could somewhat understand if it's the <Olympus>, but <Underworld>
should've replied for sure. Not only that, what about Uriel or the Great Sage
Heaven's Equal…?

Han Sooyoung next to me clicked her tongue and spoke up. "It's obvious
what happened. This is the true nature of the creatures called the
Constellations."

Each and every Modifier of all the Constellations that cheered us on
brushed past my head. There were so many of them, yet none wanted to
help us?

Meanwhile, Han Sooyoung continued on. "Many Constellations watched
out Stories. Some cheered us on, while some were jealous of us. There were
variety of reactions, sure. And we earned lots of Coins, too. But, that's as
far as it goes."

"…"

"You think the world was truly moved by our stories? Do you really think
you have managed to change the <Star Stream>?"
"I'm not that naïve, but still…"

"Constellations only subscribe to the channels that meet their tastes. They
are no longer entertained, so they simply moved onto other channels. That's
all."

I couldn't be sure whether Han Sooyoung was right or not.

[Next location for the Great Apocalypse is 'North-East Asia'.]

[Time remaining until the start of the 'Great Apocalypse Scenario' is 14
days,12 hours, and 7 minutes.]

But, I was sure that the planet Earth would go down the drain if they
continued to avoid us.

Jung Heewon asked a question. "What should we do?"

"…Well, it's not as if I didn't foresee something like this happening."

My words caused Han Sooyoung to narrow her eyes. "You got something?"

"If they are not willing to meet us, then we should go and speak to them,
instead."

"Where will you go first, then? As I thought, it's the easiest of the lot, the
<Underworld>, right?"

"I think you're probably the only person out there who calls the
<Underworld> the easiest."

I ignored the smirking Han Sooyoung and looked at Jung Heewon.

Asking for <Underworld>'s aid was indeed a priority, but there was
something else more urgent than that right now. We had about fourteen
days left. With the minimum effort, we needed to get the maximum
possible result.

"We should regain our lost companion first."
What I was looking at, was the Steelsword hanging on Jung Heewon's hips.

[Soul of the Character 'Lee Hyunsung' is in slumber.]

The after-effects of the Steel Transformation 5th stage was worse than I
expected, it seemed.

"We'll go meet the 'Master of Steel'."

"The Master of Steel? Will someone like that help us?"

I nodded my head. "The Master of Steel is a powerful Constellation.
Although he's not a Myth-grade, there's no doubt we need his powers far
more urgently than any top tier Constellations out there."

"How come?"

"I don't have the time to give you a detailed explanation. For now, let's get
ready to move."

We needed an emergency hotline, as well as the minimum level of
defensive forces, so Jang Hayoung, Gong Pildu, and Lee Seolhwa were left
behind in the Industrial Complex. I felt bad about leaving them behind
again, but after seeing their expressions, I got the feeling that I was actually
doing them a huge disservice by thinking that way. When I thought about it,
Lee Seolhwa said something similar to that, didn't she?

"Come back soon. And leave this place to us."

Them being left behind in Seoul wasn't easier of the two jobs.

Just like how the 'story' continued on because there were things that hadn't
been told yet.
We got in the [X-grade Ferrarghini] immediately and entered the
dimensional road network.

Our coordinate was OZ-7611. Resplendent stars of the <Star Stream>
brushed past us, and tension gradually dyed the expressions of my
companions.

"You don't have to be that tense, everyone. Just think of it as going out for a
fun outing… Take it as an extension of that workers' revolution or whatever
you called it."

"…But, isn't it working hours right now?"

"I'm saying this because where we're headed off to isn't that scary."

"Where exactly are we going?"

"Mm, well, as I've told you, we're going to the stronghold of the 'Master of
Steel'…"

"Just what the heck is that guy's real identity, anyway??" Han Sooyoung
became too frustrated and shot me that question. "It's more or less possible
to guess the identities of other Constellations through their Modifiers, right?
The 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' is Sun Wukong, while the 'God of
Wine and Ecstasy' is Dionysus. But this guy, I just can't figure it out. And
there was no info on him in the parts that I read, either."

"Well, if you're that curious, why don't you take a guess through the
[Predictive Plagiarism]?"

"You want me to use my ability on something this

small??" I shrugged my shoulders.

I took a look at the faces of my companions, and not just Han Sooyoung but
everyone seemed to be really curious about who this 'Master of Steel' could
be.
Jung Heewon asked me. "Is he someone from a myth that we know?"

"He's not from a myth, but well, he's a really famous Constellation
regardless. Actually, there's even a famous story that used his Story as its
foundation. But, uh… I don't think the kids know about it all that well,
though."

My words caused both Shin Yoosung and Lee Gilyoung to become dejected
right away. Just before I could continue on, noises of explosions came from
behind us.

"…Those sons of bitches!!"

Han Sooyoung steering the vehicle cried out in sheer astonishment.

Shadows of battleships were cast on the rearview mirror. And it wasn't just
one or two, either. At a bare minimum, there were dozens of spaceships
giving us chase while scattering Ether particles.

Shin Yoosung asked me. "Aren't they from a Nebula? Why are they
attacking us?"

I couldn't be sure, but those things looked like Story weapons belonging to
great Nebulas such as <Vedas> or <Papyrus>.

Lee Jihye frowned deeply and spoke up. "Should I just summon my
Geobukseon?"

"No, don't. We don't have the time to fight them. Step on it, Han

Sooyoung!" We didn't have too much to go until our destination, anyway.

In the blink of an eye, the [X-grade Ferrarghini] shot forward and crossed
the dimensional road in a shiver-inducing speed. And soon afterwards, a
new message popped up in the air.

[You've arrived in the coordinate 'OZ-1900'!]
Along with the loud screech, the vehicle came to stop in mid-air. The place
we arrived in was actually a train station of sorts. And that station was a
small wooden house.

I shouted out. "Everyone, get out quickly! And enter that house!"

Almost at the same time as everyone filed into this house, the [X-grade
Ferrarghini] exploded into bits.

…Goddammit, I hadn't even driven it that many times, too.

I confirmed that everyone was inside and closed the front door shut. Right
after that, a powerful tornado was stirred up around the wooden house. The
structure rose up in the air, before moving at a break-neck pace.

I shouted again. "Shut the windows and lock them!"

"You think closing the windows will actually help?!"

Han Sooyoung threw out a tackle, but she still diligently closed the
windows. I spotted the mystery Nebula reloading their weapons in the far-
off distance. It was indeed an impressive spectacle to witness dozens upon
dozens of battleships charging their photon cannons at once. An attack of
that magnitude could probably blow up the Korean Peninsula in one go.

Lee Jihye urgently shouted out. "Ahjussi, even if it's now…!"

"Don't worry. We're safe here."

Suddenly, the entire house went through a geometric transformation. Its
interior expanded rapidly, and accompanied by loud metallic noises, steel
pipes suddenly began growing throughout the house.

"What the heck? Wasn't this a wooden house??"

[Docking procedure will now commence!]
The house floating in the air was secured to something as the loud docking
noises resounded out. And at the same time, the burst of gunfire rained
down on us. The firepower on display here was enough to blow away a
continent to oblivion.

But then, an unimaginably humongous steel barrier suddenly grew around
the entirety of the planet as noisy exhaust sounds resounded out. Streams of
gunfire flying in crashed into that barrier and were extinguished without a
trace.

My companions carried this rather scared-silly look on their faces from the
sheer scale of the barrier as they all turned to look at me.

The exterior of the planet we arrived at could be seen through the windows.
It was a city glimmering in a silvery hue. The giant planet that reminded
one of a contracting heart.

[Welcome to the Heart of Steel, <Oz>!]

The Heart of Steel, <Oz>.

This was the planet where the strongest metal found in the <Star Stream>
'grew'.
             Chapter 460: Ep. 87 - The Heart of Steel, II


[The ship's hull will now enter the stabilisation process.]

[Please be on standby.]

While listening to the system messages, my companions dazedly looked out
of the windows.

The house that got swept away by a tornado, and entering a brand-new
world… Surely, some of them should've realized what exactly was going
on here.

"…Ahjussi, this, this is 'that', right? That 'Wizard of Oz'?"

Rather unexpectedly, the one to ask me first was Lee Jihye.

"You heard about it?"

"Huh. An old friend of mine used to love a musical related to it."
Lee Jihye was bragging a bit, but then her expression suddenly became
gloomy.

Jung Heewon noticed that and quickly took over from there. "By the way,
isn't the 'Wizard of Oz' a relatively modern literary work?"

"If I remember correctly, it was created in the year 1900, I believe," said
Yoo Sangah.

"As expected of Sangah eonni. You really do know everything."

Lee Jihye raised her thumb up.

Jung Heewon carried on. "But, that doesn't make sense, does it? This world
is only around one hundred years old, but… I heard from Hyunsung-ssi that
the 'Master of Steel' is a far older Constellation than that."

"You're correct, Heewon-ssi."

She was asking a valid question. All Stories would go on to construct
'existences' sooner or later. Yet the age of the Story in question that
could've constructed an existence was too short, so it was only natural that
questions would be raised.

"What do you think about the 'Journey to the West'?"

"Pardon?"

"Do you believe that the 'Journey' came about first, or the Great Sage was
around way before that?"

That brought about the moment of realization to my companions.

"Does that mean the 'Master of Steel' existed before that story?"

"It might, or might not."

"What the heck?"
It was as I said.

The ages of those beings that became Stories would gradually get harder to
distinguish as time went on. A Constellation would start from a source
Story, but even such a Story would minutely change as time elapsed.

[The ship stabilisation process has concluded.]

[Exit will now open.]

"Well, we'll find out once we get there," said Han Sooyoung, as she lightly
leaped out first. Lee Jihye and the two kids, looking clearly excited, quickly
followed after her.

"Let's get going, as well," said I.

The remaining companions nodded their heads and exited from this 'ship'.

If my memory was correct, the scenario of <Oz> mirrored the original
novel's adventure. The house flown away by the tornado would arrive in
another world called <Oz>, and the unfortunate one that gets squashed flat
would be the wicked witch…

"What the hell is this?!"

And that's when I heard Lee Jihye's yell. Yup, she must've discovered the
witch below the house, then. However…

"…Hey, it's a fake?"

Something was indeed crushed under the house. However, it wasn't an
actual witch, but a doll mocked up to look like one. Its state was so filthy
and neglected that it would be hard to argue this thing was once a witch.

Han Sooyoung picked up the broken leg of the mannequin and asked me.
"What is this?"

I quietly studied the leg.
⸢The progression has changed from the original.⸥

The planet <Oz> from the 'Ways of Survival' was a type of theme park.

The visitors would follow the route of the original 'Wizard of Oz' which
went along the lines of – encounter the Munchkins first, then after receiving
different roles to play, travel towards the Emerald Castle.

However, something was wrong here.

⸢The dwarves, 'Munchkins', are nowhere to be found.⸥

Yoo Joonghyuk muttered quietly. "It's somewhat different from what my
Master told me."

I agreed with him. What was up with this view? The silver city with bleak
winds blowing through it, was showing almost no sign of life.

"Something feels really dreary. Isn't this world supposed to be a fairy
tale…?"

Even I, a man who read the 'Ways of Survival' inside out, didn't possess a
whole lot of info related to <Oz>.

It was introduced properly only once during the original novel – during Yoo
Joonghyuk's 999th regression turn. (In the latter half of the 'Ways of
Survival', the scene skips happened far more frequently, and stuff related to
Oz got relegated to simple lines such as: "They went to Oz to get Story
metal that could strengthen their weapons.")

⸢It's a sad place, isn't it? It'd have been nicer for a happier story to permeate
in this place.⸥
Lee Hyunsung from the 999th turn said that. It still remained vividly in my
head even now. This was where he awakened his powers and ended up
inheriting the Status and the will of the 'Master of Steel'.
But no matter how hard I looked, our current view was completely different
from the original novel. Why? Was it because we changed a lot of the
original's storyline?

This was none other than <Oz>. It was not one of the planets strongly
influenced by the changes <Kim Dokja's Company> caused.

"Shouldn't those fairy-like creatures gather around us to sing and dance
while taking us somewhere? Forget about fairies, I can't even see a single
fly," said Han Sooyoung.

The theme park's broken notice board was found discarded on the ground. It
was as if we were looking at a closed-down amusement park.

Still, the kids seemed to be really excited regardless. They stuck close to
my sides and began muttering away. "It's almost like a haunted house."

We decided to follow the yellow road marked on the ground for the time
being. According to the original, the Emerald Castle should be waiting for
us at the end of this road.

And sure enough, we did spot a tall green tower after walking for a bit. And
a small city was built around that tower.

⸢An aged castle has been constructed at the place where all journeys come
to an end, so⸥

⸢We wish for you to willingly pay us a visit and remember our story.⸥

Somewhat poignant words were written on the entrance to the city.

It was around then that Yoo Joonghyuk suddenly spoke up. "I shall act on
my own from here."

"What? Why?"

"There is an excellent blacksmith living among the dwarves in this place."
I recalled a certain sentence after hearing him.

⸢The Oz's metal is permeated with the most ancient type of magic, so…⸥

Indeed, <Oz> was the place of origin for the metal permeated with the
oldest Story in the <Star Stream>. Even Yoo Joonghyuk's weapon from the
original was reinforced with the steel from this place.

The greatest supreme sword reborn as the Star Relic after the <Oz>'s metal
and Yoo Joonghyuk's Story were intertwined – that was the Star Relic he
used in the latter half of the novel, [Splitting the Sky Sword].

Of course, that was the story from the original, and the one to get reinforced
this time around would be the [Black Heavenly Demon Sword], but still…

"Oz's steel is the strongest in the <Star Stream>. Securing suitable weapons
is an utmost priority."

After declaring such, Yoo Joonghyuk didn't even wait for our permission
and simply went on his way. Companions looked at me, silently asking if
this was okay, and I replied with a simple shrug of my shoulders.

Since I had multiple reasons for coming to <Oz> anyway, there was a need
to split the group here. Also, the whole group wasn't really necessary to
save Lee Hyunsung.

I spoke to Lee Jihye and her brilliantly-sparkling eyes. "You should go after
him, too. Don't you want to upgrade your battleship?"

"Hell yes!"

The clearly-happy Lee Jihye quickly trotted away.

Next up, I looked at Yoo Sangah. "Yoo Sangah-ssi, can you tail them for
the time being? I'm kind of worried about sending those two alone. And
also, the kids… I'm sure there are lots of things to sightsee around here."

"Let's go! Please hurry!"
The children held onto both hands of Yoo Sangah and they soon
disappeared towards the high street. Now that the noisy group had been
split up like this, I felt a bit hollow for some reason.

The remaining people were Jung Heewon, Han Sooyoung and me.

Han Sooyoung muttered out. "So, only Dorothy, the smart Scarecrow, and
the Cowardly Lion remain."

There were four members in the Wizard of Oz's main group. They were the
protagonists Dorothy, Tin Woodman, the Scarecrow, and the Cowardly
Lion.

I spoke up. "Since you went ahead and said the 'smart' Scarecrow, I'm
guessing that's you."

"Bingo."

"I won't ask you about the other two."

"You're the Cowardly Lion, obviously."

"Thanks."

While chatting and giggling away, we entered the center of the city. If this
place remained as a theme park, such a composition could've been rather
fun. Jung Heewon shook her head while looking at us and strode forward
without hesitation.

A handful of monkeys hidden in the nooks and crannies of the city were
glancing at us.

It certainly didn't feel like a welcoming atmosphere. This world didn't
welcome us or even bother to greet us. Forget about a fairy tale, the overall
vibe suited a horror novel far better.

Not too long afterwards, we arrived before the Emerald Tower.
Han Sooyoung was the first to speak up. "It looks like a magic tower."

"Well, an actual wizard is living here, so…"

Although, I couldn't be sure if he was still alive even now.

We approached the entrance and knocked on the door, only to be greeted by
a stiff, curt voice of a man.

– State your business.

"We seek an audience with the 'Master of Steel'."

No reply came back. The door remained resolutely shut.

It seemed that I made a slip of tongue somewhere. I quickly recalled the
'Ways of Survival'. What did they say in the 999th turn again?

While I remained engrossed in my thoughts, Jung Heewon suddenly
unsheathed her sword and spoke up. "Return Hyunsung-ssi's soul before I
split this damn tower in half."

The Status of an Archangel exploded out from her entire figure. And just as
the intense flames of [Hellfire] started burning on the Steelsword's blade,
the door hesitantly opened up.

[The Emerald Castle is welcoming all of you.]

I wondered if this was fine, but since we didn't have a lot of time, I figured
might as well.

Han Sooyoung had found an ideal opportunity here so she muttered in an
impressed voice. "As expected of our Dorothy."

"Shut up. I didn't come here to fool around."

Han Sooyoung sneaked closer to my side and whispered through the
[Midday Tryst].
– Super scary. Is that the power of love?

Jung Heewon was marching forward while her Steelsword drew arcs in the
air. She was originally a spirited person, to begin with, but seeing her like
this, I couldn't help but admit that her current aura was indeed astonishing.

– I guess so.

The interior of the tower was rather plain and boring. There weren't any
eyecatching decorations to speak of, and only the most necessary items
were placed here and there. It was like the inside of Lee Hyunsung's
military backpack.

We walked for another five minutes or so before a room resembling an
audience chamber made its appearance. We opened its doors and entered
immediately. Colourful spotlights came to life and a giant, silver-coloured
mask floated up in the middle of the chamber. A pair of hollow eyes were
now looking at us.

[The <Kim Dokja's Company>, is it.]

The Steel's true voice reverberated within the audience chamber.

I immediately realized that this guy was the 'Master of Steel', the
Narrativegrade Constellation and Lee Hyunsung's backer. This mask was
probably a symbolic item.

"That's correct. Pleasure to make your acquaintance."

[I'm guessing that you're the 'Demon King of Salvation'.]

I nodded my head. The silver mask looked at me as if this whole thing was
rather annoying. [What is the purpose of your visit here?]

Going straight to the topic, is it? I thought that this was for the better.

"Please return Lee Hyunsung's soul to us. We know that you have the
ownership over it."
[That's impossible.]

"Why not?"

[His soul is required to maintain this planet.]

That was completely unexpected. I glanced to my side, only to discover
Jung Heewon glaring daggers in my direction.

I quickly followed up. "I'm well aware that sponsorship contracts are
usually like this, but regardless of what, Hyunsung-ssi is our companion. I
was under the impression that you liked our story so far?"

[…]

"Besides, doesn't <Oz> possess more than enough Giant Stories? Surely,
there isn't a reason to use Hyunsung-ssi's soul as the power source?"

The Story of ⸢Wizard of Oz⸥ was famous enough to be well-known back on
Earth, too. Sure, the fame had cooled down a little in recent times, but this
story managed to generate a shocking level of popularity throughout the
planet once upon a time.

It was that famous on Earth, so how popular would it have been in the <Star
Stream>? So, the lack of a power source simply didn't make any sense at
all.

Even then, the 'Master of Steel' remained resolutely stubborn.

[Go back. I can't return his soul.]
            Chapter 461: Ep. 87 - The Heart of Steel, III


"If you really require a power source, then why don't we exchange Stories?
We can supply you with Stories that can serve as useful replacements."

[I told you to go back.]

As I thought, something was off here. If it was simply about using Lee
Hyunsung as a power source, then there shouldn't be a reason to say no to
my offer.

"I'm sorry, but we must take his soul back with us. The Final Scenario will
soon begin. Meaning, this is no time for us to worry about your well-
being." [Story, 'Demon King of Salvation', has begun its storytelling!]

I unleashed my Status, causing the 'Master of Steel' to speak in a bit of a
fluster. [You dare to oppose me inside <Oz>??]

Accompanied by a 'Tsu-chuchuchut!' noise, sparks exploded inside the
audience chamber. The 'Master of Steel' was a Narrative-grade
Constellation, but when in <Oz>, his Status would…
[I've been generous by receiving you lot, yet you…!] …Be

almost on the same level as a Myth-grade Constellation.

Ku-dudududu!!

The whole planet seemingly writhed about violently like a heart repeating
the actions of contracting and relaxing.

Han Sooyoung stared at me with a pale complexion.

– Are you insane, Kim Dokja?! Why are you trying to fight insi…

I began unleashing the Stories next.

[Giant Story, 'Demon Realm's Spring', has begun its storytelling!]

[Giant Story, 'Torch that Swallowed the Myth', has begun its storytelling!]

The main Giant Stories started their storytelling and the audience chamber
quaked as if it'd collapse at any given moment.

I stepped across the violently-rocking floor and walked forward. The
'Master of Steel' shouted out. [Step back! If you don't, I shall…!] Yup,
thought as much.

There were plenty of opportunities to subdue me, yet this 'Master of Steel'
only issued warnings repeatedly without actually doing anything.

It was like dealing with the Cowardly Lion.

I walked straight through the mask and advanced forward to reach the
rearmost wall of the audience chamber. The 'Master of Steel' was shouting
something at me, but I ignored it all and simply punched the wall, hard.

In the next moment, the silver mask floating around like a hologram
disappeared.
"Listen here, monkey."

And I could see a monkey through the wide-open hole in the wall, shivering
away in pure fear.

"Where is the real 'Master of Steel'?"




A short while later, we managed to get some useful info from the monkey.

Han Sooyoung spoke first. "Okay, so. The 'Master of Steel' isn't here."

[I-if you do this, the 'Master of Steel' will…]

"Switch off the true voice, now. It doesn't even sound like a proper true
voice, anyway."

"…probably forgive you," said the now-dejected monkey.

It was likely that this monkey was a henchman of the real 'Master of Steel'.
I wasn't sure why, but this little guy was acting like a Constellation in this
place for some reason.

"Hang on, was it you who sent all those indirect messages until now, then?"

"Y-yes, that's right. However, I was accurately conveying the Master of
Steel-nim's intentions."

"You were 'conveying' his intentions?"

My question prompted the monkey's gaze to shift towards a corner of the
audience chamber. That was where we could see an altar with a Steelsword
stabbed into its surface to resemble a cross.

I took an especially closer look at the exterior of the sword.
"Now normally, I can hear the Master's intentions through that altar. But
lately, messages from him have stopped arriving, and…"

I reached out to the Steelsword. I felt a certain flinching jolt when I touched
it. I had experienced a sensation like this one before.

Although very faint, it was the same sensation I felt back when I came in
contact with a different world-line.

Which meant that the 'Master of Steel' was an existence from another
worldline.

…But, that was not possible. As far as I knew, the 'Master of Steel' was Tin
Woodman from the ⸢Wizard of Oz⸥… Could it be that someone else had
appropriated that Constellation Modifier?

While I was stewing inside my thoughts, Han Sooyoung asked the monkey.
"Does the wretched state of your planet have something to do with that?"

"…Well, some part of it, yes. But neglecting maintenance also contributed
to the issue, as well. Every Story is bound to stagnate, after all. It has been a
really long time since magic has disappeared from <Oz>. Do you actually
know how old the Story of this place is?"

"Don't know."

"Tourists don't come to <Oz> anymore. It's already been over three years
since the last time the monthly average visitor numbers reached double
digits."

The monkey's eyes were dyed in the light of vague reminiscence. As if he
was recalling the glory days of yore or something.

"Once upon a time, <Oz> was the number one theme park in the <Star
Stream>…"

Jung Heewon frowned deeply. "I don't want to hear about stuff like that. So,
are you going to return Hyunsung-ssi's soul or not??"
"W-well, that is a bit…"

"Why not?!"

"The whole reason why we managed to maintain double-digit attendance
numbers is due to 'Lee Hyunsung', that's why."

"What are you talking about?"

The monkey hesitated greatly before answering her. "Have you heard the
news that lately, the powers of all Giant Stories are in decline?"

"Powers of the Giant Stories are declining…?"

"It's not just <Oz>. Many Stories that constitute Giant Stories have all
entered the path of stagnation similar to <Oz>'s situation."

"But, why?"

"A certain Story that has appeared in recent times has begun eating into the
percentages of other Stories."

The monkey raised its head and with eyes full of resentment, began glaring
at me.

"I'm talking about you people's Story."




In conclusion, we did get something out from the visit to the Emerald
Castle. The monkey told us this:

– You can take Lee Hyunsung away. In return, please help us
withadvertising <Oz>.

We asked how we could do that, and he replied like this.
– You'll find out when you get to where Lee Hyunsung currently is.

And that was the reason why us, this trio, were standing in this particular
place. At some distance away, we could see a Ferris wheel that no longer
functioned as well as an ancient, decrepit carousel. It was the stereotypical
sight of a run-down, bankrupt theme park.

<<There is no Wizard in Oz>>

It seemed that was the name of this theme park. In a way, it sounded rather
cool.

My problem was with what was written below it.

<<However, we have Lee Hyunsung>>

– Lee Hyunsung 'Memory Experience Center' now open!

– Find Lee Hyunsung's soul hidden somewhere in the Experience Center
towin a cool, pre-selected prize.

…What the hell was the meaning of this?

We headed to the ticket booth to find a list of prices waiting for us.

 Entrance ticket 4000 Coins

 Free Pass (50% discount) 3000 Coins

This was basically telling us to buy the free pass.

The ticket booth employee asked us.

– How many?

"Three."

– 3000 Coins per Incarnation. 60000 for a Constellation.
…Did I hear him wrong just now?

I became dazed after being on the receiving end of such cruel
discrimination for the first time in my life. But then, Jung Heewon suddenly
extended her hand in my direction. "This counts as company expenses,
right? We're on the clock, after all."

"…Of course."

"Give me one for Incarnation."

She unhesitantly swiped with the company expenses card and entered the
'Memory Experience Center' right away. I remained dazed, while Han
Sooyoung stepped past me.

"Excuse me, one more Incar…"

"Hang on."

"What is it now?"

"There is a special discount category."

I pointed at the small notice attached next to the price list.

– Constellation X Incarnation Couple Discount Coupon, now available!

– This is a special couple's discount coupon designed for those
Sponsorsvisiting along with their Incarnations! Make beautiful new
memories with your Incarnation and enjoy sweet, relaxing time together!

Han Sooyoung finished reading the notice and turned to look at me. I
nodded my head. Which prompted her to ask a question.

"Have you finally lost it?"

"Even if we have enough Coins, I don't have enough to spend in this place."
She glared at me with seething eyes, and as if calculating something in her
head, she counted with her fingers for a bit, and finally alternated her gaze
between the price list and me.

Eventually, she sighed grandly and asked. "Fine. What will you give me in
return?"




"…What are you two doing??"

Jung Heewon discovered Han Sooyoung and I, and said that in dismay. But,
that was understandable. Because… both of us were sporting an identical
pair of wolf-ear headbands right now.

[Applicable item can't be taken off while inside the 'Memory Experience
Center'.]

[Please show off the close bond you share with your Incarnation to other
Constellations!]

Han Sooyoung replied to her in a shameless voice. "I'm working part-time
in the dating industry."

"Let's search for Hyunsung-ssi first, shall we?"

According to the monkey, Lee Hyunsung's soul should be wandering
around somewhere in this 'Memory Experience Center'. Not sure why he
was roaming around in this place, but…

We had a little bit of time on our hands, so we walked around the 'Memory
Experience Center' with calm minds. I was wondering what exactly this
place was, and we soon got to find out.

[Lee Hyunsung, born as a healthy and big baby weighing in at 5.4 kg!]
[Lee Hyunsung, five years old – rescues a friend from bullies!]

This was where we would get to 'experience' his life.

[Only those holding the 'Free Pass' can enter.]

[The chamber's experience will begin once you enter. Will you enter?]

"Does this mean we will get to experience the feelings of a newborn? Who
the heck would want to pay money to experience something like that??"

This theme park seemed to be similar in nature to a generalised amusement
park. We could enter individual 'Experience Centers' to experience Lee
Hyunsung's life through either his eyes or someone near him.

Jung Heewon spoke up. "I guess we really have become famous lately.
Someone even came up with a thing like this, too."

"…I'm kinda curious about that one over there."

We became totally entranced and studied the various parts of Lee
Hyunsung's life. It felt as if I had really become a Constellation… Hang on,
I really was a Constellation, wasn't I?

[Lee Hyunsung, 17 years old – fails in his quest for his first love!]

Jung Heewon stared at this particular 'center' without saying anything.

So, I naturally had to ask. "…Are you planning to go in?"

"No."

We continued to search for Lee Hyunsung. His soul gave off a unique Story
reaction. And we could definitely sense that particular reaction nearby,
but…

[Lee Hyunsung, encountering the Judge that destroys evil!]
After walking about for a while, we discovered several 'Experience Centers'
related to the <Kim Dokja's Company>.

[Pure Steel Lee Hyunsung! With Judge that destroys evil, he…]

Jung Heewon's steps gradually gained pace. We diligently followed after
her. However, we still couldn't sense Lee Hyunsung's presence. We looked
through a row of the Experience Centers and turned around to leave, but
found someone unexpected behind us. It wasn't the guy we were looking
for, though.

"Uh? Ahjussi?"

It was Lee Jihye wearing a fox-ear headband.

"…And why are you here?"

Lee Jihye provided a short explanation after I asked her.

The first part of the tale was about Yoo Joonghyuk, Yoo Sangah, the kids,
and her heading to the blacksmith only to be told that the supply of Story
metal had run out.

The second part was about how they walked around disappointed only to
coincidentally discover this place.

And finally, the last part regarding how they just couldn't win against the
kids pestering them so they bought a family discount to enter… Eh? Family
discount?

"What are you fools doing here?"

I looked back and sure enough, Yoo Joonghyuk and his fox ears were
standing there. He alternated his gaze between me and Han Sooyoung
before throwing out a question. "Have you regained Lee Hyunsung's soul
yet?"
"We came here to find it. Besides, what are you doing here instead of
searching for the Story metal?"

"The blacksmith was temporarily closed. Apparently, their supply of Story
metal had run out."

I could guess why something like that had happened. Perhaps it was related
to the weakening of <Oz>'s Giant Story.

I saw Yoo Sangah waving her hand from afar. I also spotted Shin Yoosung
and Lee Gilyoung wearing headbands that reminded me of a dragonfly's
wings.

"Eonni! Let's go inside that one next! That one!"

"Oh my, that one's for over 18s, you know."

Somehow, the whole gang had assembled once more.

I figured this was for the best. Since it had come to this, searching for Lee
Hyunsung together could save us from further trouble.

It was then that Jung Heewon's voice came from a bit of distance away.
"Everyone, please come over here!"

We hurriedly went over to her side. And that's where we discovered a
certain Experience Center with an especially large number of warning signs
posted outside compared to the others we've seen so far.

 This Experience Center can only be entered by persons older than 18
yearsof age.

 After experiencing the possession, you might suffer from mental
anguishdue to the severe, harsh treatment.

 Caution should be exercised if South Korean male Incarnations wish to
usethis center.
I looked up at the title card for the 'Memory Experience Center' and spoke
to the others. "…Looks like we found him."

There was no doubt about it. The dull-and-slow-moving Story unique to
Lee Hyunsung could definitely be felt from this particular Experience
Center.

He was inside this thing.

I reconfirmed the name of this Experience Center one more time.

[I lost a shell by mistake.]
            Chapter 462: Ep. 87 - The Heart of Steel, IV


"Hyunsung-ie will do it right."

"Hey, it's still not too late. Tie the PET bottles to your legs and jump from
the third floor."

"Others eventually all serve, anyway. So it's fine. Come back after
becoming a man."

Those were pretty common advice given to someone about to be drafted,
just like his life. A life too busy chasing after what everyone else was
doing.

Just like everyone else, he had to sing 'Private's Letter', and without a best
friend nor a girlfriend to bid him goodbye, walked into the recruit training
center.

"53rd trainee."

"53rd trainee Lee Hyunsung, here!"
Lee Hyunsung's early military life wasn't so bad. Thanks to his naturally-
tall height and well-built muscles, he even got recommended to become a
commander-in-training, too. He would've even graduated the training
course with citations were it not for messing up the commander's pledge
repeatedly. "Trainee, do you think the words of your training supervisor are
a joke??"

He realized it from an early age that he was rather slow-witted. Didn't
matter what it was, he learned it later than everyone else, and he was also
rather slow in analysing his situations, too.

Even then, he managed to live on relatively fine all because there were
some people who appreciated his relaxed and honest personality.
Unfortunately, there were no such people to be found in the army.

"Just why do I have to be paired with him in the buddy system…"

"A big freaking body and nothing much besides…"

Lee Hyunsung endured the trainee life even as he was subjected to various
insults and ridicules.

By the time he completed the training course, he became someone who
could finish showering in five minutes or pack his sleeping gear in less than
one minute.

Not too long afterwards, the moment he'd be dispatched to a base had
arrived. This was the moment he had been waiting forever since he got
drafted.

– Giving away sweet tips to those about to join the army. Follow these
instructions after you get to a base. (HOT!) [812]

From the shoe inserts to use during prolonged marching, to being loved by
his seniors after he got assigned to a base – the so-called 'sweet tips' on the
internet he diligently studied the day before joining the military was his
only hope.
His fellow trainees left one by one.

He was the last one remaining. And the person to come fetch him was a
person named 'Sergeant first class Jung'. A steel hat deeply pressed on this
person's head obscured their face.

"You, come with me."

While he rode on the noisy military truck headed to somewhere, Lee
Hyunsung thought about his life one more time. He thought about the next
couple of years ahead, as well as the trials and tribulations waiting for him.

His new army base was in the middle of a small mountain. And so, this
would be where his army life would begin proper. He finished the simple
registration process for a new recruit with the aid of a manager and headed
off to the barracks.

And the moment he opened the building's door wide…

– You must definitely do this.

Lee Hyunsung did exactly what the internet tip said he should do.

"Accept your newbie-!!"

If this was a regular army, his army life would've come to an end right
there. That was, if this was the regular army base.

As his duffel bag was flung in the air, everything around him slowed down
to a crawl, like a slow-motion video. The bag slowly came undone mid-air;
unwashed army-issue underwears, toilet papers, and soap he used back in
the boot camp very slowly scattered in the air. Also, Lee Hyunsung's own
triumphant, confident face, filled with the hope of his upcoming army
life…

As this scene resembling a tragedy-filled movie played out, someone
suddenly asked a question.
– …What should we do?

That elicited a reply from someone else.

– Nothing much. This is who Hyunsung-ssi is. In any case, let's accept
thisreality. The hardcore treatment last time didn't work, so this time, let's
go with the promised 'progressive army' concept… – Stop being noisy and
get it started already, Kim Dokja.

– …Well then, let's start over again!

And then, the scene began moving forward again.

Splat!

His duffel bag shooting forward seemingly out of a cannon crashed on the
floor like a real cannon shell.

The atmosphere became icy in an instant as if someone poured cold water.
And the glares of his seniors belatedly stabbed into Lee Hyunsung. Cold
sweat trickled down his back. Could it be… that he made a mistake?

Right next moment.

Sergeant first class Jung grinned brightly and clapped hands. "Begin your
smile exercise, now! Hahahaha! Wow, now that was funny! My first time
seeing such a refreshing debut!"

That prompted the seniors in the barracks to give him a standing ovation as
if they were waiting for this moment.

"Rookie-nim, really well done!"

"Wonderful job."

As the sounds of hands clapping resounded out, Lee Hyunsung grew even
more puzzled, but still, his triumphant air returned. The 'sweet' tip had been
right.
Sergeant first class Jung spoke towards the soldiers. "Joonghyuk-ie, you're
his direct senior, so take good care of this guy."

"…Understood."

The noisy atmosphere continued on. In the meantime, Lee Hyunsung
discovered a senior tidying up his scattered belongings on the floor for him.

His uniform was perfectly straight, the light in his eyes sharp and fierce,
and his face was like a fine sculpture. His chest was home to the army
service ribbon of Private first class, and the name tag of 'Yoo Joonghyuk'.

'Ah, so this person is my direct senior'.

It was then, this senior's scary eyes landed on Lee Hyunsung.

"I, I'm Private second class, Lee Hyunsung!!"

"Your spot is this way."

His stuff had been gathered up in the blink of an eye and was placed in the
locker. Other seniors looked impressed as if they were expecting it.

"Newbie, watch and learn from him. Joonghyuk-ie is our base's ace, you
see?"

Just from looking at the atmosphere of his seniors, he could already tell
what kind of a being his direct senior was. That perfectly-set beret, that
perfectlyset bedding – it was as if everywhere this person touched sparkled
brightly. If he could carry on his army life just like this senior…

"What's this? We have a newbie?"

It was at this moment that a cheerful voice came from the entrance. A man's
face caked in sweat as if he was returning from a hard day's work was there.

Lee Hyunsung confirmed the rank of sergeant as the man brushed past him
and he quickly performed a military salute. "Loyalty!"
"Ah, ah. Don't be so tense. It's fine." The sergeant studied Lee Hyunsung's
face before breaking out in a grin. He then shifted his gaze towards Private
first-class Yoo Joonghyuk. "Looks like our Joonghyuk-ie's military life is
about to get a whole lot easier now? He's already got himself a direct junior
and all."

The complexion of the man snickering away was far too pale for a soldier.
But, why was this? The moment he saw this man, Lee Hyunsung felt this
sensation of the deepest corner of his heart ache a little.

Soldiers confirmed the face of the man and shouted out.

"Sergeant Kim Dokja-nim! Good to see you back from your hard day's
work!"

"Alright, men. By the way, why isn't Joonghyuk-ie greeting me?"

"…Wel…come… back…"

Private first-class Yoo Joonghyuk trembled visibly, his complexion
ashenwhite. It felt as his scowl didn't form out of fear, but more like out of
sheer rage, instead

Sergeant Kim Dokja shrugged his shoulders after observing his reaction,
then spoke up. "Welcome to our squad, Lee Hyunsung."

"I'm Private second class, Lee Hyunsung! Sir!"

This was the first meeting between Lee Hyunsung and the squad leader
Kim Dokja.

…As far as the former's memories were concerned, that was.




About two weeks went by since he was shipped out.
During that time, Lee Hyunsung got to learn various things about this base.
For instance, about Sergeant Kim Dokja, the de facto authority in the squad
he belonged to.

"Got it? If that fool Yoo Joonghyuk does something out of line, you must
tell me right away."

"P-Private second class, Lee Hyunsung!! There's no such thing!"

"Nope, listen. Such a thing will happen. You already suffered plenty of
times."

"…I think I misheard you, sir?"

And then, Private first class Yoo Joonghyuk who always stayed by his side
and led by example, and also glared at Sergeant Kim Dokja every single
chance he got.

"Polish your military boots this way."

"P-private second class, Lee Hyunsung! I'll work hard!!"

"Working hard has no meaning. The important thing is doing it right."

Also, medical officer Lieutenant Yoo, who periodically showed up to do
health check-ups.

"Mm, you have a bruising on your leg… Should I just have you discharged
for health reasons?"

"P-Private second class Lee Hyunsung!! I'll be fine!"

"Then, should I stitch you up? I'm pretty good with needles."

Then, Sergeant first class Jung who seemed to be disinterested yet also
meticulous, and sometimes looking at Lee Hyunsung with a saddened
expression.

"…How is it? You good?"
"P-Private second class, Lee Hyunsung!! I'll do my utmost best!!"

"It's fine if you don't. You always try your best anyway."

…Everyone here, they all had something weird about them.

"For the sake of establishing the culture of progressive army environment!"

However, if he were to pick the strangest person out of them all, then…

"All soldiers must read webnovels during their downtime. Reading
webnovels is the alpha and omega of a productive downtime." …It was
none other than the squad commander, Captain Han.
"That's enough! It's your downtime now! All of you, read webnovels."

"Lo! Yalty!"

That's how Lee Hyunsung's dream-like soldier life began. However, he had
no idea.

[Currently, <Kim Dokja's Company> is challenging the Memory
Experience
Center's 'I lost a shell by mistake'.]

[Applicable Experience Center's difficulty is rated hardest.]

[Number of attempts to clear it is currently 3.]

He had no idea that this soldier life wasn't his first time.




It didn't really need to be explained, but the total number of people
participating in this scenario was five. Yoo Joonghyuk, Yoo Sangah, Jung
Heewon, Han Sooyoung, and myself.
On a side note, the hidden scenario we got was this.


  <Hidden scenario – I lost a shell by mistake>
  Type: Hidden

  Difficulty: ???

  Clear condition: Incarnation 'Lee Hyunsung' is trapped in his own
  memories. Resolve his trauma and rescue him from his memories.

  Time limit: ???

  Reward: Lee Hyunsung's return, possibility of acquiring main prize
  item related to strengthening of <Oz>'s profile.

  Failure: Acceleration of <Oz>'s destruction.


What a nonsensical scenario it was. The time limit shown as question marks
already put us in a bit of spot, yet the clear condition and the failure penalty
were even more disconcerting.

Sergeant first class Jung Heewon-nim… no, hang on, just Jung Heewon,
asked a question. "Sergeant Kim Dokja."

"Yes?"

"Let's forget about the rest for now. But this, why would <Oz> be destroyed
if we fail?"

"There are two possible theories. One, that's how low the <Oz>'s profile has
fallen, and… two, it could mean some kind of physical danger."

Along with a 'Boom!!' a slender ripple-like thing spread from the far side of
the skies. I recalled the Nebulas that chased us to this place. It was possible
that they had begun their invasion in earnest. If that was the case, then we
didn't have all that much time.

Maybe he heard the rippling noise, Lee Hyunsung and his pale-white
complexion quickly ran towards us from afar.

"Sergeant Kim!!"

"Yeah, Hyunsung-ah."

"Looks like North Korea is attacking us!!"

"Nah, it's alright. Go take a break."

"Loyalty!"

Lee Hyunsung seemed lost as to what to do next, but eventually headed off
to the corner of the base and began practising national military gymnastics
exercise he hadn't mastered yet.

Jung Heewon watched him and muttered to me. "Can Hyunsung-ssi really
return to us?"

"I'm not sure. But we must try."

This was already our third attempt.

The first try was a failure as many of my companions didn't know much
about the army (I was the only person who served among our group,
actually) and the second try ended up as another failure all thanks to Yoo
Joonghyuk's hardcore treatment.

Yoo Joonghyuk forming a scowl next to us piped up. "Frustrating. Lee
Hyunsung must be put through his paces so that he can wake up faster.
Have you forgotten about the events of Kaizenix?"

"We already tried that during our second try."

"I can do better given another chance."
"You should know better than anyone that's not true."

"…"

"You know that saving someone else is never that easy."

This Yoo Joonghyuk had gone through the third regression turn… or,
possibly even the 1864th turn. So, he should know it even if I didn't bring it
up.

"Lee Hyunsung! The order of your exercise is wrong!"

…Or, it's possible that he didn't know.

Yoo Joonghyuk strode towards the frightened Lee Hyunsung in big steps.

I watched the two of them doing the military gymnastics exercise side by
side and murmured to Jung Heewon. "I think staying here for too long will
be bad for us. Even Yoo Joonghyuk's acting strange."

"…He is?"

"He's never served in the army, yet he's adapting to it just too well."

I watched Yoo Joonghyuk perform the gymnastics exercise with
nearreligious zeal. There was an event during the 144th regression turn
where he wrongly received a transfusion of Lee Hyunsung's 'Military Story'
and went insane.

If more time went by inside here and yet another Story like ⸢Mad Soldier
Yoo Joonghyuk⸥ was created in the process, then…
Jung Heewon replied. "Isn't it a good thing that he's adapting really well?"

"Yes, he's adapting well, but the problem is with how poorly he's treating
me, his senior in rank. The military nowadays have become really soft, I
have to say. Back when I was in the army…"
"Dokja-ssi, you're just sour that Joonghyuk-ssi never served, right? I mean,
he was exempted, wasn't he?"

I replied to her in a calm manner. "…In any case, the situation isn't so bad if
we exclude that part. Just by us being here, the planet <Oz>'s profile is
rising up, after all."

[Currently, a large number of Constellations are paying attention to the
applicable scenario!]

Maybe the rumour of <Kim Dokja's Company> creating yet another bizarre
Story had made rounds out there because visitors to Biyoo's channel had
increased.

I couldn't be sure, but those Nebulas targetting us right outside the planet
were probably watching us right now. If they couldn't attack us
immediately, then taking advantage of the situation would be a smart thing
to do.

[Many Constellations have entered the applicable channel!]

[Planet <Oz>'s fame is spreading far and wide!]

[Brand new Story related to Incarnation 'Lee Hyunsung' is germinating!]

The strange thing was, the newly-entering Constellations weren't the people
that I knew of. Uriel, the Great Sage, the Abyssal Black Flame Dragon,
Goreyo's First Sword… as if they were the tidewater receding away, all the
Modifiers I was glad to see were nowhere to be found.

An ominous foreboding crept up in my mind. Did something happen to
them?

[Portion of Constellations are eagerly waiting for Incarnation 'Lee
Hyunsung's return!]

I need to conclude this scenario quickly so that I may get to find out what's
going on, but…
"Is there really a need to clear it, though?"

"Pardon?"

Jung Heewon didn't reply and stared in Lee Hyunsung's direction. While
under the guidance of Yoo Joonghyuk, he was continuing to perform the
exercise routine as sweat trickled down his face. Maybe he got the order
right this time because Yoo Joonghyuk could be seen nodding his head. Lee
Hyunsung looked elated.

[Character 'Lee Hyunsung' is feeling happy!]

"Because he always harped on about manual this and manual that, I thought
that Hyunsung-ssi was a natural-born soldier."

I agreed with her assessment, so I ended up nodding along.

Lee Hyunsung's backstory wasn't discussed in-depth within the Ways of
Survival.

The man named Lee Hyunsung, who lived and died by the rules of the field
manual. But such a man was in reality, as far removed from those manuals
than anything else out there.

This world was where Lee Hyunsung's manual had come to life.

[Character 'Lee Hyunsung' likes this place.]

Jung Heewon smiled powerlessly and spoke in a sorrowful voice. "In a
way, taking him away from here could be us being greedy."

Certainly, Lee Hyunsung might be happier by remaining in <Oz>. Instead
of wandering inside the hellish scenarios, spending simple, comfortable
time within his memories could be a better life for him.

Ku-gugugu…

It was then, we heard yet another deafening boom.
Just as I was about to exchange glances with Jung Heewon, several channel
messages floated up one after the other.

[Constellation, 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' has entered the channel!]

[Constellation, 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' has entered the channel!]
[Constellation, 'Goreyo's First Sword' has entered the channel!]

All those vanished Constellations had returned to the channel at once. Just
before I could ask what happened, though…

[Constellation, 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' is trying to warn you of…!] Tsu-

chuchuchut!

[All indirect messaging within the channel has been restricted.]

…The indirect message was cut off.

I raised my head to discover Biyoo forming a surprised expression.
Obviously, this wasn't her doing, so… In that case, who?

Another boom spread out from the skies. Accompanying the noise akin to a
giant drum being torn apart, the heavens far away began cracking up.

Craaaaack.

"…Dokja-ssi."

Something was going wrong here.
         Chapter 463: Ep. 88 - Myth-grade Constellation, I


Uriel's mood wasn't so good.

– Where are you, our Biyoo?

The previous Stories of <Kim Dokja's Company> were currently on the
Star Stream's broadcasts, yet she couldn't pay attention to them. That
couldn't be helped, though.

The thoughts of previously-laid-back Uriel had become rather complicated
what with everything that happened recently. The deciding factor was her
running into the version of herself from the 999th worldline and receiving a
portion of her memories.

⸢I'm your only ally, Yoo Joonghyuk. I shall definitely end the scenarios and
avenge you.⸥
She knew that versions of herself existed in other worldlines. But, she didn't
expect the experiences of knowing it and meeting one would be this
different.
The 999th regression turn's worldline.

Just what exactly did she do in that world?

[…Urgh, so irritating. I'm not curious about the stories of another
worldline. Trying to follow the stories of my kids alone is plenty hard
enough already.] Uriel grumbled while hugging her head.

Besides, the <Star Stream>'s atmosphere seemed rather unsettled lately. As
the Final Scenario approached, this vague, strange sense of tension
circulated among all the Constellations. So much so that a groundless
rumour of the Bureau abandoning this worldline was doing the rounds, too.

[<Bureau> has summoned the Constellation, 'Demon-like Judge of
Fire'nim!]

[Will you answer the summon?]

Uriel's head shot up after hearing that sudden message.

…Why, with such a timing?

She pondered for a moment, before tapping on the 'confirm' button. When
she did, she was transported to another location along with blinding rays of
light.

[Transmission is complete.]

The place she arrived in was an unfamiliar empty field. Besides her, other
Constellations had arrived there before her.

[What's this, Gabriel? You're also here?]

[The Bureau will spam you with messages if you refuse their call, after all.]

She looked around and spotted several dozen Constellations gathering here.
Just like her, many seemed to be curious about why they had been
summoned. Even if the Bureau was a bunch of thugs, they wouldn't
summon them here without a reason.

Not only that, she recognised a few familiar faces, too. Such as a short
height with bandages tightly wrapped around in one arm…

[Oh my gosh, oh my gosh! Isn't this our little Flame Dragon?!]

Uriel dashed towards the figure of the Abyssal Black Flame Dragon and
performed a head-lock.

[Keuk! An enemy's sneak attack?!]

[It's me, your Archangel noonim.]

[Release me at once!]

Abyssal Dragon freaked out and struggled inside Uriel's 'embrace'.

While watching that spectacle unfold, Gabriel muttered out. […Uriel, that
guy is an 'Absolute Evil', you know.]

[Who cares. <Eden> is destroyed, anyway. We should be friends with one
another.]

The Nebula <Eden> was almost completely wiped out at the end of the
prior 'Great War of Saints and Demons'. Most of the once-powerful
Archangel army was decimated, and the only Archangels that could move
were Uriel and Gabriel.

The former stopped thinking about the bitter matters and scanned her
vicinity. [Hey, that's the Goryeo's First Sword, isn't he?]

Not only him, but also the Korean Peninsula's Constellations that included
'Bald General of Justice', 'First Sorcerer of Joseon', and even 'Last Hero of
Hwangsanbeol'; Nebulas such as <Olympus>, plus a host of Constellations
and even Surya could be seen.
Uriel's eyes moved about even more urgently than before.

The more she spotted familiar Constellations, the greater the foreboding
grew. Every Constellation gathered here, they all had one thing in common.

The Abyssal Dragon finally managed to extract himself from her grasp and
muttered loudly. […Everyone here is from Kim Dokja's channel.]

He was right; Everyone gathered here, they… …Pah-

chuchut!

Right then, Uriel's perception picked up on the movement of a threatening
Status. Beings were surrounding this empty field. Each and every one of
them possessed more than enough Status to almost rival a Narrative-grade
Constellation.

Uriel and her quick wits immediately saw through their identity. […
<Papyrus>, <Vedas>, and even <Emperor>. What is the meaning of this?
To think that you lot with plenty of bad blood between you would unite like
this.]

Uriel spoke up, feeling slightly tense. Even if it was her, fighting off
against this many Narrative-grade Constellations was asking for too much.
Not only that…

[Even a bum-heavy geezer, too… What brings an existence from the 'Final
Scenario' here?]

She was sure of it; the goosebumps rising up on her arms were proof of the
incredibly powerful being's existence hiding nearby.

Even if <Star Stream> was vast, there were only a handful of beings
possessing this level of Status. She glanced to the side and noticed that even
the 'Abyssal Dragon' was making a visibly hardened expression.

There was no doubt – this creature, it was…
[Is everyone here?]

…A true Myth-grade Constellation.

Tsu-chuchuchuchut!

The moment that true voice rang out, the surrounding air suddenly changed.
It felt as if the oxygen floating around was ignited instantly.

The sensation was so strong that the Constellations near her wobbled
unsteadily, while even Uriel, renowned for her high resistance to fire,
couldn't help but frown deeply for a moment there.

…Why was a 'Myth-grade Constellation' here?

With the very rare exceptions like the King of the Underworld, Metatron or
the Great Sage, the majority of 'Myth-grade Constellations' didn't interfere
with the matters of lower-ranked scenarios. Because they were beings that
had already completed their 'Conclusion' and placed their names on the
candidate list for the 'One Single Story'.

They had already reached the Final Scenario, and their Stories had been
guaranteed.

[Looks like the monkey bastard and the King of the Underworld are the
only absentees. However, it's not possible to delay any further, so I shall
start with the explanation.]

[Hold up!]

[Constellation, 'Midday Sun' is looking at 'Demon-like Judge of Fire'.]

The moment she met that gaze, Uriel realized who the owner of that true
voice was.

There were many 'suns' to be found within the <Star Stream>. However,
suns that occupied the center of the universe were extremely rare even
among them. Especially so, if it was an existence that occupied the 'midday'
smack-bang in the middle of time itself…

[God of the Sun, Ra. Did you summon us here?]

He was none other than Ra, the top Constellation of the great Nebula,
<Papyrus>.

[Correct.]

[How odd. I thought that the 'Bureau' called us here?]

Ra didn't reply to her.

Actually, Uriel could sense a presence of Great Dokkaebi among all the
others surrounding her. She decided to calmly respond for now. If that side
really chose to align themselves with the Bureau even at the exorbitant loss
of their Probability, then this situation couldn't be described as good at all.

[Okay, so. Shall we hear what's so important that you're even willing to
expose your cosy relationship with the Bureau?]

[I've summoned you here because of the 'Final Scenario'. Soon, the
'One Single Story' will be chosen. Meaning, the story that will
represent this worldline will be decided.] The One Single Story.

There was not one Constellation present that didn't know what that was.
Even the <Kim Dokja's Company> they had been watching until now was a
Nebula creating their own One Single Story, after all.

[Okay? What's that got to do with us?]

[Most of you have not earned the right of the 'Final Scenario'. However, it'll
be a different story if you side with me. I shall take you to the 'Final
Scenario'. Meaning, I shall give you an opportunity to place your Modifiers
on the 'One Single Story'.]
That proposition caused the eyes of a few Constellations to rock visibly.
Most of them were unaffiliated Historical-grades.

Uriel observed Ra for a moment there before breaking out in a smirk. [What
the hell, that's it? It wasn't anything important, so if you're done talking, I'm
leaving.]

She turned around, but couldn't take another step. An incredibly powerful
Status had rooted her to the spot.

[…What's the meaning of this?]

[I haven't finished talking yet.]

[But, I can already guess what you're about to say without hearing it?]

Uriel's true voice carried a sharp edge. Only the Constellations from the
channel BY-9158 and not any others were brought here. And the one who
gathered them was none other than the top Constellation of <Papyrus>.
[You're about to propose that we attack the <Kim Dokja's Company>,
right?] For a very short moment there, silence dominated the proceedings.

[…Why do you think that?]

[Because they earned the qualification of the 'Final Scenario', that's why.
And eliminating them naturally would lead to one of the strongest
candidates for the 'One Single Story' exiting the picture.]

Visible turmoil spread among the Constellations. Uriel sensed the Statuses
of the Constellations surrounding them get agitated as well.

She snorted derisively. [Really now, you lot called Constellations just don't
change even until the end, no? And also, Ra. You have already reached the
Final Scenario, so interfering in the lower scenario like this is really petty,
you know. Zeus, and even you…]

[…]
[Are you by any chance worried about your kids? You angry that your
offsprings that inherited your Story couldn't win against fledgling Nebula
and failed to become the candidates of the 'One Final Story', and…] There
was an incredible explosion, and Uriel's figure was buried deep into the
ground. As she spat out a slew of expletives, Ra's true voice entered her
ears.

[Fu■, what the hell…]

[Indeed, you're correct. This is the rage of a parent who didn't educate his
children properly. This is the righteous rage of a parent who couldn't sit still
and watch his children's future go astray because of pathetic losers who
gave up on their Conclusions, and a little Nebula not even a decade old.]

As if she was already expecting that, Uriel shouted back. [And you finally
reveal your true colours. Sorry, but there are no Constellations here who
will side with your kids. Looks like you don't know whose channel we're
subscribers of.]

The Abyssal Dragon and Gabriel reached out and helped Uriel out of the
crater. Behind them, the Korean Peninsula's Constellations, including
Goryeo's First Sword and Bald General, were nodding their heads.

Uriel felt this inexplicable sense of contentment after meeting their gazes.
Right now, here in this place, folks that cheered on someone's Story in one
heart had gathered.

From the start of the first scenario, the 'proof of credentials', all the way to
the 'Final Scenario' where the fate of the worldline was to be decided.

Uriel couldn't be certain that everyone here thought the same as her.
However, without a doubt, someone among these people must've loved
<Kim Dokja's Company>'s Story more than their own. Just like she did.

[And that is why you're all losers.]

[What?]
[Have you all lost yourselves to voyeurism and forgotten that you are also a
part of the scenario?]

In the next moment, a powerful storm of Probability's aftermath whipped
about and a certain figure made an entrance.

Tsu-chuchuchut!

It was a doll with an exterior of steel. A Narrative-grade Constellation
riddled with wounds was bound by the sturdy ring of light.

[This fool had been supporting a stupid Story, just like you have.]

Uriel dazedly stared at this Constellation. She had never met this guy
before, yet the moment he appeared, she could tell who he might be. Not
only that, she had exchanged several indirect messages with him in the past,
too.

[Constellation, 'Master of Steel', is shrinking back from pain.]

The Master of Steel. He was the Incarnation 'Lee Hyunsung's' Sponsor.

Ra's laughter could be heard next. [He would have been safe if he remained
quietly back in <Oz>, yet this fool got in touch with an existence from
another worldline, hoping to aid that stupid Story.]

[Just what the hell are you…!]

[You all do not have a choice. Either you help us put an end to <Kim
Dokja's Company>'s Story, or…]

Along with those words, the rings of light binding the Master of Steel's
body began tightening. He thrashed in pain but still stared straight at Uriel.

[Constellation, 'Master of Steel', says that his death today has no meaning.]

[Constellation, 'Master of Steel', announces that his Story and Modifier
have been succeeded by someone else!]
The ring was getting tighter and tighter. Uriel hurriedly moved.

And then…

[Constellation, 'Master of Steel', asks you not to give up on that story.]

Squeeze!!

The Master of Steel's body got crushed without any resistance whatsoever,
and Stories exploded out from his body. It was truly a meaningless death of
a Narrative-grade Constellation.

Everyone from the same channel watched that spectacle as if they were
frozen to the spot.

In front of a planet's death, Ra continued to speak. [Or, die like this one.]

Along with a madness-filled roar, Uriel unleashed her Status in full.
        Chapter 464: Ep. 88 - Myth-grade Constellation, II


Ku-gugugugu!

Like a breaking glass, the sky above cracked apart with black lines running
through it.

Lee Hyunsung stared at the heavens filling up with rifts and asked me.
"Sergeant Kim Dokja-nim? Are we really going to be alright?"

"…"

I too had to look up after listening to him. The world seemed to be
crumbling down.

The reason for that was clear – someone was attacking <Oz> from the
outside. Not just anyone, but incredibly powerful beings, no less.

I turned back and discovered my companions looking at me; Yoo
Joonghyuk, Han Sooyoung, Yoo Sangah, Jung Heewon…

I didn't have to say it, but we already knew what our choice would be.
"It'll be fine. Do you think I'm a sergeant just for a show? Don't worry
about a thing."




The sky was breaking down. Yet, how could he say it was all fine?

Lee Hyunsung couldn't quite understand it. Was the military originally like
this?

⸢Kim Dokja simply smiled quietly.⸥

A calm, collected smile floated upon his face.

Sergeant Kim Dokja would only say this. "Even the squad leader will tell
you it's fine."

Indeed, the squad leader really did gather the soldiers in the training ground
a short while later and began her speech.

She might be small-statured, but still, was overflowing with charisma. With
an unreadable expression on her face, she scanned the rest of the troops and
opened her mouth. "Your squad leader, me, is really disappointed in you."
That unexpected opening caused the soldiers to tense up.

"You have not read webnovels during your downtime."

Lee Hyunsung inwardly flinched. It was true. Even yesterday, he didn't read
webnovels during his break but practised the military gymnastics routine
with Yoo Joonghyuk.

"And so, this squad leader is planning to leave this base."

Lee Hyunsung became stupefied by that unexpected declaration.
…She was leaving? Hushed murmurs could be heard coming from here and
there.

"And Lee Hyunsung."

When he regained his wits, she was already beside him, her hand resting on
his shoulder.

"Private second class Lee Hyunsung, ma'am!"

This would be his first time seeing her up close. Her name and rank could
be seen on top of her neatly arranged uniform.

Captain Han Sooyoung – that was her rank, and her name.

⸢"How long are you planning to stay dazed? You better start moving! You
wish to see Kim Dokja kicking the bucket?"⸥
Why was this? For a moment there, a stinging pain accompanied a set of
strange memories brushing past his mind.

What was that just now…?

"Look, you're stupefied again."

"P-Private second class Lee Hyunsung!"

The squad leader stared at him with unreadable eyes before lightly patted
him on his cheek. "You better read more books, okay? You're slow, so you
simply have to read lots more books. You'll survive for longer that way."

Squad leader Han Sooyoung left behind indecipherable words and left the
base.
Two days after Captain Han Sooyoung left.

The cracks in the skies were growing larger. It was like seeing the first
signs of a world coming to an end.

"Lee Hyunsung, have you memorised the exercise routine yet?"

He looked behind to discover Private first-class Yoo Joonghyuk.

"Private second class Lee Hyunsung! I've memorised everything!"

"You've filled up the army-issue canteen, too?"

"I've filled it up with exactly two litres!"

Lee Hyunsung felt a bit scared by that pair of sharp, angry eyes. He hadn't
made any mistakes, yet they remained critical.

"What about the barracks code of conduct?"

"P-Private second class Lee Hyunsung!! T-that, I haven't…!"

The moment he said that, he inwardly went, oops, I'll get scolded again. He
swallowed nervously and just as he tried to squeeze his eyes shut, heard
Yoo Joonghyuk's voice.

"You should be able to memorise it soon. It's not that long, anyway."

"…Pardon? Ah, you must've heard me wrong. No, I have not…!"

What on earth was going on here? He made two consecutive mistakes just
now, yet Yoo Joonghyuk didn't criticise him.

Not only that, those scary eyes were no longer angry when looking back at
Lee Hyunsung.

"I will be shipping out tomorrow."

"…I don't quite follow, senior?"
"Lee Hyunsung, you can't refer to the field manual on everything. You
won't find a senior willing to aid you every single time."

Why was this?

Why did Private first-class Yoo Joonghyuk's back turning around to leave
feel so familiar to him?

"There will come a time when you must make a choice not found within the
manual."

Those were the last words left behind by the Private first-class Yoo
Joonghyuk.




Members of the squad began disappearing one by one. First, it was Captain
Han Sooyoung, Private first class Yoo Joonghyuk, followed by Lieutenant
Yoo Sangah. When he regained his wits, the non-commissioned officer,
Sergeant first class Jung Heewon had become the squad's top presiding
commander. (Even though the situation made no sense, Lee Hyunsung told
himself it couldn't be helped because it was emergency.)

Lee Hyunsung's daily tasks after performing the morning and evening roll
call were to check the base's infrastructure or accompany Sergeant Kim
Dokja to the barracks' library.

"The military nowadays even stock wuxia novels? Wow, this is a really old
book, too."

Kim Dokja loved books. Actually, it went beyond a simple love affair – he
was the kind of a man who spent the whole day reading books.

Lee Hyunsung would sit next to him and quietly observe him excitedly flip
the pages.
"Don't you want to read, too?"

"Uh, no, I, I'm…"

Before Lee Hyunsung could reply, yet another boom spread out from the
sky.

Kim Dokja's expression faintly hardened.

When the boom was heard for the first time four days ago, Captain Han
Sooyoung went away, and after the second boom two days ago, Private first
class Yoo Joonghyuk disappeared next.

Lee Hyunsung grew restless.

"Kim Dokja Sergeant-nim."

"Huh?"

"By any chance, are you also leaving, sir?"

People were leaving him behind. He was continuously losing something.

Kim Dokja smirked softly. "Probably. I'm a sergeant already. I gotta get
discharged soon. I'm definitely not planning to make a career out of this
place."

"…I see."

"You also want to get out of here as soon as possible, right?"

Lee Hyunsung was about to reply with, "Yes, I do", but then, his eyes
suddenly caught the sight of barbed-wire fences outside the windows. They
looked so sturdy and intimidating.

Why did he feel this, though? He felt fearful of going outside those fences.

"I…"
If he carelessly went beyond the fences, he'd definitely get hurt. However,
they would become barriers protecting him as long as he stayed inside.

When he thought like that, he felt his heart calm down.

The skies were falling. There was an unknown world outside where code of
conduct for living in barracks or the military gymnastics exercise held no
meaning.

He shifted his gaze back to discover Kim Dokja staring at him. The
sergeant's lips bobbed up and down as if he wanted to say something, but
then, a sly grin suddenly formed on his lips. "Hey, if you wish to leave, you
better read more books, man."

"…Will reading lots of books reduce the period of active service?"

Kim Dokja's lips twitched after hearing that question. "Reading a book
and writing a report on it might be enough to get you a vacation." A book
report?

"See, there will be a book report contest being held within our division.
Read that and apply for it. If yours get picked, you'll get time-off as a
prize."

The noticeboard Kim Dokja pointed at had a poster advertising the army's
book report contest. Lee Hyunsung learned for the first time that such a
thing existed.

Ah, so it was true, this book report thing. If he wrote that, he'd be able to
earn some time off the base.

"When you're finished, you gotta let me read it, okay?"

It was after the following morning's roll call that sergeant Kim Dokja had
vanished.
"It's only us two remaining, so who cares about daily tasks?"

Sergeant first class Jung Heewon grumbled loudly.


Lee Hyunsung smiled sheepishly and pulled out weeds growing near the
base. "Well, we don't know what might happen, ma'am. The squad leader
might suddenly return, and…"

Jung Heewon sat on a bench and while resting her chins on her hands,
watched Lee Hyunsung as if he was a mysterious new lifeform.

"Do you like this place?"

The usual Sergeant first class wouldn't have used such a tone of voice.
However, her voice still managed to elicit this inexplicable sense of longing
in him.

Maybe it was that longing allowing him to reply honestly right away.

"It's neither like or dislike, ma'am."

A place that he neither liked or disliked. That was exactly what Lee
Hyunsung's impression on the 'military' was.

"Except that, I don't have to think about anything while I'm here."

That's right – that was the reason why he chose the army.

While he was here, he could forget about the outside world. Employment,
enrolment, gazes of others, issues of the outside world, family affairs,
dilemmas he could never solve no matter what he did.

"…But then, I've been thinking lately that I kind of like it here."

What did he exactly like about this place, anyway? He couldn't describe it
properly.
⸢"I like you."⸥

And why did his heart ache so much?

Sergeant first class Jung Heewon looking straight at him suddenly spoke
up.
"In that case, you stay here, Lee Hyunsung. Wait for us until we come
back." He couldn't reply with "I didn't quite catch you".

Because he simply couldn't mishear what she was saying.

"We'll protect your world."

The moment he wanted to say something, blinding rays of light poured
down from the sky, and the Sergeant first class Jung Heewon disappeared
from his view.

Ku-dududu…

Before anyone had noticed it, the cracks in the skies had already swallowed
up half of the heavens.

And so, Lee Hyunsung became alone.




Just what am I doing?

Is this place really an army base?

The army that I knew is…

Lee Hyunsung repeated his daily tasks and continued to protect the base
with no one in it. He woke up at the fixed time, did his roll call, and did the
military gymnastics routine. After that, he finished disciplining his mind
and began his daily tasks.
However, he had no more things to do now. He even finished pulling out all
the weeds found in the base yesterday.

"…The book report."

He belatedly recalled Kim Dokja's words.

He was told to write a report. To read a book, and write his report on it.

Lee Hyunsung went up to the barracks' library. As if to let the world know
that Kim Dokja used to be here, there was a pile of books gathered up on
that spot.

He reached out to the book on top of that pile, all the while sensing this
strange feeling. The book itself was a familiar one.

⸢The Wizard of Oz, ver. 999⸥

Even he had heard of this book's name from somewhere. However, he had
never read it before. Lee Hyunsung flipped the cover open and began
reading the first sentence.

⸢The tin soldier was scared of having a heart.⸥

A tin soldier, was it? It must've been the Wizard of Oz's protagonist. He
continued to flip through the pages.

⸢The first companion the tin soldier met was a really scary man. The tin
soldier called him 'Captain'.⸥
The moment he read that line, his head pulsed in pain. Captain?

⸢The tin soldier then became companions with a beautiful angel. When that
angel became angry, she'd often morph into a devil.⸥
For some reason, his heart ached when he read those lines. ⸢The tin soldier
became companions with a warrior wearing thick armour. The warrior
used his own sword to test out the tin soldier's strength now and then.⸥

Why, why did it feel like this description would come to life right before
his eyes at any second?

⸢The tin soldier became companions with a dragon spitting out fearsome
flames. The dragon sometimes acted like a nuisance, too.⸥
But, I've never met an existence like that before?

⸢And then, a demon king coming from another world stole away what was
most precious to them.⸥
Every time he read a sentence, all sorts of chaotic scenes and screams flitted
in and out of his vision. He was unfamiliar with those spectacles. Even
then, Lee Hyunsung's entire body shivered.

He couldn't understand it. He didn't get what this story was about.

He simply didn't get what the author was trying to convey.

Worse still, he couldn't understand why tears were welling up in his eyes.

⸢And at the end of this story, the tin soldier realized what the aching in his
heart was.⸥

⸢That aching eventually became his heart.⸥

As soon as he read that line, Lee Hyunsung recalled it.

I too once had companions like them.

⸢"I'd love to hear your story, Hyunsung-ssi, when all these tragedies come
to an end and our stories are no longer treated as scenarios."⸥
The first companion was a polite and warm person. Everyone followed his
lead.

⸢"Until then, everyone being safe is the utmost priority."⸥

The second companion was a kind person. Everyone believed her words to
be correct.

⸢"No, hang on. It's more important that everyone survives, even at the cost
of one person. Of course, that 'one person' must be Kim Dokja. That fool
knows how to come back from being dead, anyway."⸥

The third companion was a wise person. Everyone thought that the
strategies she cooked up will succeed.

⸢"No one will die. Leave this place to me and go."⸥

The fourth companion was a powerful person. Everyone could entrust their
backs to him.

⸢"You know, Hyunsung-ssi. If I ever forget about you, then…"⸥

And, the fifth companion was…

⸢"…Then, please kill me."⸥

His memories were coming back to him. Slowly, so very slowly, his heart
began beating. So slowly, yet with a distinctive feeling, each beat did its
very best to emphasize that they were hurting this way, that this was where
such ache existed.

How could he have ever forgotten about them?

Lee Hyunsung clenched his fists, his body shivering away. He shouldn't be
in this place.
He looked up at the skies outside the windows. The cracks of the skies had
covered the entirety of the heavens by now. It became rather clear where his
companions had gone off to.

They went away to protect this world he was stuck in. All the while facing
off against the calamities that measly North Korea couldn't even compare
to.

⸢Lee Hyunsung thought to himself. 'Do I possess such powers?'⸥

[Constellation, 'Master of Steel', is looking at you.]

His Sponsor was now looking at him.

Tsu-chut, tsu-chuchuchut!!

However, something felt different from before. It must've been his Sponsor,
yet there was a slight, vague difference in the gaze he sensed.

[Constellation, 'Master of Steel' asks if you're hurting.]

Lee Hyunsung nodded his head.

⸢This emotion, this heart, I wish to protect it.⸥

He was scared. Scared of forgetting this moment again, scared of his heart
stop beating again. Scared of everything freezing up within the cold silvery
light.

It was then, his Sponsor spoke to him. 【You can protect it.】

His voice resembled forged steel, tempered for tens of thousands of years.

【However, you may end up in agony for all eternity as the consequences
of failing to protect it.】

"Even then, it's fine. It's better than not even having a chance to protect
them."
He was only familiar with the things he had lost already. The important part
was about not losing them again.

【Your name is the Emperor of Steelsword.】

He saw the barbed wire fences in the distance crumble away. The world of
manuals he had been protecting was disappearing.

Lee Hyunsung stepped forward, towards his own story.




"Dokja-ssi."

We were currently protecting the crumbling <Oz>.

With the decline of the Stories of the Master of Steel, and the ⸢the Wizard
of Oz⸥, <Oz>'s anti-air defense system was crumbling down.
I could see hundreds of battleships surrounding Oz. We shared our strength
and protected the planet with a hole in it from that armada.

Even then, we were reaching our limit.

The other side relied mainly on the long-range attacks from their ships. The
only methods we had of defending against that effectively were Lee Jihye's
[Turtle Dragon], and Shin Yoosung's [Chimera Dragon].

The problem here was that neither Lee Jihye's vessel and Shin Yoosung's
dragon had fully recovered from the damages incurred during the 'Great
War of Saints and Demons'.

We originally came here to address that issue, but this…

"The anti-air defense will be rendered powerless soon!"

We got ready for the final showdown.
Jung Heewon asked. "Still can't contact any other Constellations?"

"Something bad must've happened."

It was likely that these guys attacking us were involved in that.

Han Sooyoung grumbled loudly. "You really aren't going to regret this?
Should we really be doing this?"

I nodded my head. "Lee Hyunsung always fought for us in the frontlines.
It's our turn to repay that debt."

My companions agreed with me.

Yoo Joonghyuk was currently on top of the tallest building on the planet,
while Jung Heewon was emitting powerful Status that didn't lose out to
anyone, her resolve firm, unwavering.

⸢We'll believe in Lee Hyunsung.⸥

I wasn't sure exactly how much time we could buy here. Just that, I could
only pray it was enough for Lee Hyunsung.

"Incoming!"

Ka-boooooom!!

Hundreds of battleships in the distance spat out flames simultaneously.
Magical shells, their numbers more than enough to utterly decimate a planet
in its entirety, rained down.

We unleashed all of our Statuses. We needed to withstand this wave of
attack no matter what.

After gathering all of our magical…

Right next moment.
A vast silvery light suddenly enveloped the whole world.

The enormous protective barrier made out of Story metal spread out among
the heavens. Through the semi-transparent barrier, I saw the shells of the
battleships powerlessly explode on the outside.

"Being left alone in a place like that was not a happy experience, you
know."

This was not the Story of ⸢the Wizard of Oz⸥. No, it was a new type of
Story, with a somewhat different origin.

⸢In that world, he was referred to as the Emperor of Steelsword.⸥ Kwa-
kwakwakwa!!

Chills ran down my spine.

Steam covered the entire planet. Metals spreading out like a giant tree's
branches began blanketing the surface of the planet itself.

This was the hardest material found in <Star Stream>, the only Story metal
capable of dealing with the Myth-grade Constellation's frightening
weapons. [A large number of Constellations are astonished by the scale of
this Story!]

And here it was, the Stigma powerful enough to completely envelop a
planet with that metal. That was the anti-air defense system that the planet
<Oz> proudly boasted, the [Last Steel].

"Captain Lee Hyunsung from the Giant Monsters Special Command,
reporting."

The man I was familiar with, blessed a height taller than Yoo Joonghyuk's,
and boasting the sturdiest body.
"I have been discharged from the active service today."

Stars of the skies could be seen staggering back now.

[Constellations from Nebula <Papyrus> are astonished by the revival of the
'Master of Steel'!]

And now, it was the time for the counterattack.
       Chapter 465: Ep. 88 - Myth-grade Constellation, III


[You have become a Great Dokkaebi.]

[You can now participate in the Great Dokkaebi's 'Final Ballot'.]

Bihyung looked at the messages and slowly blinked. His appearance had
changed a lot since meeting the Dokkaebi King. He was now in a complete
humanoid figure like Baram, with the white tiger leather draped over his
shoulders and three yellow horns emanating the powers of Story on his
head.

He had now become a full-on 'Great Dokkaebi'.

[I shall be on my way now, Baram-nim.]

[Are you planning to go to them?]

Bihyung didn't reply.
But Baram continued on, anyway. [All Dokkaebis must select their own
final stories when the end of times draws near. Even if they could die
telling that particular story.]

[…]

[The story you're about to select has very low odds of victory.]

[I'm aware.]

[Not only that, they have made enemies of the Bureau and quite a number
of other Great Dokkaebis, too.]

[I'm also aware of that.]

There was no Dokkaebi alive who didn't know what it meant to become
enemies with the Bureau in <Star Stream>.

[Even still, I'd like to see the end of this world with that story.]

Bihyung had chosen his last Story.




"Dokja-ssi."

"Have you come out to enjoy your vacation?"

"Don't be like that. I told you, it's not a vacation but a discharge."

"A real discharge, then?"

"Yes." Lee Hyunsung smiled brightly. "I won't be a soldier anymore."

I observed the silvery Story leaking out from his entire figure. When
reading the opening sentences of some novels, you'd get a certain sense of
what they are like, and Stories were similar in that regard.
⸢That resolute silver hue. The unwavering will, tempered through a lengthy
period of time.⸥

Back in the 'Isle of Reincarnators', the One Invincible Fist Yoo Hoseong
said this – in order to rule over certain Stories, you needed to understand it
first. However, just like how it was impossible to fully understand another
human being, it was also impossible to fully understand a Story.

⸢What we can do instead, is to come up with an interpretation of our own.⸥

In that case, this was the answer Lee Hyunsung had come up with.

[Story, 'Ruler of Steel', has begun its storytelling!]

That was the core Story possessed by the 'Master of Steel'. The fact that he
could finally wield it meant that Lee Hyunsung had reached the last phase
in the [Steel Transformation].

"I didn't get to write a report, but I still understood why you asked me to
read that book, Dokja-ssi," said Lee Hyunsung before reverting to a more
cautious voice. "Was that perhaps the story from the 999th regression turn
world-line?"

I was somewhat surprised. Didn't expect that he'd think that far ahead.

"I believe that might be the case."

"But then, why was that story transformed into ⸢the Wizard of Oz⸥…?"

From my own knowledge base, <Oz>'s founding Story was ⸢the Wizard of
Oz⸥. However, the Story forming its foundation had been altered.
Not only that, to a story from the 999th turn, no less.

I wasn't sure what all this meant yet, but still, I could think of something.
The meaning of altering the basis of a Story was quite clear, after all.
[Sponsor of Incarnation 'Lee Hyunsung' is now looking at you.]

I might have not noticed the faintly altered gaze if it was in the past. It was
not the same aura of the 'Master of Steel' I knew of. I shifted my gaze
towards the Emerald Tower where that altar was located at. And then,
recalled the large steel sword I saw in the audience chamber.

"Hyunsung ahjussi!"

Our companions preparing for the enemy's attacks below the tower rushed
towards us.

"Hyunsung ahjussi! Are you alright?"

Shin Yoosung and Lee Gilyoung jumping around grasped the tall, sturdy
man's hands tightly.

Yoo Joonghyuk arriving a step later muttered out. "Looks like you were
safely discharged."

Both Yoo Sangah and Han Sooyoung decided to chime in, too.

"Congratulations on your discharge."

"If you need your squad leader again, just give me a shout."

The last person to rush in was Jung Heewon, who was getting ready to fend
off the enemy's attacks in the farthest location. She stopped about a dozen
meters or so away, and while her lips twitched, she kept staring in this
direction.

Lee Hyunsung smiled at her. "Heewon-ssi."

I began wondering if I should make my exit from here about now. But the
person who solved that dilemma was a completely unexpected person.
"Hey, you lot! Do your emotional reunion later! It's not over yet, you
know!" Lee Jihye shouted out as she summoned the [Turtle Dragon] in the
air.

She was right. The Nebulas outside the planet hadn't withdrawn their battle
line yet. No, rather than retreating, an even higher number of battleships
were actually showing up now. Among them were dreadnoughts
exclusively designed for destroying planets and inter-Nebula warfare.

"Do not worry. I won't leave them alone." said our trustworthy Lee
Hyunsung as he stepped forward.

For sure, they were still bombarding us on the outside, but <Oz>'s barrier
was holding firm. Like I said before, the strength of Master of Steel's Story
inside <Oz> would almost match a Myth-grade Constellation's…

Chiieeeek…

A rather ominous-sounding noise could be heard coming from somewhere.
A foul smell akin to something burning wafted out.

I raised my head to discover that a side of the opaque barrier was being
ignited in the shower of blinding sparks as if it was being welded open.

Something was melting down Lee Hyunsung's forged steel.

[Constellation, 'Midday Sun', is staring at the planet <Oz>.]

Right then, I sensed Lee Hyunsung's body stiffen up greatly. He had
covered the whole planet for us, so no doubt he was currently fully exposed
to the Status of that gaze. Even if he was almost on the level of a Myth-
grade Constellation, that still didn't mean he was equal to one.

I placed my hand on his shoulder. His trembling lessened a little after
receiving a share of the Nebula's Probability. One shouldn't fight alone just
because he had gotten a little bit stronger. Because we were a Nebula, just
like them.
"…Looks like a real bigshot has personally made an entrance."

I knew of the Modifier of 'Midday Sun'. Now normally, that guy should
never be able to come here.

It was the top Constellation of the Nebula, <Papyrus>. And the meaning of
him coming here personally could only be…

[Constellation, 'Midday Sun', has revealed its intention to <Star Stream>.]

…That he no longer wished to hide their true intentions.

[Nebula <Papyrus>, has revealed their animosity towards Nebula <Kim
Dokja's Company>.]

[Two Nebulas recorded as the candidates for 'One Single Story' are
clashing!]

The expressions of the companions hardened after receiving that
neverbefore-seen message. Something was about to get underway.

[Nebula <Papyrus> has declared inter-Nebula warfare against Nebula <Kim
Dokja's Company>.]

It was exceedingly rare in <Star Stream> for a great Nebula to officially
declare war against another. Because inter-Nebula warfare would never
lead to a good result for all sides involved. There must've been a reason for
them declaring one right now even though they knew the truth.

[Conditions to activate the restricted main scenario has been satisfied!]

[Applicable scenario will be issued only to the Nebulas recorded as the
candidates of 'One Single Story'.]
  <Main Scenario #98 – Candidate Selection War (restricted)>

  Type: Main

  Difficulty: ???

  Clear condition: All Nebulas recorded in the 'One Single Story' can
  now freely engage in inter-Nebula warfare. It's possible to declare war
  without any penalties, and alliances and request for support between
  other Nebulas are now fully allowed.

  Emerging victorious in the Candidate Selection War will ensure that
  you receive <Star Stream>'s attention, and your odds of being selected
  as the 'One Single Story' will improve.

  Time limit: -

  Reward: Increase in the Nebula's profile. Acquisition of Myth-grade
  Story related to inter-Nebula warfare.

  Failure: Reduction in the Nebula's profile. Qualification for the Final
  Scenario rescinded.


…I knew it.

[Currently, your Nebula is in war with <Papyrus>!]

[Please defeat the enemy camp's leader.]

[You will be accredited with victory points if you win the applicable
warfare.]

Visibly-tense companions quickly gathered around me. Hostility
incomparably heavier than any other we felt in the past was enveloping the
whole planet.
[Constellation, 'Demon King of Salvation' is glaring at Nebula <Papyrus>.]

We had fought large Nebulas a couple of times in the past.

Back in <Gigantomachia>, we fought against <Olympus>, and during the
⸢Journey to the West Remake⸥, against <Emperor>.
However, the story this time was completely different.

The restrictions on the Probability during <Gigantomachia> were so great
that Constellations couldn't really exercise their full powers, while during
⸢Journey to the West Remake⸥, the Great Sage Heaven's Equal and the
members of judging panel lent us their powers and their Probability.

So, what about now?

[Story, 'Demon King of Salvation', has begun its storytelling.]

Was there any Nebula that might help us now?

[Giant Story, 'Demon Realm's Spring', has begun its storytelling.]

Companions were now looking at me.

They all looked to have made up their minds. Their eyes were proof that
they knew what was about to happen and where our new battlefield was.

"Let's go."

No one would come to help us.

I looked up at the sky and spoke. "We're not weaklings anymore. Please
open the sky, Hyunsung-ssi."

Lee Hyunsung nodded his head.

[Incarnation 'Jung Heewon' is requesting the activation of 'Hour of
Judgement!]
Jung Heewon unsheathed her sword first. The [Judge's Sword] was
enveloped in the auras of God Slaying.

[Incarnation, 'Lee Hyunsung', has agreed with the judgement.]

Lee Hyunsung's forged steel was placed on top of the companions'
equipment. This was the world's toughest 'oath' to protect his precious
companions.

[Incarnation, 'Lee Jihye', has agreed with the judgement.]

The silver-coloured Story metal settled down on Lee Jihye's [Turtle
Dragon].

[Incarnation, 'Shin Yoosung', has agreed with the judgement.]

[Incarnation, 'Lee Gilyoung', has agreed with the judgement.]

The Chimera Dragon too was dyed in the silvery hue; the monster roared
out and carried the two kids into flight.

[Incarnation, 'Yoo Sangah', has agreed with the judgement.]

Lotus pedestals also reinforced by silver-coloured steel began rotating all
around Yoo Sangah.

[Incarnation, 'Han Sooyoung', has agreed with the judgement.]

Han Sooyoung had unwrapped the bandages off her arm before anyone
noticed it, and tied her hair with the very same bandages.

[Incarnation, 'Yoo Joonghyuk', has agreed with the judgement.]

Yoo Joonghyuk's [Black Heavenly Demon Sword] carrying the Status of a
Transcendent began emitting cold sword light next. And…

[Constellation, 'Demon King of Salvation', has agreed with the judgement.]

And I unsheathed the Unbroken Faith.
['Hour of Judgement' will now activate!]

The moment the pitch-black night sky opened up, we all boarded Lee
Jihye's vessel and leapt towards the heavens above.

The enemy's armada grew closer. We grasped our individual weapons as
we faced off against an armada at least 600 ships strong.

⸢This was the spectacle that Kim Dokja had been longing to see for a very
long time.⸥

Jung Heewon was the first to dash out and her sword attack rained down.
The strongest swordswoman of Chaos that I know of was Jung Heewon the
Judge of Destruction.

Ku-gugugugu!

A dreadnought was penetrated cleanly through from its cockpit right down
to its engine bay, and explosion noises resounded out. Soon, explosions
both large and small erupted out from all over its hull as cracks spreading
all over it. We got to see the Constellations riding on it hurriedly make their
escape.

Not missing that opening, Lee Jihye's [Turtle Dragon] began its violent
assault.

BOOOOOM!

Our vessel broke through the explosions, emerging unscathed. Lee
Hyunsung's Story metal had protected everyone.

Lee Jihye stepped forward. She was the greatest Incarnation there was when
it came to large scale warfare, capable of destroying hundred-plus enemy
ships with only one vessel.

The Naval Admiral Lee Jihye ordered the shelling to commence.

"Ahjussi, we're going, too!"
Following on the cannon fires, Shin Yoosung's [Chimera Dragon] also took
flight, as well.

The leader had to be brought down first to end this warfare. So, as we had a
small number of participants, there was only one choice we could make,
really – an all-out blitzkrieg.

Shin Yoosung the Beast Lord, and Lee Gilyoung the Insect King. Two of
the most complete tamers that I knew of carved out a path for us. [Chimera
Dragon] under Shin Yoosung's control fired the Breath to accurately strike
down mid-sized enemy ships, while Lee Gilyoung's insects crawled through
any open gaps found to deal with dozens of smaller vessels trying to rush in
at us.

"Stop right there!"

Insects crawled into the engines of smaller vessels and caused a series of
huge explosions, thrusting the battlefield into pure chaos instantly.

Perhaps thinking that this couldn't go on anymore, Narrative-grade
Constellations began crawling out from the battleships one by one.

[Incarnation, 'Yoo Sangah', is unleashing her Status!]

[Story, 'Hour of Mandala' is activating!]

The moment Yoo Sangah activated her Story, the movements of the enemy
Constellations slowed down visibly.

That shocked me. I was already aware of her inheriting a portion of
Sakyamuni's powers, but didn't expect her to wield this much of an
authority over it… An ability to control the flow of time itself?

"I can't continue this for long," said Yoo Sangah.

"It won't take that long."
Taking advantage of the time she bought for us, Yoo Joonghyuk, Han
Sooyoung and I ran on the night sky.

[Giant Story, 'Demon Realm's Spring' is continuing on with its
storytelling!]

[Giant Story, 'Torch that Swallowed the Myth' has begun its storytelling!]

The two Giant Stories that protected <Kim Dokja's Company> until now;
we had been using these two as our main attack power so far. The aura of
the Stories stretched on like the tail of a meteor. The space we flew past
was engraved with sparkling stars.

We had already broken past countless battleships, yet hundreds of
Constellations were still blocking our path. If we cowered even for a
moment here, their Status would force us back and crush us to death with
sheer pressure.

[Nebula 'Papyrus' is unleashing the Giant Story's Status!]

And so, this was the fight between two Nebulas.

"It's my turn now."

Originally, the Delusion Demon Kim Namwoon should have been where
Han Sooyoung was now. However, not only had she performed that guy's
role admirably, she had become an existence far surpassing him.

[Giant Story, 'Season of Light and Darkness' has begun its storytelling.]

Finally, our third Giant Story began telling its story, as well. The distant cry
of the Apocalypse Dragon could be heard like an auditory hallucination.
We saw the <Papyrus>'s Constellations that participated in the Great War
of Saints and Demons tremble in fear.

[T-this is…!]

The heavens split into two, one in light and the other in darkness, as ⸢Stage
Transformation⸥ was activated. Han Sooyoung's figure soared higher as she
stepped on the blurred boundary between the light and darkness. The wings
of 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' spread out wide behind her back.

Just like back when she swooped in to rescue me, purple-coloured [Black
Flames] were raging on both of her fists.

Kwa-aaaaaaah!

We rode on the storm of the Story and advanced forward. This was the
overwhelming splendour of a Giant Story that not even the Narrative-grade
Constellations could contend with.

We advanced forward like the Apocalypse Dragon's shockwave. But then, a
gigantic sun stepped in to block us.

[Constellation, 'Midday Sun', is staring at <Kim Dokja's Company>.]

A lone pitch-black figure stood in the center of the blinding ball of light.
That was the Sun God Ra's true body.

[You shall all die here today.]

Yoo Joonghyuk's [Black Heavenly Demon Sword] roared on with a vicious
howl.

Every Story we possessed also howled and roared on. Even if it was just us
two fighting together, facing off against a true Myth-grade Constellation
was still asking a lot.

After all, we were only in the 3rd turn, so… Hang on, 3rd turn?

[Story, 'Hell of Eternity' has begun its storytelling!]

It was like that once upon a time.

['Reading together' has begun.]
Afterimages of pages flipping past entered my eyes. As the hellish
landscape filled up the surroundings, my story began. On the road created
out of countless letters – Yoo Joonghyuk ran on his lengthy lifetime.

⸢The 41st turn's Yoo Joonghyuk threw a spear, and⸥

⸢The 362nd turn's Yoo Joonghyuk extended his sceptre.⸥

⸢The 999th turn's Yoo Joonghyuk wielded his Demon Sword.⸥

Tsu-chuchuchut!

Violent sparks began digging into my body.

[Your Status can't handle your Reading Comprehension!]

For a brief moment during the 'Journey to the West', I managed to read up
to the 1863rd turn. But that was only possible because the Great Sage and
Outer Gods lent me their Probability.

[This is the true myth.]

Even after taking on Yoo Joonghyuk's falling [Breaking the Sky
Swordsmanship], Ra didn't even budge.

[You cannot surpass the true myth.]

The minimum regression turn of Yoo Joonghyuk needed to bring down a
Myth-grade Constellation was 1700th.

I lacked power and lacked in Status. However, I didn't back down. "No, we
can surpass it."

Because we still had one more Story up our sleeve. The fourth Giant Story
we earned by clearing ⸢the Journey to the West Remake⸥.
[Giant Story, 'Liberator of the Forgotten Ones' has begun its storytelling!]
In the next moment, an abundant amount of a Story's Probability permeated
into my entire being. The Story that the Great Sage and Outer Gods worked
together to create was now roiling about over the contexts of my star and
<Kim Dokja's Company>.

[<Star Stream> is greatly surprised by your Status.]

[<Star Stream> is currently reassessing your Status.]

Stinging bloody odour stabbed into my nose. The Tongtian River dyed in
red from the corpses of Outer Gods appeared around us.

The sparks trying to drown me gradually lessened. The pages of the
Hellscape began flipping past once more.

…1321st turn.

…1582nd turn.

…

…

And eventually, 1701st turn.

Yoo Joonghyuk moved, his [Black Heavenly Demon Sword] now loaded
with the power from the 1701st regression turn.

The 'Yoo Joonghyuk' from then that cut the oceans apart, destroyed the sun,
and carved out the Myth-grade Constellation Poseidon's heart, was now
opening his eyes.

⸢And this is the sight Kim Dokja longed to see for a very long time.⸥

We could see Ra freak out and belatedly unleash his own Giant Story. I
stared straight into Ra's eyes. That bastard's lips were mouthing, "But,
how?" I laughed.
"What do you mean, how?"

In order to kill a Myth-grade Constellation, you needed a power that
equalled one.

The Myth-grade Constellation – existences that started their 'One Single
Story' and had earned their 'Conclusion', or compiled their own incredible
Giant Stories and reached the cusps of their 'Conclusion' that way.

[Absolute majority of Constellations are greatly shocked by your Status!]

[Your Status has caused the Constellations from great Nebulas to…!]

Just like me right now, in other words.


[<Star Stream> has announced your new Status.]

[Your Status is Myth-grade.]

A stupendous boom resounded out as Yoo Joonghyuk's [Black Heavenly
Demon Sword] cut Ra's sun down.
        Chapter 466: Ep. 88 - Myth-grade Constellation, IV


[A large number of Nebulas are freaking out at your Status!]

[Portion of Nebulas are freaking out at the sudden appearance of a new
Myth-grade Constellation!]

[Portion of Constellations are requesting the ⸢Probability Suitability
Evaluation⸥ to the 'Bureau'!]
Tsu-chuchuchut!

[Requests for the Probability Suitability Evaluation have been denied.]

[<Bureau> cannot interfere at will during the applicable scenario.]

The spectacle of the blinding sunlight crumbling down – I couldn't even
breathe properly as I focused solely on the battle itself. Ra's torso, cut by
[Black Heavenly Demon Sword], began emitting bright light.

Ku-gugugugu!
Accompanied by an intense storm of heat, our vision was clouded by thick
steam. A ploy to buy time, no doubt.

"Yoo Joonghyuk! Don't stop!"

I shouted out and desperately continued to read the Story.

[Story, 'Hell of Eternity', is continuing on with its storytelling!]

[Story, 'Life and Death Companions', is amplifying the effects of other
Stories!]

I recalled the 1701st regression turn of Yoo Joonghyuk that I read in the
past. Yoo Joonghyuk had fought against Poseidon one on one in that turn.

⸢On the border where the ocean's boundaries meet, Iron Blood Supreme
King unsheathed his sword.⸥

⸢"Poseidon. Today, you shall die."⸥

⸢A life that carried on for 1700 lifetimes. The swordsmanship borne out of
this life now shone brilliantly.⸥
Yoo Joonghyuk's blade moved as if to recreate that very battle. His sword
gradually became faster and faster to utterly destroy Ra's sun.

[Constellation, 'Midday Sun', is enraged from the pain!] Kwa-

gagagagaga!!

Yoo Joonghyuk's blade continued to dance on the stage I read into reality.
An incredible storm of Probability's aftermath tried to crush me, but four
Giant Stories responded to each other and allowed me to endure the
aftereffects.

I still tasted iron in my mouth, though. My Incarnation Body was failing to
cope with the sudden, abrupt increase in my Status.
[Nebula, <Vedas>, is observing your battlefield.]

[Nebula, <Tamna>, is observing your battlefield.]

[Nebula, <Olympus>, is observing your battlefield.]

[Nebula, <Asgard>, is observing your battlefield.]

Look all you want.

This battle was meant for all of you to see, anyway.

[Channel's indirect message restriction has been lifted!]

Even now, many Constellations would still be dismissive of our strength.
They were probably thinking that we reached this far because of our luck
and perhaps due to other Constellations lending their aid to us.

[A large number of additional Constellations are entering the channel!]

[Absolute majority of Constellations are observing your battle!]

However, this was now time to prove ourselves.

[Giant Story, 'Season of Light and Darkness', roaring out!]

Time to prove that <Kim Dokja's Company> was not some poor sobs
needing your sponsorships but your actual competitors, and that we were a
Nebula capable of bringing down a large Nebula with our own powers.

Kwa-dududuk!!

Yoo Joonghyuk's sword slashes continued to corner Ra. The sunlight falling
away made noises similar to actual flesh being ripped apart.

It was then, I sensed a sharp glare coming from the empty air.

[Great Dokkaebi, 'Noksu', is glaring at you.]
Great Dokkaebi Noksu – not even a mid or low-grade, but a 'Great'
Dokkaebi. For someone like that, making the scenario rather inconvenient
for us wouldn't be that difficult. However, even they couldn't intervene
carelessly in the 98th scenario.

Tsu-chuchuchut…

Because the scenarios from now on would be of utmost importance to the
Great Dokkaebis, as well.

[Great Dokkaebi and the Nebula are participating in the applicable scenario
together.]

[All Dokkaebis can select the 'candidate' and its story they wish to tell.]

[Great Dokkaebi 'Noksu' has currently selected <Papyrus>.]

I recalled the moment when Great Dokkaebis Heoju and Heoche came to
see us just before the climax of the 'Great War of Saints and Demons' got
underway. Back then, those Dokkaebis said this:

⸢You must decide now. Die in this place, or head off to the Final Scenario
with us.⸥
Those words were suggestions meant for this very moment.

Great Dokkaebis facing the end times must risk their reputation, their
insight, and their own Stories to select the candidates for the 'One Final
Story'. And that bastard named Noksu must've chosen <Papyrus> as its
candidate.

[According to the legend, there are three suns in <Papyrus>.]

I spoke in true voice as Yoo Joonghyuk's Incarnation body moved again.

With the speed faster than anyone in this universe, he swung his sword
filled with the eternity's curse. Sharp strikes from the [Black Heavenly
Demon Sword] dug deeply into Ra's skin. The deity's temperature, reputed
to be capable of melting any metal, was being ably resisted by Lee
Hyunsung's Story metal.

With a loud rupture, Ra's heart spewed out a Story. That noble and lofty
Myth-grade Constellation was being destroyed by our hands.

[If you were really planning to cut us down, then you should've descended
with all of your selves first.]

The Myth-grade Constellation, Ra. A Constellation who had reached his
own 'Conclusion', and had been hibernating within the Final Scenario's
stage for a very long time.

[You think that someone like you, stuck inside a freezer until now, can win
against us with just a single sun?]

[Constellation, 'Midday Sun', is screaming in pain!]

[Constellation, 'Midday Sun', is urgently scanning his vicinity!]

[Just how long will you sit back and watch?!]

Ra's shouting caused the stars of the sky to sparkle.

[Vedas! Olympus! Did you not all agree to participate together?!]

…What?!

At the end of those words, ominous auras began rushing in from the
distance.

The skies thrashed about and the sounds of crashing waves could be heard.
The middle of pitch-black sky split up and an enormous current of water
flooded out.

We quickly moved out of the way and dodged the waves of that Status.

[Someone has announced his support to the Nebula, <Papyrus>.]
[Someone is incarnating into the scenario!]

It was a possessor of a Status powerful enough to send shivers down my
spine. Someone who could equal Ra before us was now descending into
this world.

[How pathetic, 'Ra'. Did you not declare that you alone would be sufficient
for this matter?]

A voice reminding me of violent tidal waves resounded out. Quite
surprisingly, the existence that descended to this place was the very enemy
Yoo Joonghyuk of the 1701st turn fought off desperately.

[Constellation, 'the Spear that draws the Boundaries of the Oceans' is
incarnating to this scenario!]

Accompanying Poseidon's entrance were the stars of the heavens rushing in
like storm clouds. They were Narrative-grade Constellations from <Vedas>
and <Lokapala>. To make matters worse, among them were individuals
known to be almost on the level of Myth-grade Constellations, as well.

[Nebula, <Tamna>, is condemning <Vedas>'s intervention!]

[Nebula, <Hongik>, is condemning <Olympus>'s intervention!]

Condemnation rained down. Completely not caring about that, Poseidon
simply pointed his trident, 'Triaina', in our direction. [How dare measly
beings such as yourselves try to witness the end of this <Star Stream>?]

The end of <Star Stream>, the epilogue that determined the conclusion of
all the worlds. Right, I had been waiting for a long time to witness it.

That was true.

[I don't simply wish to see the 'end', actually.]

In all honesty, what I really wanted to see was…
"Ahjussi!"

My companions had gathered around me even before I had noticed it – Jung
Heewon, Yoo Sangah, Lee Jihye, Lee Hyunsung, Lee Gilyoung, and Shin
Yoosung.

The Stories we had created together were shining brightly in the empty
night sky. I saw the trajectory of the Stories we've used beyond the galaxy
in the far distance.

No matter how wide and expansive this universe was, I was confident of
locating that very set of constellations regardless of where I was.

[Story, 'Demon King of Salvation', is shining brightly.]

[Story, 'King of a Kingless World', is shining brightly.]

[Giant Story, 'Torch that Swallowed the Myth', is shining brightly.]

I hid all signs of emotions welling up in my heart and looked at my
companions.

⸢That was where the Story he longed for could be found.⸥

Poseidon emitting powerful Status extended his hand towards us. [What
a noisy little full stop you are. Now, disappear.] <Vedas>'s army rushed
in.

My companions tensed up and gathered around me. I addressed them. [I
love the Story I managed to create with all of you. Although we
encountered many painful, sad things, we…]

Even then, I loved this story so much so that I wished for it to continue on
forever.

"…That's not your final wish, now is it?"
Jung Heewon asked after seeing my expression. She probably sensed
something ominous from it.

I simply smiled back at her before staring at the empty skies beyond the
Nebula's army rushing in at us.

My mother once told me this. A person who watched a certain story for a
long time would eventually grow to resemble that story.

Perhaps that logic also applied to these stars, too.

[Die!]

Just before the tsunami wave of <Vedas>'s army pounced on us, though…

[Constellation, 'Demon-like Judge of Fire', is incarnating into the scenario!]

The night sky split up and the waterfall made out of hellish flames flooded
out. A lone Constellation riding on the fiery waves started massacring other
Constellations with her sword burning in flames.

The Archangel that I liked the best was right there.

[■ck you! You ■cking bastards!]

The true voices of Constellations freaking out could be heard over that
torrent of expletives.

[…But, how?! You were definitely…!]

[■ck, man! I'm Uriel! You think you can kill me with such measly little
numbers??]

Right after her, purple-coloured intense flames burned the heavens.

[Constellation, 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon', is incarnating into the
scenario!]
[…Kekeke, to think you'd make me use both of my hands. You did well,
<Papyrus>.]

The wings of a massive flying dragon tore and crushed through the
Constellations.

<Vedas>'s battleships took aim at the Black Flame Dragon and got ready to
fire. And in the following moment, dozens of vessels began exploding one
after another along with loud booms.

One could spy the golden-coloured Ruyi Jingu Bang flitting in between the
explosions.

[You're really making it so annoying, aren't you.]

Once the smoke cleared, a platinum-haired man could be seen standing
there, digging his ear as if he was quite bored right now.

[Constellation, 'Most Ancient Liberator', is incarnating into the scenario!]

Uriel, Black Flame Dragon, and the Great Sage, Heaven's Equal. These
three's entrance caused unrest to spread out.

[…Great Sage! What is the meaning of this??]

[This is inter-Nebula warfare! Do you understand what you're trying to
do…!]

Even before the enraged true voices of the Constellations could finish,
someone else announced their support to our cause. [Just like you, we
also have a Story we wish to support, that's all.] I knew whose voice that
was.

Pitch-black yet gentle darkness wrapped around us, and a loving hand
touched my shoulder.
[Constellation, 'Queen of the Darkest Spring', is incarnating into the
scenario!]

And if she was here, then that meant…

[Constellation, 'Father of the Rich Night', is incarnating into the scenario!]

The King of Underworld's cold eyes scanned the battlefield. Here he was,
the grim reaper of death capable of making all the stars shiver in fear.

First, it was the Great Sage, and now, the King of Underworld, too – the
constant appearances of Myth-grade Constellations caused the enemy
Constellations to hesitate and retreat.

[Nebula <Underworld> is supporting <Kim Dokja's Company>.]

The two camps emitted powerful Statuses and confronted each other as if to
goad the other side to attack first. I could see the crumpled expressions of
Poseidon and Ra in the distance. And how long went by like this?
Constellations from one camp began retreating without saying anything.

[Constellation, 'Spear that Draws the Boundaries of the Oceans' is exiting
from this scenario.]

The enemy Constellations began disappearing one by one. Their rate of exit
grew faster now that a Myth-grade Constellation they placed so much faith
in had left the scene. The panicking <Papyrus>'s Constellations looked
around in confusion all the while cautiously studying Ra's reaction. And
eventually…

[Nebula <Papyrus> has announced the withdrawal of its Constellations.]

Not too long after, only the half-crushed sun remained. Ra gritted its teeth
noisily and glared at us, but before long, the sounds of a star scattering
away could be heard.

[Constellation, 'Midday Sun', is exiting from the scenario.]
The glow of setting sun filled the sky and the bright ball of fire disappeared
below the horizon. Finally, this scenario's victors had been decided.

⸢And this is the sight Kim Dokja longed to see for a very long time.⸥

Within the sunset's soft glow, I looked back to my companions.

⸢Some things didn't work out as he had been hoping.⸥

While staring at the disappearing sunlight, Yoo Joonghyuk was still
gripping the [Black Heavenly Demon Sword] tightly.

⸢Meanwhile, some things went better than he expected.⸥

Han Sooyoung, her lips twitching slightly, hurriedly wrapped the bandages
around her arm while going, "Ouch, ouch, ouch!"

⸢There were moments where they got lucky irrelevant of their intentions.⸥

Yoo Sangah sighed gently and smiled back at me.

⸢However, all those events came together to create this very moment in
time.⸥
[Nebula <Kim Dokja's Company> has won the inter-Nebula warfare!]

[Reward payout is being prepared.]

Both the companions and I didn't say anything.

This wasn't our first victory, but in a certain sense, it was indeed our first
victory. For a long time there, we didn't say a word and stared at each
other's faces.

We won.

We really emerged victorious against another 'Nebula'.
[Great Dokkaebi 'Heoju' is gasping after seeing your Story.]

[Great Dokkaebi 'Garang' wishes to vote for your Story.]

[Great Dokkaebi 'Haesol' wishes to…]

Only the system messages floated up in the empty air now.

[Great Dokkaebi 'Bihyung' has voted for your Story.]

[Mid-rank Dokkaebi 'Biyoo' likes your story very much.]

I watched the shadows of two Dokkaebis cast by the setting sun and began
thinking to myself.

We were almost there.

I turned my head towards the companions once more. I wanted to say
something to them while looking at them. But, they all carried expressions
of already knowing what I wanted to say.

Jung Heewon spoke up instead of me. "Let's go and witness the
conclusion of this world. Together."

I nodded my head.
             Chapter 467: Ep. 89 - Great Apocalypse, I


[Your ■■ is getting nearer.]

The system message whispered in my ear. It had been repeating itself over
and over again for the past few days.

"It seems that it won't be long now."

"Yes."

My mother and I were sitting face to face over a table, drinking tea
together. We were watching the display panel installed in the [Industrial
Complex]'s reception room.

– The American continent, annihilated! What's the next target for these
Outer Gods?

– Emergency evacuation order issued in North-East Asia!

– Nebulas have abandoned Earth. "There is no place left to run."
The last place the news program showed was the Korean Peninsula.
Refugees streaming in from all over the world ensured that the whole
peninsula was bucking raucously even now.

I was well aware of what they were hoping for by coming here.

[Next Great Apocalypse scenario location is 'North-East Asia'.]

[6 days, 8 hours and 24 minutes remaining until the start of the Great
Apocalypse scenario.]

My mother inside the panel was making an announcement in my stead as
the representative of the [Industrial Complex].

– The [Industrial Complex] won't stop accepting new citizens. However…

My mother smiled bitterly and spoke. "It's quite embarrassing to watch,
isn't
it."

"But, it suits you well. You're like the President, actually."

In all honesty, it was fine to think of my mother as the current master of the
[Industrial Complex], not me. The citizens of this place would rather listen
to her more than me, at any rate.

"You should show your face to Seoul's residents at least once before
leaving, son. Even a simple greeting from you will become a great source
of strength to them."

For sure, I could hear the reporters using megaphones to shout their
questions from outside the [Industrial Complex].

– Demon King of Salvation-nim!! Is it true that you have returned?

– Demon King of Salvation-nim! Please tell us your plan to stop
theApocalypse!
…My plan, is it.

I smiled bitterly just like my mother. "If that's the duty of the mascot, then
well."

We quietly sipped the tea.

The skies were dark and gloomy. So gloomy, in fact, it'd not be strange to
see a thunderbolt fall from the sky out of the blue and shatter the Peninsula
in half.

"It's so peacefully, isn't it?"

"I guess so, mother."

Even so, we said those things.

The tea leaf inside the cup gently trembled. To think, I'd enjoy such a
leisurely tea time. This would be the first time in our 30-something years of
relationship as a mother and son.

The event I so wanted to experience only came knocking on my doorstep as
the apocalypse of everything approached us.

My mother, she didn't ask me anything. Not a thing about what I would do
from now on, what I would gain at the end of this story, nothing. I knew
that was how she operated, though.

"Well, I'll be on my way now."

"The Heavenly Wind God was searching for you. Before you embark,
please do make sure to speak to him first."

…Pungbaek? Why was he looking for me this time?

I couldn't help but recall that unpleasant incident back in the Great War of
Saints and Demons. Was he thinking of doing something uncouth again just
before the Final Scenario? I lightly nodded my head and exited the room.
There was someone waiting for me there.

[And here we are. You somehow managed to get this far, Kim Dokja.]

It was none other than Bihyung, looking so much better than before after
becoming a Great Dokkaebi. The long coat fashioned out of a white tiger's
fur really suited him well.

I spoke in a sarcastic tone of voice. "You were actually waiting for me?"

[The reunion of you and your mother is a pretty popular Story among
your subscribers. So, I just couldn't bear to interrupt the flow.] Bihyung
shrugged his shoulders and spoke up.

[Constellation, 'Demon-like Judge of Fire', is dabbing her eyes away.]

[Constellation, 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon', is grumbling while handing
over a handkerchief.]

This damn guy, sending that out as another broadcast.

[And so. The Final Scenario is literally just around the corner.]

"I know."

[How reliable you are. I'm sure you already know this, but the Final
Scenario is…]

"Bihyung."

My quiet call stopped the Dokkaebi from talking anymore. He stared at me.

"Why did you select us?"

A faint ripple spread within Bihyung's eyes.

I already knew what was written on the scenario window that popped up
before his eyes.
 <Main Scenario #98 – Candidate Ballot>

 Type: Main

 Difficulty: ???

 Clear condition: Please choose the final candidate for the 'One Single
 Story'.

 Time limit: -

 Reward: ???

 Failure: Death

<Star Stream>'s scenarios didn't only apply to Constellations and
Incarnations, but to the storytellers like Dokkaebies, too. And the
'Candidate Ballot' that would decide the end of all scenarios was an
incredibly important scenario for all Dokkaebis. It was a scenario where
they had to bet their own existence.

And in such a scenario, Bihyung had chosen us.

[Great Dokkaebi 'Bihyung' has currently cast his vote with <Kim Dokja's
Company>.]

When I first met this guy, he was no bigger than a soccer ball.

He was a true Dokkaebi who indiscriminately massacred people for the
sake of increasing the number of subscribers in the channel, and he
massproduced horrifying scenarios on the fly.

That very Dokkaebi who grew up by devouring the Stories we created had
eventually morphed into a human-like being. He was as tall as a human, he
wore clothes like a human, and he was making expressions of a human, too.

That very Dokkaebi, he was looking at me on a similar eye level as he
spoke up.
[Sign the contract with me. I shall make you the next Dokkaebi King.]

"…?"

[That's what you said to me inside that fish-dragon's mouth.]

Indeed, I did say something like that in the past. "Hang on, could it be that
you selected us while believing in that rubbish? There are very low odds of
us winning, you know."

[It's not like that anymore. I see that you still have no idea how big of a deal
what you did was.]

Bihyung shifted his gaze outside the window.

The plaza of the [Industrial Complex] was filled with the Constellations
that fought with us in the battle against Papyrus.

The Black Flame Dragon got subdued by Uriel and was currently acting as
her cushion. Persephone and Hades were quietly sipping tea on a prepared
table. The Great Sage, meanwhile, had borrowed a pipe-like cigarette from
the Breaking the Sky Sword Saint and was busy puffing away.

They were watching the Star Stream broadcasts unfolding in real-time.

– A brand new list naming '12 Nebulas' are making rounds among
thegossipers of <Star Stream>…

– A portion of Narrative-grade Constellations estimate that <Kim
Dokja'sCompany> could very well be the 3rd strongest…

…Third strongest, was it. It seemed that the ripples from the last battle were
larger than I thought. I was thankful for the generous assessment, but it was
still too early to let our guard down. Because the war for the Candidate
Ballot hadn't ended yet.

However, Bihyung's thoughts seemed to be a bit different from mine.
[I think it'll be fine for a little while. It's been two days since you defeated
<Papyrus>. Did any other Nebula request <Kim Dokja's Company> for
inter-Nebula warfare since then?]

"…No. No one."

[A Nebula that achieves a big win during the Candidate Ballot battles will
enjoy much higher odds of being selected as the 'One Single Story'.]

Just like how one battle helped up climb up to the 'third strongest' position,
other Nebulas could also participate in the inter-Nebula warfare and alter
the rankings. So, messages of declarations of war or announcements of one
soon to take place should be raining down on us by now.

However, forget about a declaration, not a single Nebula tried to provoke
us. The planet Earth was surprisingly peaceful.

"But, why? It's not as if our Story is that shocking, now was it?"

[That's because you're going to be annihilated even if they leave you alone.
That's why.]

I felt my heart cool down in an instant. I could see the footage playing on
the Constellations' panels.

[Constellations know that you simply can't forsake Earth.]

Separate from the 'Candidate Ballot battles', Earth had entered the Great
Apocalypse sequence. The North American continent was already no more,
and next up was North-east Asia.

Back in the original story's Final Scenario, Outer Gods and the rulers of
other worlds also began invading this world.

[The ascension of the forgotten islands are still ongoing!]

⸢At the end of the world-line, the corrosion of the forgotten beings will
begin.⸥
According to the original storyline, Nebulas and I should've been fighting
together here. But now, they had made a different decision. They gave up
on Earth, and to eliminate <Kim Dokja's Company>. That was the decision
made by the Nebulas facing the 'Final Scenario'.

"Those sons of bitches…"

[A portion of Nebulas are mocking your decision.]

You could say that this was the worst possible situation.

To make matters worse, the Outer Gods flooding into this world were
different from the ones that I knew of from the original storyline.

I recalled Uriel from the 999th regression turn I met in the N'Gai's Forest
some time ago.

⸢Once the Great Apocalypse scenario begins, the attacks from the Kings
will commence.⸥
If my predictions were correct, then the Kings showing up for the Great
Apocalypse soon to get underway should be the existences that witnessed
the 'Conclusion' during the 999th regression turn. And <Kim Dokja's
Company> needed to fight against them.

"Who summoned the Kings? Was it your people from the Bureau?"

[I can't reveal any information to you. Except that…] Bihyung formed an
expression showing his firm resolve and finished what he wanted to say.
[Until the moment I breathe my last, I shall tell my story with you.]




"If you don't wish to participate, it's fine to leave now."

Funnily enough, this was the first thing I said to my companions.
"The next scenario is incomparably horrifying than any other battles we've
been through so far. It's not too late. If any of you wish to leave the Nebula,
then…"

A couple of them began yawning as if they were listening to a boring
Sunday mass. But, that was obvious. These people right before my eyes had
survived dozens of life-threatening events together to get this far. To them,
there was no difference to dying in this or that event. If they want to leave,
they would've done so already. I too knew this.

Even then, the reason why I had to ask the obvious question was…

"Excuse me."

…Because there was someone who did want to leave for real.

"I'd like to sit out this one."

And it was none other than Han Myungoh. It wasn't as if I didn't expect
this.

He carried on. "I'm not saying I'll completely leave the Nebula. However,
there is a place I wish to visit for one last time."

Lee Jihye next to him retorted unhappily. "Eh-whew, ahjussi, why don't you
just leave? You aren't much of a help, anyway. You'll just run away like
your ass is on fire once the fighting starts, right?"

"…I might be like this, but back in my heyday when I was a Count in the
Demon Realm…"

Originally, the words 'Demon Realm' and 'Count' in that sentence should've
been replaced by 'Mino Soft Director'.

Watching them go back and forth brought about a wry grin on my face.
Actually, I knew where Han Myungoh wished to go.
"Are you thinking of going to where the 'Isle of Reincarnators' used to be?"

My question caused Han Myungoh's expression to harden visibly.


I carried on. "Even if the area's been sealed, the aftereffects of the
Apocalypse Dragon and 'Indescribable Distance' still linger there. That
place will still be considerably dangerous."

"Even then, I'd like to go and take a look."

The Isle of Reincarnators, where the Great War of Saints and Demons took
place. Even now, corpses of dead stars and Outer Gods should be floating
around aimlessly near the vicinity of the dark dimension. Those beings that
failed to get on the Ark and got killed in the process.

…Perhaps the Demon King 'Asmodeus' was among them.

"That child is everything I've earned in this world."

The light of determination shone within Han Myungoh's eyes.

Post-Great War, he diligently participated in the main scenarios with us. He
was working incomparably harder than back when he used to steal certain
projects away from his subordinates for the sake of advancing his career.

And he got to taste the fruit of his labour, too – although small, he still
earned a share of a Giant Story, and even acquired several useful Star
Relics in the process, too.

All of that was to help him search for his daughter.

The current him might be able to withstand the chaos's aftereffects lingering
around Isle of Reincarnator for a few days.

"Please, be careful out there."

Han Myungoh nodded his head, finished his preparations, and stood up.
Looked to me he had already made up his mind before coming here.
Companions all bade him good luck.

Not receiving the 'One Single Story' scenario didn't automatically mean
there would be no 'One Single Story' – it existed for everyone. Just like how
anyone could embark on a journey to search for their own ■■.

I watched him tremble in fear as he stepped foot inside the portal and began
thinking about something.

[Your ■■ is getting nearer.]

It wasn't <Star Stream> that decided where your 'Conclusion' might be.

I looked back to discover that my companions were waiting for me.

"I shall continue with the meeting."




[11 hours and 8 minutes until the start of the Great Apocalypse scenario.]

Only about half a day remained before the Great Apocalypse. If we
managed to withstand this apocalyptic event, we'd be able to enter the Final
Scenario.

In the meantime, I went through all the information in the original story,
and requested for the acquisition of every useful remaining Star Relic and
skill found not just in the Korean Peninsula, but the rest of the planet as
well. Companions easily okayed my request.

Han Sooyoung asked. "And what will you do?"

Of course, I too had something to do. For instance, thinking up of a new
sure-kill technique with this uptight dude.
"You fool must surely know this by now. There is only one way for us to
fight against the Great Apocalypse," said Yoo Joonghyuk, while polishing
the edges of the [Black Heavenly Demon Sword].

Uriel, the Black Flame Dragon, the Great Sage and other Constellations
promised to lend us their aid, but we couldn't rely on them all the time.

Even after excluding the 'Secretive Plotter', there were four more King-level
Outer Gods still to appear. If all of them decided to attack simultaneously,
then we wouldn't be able to win even if the Myth-grade Constellations such
as the Great Sage and the King of Underworld were with us.

However, we did have one method we could use to fight back.

The ⸢Hell of Eternity.⸥

The reward of the 1863rd regression turn, the Myth-grade Story I earned
through the 'Secretive Plotter'. With this Story, I could recreate Yoo
Joonghyuk's memories, and he could rouse up the powers of the 1863rd
turn and use it by sharing that stage of memories with me.

The only problem was…

[Reading has failed!]

[The highest Yoo Joonghyuk's regression turn you can read currently is
'978th'.]

[Story, 'Hell of Eternity', is looking at you with criticising eyes.]

…Something had gone wrong with my reading ability.

[Reading has failed!]

[The highest Yoo Joonghyuk's regression turn you can read currently is
'778th'.]
[Story, 'Hell of Eternity', is wondering if you have dyslexia.]

And now, even the Story was beginning to mock me.

This thing continued on for several days now, and Yoo Joonghyuk, unable
to hold it back anymore, finally blew his top. "How pathetic. Did you not
say you've been reading books for all your life?"

"…It's not all my life, you know. In any case, this is a different sort of
problem."

I also had no idea. Why was this happening only now?

"If this problem persists, you better hand over the Story to me. It'll be
simpler if I use it myself."

"I'd have given you already if only I could."

I had already asked the 'Secretive Plotter' about it. He simply ignored me,
though.

"In that case, use that possession skill from the last time. Use that, then
activate the Story. The rate of assimilation goes higher if you do."

He must've been talking about the [Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint] here.

"I'd like not to rely on that if I can."

For sure, activating [Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint] would make using the
Story so much simpler. That skill's effect was similar to a Sponsor taking
over the control of an Incarnation. However…

"Using that skill leaves my Incarnation body defenseless. So, it's for the
best to win without resorting to it if possible."

"How laughable. This is the result of neglecting your training every day."

"…Do you honestly think everyone can train to a ridiculous degree like
you?"
Yoo Joonghyuk glared at me for a short while before focusing on the Story
once more without saying anything else.

He probably already knew the truth – that the reason for my unwillingness
to rely on [Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint] was actually something else.

⸢For a while now, [Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint] stopped listening to
Kim Dokja's commands.⸥

Not only that, the skill would activate when I least wanted it to and start
reading people's minds. I wasn't sure why such a thing was happening.

It was possible that I got too used to looking inside someone's head. I had
gotten too used to reading nicely-laid out sentences of their inner thoughts
rather than listening to their actual words.

[Reading has failed.]

Maybe, me suddenly developing an inability to read was an obvious
consequence.

"Focus properly, Kim Dokja."

I reactivated the Story after hearing Yoo Joonghyuk's rebuke. I slowed
down my breathing and collected my thoughts.

[Story, 'Hell of Eternity', has begun its storytelling!] I

should forget about all the info I knew on Yoo Joonghyuk.

I knew nothing about him.

This guy, he was a complete stranger to me.

Yoo Joonghyuk was not some crazed psychopath, nor was he an
impregnable stubborn idiot, either.
When I thought like that, it felt as if the inside of my head was clearing up
just a little.

Right, I should start from there. Just like back at that moment when I read
the 'Ways of Survival' for the first time.

Tsu-chuchuchut!

It was right then that something strange occurred.

[A problem has occurred during your reading attempt!]

Suddenly, Yoo Joonghyuk's complexion paled greatly. "Kim Dokja! You
fool, what have you…!"

Those were his last words, as the light disappeared from within his eyes.

I was taken by surprise and hurriedly asked him. "Hey, are you

alright??" There was no answer.

[Character 'Yoo Joonghyuk's' egos are colliding!]

Egos were… colliding??

Growing even more urgent now, I tried to confirm his current status, but
then…

['Character List' has failed to activate.]

The text that appeared afterwards was a sentence that I heard quite a long
time ago.

[Applicable individual is not a 'Character'.]
             Chapter 468: Ep. 89 - Great Apocalypse, II


The unconscious Yoo Joonghyuk didn't want to wake up even after four
hours passed by.

"Hey, you crazy idiot! Wake up!"

Han Sooyoung and I took turns slapping his cheeks. Unfortunately, he still
showed no signs of waking up at all.

Slap! Slap! Slap! Slap!!

Also, his damn cheeks were so hard that even the concerted slapping from
both of us failed to puff them up. Our palms went numb from pain, instead.

Han Sooyoung spoke in a genuinely impressed tone of voice. "You know,
this is kind of fun?"

"…This is no time to crack jokes like that."

[5 hours and 12 minutes remaining until the start of the Great Apocalypse
Scenario.]
We really didn't have much time left. Soon, the 'Great Apocalypse' will
commence, and the Outer Gods would start invading us due to the
expanding Probability.

But now, Yoo Joonghyuk was in this state.

I couldn't even begin to guess what went wrong where. Was this related to
my [Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint] somehow?

['Character List' has failed to activate.]

[Applicable individual is not a 'Character'.]

I tried using [Character List] one more time, but the resulting message was
the same.

There were a lot of 'Yoo Joonghyuks' in this universe, but that message
only ever appeared with just one. That Yoo Joonghyuk of the 1863rd
regression turn, disappearing towards his own story…

When I got that far, I began thinking of something. But… could it really
be?

Lee Seolhwa watching on from the side asked a question. "Should we feed
him the [Life and Death Pill]?"

Not too long ago, she finally managed to perfect the ultimate recovery
medicine, the [Life and Death Pill]. This elixir could apparently cure any
and all fatal wounds when ingested.

"Have you already reached the level of mass-producing it?"

"No, not yet. I was only able to concoct a few. Didn't have enough
ingredients…"
I could only sigh. Since we didn't know what might happen, we
couldn't afford to carelessly waste the [Life and Death Pill]. [Character
'Yoo Joonghyuk's' egos are colliding!]

On top of that, we weren't sure if the problem of one's ego could be solved
by the [Life and Death Pill], either. It was then, a slight vibration
reverberated throughout the Industrial Complex.

"Dokja-ssi, we've detected movement."

Lee Hyunsung opened the sick bay's door and hurriedly entered.

Han Sooyoung and I looked at each other at the same time. I urgently
switched the display panel on and the Pacific Ocean's situation soon filled it
up.

Ku-gugugugu!

The wave that swallowed up the American continent revealed itself once
more. Transparent dome walls had stopped the wave, and it was steadily
increasing its water level, instead.

The Probability was still restricting it, that was why.

Tsu-chuchuchuchut!

However, that Probability's wall was being pushed back bit by bit. The
border that crossed the vast Pacific was gradually widening its diameter.
We could also see the 'Outer Gods' wiggling about in between the rising
waves.

In five hours' time, that border would reach the Korean Peninsula, and this
land would disappear from the face of this Earth.

"…Kim Dokja. A plan?"
"I do have one," said I, before glancing at the unconscious Yoo Joonghyuk
and adding something else. "Although, it looks like I'll have modify it a bit
now."

"Stop making me worried, alright? How did that thing get stopped back in
the original storyline?"

"Nebulas all desperately fought together. Most of the Constellations were
ground down to fine dust trying to stop that."

"Where are those oh-so-mighty Constellations, then?"

"What do you mean, where?"

[Many Constellations are watching your judgement.]

Most likely, they were busy spectating on our apocalypse.

[Constellation, 'Demon-like Judge of Fire', is criticising other
Constellations, asking them if the ideals of righteousness in <Star Stream>
have all withered away.]

[Constellation, 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon', is crossing his arms and
shaking his head.]

[Constellation, 'Most Ancient Liberator', finds the Constellations of the
large Nebulas quite pathetic.]

Even though Constellations from our side provoked them, they remained
composed in their replies.

[A portion of Constellations argue that all of this was brought upon by
<Kim Dokja's Company> themselves.]

Some of them even began arguing that it was our fault, too.

[A small number of Constellations argues that it's <Kim Dokja's Company>
that stole away their shares first.]
Now normally, such an argument was utter drivel with no leg to stand on,
but for some reason, my mind remained calm even after hearing them.
Because I roughly knew why they were acting like this.

Back when we went to visit <Oz>, the monkey told me this.

– Many Stories that constitute Giant Stories have all entered the path of
stagnation similar to <Oz>'s situation. A certain Story that has appeared in
recent times have begun eating into the percentages of other Stories, you
see… I'm talking about you people's Story.

Originally, the main actors leading this stage should've been the Nebulas
that had been compiling their myths for a long time. However, several of
them either lost the important Stories to us or got destroyed in the process.
In the midst of all this, <Star Stream> even decided to grandly label us as
the 'third strongest' Nebula, so the sense of deprivation the existing stars felt
must've been indescribable.

…Of course, it didn't mean that what these stars were doing right now was
correct or justified.

Han Sooyoung chewing on her nails asked. "Isn't it better to give up on
Earth? How about we come up with the way to reach the 'Final Scenario'
with everyone, instead…?"

"You know that's not going to happen."

Only the ones permitted could reach the Final Scenario.

Even if everyone on Earth was inducted into <Kim Dokja's Company>, the
aftermath of the Probability's storm caused by the nonsensical scenario
jump would ensure our complete destruction.

"Goddammit."

I could sense [Predictive Plagiarism] spinning its gears vigorously inside
her head.
"You said that these Outer God Kings are beings from the 999th turn. How
many are there, anyway?"

"From what I know, there are four excluding the 'Secretive Plotter'."

"…Are we going to fight all four of them at the same time??"

I shook my head and recalled the list of the 'Outer God Kings' I memorised
back then.

⸢The 'Living Flame' that rises up from the east.⸥

⸢The 'Master of the Sunken Island', the calamity of the world in the west.⸥

⸢The 'Monarch of the Great Abyss', the ruler of the northern universe.⸥

⸢The 'King of the Silver Heart', the ruler of the interstellar space in the
south.⸥
The beings that became the 'Outer God Kings' after witnessing the
'Conclusion' of the 999th regression turn.

However, Even if this was the <Bureau> we were talking about, I wasn't
convinced that they'd insert every King into this scenario. They didn't really
like the scenarios that they couldn't control, after all. Which meant…

"One has appeared in the Pacific Ocean. And when all of our forces start
moving, one more should show up. That would make two Kings."

"Okay, so one is the Pacific Ocean bastard, and the other will be Uriel from
the 999th turn?"

"Correct."

"How strong are they? I only saw for a brief moment back then…"
"Well, Uriel from the 999th turn is responsible for leaving the 'Secretive
Plotter' in that state, so yeah."

"…Son of a bitch. And something like that is going to show up with
underlings, too??"

Han Sooyoung clearly witnessed the power of 'Secretive Plotter' during the
battle against the Apocalypse Dragon. So, her reaction couldn't be seen as
over the top.

"Constellations of our channel will definitely help us, right?"

"Even if they help us, there is no guarantee of our victory. Most
importantly, we won't be at our full combat strength with Yoo Joonghyuk
missing."

My original plan was to split the companions in two to divide and conquer
the Outer God Kings. However, if the main combatant Yoo Joonghyuk
were to go missing from the picture, then we won't be able to rely on the
1863rd turn's power to survive.

Kwa-kwakwakwa!

We saw the 'wave' gradually widening its area of influence through the
display panel. It'd be too late if we started defending ourselves when the
boundaries of the Great Apocalypse reached the Korean Peninsula.

I quickly came to a new decision.

"Let's get moving. I'll tell you what you must do."

Five hours remained.

We needed to finish our preparation within this time frame.
While Han Sooyoung was busy conveying my new plan to our companions,
I went to talk to Lee Gilyoung. After hearing my summons, the boy quickly
rushed into the reception room with a bright expression.

"Hyung! You called for me? What's up?"

I nodded my head. "Please sit over here."

He quickly sat down on the couch and looked up at me with his sparkling
eyes as if he couldn't wait to hear what I had to say.

I stared deeply into his eyes.

⸢The child who used to think of this world as a game.⸥

Even now, the memories of the moments I first met Lee Gilyoung remained
fresh in my head. It was a nightmare filled with the flickering overhead
lights of the subway and grasshoppers all leaping up into the air
simultaneously. If Lee Gilyoung hadn't caught any insects that day, the one
to die would've been me.

⸢The insect-collecting boy without a mother was now old enough to be a
middle-school student.⸥
I didn't save his mother that day. What would've happened if I made a
different choice back then?

For instance, what if my disgust towards humans was less intense? What if
I didn't notice the injuries on the boy's arm while grabbing the
grasshoppers? What if I didn't have a habit of hastily guessing a person's
history with just a few circumstantial evidence?

What if I hadn't read the 'Ways of Survival'?

What if I… wasn't Kim Dokja…?
"…Sorry."

Huh?

"…I'm sorry, hyung."

Lee Gilyoung had his head lowered, his shoulders trembling from
trepidation like a child about to be handed down a scary punishment.

Was it because I looked scary? Or, was it because of some other reason?

Lee Gilyoung continued on. "But, but, I didn't have a choice… If I hadn't
signed the contract, Shin Yoosung might have…"

Only then did I realize what he was trying to say.

⸢And this boy signed the contract with the devil in order to protect his
precious something.⸥

A certain moment from the ⸢Journey to the West⸥ brushed past my view.
Right, I witnessed it clearly, didn't I – the yellowish storm erupting out
from the boy's figure while being surrounded by the Nine Stars.

Lee Gilyoung was talking about that time.

"I, I do remember you telling me to never use my Sponsor's powers! I
swear, I didn't deliberately break our promise! I, I really…"

As the boy spoke incoherently, I placed my hand on his head. "You
did well." "Eh?"

The boy's eyes grew wider, so I spoke with more conviction in my voice.
"You did well. Without you, we'd have all died back then."

I was aware of how tough it had been for this boy. Because I also knew
only too well the sorrow of watching your companions die before your eyes
and unable to do anything about it. Lee Gilyoung must've felt the same.
"However, doing it again is going to be troublesome. You know this, don't
you? With your powers…"

"…I don't want to."

"What's that?"

"If the same things happen again, I'll make the same choice. I'll rely on that
power again. I'll… I'll protect Shin Yoosung and my companions."

"But, Gilyoung-ah."

He hesitated slightly before avoiding my hand. He raised his head, and I
saw several complicated emotions swirling within his eyes.

It seemed that I wasn't the only one who had made up his mind.

"I know you called me here to scold me. But, I came here to tell you
this, too. I'm not a little kid anymore, hyung. I'm also qualified, you
know. Just like everyone else, I reached this far by beating back all the
scenarios." I inwardly swallowed back my gasps.

I knew this already. I did, but…

[The Fourth Wall]'s voice could be heard next, sounding thoroughly
unimpressed by my thoughts.

⸢D on't tre at him l ike a kid you are mo re l ike a k id.⸥

'Gilyoung-ie is still a kid'.

⸢Y ou ca n't fig ht wi thout hi m an yway.⸥

⸢Kim Dok ja, ac ting l ike a ni ce per son do esn't suit y ou.⸥

I knew that. But still, that didn't mean…
⸢D on't wo rry, my fr iend will he lp.⸥

…Your friend?

It was then, a transparent wall-like something wavered around Lee
Gilyoung accompanied by 'Tsu-chuchut' noise.

['The Fourth Wall' is responding to its friend.]

I cautiously reached out towards the empty air.

Something was there. This sensation of touching a wall – I was familiar
with it. However, this 'wall' was still incomplete.

I finally understood several things just then.

…So, that's how it was. That 'wall' was now with this child…

"H-hyung, even if you say no, I…!"

He must've felt scared by my hand reaching out to the empty air, because he
started shouting in a shaky voice. I quickly lowered my hand and held his. I
remained still while holding his hands tightly, until his shivering gradually
calmed down.

"You're right, Gilyoung-ah."

"…Hyung?"

"I… We, can't see the Conclusion without your help. We need you during
the scenario we are about to enter." I slowly blinked my eyes.

I couldn't help it now. I had to acknowledge our current situation where I
had no choice but to rely on a hurting child. I had to treat preciously the
boy's heart that had to mature far too quickly for his age, and his courage he
had to display first.

And to reward that courage, I too had to become honest here.
"Even if that's true, I won't let you fight all alone. This is my desire, and I
won't ever back down from this. Can you understand that, Gilyoung-ah?"

Lee Gilyoung slowly nodded his head. He wiped his tears and smiled
happily. My heart ached thinking about how I had to go to war with this
child in tow.

Unfortunately, it was now time to cross 'that' bridge.

"I want to speak to your Sponsor."

My words caused Lee Gilyoung's eyes to quake quite noticeably.

"…B-but, hyung. T-that guy, it's…"

"Don't worry."

The reason why I didn't want to use his Sponsor was because that guy was
simply too dangerous.

⸢"…Will you truly not come with me? You'll become stronger much faster
if you stick with me instead of him. Even then, you wish to stay behind?"⸥
Yoo Joonghyuk must've known this too and that's why he tried to take Lee
Gilyoung away. What a fox-like sly bastard.

I gently grasped the shoulders of worried Lee Gilyoung and spoke. "Your
hyung is now a Myth-grade Constellation, you know."

If it was a few days ago, I'd have avoided making this choice if at all
possible. But the story was different now.

I lightly sucked in my breath, and while looking up, spoke in my true voice.
[I know you're watching, so come out.]

The moment the tone of my voice changed, a heavy reverberation spread
out around us. Sparks completely inundated the reception room and Lee
Gilyoung's expression changed. As his brows furrowed in pain, his eyes
became white next. I realized what was happening here so I quickly broke
past the Probability's storm and tightly grasped the boy's shoulder.

[I don't remember telling you to descend.] Tsu-

chuchuchut!

The after-effects from the Probability's storm lessened significantly and all
sorts of pain rushed into my arm. But, I ably endured it. If I didn't go with
this much showmanship, then I'd not be able to negotiate properly with this
guy.

[Your Status is suppressing the after-effects of a localised Probability's
storm!]

Lee Gilyoung's expression regained its calm rapidly.

And right in the next instance, sounds akin to the beatings of insect wings
came out from his mouth, currently looking as if empty darkness had taken
over.

[I'm familiar with waiting, yet you have taken far too long.]

This voice sounded as if millions of locusts were crashing in at the same
time.
             Chapter 469: Ep. 89 - Great Apocalypse, III


It had become dark outside the windows. I wondered if the sun had set
already, but when I took a closer look, I realized that insects were sticking
to the glasses. Locusts were glaring at me while scurrying around, their
antennae swaying threateningly about.

I glanced at the plague of locusts and spoke up. [Compared to how long you
had to endure, your waiting this time wouldn't have been all that much. So
stop exaggerating.]

[You… what do you know… about waiting?]

The creature's words kept being cut off. Its true voice sounded like an echo
spreading out from beneath the emptiness that I couldn't even fathom. The
surrounding air was bubbling with pitch-black Status. I adjusted my own
aura and continued to speak.

[I know that you are the 'forgotten evil', at least.]
It was here that the brows above Lee Gilyoung's white eyes quivered just a
little. It felt as if bitterly cold air suddenly was blanketing us. I endured it
and spoke again.

[The 'evil' that all the other stars have forgotten after too much time has
passed by. The 'evil' that was even ostracised by other 'evil', and was sealed
away within the Demon Realm's deepest underground.]

Quite often, it was told that the deepest part of Hell was the dwelling of the
'Apocalypse Dragon'. The reason why the 'Great War of Saints and
Demons' was so famous was because of the <Harmagedon> burning in the
flames of this terrifying dragon.

The truth was, though, the Apocalypse Dragon wasn't the only calamity
found in the early days of the 'Great War of Saints and Demons'.

The calamity of the stars that swept across the worlds with yellow-coloured
storm clouds of insects – amongst all the names that had disappeared, there
definitely existed a calamity with this title.

[Oh, the King of Locusts, the 'Ruler of the Deepest Pit'.]

My words prompted a vicious storm to whip about in the air as a new
message revealed itself.

[Character 'Lee Gilyoung's' Sponsor has revealed its Modifier.]

[Constellation, 'Ruler of the Deepest Pit', is now looking at you.]

The Ruler of the Deepest Pit, Abaddon.

Just like the other 'main characters' of the Great War of Saints and Demons,
it too was an existence on the level of Myth-grade.

However, the masters of the 'Wall Dividing Good and Evil' didn't
acknowledge it as 'evil' for the sake of their own battles, and to make
matters worse, didn't even let it enter the ranks of the '72 Demon Kings' of
the Demon Realm.
And so, this being was more like an 'Outer God' now. Even though it was
the 'Great Evil' that dyed the galaxy with locust plague once upon a time,
this being had to spend tens of thousands of years locked away within the
prison of forgotten memories.

This being was even betrayed by its own kins, the demons, while believing
in the empty promise of others waking it up during the age of calamities.

⸢That was, until one human used 'grasshoppers' as the method to clear the
scenario one day.⸥
[Story, 'Grasshopper Catcher' has begun its storytelling!]

Lee Gilyoung's Story that sprouted from our scenario had managed to
awaken the ancient demon from its slumber.

[State your reason… for summoning me, oh the arrogant… Constellation.]

I could easily sense this demon's hidden pain from its voice filled with
boundless hatred. It was ignored by its enemy, the 'Good', while it was
betrayed by its supposed ally, the 'Evil'.

[What do you think? I called you here to make you stop exploiting a little
kid after you forced him into signing a contract with you.]

[…]

[If you want to sign a contract with someone, then do it with me, instead.
Wouldn't that be fairer?]

[I only… forgive… your insolence… because… you… wrecked the…
Great War of Saints and Demons…]

Lee Gilyoung's lips twisted ever so slightly to form a grin. This guy, it
possessed the qualification of Great Evil, yet it decided not to participate in
the 'Great War of Saints and Demons' right till its conclusion. Hell, it even
acted as if it didn't exist in the first place.
I kind of understood why, though. That particular Giant Story was no
longer a festival meant for this creature.

[The Apocalypse Dragon and Eden… the Demon Realm… Watching them
being destroyed was… gratifying.]

[Is that so? But, is it over with only that?]

[Over…?]

[Abaddon. You're still 'Evil'.]

My words caused Lee Gilyoung's brows to quiver. [The Great War… of
Saints and Demons… is already… over…]

[Yeah, it has ended. But, it'll start again in the future. And the scenario
where you're the calamity might get created during then. Where everyone
remembers your Modifier, where everyone trembles from fear in front of
your name.]

[Why… are you… saying such things?]

Abaddon smiled as if it heard rather sweet-sounding remarks.

I went straight to the topic. [Let me not beat around the bush. You've saved
up enough of your strength. Now, lend us your aid.]

[And… why… should I?]

[Because even you would be annihilated if you don't. You already know
very well that other Constellations will never give you the time of day after
we're all gone.]

[…I am… the ancient… Evil…]

[Constellations on the side of 'Absolute Evil' will never acknowledge you as
the Oldest Evil. No one will stand on your side. And I guess you must've
forgotten it, but there is that monster, 'Baal', waiting in the 'Final Scenario',
too.]

[Ba-al…!]

Abaddon's voice trembled as if it was having a seizure.

Baal – the Demon King ranked number one in the pecking order. The sole
existence from the Demon Realm that had entered the 'Final Scenario's'
area, and also the Demon King who had imprisoned Abaddon in the deepest
pit, as well.

[You help us and stop the 'Great Apocalypse', then we shall grant you
an opportunity to take your revenge on that guy.] The surrounding air
was trembling viciously.

I continued to withstand the Status tumbling within the air current and
spoke up. [Oh, the Ruler of the Deepest Pit. Become the Oldest Evil in the
world we wish to create.]

When choosing to get in bed with the devil, you need to offer up a bait of
this scale, at the least. I definitely needed Abaddon's powers in order to stop
this calamity.




[One hour and 5 minutes remaining until the start of the Great Apocalypse.]

Finally, all the preparations were complete.

I looked at my companions waiting on the side of the plaza and asked them.
"Has Yoo Joonghyuk woken up yet?"

"…No, not yet."

Lee Seolhwa replied, and I nodded my head.
If he hadn't woken up yet, then we had to go with Plan B.

"I'll believe in you, everyone. We have no other choice now."

The Plan B was actually the same with A – split into two groups and each
fight an 'Outer God King'. The only thing different would be the
composition of each group.

"The 'Outer God' the first team will fight is the 'Living Flame'."

The Living Flame – the 'god name' of Uriel who lived during the 999th
turn.

"The one appearing in the Pacific Ocean is the 'Master of the Sunken
Island', but once the Great Apocalypse begins, the 'Living Flame' will
definitely make her appearance. She's targeting the 'Secretive Plotter', after
all." I glanced at the sleeping 'Secretive Plotter' still trapped within the
sealing sphere and continued on. "For the time being, this is the list of the
participants."

Companions stared at me with tense eyes.

"Jung Heewon, Lee Gilyoung, Shin Yoosung, Lee Seolhwa, Gong Pildu,
Yoo Sangah, Han Sooyoung…"

The main damage dealer of this group was Jung Heewon. The one
possessing the strongest space restricting power was Yoo Sangah, while no
one even came close to Han Sooyoung's ability to conduct the battles.
These three were going to form the 'mains' of the team.

Of course, that wasn't the end.

"Uriel, Abyssal Black Flame Dragon, the Great Sage…"

Sparks began dancing wildly in the air as soon as I said that.

[Constellation, 'Demon-like Judge of Fire', is nodding her head.]
[Constellation, 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon', grumbles that it doesn't wish
to be ordered around.]

[Constellation, 'Most Ancient Liberator', is guessing your intentions.]

Since our opponent was going to be Uriel from the 999th turn, we definitely
had to send out our own Uriel. If luck was on our side, we might be able to
see the [Disconnected Film Theory]'s effects once more. The Black Flame
Dragon would no doubt be a great help here, and there was no need to even
mention the Great Sage now that he had become a Myth-grade
Constellation himself.

"I'd like Breaking the Sky Sword Saint, Kyrgios, Jang Hayoung, and… the
rest of the Transcendents to be their back-up, please."

"Leave it to us!"

The clearly-excited Jang Hayoung shouted out after she finally got a proper
mission of her own. However, her enthusiasm should take a turn for the
worse once she gets there.

Both the Breaking the Sky Sword Saint and Kyrgios nodded their heads, so
I continued on. "Finally… Hades, Persephone, I'd like you two to
accompany the first team, please."

[Constellation, 'Father of the Rich Night' is silently nodding his head.]

[Constellation, 'Queen of the Darkest Spring' is looking at you worriedly.]

The expressions of my companions quietly listening until then finally began
changing somewhat.

The first one to open her lips was Jung Heewon. "Hang on a minute. Is
there a need to focus all the combat personnel on the first team? Basically,
everyone is in the first team, isn't it? Who will be in the second team?"

"Lee Jihye, Lee Hyunsung-ssi, and I will form the second team."
"What about other Constellations?"

I didn't reply to her, prompting her eyes to narrow to a slit.

"Yet another nice-sounding suicidal plan…"

I spied Yoo Sangah next to her smiling gently just then. R-right, if it's her,
then she might side with me on this one.

[Someone is reciting the Constrictive Sutra…]

Her gentle lips began reciting something truly terrifying. I then spotted Han
Sooyoung in the distance with her hand massaging her temples while
shaking her head.

'I told you, it's not going to work'.

I urgently shouted out. "H-hang on! It's not a suicidal plan. It really is a
proper plan. That's why I'm bringing along both Jihye and Hyunsung-ssi."

"H-mm…"

"I'm a Myth-grade Constellation now. You all saw how strong I've become
earlier, didn't you?"

"Sure, we saw you hiding behind Joonghyuk-ssi and cheering him on."

"Please trust me. You all know what kind of an existence a Myth-grade
Constellation is. It's none other than a Myth-grade! Poseidon! Zeus! The
Great Sage, Heaven's Equal! The Demon King of Salvation!"

"Sounds like something weird is mixed up in there, though…"

My companions seemed to have fallen into the trap of uncertainty after I
repeated the Myth-grade several more times. Indeed, the best brainwashing
method was to repeat yourself.

It was then a thunderclap exploded in the sky.
[Constellation, 'Most Ancient Liberator', is glaring at you.]

The Great Sage spent his own Probability to materialise his Incarnation
body and made his grand entrance along with the flashy lightning show. His
majestic platinum-hued hair danced above the Somersault Cloud.

[Maknae, have you lost your mind?]

"I-it's fine to send an indirect message, you know… You need to conserve
your Probability…"

[Not all Myth-grades are equal 'myths'. You're just a hatchling who has
stepped into this domain only recently.]

This was my first time seeing the Great Sage come out this forcefully, and
that flustered me somewhat. I deliberated on my options, before sighing out
grandly and told everyone the truth.

"…I too don't believe the combined strengths of the second team will be
enough to kill a King."

"Then, what were you planning to do?!"

"The core of our plan this time is 'blitzkrieg'."

Currently, we didn't have Yoo Joonghyuk, the core of the second team, with
us. If we couldn't borrow the powers of the 1863rd regression turn, then
didn't matter how the teams were split up, we still didn't have any guarantee
of victory.

Just one mistake, then forget about dividing and conquering our enemies,
we'd get conquered, instead. In that case, there was only one way remaining
to ensure everyone's survival.

"The survival of the second team is dependent on the first. You must defeat
the 'Living Flame' as speedily as possible and head to the Pacific Ocean.
The goal of my team, Jihye, Hyunsung-ssi, and I, is to endure until all of
you come and join us."
This was the first stage in the plan that I came up with.




30 minutes later, Lee Jihye, Lee Hyunsung, and myself disembarked to the
Pacific Ocean. Right up until our departure, my companions were trying to
change my mind, but I simply shook my head at them.

The 'Master of the Sunken Island' managed to destroy the American
continent simply by rising up. If we waited for that guy to get closer to the
Korean Peninsula, then every single nearby island would be destroyed even
before the battle got underway.

Going out to face our enemy head-on was the right call even when
considering the accompanying risk.

[Constellation, 'Maritime War God', is reading the water route with a deeply
meaningful stare.]

Both Lee Jihye and Lee Hyunsung looked quite tense. Especially the latter,
as he was returning to scenarios after a period of absence. His expression
was far more solemn than before.

[Constellation, 'Bald General of Justice', is busy polishing his head.]

[Constellation, 'King Heungmu', is saddened by the fate of the Korean
Peninsula.]

The [Turtle Dragon] scythed past the ocean waves to go past the islands of
Ulleundo and Dokdo.

Perhaps the sights of the latter left an impression on him, because Lee
Hyunsung suddenly placed his hand on his chest and shouted out. "…We
shall protect our motherland!"

[Constellation, 'Last Hero of Hwangsanbeol' is nodding his head.]
I found it a bit hard to watch such a serious declaration, so I promptly went
for a tackle. "…Hyunsung-Ssi, you said you quit being a soldier, didn't
you?"

"It's not just soldiers that protect our nation, you know."

He muttered his reply and looked down at his dog tags with sorrowful eyes.
Before we parted ways from the rest of the companions, Jung Heewon
fidgeted around with those tags for a long time before letting him go.

– You must stay alive, no matter what. Understand?

Lee Hyunsung, now with a face of an innocent little bull, looked up into the
sky and nodded his head.

Lee Jihye watched this spectacle unfold and whispered something in my
ear. "Ahjussi, why does this feel like our death flag?"

"…We'll be fine. If anyone's dying today, it'll be Hyunsung-ssi only."

"By the way, will just us two, me and Hyunsung ahjussi, really be alright?"

"Huh."

I spread out a sheet on the ship's deck while explaining myself. This sheet
was a DIY item I bought just now from the [Dokkaebi Bundle]. My new
goal was to complete this thing before we encounter our new enemy.

"I don't get it, though? Sure, I get why with Hyunsung ahjussi, but me? Is it
because we're on the sea?"

"Something like that."

"But, my Sponsor is a Historical… No, a Narrative-grade. But, you clearly
said that even a Myth-grade can't stop the guy about to show up, didn't
you?"
For sure, what she said was correct. The Maritime War God was an
excellent Constellation, sure, but he was a long way off from being referred
to as <Star Stream>'s greatest Constellation.

"It's not the General, but you that I believe in."

"…Eh?"

"The Constellation being a Narrative-grade doesn't mean his Incarnation is
also a Narrative-grade."

Lee Jihye blinked her eyes as if she didn't really get it, but eventually, a
smirk formed on her lips. "What are you on about? I'm not even a
Constellation, you know."

Well, true, you aren't one now.

Lee Jihye had no idea of her own potential. She had no clue just how far
she reached back in the original story.

[Constellation, 'Maritime War God', nods his head after hearing your

words.] Perhaps the General was already well aware of it.

Lee Hyunsung finished shooting the solo performance of Romeo and Juliet,
and approached us. "By the way, Dokja-ssi? What have you been making
until now?"

"Ah, this?"

I showed him the item I'd been making. Its explanation immediately popped
up when I did.
  <Item Information>

  Name: The White Flag of Complete Surrender

  Grade: SSS

  Explanation: It's a surprising item that allows the enemy to see your
  surrender from very far away. Be careful to not let your allies discover
  you using it.


Lee Hyunsung formed a disbelieving expression as if he had seen
something weird and rubbed his eyes a few times before he looked at me.

I grinned back. "I told you, I'm not planning to die this time."

"B-but, this, isn't this…"

"The moment you see them, we must surrender. Then we try to talk to
them. Understand? Fighting won't buy us any time whatsoever. As soon as
they show up…"

"Ahjussi! Something's coming!"

Almost at the same time with Lee Jihye's cry, we all spotted a ginormous
wall approaching us from the horizon. It was a wall of waves reaching
hundreds of meters high. That wall was steadily encroaching upon us.

[You have entered the 'Great Apocalypse Scenario' area prematurely!]

[You're recommended to exit the scenario area immediately!]

[If you fail to exit, the 'Great Apocalypse Scenario' will

begin!] Of course, I wasn't planning to leave.

[Hidden Scenario – 'Great Apocalypse' has begun!]
[The invasion of 'Outer Gods' has commenced!]

[Please survive this calamity!]

The moment the scenario explanation ended, the gigantic waves of Status
crashed into us. This Status was so great that all the hair on my body was
standing up real high, even though I was supposed to be a 'Myth-grade
Constellation' now.

⸢The calamity that not even stars can't survive. This is the 'Great
Apocalypse'.⸥

The march of the 'Outer Gods', for the annihilation of a world.

[Story, 'Demon King of Salvation', has begun its storytelling.]

I unleashed the appropriate Story to protect my companions and looked up
at the wall of waves. The howl of the 'Outer God' resounded out from
somewhere.

The 'Outer Gods' were piled up like layers in between the waves.

And a lone battleship rode on top of this wall as if to reign over it. The
vessel was an intimately familiar shape. The dragon-shaped figurehead spat
out a violent lick of flames.

The [Turtle Dragon].

That was definitely the Turtle Dragon. If one wanted to point out the
obvious difference between that one and our own Turtle Dragon, then the
enemy's was at least twenty times larger.

"A-ahjussi…"

The frightened Lee Jihye was now staring at me, her expression asking me
if I knew this already.
I nodded my head. I wasn't 100% sure, but did expect this to happen. I
knew the list of survivors from the 999th turn better than anyone, after all.

⸢The calamity of the western world, the 'Master of the Sunken Island'.⸥

Beyond the waves splitting up, we could hear the voice of a certain girl who
had witnessed the 999th turn's 'Conclusion'.

【Load the cannons.】
             Chapter 470: Ep. 89 - Great Apocalypse, IV


The moment the shelling began, I grabbed Lee Jihye. It felt as if the entire
world had us in its crosshairs. Our ship quickly turned its heading. I could
only pray that she wasn't too late.

【Fire.】

Kwa-aaaaaaaah!!

The ear-rending cacophony of cannon firing noises filled up the entire great
ocean. Foams around us evaporated into steam. With almost no room left,
the [Turtle Dragon] managed to turn around in time. Even then, we couldn't
dodge everything.

"Hyunsung-ssi!"

As the acrid burning smell filled up our noses, the Story metal quickly
branched out and covered up the entirety of the deck. Soon, it covered the
entire hull and started glowing in white-hot heat. So hot, in fact, one's skin
would be cooked instantly. As the impact force on the outer layer of the
metal decreased, Lee Hyunsung undid the [Steel Transformation].
When we saw the sky again, we realized that our ship was falling to the
bottom as if the ground beneath had disappeared. I quickly activated
[Demon King Transformation], spread out my wings, and shouted out.

"Lee Jihye!!"

She hurriedly grabbed the helm and controlled the movement of the ship.
Flames lit up below the hull and the [Turtle Dragon] began flying.

Only after securing our balance were we able to take stock of our
surroundings. Just what the hell happened here…?

⸢And then, Kim Dokja couldn't close his slack jaw.⸥

A ship in the middle of the ocean suddenly fell to the ground – meaning, the
water supporting that ship had disappeared.

Ku-gugugugu!

The great ocean had been split in half and its deep, dark bottom was now
fully exposed. Aquatic creatures were flapping around painfully down
there, and we could see the horde of 'Outer Gods' gleefully tearing into
those helpless creatures.

[Gyahaaaaaah!]

The swarm of Outer Gods were running on the bottom of the ocean, their
bodies wriggling like worms. From either side of the now-dry ocean, the
huge tsunami waves were flooding in.

"Move! Hurry!"

I shouted out and Lee Jihye urgently turned the ship around again.

【Load the cannons】.
It was then that we heard the noises of cannons being loaded for the second
time. Just hearing that true voice alone instilled fear deep into the very
marrows of our bones.

I raised my head and saw Lee Hyunsung sweating buckets as well. Even if
it was the [Story metal], it wouldn't be able to withstand attacks of such
calibre too many times.

"Ahjussi! Do something!"

I was planning to act, anyway.

I finished my crappy construction effort on the [The White Flag of
Complete Surrender] and raised it up high.

[Item, 'The White Flag of Complete Surrender', is activating!]

[Now your enemies should be able to spot your complete surrender from
even afar!]

[A portion of Constellations are shocked by your action!]

[A small number of Constellations are pointing accusatory fingers at your
cowardice!]

Cowardice, my foot. You haven't even bothered to show up here.

I used all of my strength to wave this white flag around.

"Lee Jihye! Over here!"

I called out, yet no reply came back my way.

No, the one to tackle me down figuratively was our own Lee Jihye, instead.
"Ahjussi, have you gone insane??"

"It might not look it, but this item is an SSS-grade."
"There's no guarantee of us surviving just because we surrendered, you
know!"

"Well, Lee Jihye on that side could be a kind girl. Let's believe in that."

"How can you crack jokes in this kind of situation??"

Unfortunately, I wasn't joking.

The cannons finished reloading and just as they began emitting light, I
diligently waved my white flag and shouted out my prepared speech. "Oiii,
Lee Jihye! Did your master teach you to attack the opponents waving white
flags??"

Ku-gu…

And then, that side stopped moving for the first time ever. The fully-loaded
cannons had stopped just before they could fire. The thick, grey steam
dissipated to reveal a lone figure standing on the deck.

It was the Outer God, the 'Master of the Sunken Island'.

Lee Jihye from the 999th turn was standing there, her long hair dancing in
the wind.

Even though she had lived an unaccountable amount of time, her looks
were still in the 20s. It was as if her time had frozen still in the moments of
the 999th regression turn's 'Conclusion'.

As if she wanted to count the emptiness of that time, her lips began parting
slowly.

【Flag…】

"That's right, this flag. You remember it?"

Old pages were flipping past within me. Scenes from the 999th turn were
being replayed – the intense stench of blood, the eerie darkness of the
subway…

[Exclusive skill, 'Reading Comprehension', is activating!]

[Attribute, 'Scenario Interpreter', is activating!]

[Your words have awoken the ancient Story within your opponent!]

⸢Within that darkness stood Yoo Joonghyuk.⸥

Sparks burst out from the shattered, broken headlights of the train; the light
flickering intermittently illuminated Yoo Joonghyuk's sword slaughtering
the monsters.

⸢On that day, the wounded Sword Demon met the Supreme King.⸥

The Sword Demon shuddered after seeing his sword easily rip through the
enemies she had so much trouble fighting until then. Lee Jihye shouted out,
her eyes chasing after the sword's trajectory that seemed to disappear in
pure disinterest.

⸢"If I follow after you, can I become stronger, too? Then, will I be able to
survive in this stinking world?!"⸥
Tsu-chuchuchuchut!

Sparks danced violently before my eyes. The vicious storm of Probability's
aftermath was so powerful that I couldn't even see my front properly.

The incoming aquatic creatures and 'Outer Gods' targeting us got sucked
into the sparks and writhed in pain.

[Whatsthiswhatsthiswhatsthiswhatsthis]

'Outer Gods' turned to look at their 'King'. However, their king was no
longer standing there. As if she was lost within the distant memories, the
999th turn's Lee Jihye was reaching out towards the empty air.
【Mas… ter…】

As I thought.

I got this impression the first time I met the 'Secretive Plotter' as well as
999th turn's Uriel, that… These people, they were clearly out of their
minds.

[Character, 'Master of the Sunken Island', is painfully baring her teeth.]

When an existence became an 'Outer God', normally this being would end
up as a completely different existence. It'd lose the memories of the life it
lived and be reborn as a brand new creature.

However, that was the story reserved for the regular 'Outer Gods'; 'Kings'
played by different rules. They retained the memories and emotions of their
previous lives.

The 'Secretive Plotter' divided his Story into different regression turns and
stored them that way, while the 'Living Flame' shoved her own sense of self
into her vengeful obsession.

In that case, what was it like for the 'Master of the Sunken Island'?

Was she able to remember who she used to be?

"Lee Jihye! Please remember who you once were!"

I wasn't sure why the 999th turn's Lee Jihye became an 'Outer God'.
However, I could think of one possibility.

"Don't destroy this 'worldline', please! This place is the same as the world
you used to live in! Yoo Joonghyuk is here, so is Lee Hyunsung, and so are
you, Lee Jihye!"

Tsu-chuchuchuchut!

[<Star Stream> is closely observing your actions.]
[A portion of Great Dokkaebis are frowning at your actions.]

Stories from the 999th turn began flowing in front of my eyes.

"Don't close your eyes! Make sure you see who you're about to kill!"

⸢"Don't close your eyes. Make sure to remember who your sword is about
to kill.⸥

Yoo Joonghyuk as how the 999th turn's Lee Jihye remembered him stood
there, the man who taught her the ways of the sword and how to survive.
The [Struggle for the Flag] began, and after taking over the Chungmuro
Station, he said this to her.

⸢"Remember the deaths of those you've killed. This might hurt you, but that
way, you'll avoid becoming a Sword Demon."⸥
Yoo Joonghyuk's flag, still white and untainted, slowly wavered in that
place. It'd become red, then black, later. Lee Jihye looked at the flag
proudly gleaning on that man's back and thought to herself.

⸢I wish to become someone like him.⸥

That was something I also thought about often.

[Character, 'Master of the Sunken Island's' Story is violently shaking!]

I didn't miss this opening and continued to fire my salvo like a machine
gun. I spat out the events of the 999th turn that I remembered without a
shred of hesitation. "Have you forgotten everything that Yoo Joonghyuk
taught you back then? Let the ones surrendering early go! Those who
scheme behind your back are usually the smart ones! We're short on
manpower, so we need to utilise even such people, too!"

Lee Jihye's jaw fell as she watched me from the side. She must've had no
clue that I'd come out and persuade our enemy in this manner. Didn't really
matter if they slagged me off for being a coward as I simply had no choice.
I had to resort to stimulating the memories from the original novel since
buying time was the utmost priority for us. I didn't have any guarantee that
this method would work, anyway.

【Fire】.

…Goddammit, so that little wasn't enough, huh.

Kwa-aaaaaah!

The second shelling commenced.

Although the firepower this time was weaker, the destructive power behind
the attack was still too much for us to meet it head-on. The only saving
grace was that, rather than 'one big shot', the attack was in the form of
scattered rounds, instead.

I watched the shells cross the vast ocean and bit my lips, hard.
"Hyunsungssi!"

"…I'm not finished with my preparations!"

Was it because he had to lend the [Story metal] to our companions, too?
Lee Hyunsung's magical energy recovery rate was extremely slow. The
forged steel covering the vessel was only about half compared to before.

Meaning, we need to withstand this 'turn' without the help from the [Steel
Transformation].

The [Turtle Dragon] began retreating with every ounce of energy in order to
dodge the scattered shells. However, Lee Jihye moved in contrast to the
ship's direction and stood in front to protect both Lee Hyunsung and me.

"Ahjussis, stand behind me. I'll do whatever I can about this."

Her unexpected words made me take another look at her. With an
unfamiliar light in her eyes, she was studying the frontline.
"This fight… It's my fight."

I didn't know what made her move, but one thing's for certain – Lee Jihye
had chosen her battlefield.

"I don't know what the hell this 999th turn is nor what happened in that
place. However, if there is another 'me' trying to destroy this world with the
pretext of tragedy from another regression turn…" Ghostly flames burned
fiercely within her eyes after she had made up her mind. "I will never
forgive another 'me'."

[Constellation, 'Maritime War God', is unleashing his

Status!] I quietly stared at her.

The oceans were the most optimal battlefield for her.

The only things I could trust right now were Lee Jihye and her battleship.

[Nebula <Kim Dokja's Company>'s Probability is permeating within the
Incarnation, 'Lee Jihye'!]

The Giant Stories I possessed poured in all of their Status into her. Blinding
golden aura enveloped her body.

She opened her eyes wide, before smiling refreshingly at me. "Thanks,
ahjussi."

Lee Jihye's battleship dashed forward.

The [Turtle Dragon] evaded the arcs of the incoming scattered shells and
spat out flames from its figurehead.

"All troops, advance!"

[Giant Story, 'Torch that Swallowed the Myth', has begun talking a big
game!]
The flames spat out by the small dragon figurehead collided with the shell
fired from the other side and evaporated. The history we lived together
became the Story and was colliding against the 999th turn's Story.

[Giant Story, 'Demon Realm's Spring', is aiding the Incarnation 'Lee Jihye'.]

[Giant Story, 'Season of Light and Darkness', has begun its storytelling!]

If one looked at the destructive power of Giant Stories alone, then our side
shouldn't get pushed around by your run-of-the-mill Nebulas.
[Constellation, 'Maritime War God', has ceded his command to his
Incarnation.]

[Character 'Lee Jihye' is activating 'Ghost Fleet Lv.???'!]

Her speciality, the Ghost Fleet, finally revealed themselves above the great
ocean's waters. Each of these vessels had grown past the size of a cruiser
and were now almost reaching that of an aircraft carrier. They escorted the
[Turtle Dragon] and spat out flames in synch with each other.

"Load the cannons!"

Lee Jihye's Ghost Fleet started their speedy forward march. Unfortunately,
that side started firing first.

Waves of flames rushed in over the vast expanse of the ocean. The fleet
headed straight into the wave. The gigantic wall of water blocked our front,
but her eyes were focused only on a single point.

"Fire!"

The concentrated firing caused one side of the wave to explode. The fleet
dug into that small opening and continued to advance. Her fleet, now in the
straight-line formation, then opened fire in all directions.

Outer Gods struck down by the cannons cried out in pain. Lee Jihye
trampled on those screams and continued to advance forward again and
again.
She even vomited out blood after using an excessive amount of magical
energy, yet she never let go of the helm.

⸢Even if it's just one shot.⸥

Lee Jihye's eyes emitting chilling glow were still fixed on one point. On a
certain battleship waiting beyond the thick wall of waves.

【Load the cannons.】

"Load the cannons!"

[Constellation, 'Bald General of Justice', is cheering on the Incarnation, 'Lee

[Constellation, 'Seo-Ae Single Stroke of Brush', is cheering on the

The Korean Peninsula's Constellations were now looking at her.

While watching her pierce her way through this overwhelmingly
disadvantageous combat situation, I began recalling a certain page from the
now-ancient original novel.

[Character 'Lee Jihye's' attribute evolution is imminent!]
Her final attribute evolution, something she also experienced during the
original, was about to occur right before my eyes. Such a thing was possible
only because of the current situation.

The Probabilities lent to her by the Korean Peninsula's Constellations, her
own Story that she had accumulated with abnormal speed, and finally, Lee
Jihye's determination to even risk death all combined to create this miracle.

[Constellation, 'Maritime War God', is looking at his Incarnation.]

From the distant skies, Lee Jihye's Sponsor, the 'Maritime War God', was
looking down at her. He was the Constellation that protected and advised
her for the longest time.

I knew what he was thinking right now; I could sense it, because I was also
a star like him. He was currently experiencing an event that only the
smallest number of Constellations would ever encounter.

⸢The event of an Incarnation exceeding the Status of her Sponsor.⸥

This should be what the Maritime War God must've realized – that the time
had come for him to acknowledge the truth; that now was the time to let go
of his own Incarnation from his embrace.

⸢And so – the oceans desired one Monarch to rule over the violent storms.⸥

The Maritime War God recited the Story as if he was sending the
congratulatory message to a young bird taking to the skies for the first time.

⸢Therefore, there is no need for two Monarchs in this great ocean.⸥

[Character 'Lee Jihye's' attribute is evolving!]

[Character 'Lee Jihye' has acquired the legendary-grade attribute!]

Finally, the wounded Sword Demon was advancing towards her own ocean.
[Character 'Lee Jihye's' attribute has evolved to the 'Monarch of the Great
Sea'!]

【Fire.】

"Fire!!"

As the ear-deafening cannon firing resounded out, everything before our
eyes was enveloped by the blinding flash of light.
            Chapter 471: Ep. 89 - Great Apocalypse, V


【Mari… time War… God…】

The 999th turn's Lee Jihye showed some reaction as if she had finally
remembered her Sponsor.

⸢During the 999th regression turn, the 'Maritime War God' sacrificed
himself to save Lee Jihye.⸥
Perhaps to deny everything that happened during this turn, the powerful
naval bombardment continued on. However, our own Lee Jihye also
responded in kind.

⸢All of the Korean Peninsula's Constellations were with Lee Jihye.⸥

The Monarch of the Great Sea – the realm Lee Jihye reached only during
the extreme-latter part of the 'Ways of Survival', well past the 1800th
regression turns.
She reached the highest position that a human could ever reach and
leapfrogged her own Sponsor to eventually become a god of the oceans. ⸢At
least when on water, she was confident of not being pushed around by any
Myth-grade Constellations.⸥
She actually said those words, and they even became reality later, too –
during the original storyline, she fought the Myth-grade Constellation
Poseidon on an equal footing, at least when they were on the sea.

"Fire!!"

[Attribute 'Monarch of the Great Sea's' effects are activating!]

The storm whipped up from behind Lee Jihye. Waves split up and firestorm
raged on the path she scythed through. It was as if these violent winds were
trying to escort her ship. She stood at the forefront of these winds and
carried on with the shelling.

[Exclusive skill, 'Ghost Fleet Lv.???' is continuing to fight back!]

And then, the giant wall of waves gradually split up.

[Mo nar ch of the Gre at Sea]

[Twotwotwotwotwotwo]

Even the 'Outer Gods' following that side looked to be flustered now.

⸢The Monarch of the Great Sea will never be defeated on water.⸥

That was the accepted rule within the 'Ways of Survival'. I believed in those
words and that allowed us to come this far. However…

"Keuk…"

Along with 'Pu-shu-shuk!' noise, streams of blood shot out from Lee Jihye's
nose and mouth. Her excessively-boiling magical energy had begun flowing
backwards. Not only that…
[Attribute 'Monarch of the Great Sea's' effects are activating!]

That message wasn't caused by the Status from our side.

I thought something was rushing in at us, and in the blink of an eye,
powerful headwinds completely flipped our vision. The [Ghost Fleet] and
[Turtle Dragon] were sucked into the humongous wave and flailed about
within the rising foams.

"Jihye-yah!"

Lee Jihye was flung away like a kite with its strings cut. I reached out and
grasped her wrist. My magical energy helped her to regain her
consciousness, and she somersaulted in the air before landing back on the
deck.

She gritted her teeth and while grabbing the helm, shouted out. "I told you
to run away!"

"I can't do that."

For the current Lee Jihye alone, this was asking for too much. Even if she
had become the 'Monarch of the Great Sea', our opponent had already
attained the Status of that very title a long time ago and now was even an
Outer God, as well.

Tsu-chuchuchuchut!

Due to the blessings from the Great Apocalypse scenario, this calamity had
exceeded even the Myth-grade Constellations. That was precisely who we
were confronting right now.

[Giant Story, 'Demon Realm's Spring', is crying out as if in pain!]

[Giant Story, 'Torch that Swallowed the Myth', is resisting against the
myth!]
[Giant Story, 'Season of Light and Darkness', is revealing itself.]

Three 'Giant Stories' began telling their stories at the same time.


Since a portion of the Giant Stories' shares was being used by the first team,
we couldn't utilise their full powers here. However, we still had enough to
provoke our opponent.

【You are…】

Was my goal of using the white flag to stimulate her memories finally
paying off? Certain aspects of emotions carried within her true voice were
different from before.

Tsu-chuchuchuchut!

[Character, 'Master of the Sunken Island', is staring at the Giant Story.]

['Disconnected Film Theory' is activating!]

Finally, the moments I was waiting for had come. Stories built up by two
different Lee Jihyes collided and the disconnected film threads began
connecting to each other.

If everything goes well, we should be able to buy ourselves a bit of time
through this phenomenon. It was then that the scenery before us suddenly
changed.

[Giant Story, 'Demon Realm's Spring', has begun its storytelling.]

⸢This is the Story of Dokja (only son).⸥

⸢[Please survive.]⸥

⸢"Ahjussi!! Don't! Stop it! I said, stop…!"⸥
These were the memories from when we fought off the 'Indescribable
Distance' for the first time. As if simply recalling them was too painful for
her, Lee Jihye quickly averted her gaze.

…Ah, so she made such an expression back then.

I too could vividly recall those memories.

In order to transport the entirety of the [Industrial Complex], I made a deal
with the 'Secretive Plotter' and fought against that calamity.

【You are…】

However, the expression of the 999th turn's Lee Jihye was crumpling as
well. Another Story unfolded itself before our eyes next.

[Giant Story, 'Wanderer of the Eternal Horizon', has begun its storytelling.]

That was the Story belonging to the 999th turn's Lee Jihye.

The scenery of Seoul, destroyed by Nebulas sneak attacking it, appeared
before us. Next up was the unconscious companions, and finally, the
crumbling outer wall of the castle.

On top of this wall, the one-eyed Yoo Joonghyuk and his lone arm were
staring at the battlefield.

⸢"…This is the only way."⸥

The jet-black aura of Chaos began rising up from his figure.

⸢"Master! Stop! I said, stop!!"⸥

I knew exactly which scene this was. This was where 999th turn's Yoo
Joonghyuk died.

His soul, now in tatters after the 'Outer World Pledge' he signed with the
Outer God was repeatedly invoked, was making his very last trade.
Seoul was now sinking into the deepest bowels of the ocean.

Yoo Joonghyuk spoke. ⸢"You must survive."⸥

And then… the 999th turn's memories were scattering away beyond the
misty, grey foams. From the two eyes of the expression girl, the 'Master of
the Sunken Island', something began trickling down. Certain Stories
wouldn't disappear even when subjected to the untold amount of time. Such
a Story made her come this far.

"Ahjussi, isn't that…"

I looked to my side and saw our Lee Jihye also crying.

"Isn't it… too similar…?"

[Two 'Giant Stories' are responding to each other.]

Of course, the stories had to be similar.

⸢Kim Dokja believed that the most perfect regression turn was the '999th'.
And…⸥

And, I took that turn as my motif, after all.

⸢That regression turn was the closest out of all the others that came close to
the correct conclusion.⸥
It was the only regression turn where everyone survived and got to witness
the Conclusion.

Tsu-chuchuchut!

As the storm of aftermath raged on, the 999th turn's Lee Jihye was
approaching us. The distance closed in with each step taken. I was getting a
bad vibe from this.
"Ahjussi, hurry and fall back!"

Our Lee Jihye also sensed the incoming danger and unsheathed the Twin
Dragon Sword before dashing forward.

The [Instant Kill] – it was the best anti-human combat skill she possessed.
Unfortunately, the streak of swordlight slicing forward was deflected away
in the empty air as the harsh, screeching noise resounded out. And our Lee
Jihye was flung away across the deck, arcs of her blood scattering about.
"Jihye-yah!!"

Lee Hyunsung on standby quickly caught her.

Just as I sighed in relief, the 999th turn's Lee Jihye stopped right before my
nose. Even before I could unshackle my Story and unleash my Status, her
pale yet strong right hand grabbed hold of my collars.

【You… Who are you?】

…Yup, like master, like disciple.

I could only smile wryly.

In any case, the fact that we could now converse wasn't such a bad
development.

"My name is Kim Dokja. Your master's best friend."

【…Best friend??】

The 999th turn's Lee Jihye now formed a confused expression. She then
began staring at the Story circling around me.

⸢"Before you start fighting them, you must search the left-side wall. Then,
you'll immediately realize what I'm trying to say to you."⸥
⸢"I'm telling you this now so that you can fight against the 'Sasquatch'
during the 28th scenario."⸥
My Story was now left wide open for her to read.

【But, how did you…?】

⸢"I'm Yoo Joonghyuk."⸥

【…Master?】

She must've been beset with confusion, as she used her left hand to massage
her temples. Her eyes were burning with ominous aura.

Ku-dududu…!

Her grip on my collars was getting stronger. Ripples of her Status tightened
around my body and I began having trouble breathing.

"H-hang on second. Why don't you let me go and…!"

【Mastermastermastermastermaster】

Outer Gods flooding in parroted her words. With the most sorrowful
language known to man, they cried out instead of the 999th turn's Lee
Jihye. They sounded as if their vocal cords were tearing apart, as if their
whole existence was crumbling away.

[Exclusive skill, 'Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint', is activating!]

[All of your Stories are sympathising with the applicable individual.]

[Your degree of understanding on the applicable individual is increasing
rapidly!]

Her eyes now reflected the moments we had lived in the past.

From the <Demon King Selection Battle>, to <Gigantomachia>; from the
<Great War of Saints and Demons> to the <Journey to the West>. And
then…

[Story, 'Square Circle', has begun its storytelling.]

⸢"You can talk to me any time. If you don't want to talk to me, then it'll be
fine with someone else, too. But you don't have to huddle in a corner and let
it fester inside you."⸥

I now could see the face of the 999th turn's Lee Jihye distorting in great
sorrow. Why did that remind me of the 'Secretive Plotter'?

⸢【Why, why is it not me, but you??】⸥

To the 999th turn's Lee Jihye, the 'Master of the Sunken Island', what did
this story mean to her?

Would she also hate me?

To the lives of this world-line, built upon the history of her and her
companions that I read…

⸢I'm envious.⸥

…What?

Tsu-chuchuchut!

As if she was looking at something she had been longing for all eternity, the
999th turn's Lee Jihye slowly reached out and placed her palm on my
cheek.

Even if it was the same story, the impression one got after reading it would
be different from people to people. Some might despair after seeing the
story he had failed to achieve, while someone else might feel consoled
having seen the sorrow that closely resembled hers. The only issue here
would be with where that consolation effort might go next.
⸢I want to have it.⸥

Her eyes soaked in ancient sorrow suddenly were filled with streaks of
madness. The 999th turn's Lee Jihye slowly turned her head. Her gaze was
now locked firmly on the unconscious Lee Jihye.

⸢I too, want to live this kind of life.⸥

Only then did I realize what this girl was thinking of in her head.

The [Disconnected Film Theory] was writhing violently. The 999th turn's
Lee Jihye reached out, and the vicious air current flew out to envelop our
unconscious Lee Jihye. This was dangerous.

[The Stories of two beings are starting to resonate!]

Accompanied by the 'Euh-jeo-jeok!' noise, the 999th turn's Story began
moving. That Story was now devouring the Story from our world-line. I
freaked out and hurriedly unleashed my Status.

I needed to stop this. No matter what, I must never let the 999th turn's Lee
Jihye devour…

Kwa-dudududu!

Forged steel broke out from the ship's deck and extended in the blink to
protect both me and our Lee Jihye. It was Lee Hyunsung's doing. However,
I sensed that something was different about the Story's aura coming from
the steel barrier. I shifted my gaze towards him.

Lee Hyunsung was there, but it was not him. Someone had borrowed his
body to unleash his powers.

[Incarnation 'Lee Hyunsung's' Sponsor is protecting you!]

This Status was strong enough to evenly match the 'Master of the Sunken
Island'.
The steel wall was ripped apart with loud tearing noises and the 999th turn's
Lee Jihye poked her head through. As if she had been doused by cold water,
her expression was hardened to a frightening degree.

The first one to open his lips was Lee Hyunsung's Sponsor.

【Jihye-yah. Our story had come to an end a long time ago already.】

That was the true voice of an Outer God.

And I realized whose it was instantly.




At the same time.

Han Myungoh, having purchased another [X-grade Ferrarghini] with Coins
he borrowed from Kim Dokja, was hurriedly driving on the dimensional
road. His destination was the sealed-off 'Isle of Reincarnators'.

"Dareum-ah! If you can hear my voice, please answer me! Dareum-ah!"

Han Dareum – that was the name he had given to his daughter. He
continued to wander around all corners of the Dark Stratum and called out
that name.

"Dareum-ah!!!"

And eventually, he discovered a familiar hand poking out from in between
the distorted darkness.

He couldn't not recognise that hand. He had never let go of that hand, right
up until she was snatched away by the Demon King.

Han Myungoh held it tightly. And then, he began extracting his daughter's
body from the layers of darkness. It wasn't an easy job, but he couldn't give
up on it.
[Giant Story, 'Liberator of the Forgotten Ones', has begun its storytelling!]

The <Kim Dokja's Company>'s Story he borrowed in order to find his
daughter began to tell its story. And he managed to extract her body bit by
bit from the layer.

Fortunately, her Incarnation Body was intact. Not so fortunately, though,
her heart wasn't beating. However, he had in his possession a single [Life
and Death Pill] he got from Lee Seolhwa.

"Dareum-ah! Please wake up! It's your dad! Your dad's here for you!"

Han Myungoh called out while crying. And so – how long passed by like
this? Finally, Han Dareum opened her eyes. Reddish light leaked out from
her irises, however.

[…You did well, my dependent.]

What opened its eyes wasn't Han Dareum.

[…The 'Guidance of the End' almost came to an end itself during the Great
War of Saints and Demons.]

The ominous Status of a Demon King could be felt now. Asmodeus formed
a crazed smile, causing Han Myungoh to fall on his butt.

"G-give my daughter back to me! My daughter…!"

[Daughter? H-mm… My apologies, but that will be too difficult. I
definitely need this Incarnation Body. However, allow me to gift you with a
nice present, instead.]

Asmodeus spoke up to there and pulled out a pitch-black eye patch from its
inner pocket.

[The qualification to watch the end of this world-line with me, that is.]
This was an ancient item that had been passed down among the 'Guiders of
the End'. An item that could be used only when the Final Scenario was just
around the corner.

[Item, 'Relic of the Abyss', is activating!]

The 'Other World Incantation' meant to summon the Outer God dyed in the
abyss, the 'Demon of 999'. Asmodeus exploded in a fit of maniacal laughter
as it watched the dimension distort visibly. [Metatron! Agares! Demon
King of Salvation!! This story won't end the way you think it will! This
story, it will-!"

【What the hell is this?】

Since when did this happen? There was a man standing behind Asmodeus.
He was enveloped in the jet-black aura, while bandages were wrapped
around in one of his arms.

Han Myungoh watching this scene unfold five, six steps away began
trembling uncontrollably. He recognised the face of this unknown man.

This mysterious man met his gaze and smiled. 【…Oh, so you have
summoned me? Hmm… what's this? There's a Demon King here, too? Aha,
I get it. This Demon King was busy bullying you, and you summoned me to
save you, right?】

[Oh, the End! That's not true! It is I, Asmodeus, that have summoned you
to…]

Swiiiish!

The man's translucent hand reached out and grabbed the back of
Asmodeus's neck. And a second later, the Demon King's soul form was
captured by the man.

[Keo-heok…??]

【I don't trust the words of those hiding in other people's bodies.】
Asmodeus's soul was then torn to shreds along with the loud 'Pu-hwa-hack!'
noise. The attack didn't even give the Demon King a chance to resist. The
man licked the tattered Story of a demon and grinned brightly.

【I hate Demon Kings the most. They always try to imitate me. I mean,
look! This bastard, he even had the eye patch that I misplaced somewhere,
you know?】

The man muttered to himself and pulled the eye patch off Asmodeus's
former Incarnation Body before putting it on himself. He grinned brightly
as if he was satisfied by his own appearance now. Meanwhile, the trembling
Han Myungoh hurriedly hugged the fallen body of his daughter and looked
up at this man.

【Oii, oii, don't worry, man. I may look a bit scary, but once you get to
know me better, you'll learn that I'm actually a nice guy inside.】 The man
vigorously tapped on his bandages and spoke up. 【Well, then… Shall I go
and find my Jihye now?】
                  Chapter 472: Ep. 90 - One Person, I


The forged steel expanded and protected both me and Lee Jihye.

[Constellation, 'Master of Steel' is revealing his Status.]

Lee Hyunsung's Sponsor was the original 'Master of Steel'. However, he
was killed off during the <Oz> incident the last time. Before that, though,
he managed to successfully hand his Modifier over to someone else.

【King of the Silver Heart.】

The King of the Silver Heart, that was the new 'Master of Steel'. He was yet
another existence who witnessed the 999th turn's Conclusion, alongside the
'Master of the Sunken Island'.

And it was none other than Lee Hyunsung from the 999th turn.

【Stop with your ridiculous charade as a Sponsor. What do you think
you're doing?】
Was it because she was facing another 'King' like her? The 999th turn's Lee
Jihye was rapidly regaining her reasoning.

【You kept silent when we were calling for you, so why are you appearing
like this now?】

The 'Master of the Sunken Island' continued on.

【It was you who suggested that we follow the rules. We promised to find
our stories again even if that meant we'd become the apocalypse of another
world. To get our scenarios back from the <Star Stream>… That's what you
suggested, right?】

The Stories flowing near them helped me to guess what their lives had been
like.

⸢Jihye-yah. We must stick to the rules. Even if we become the 'Outer Gods',
do not forget that rule.⸥

⸢Only that rule will protect you when the world tries to inflict you with
pain.⸥

⸢It'll speak up for you – that you are not wrong.⸥

Just like how Lee Jihyes from different regression turns were still Lee
Jihye, Lee Hyunsungs found in the same turns were also undoubtedly, Lee
Hyunsung. Even after he became an Outer God, his original nature didn't
change.

The 'King of the Silver Heart' stared at me next. I couldn't decipher the
emotions contained within his gaze.

【This is my rule, Jihye-yah. To prevent the re-enactment of the 999th
turn's tragedy.】
【What rubbish are you talking about? Is 'rules' something you can easily
change on a whim like flipping your hand around??】

【I've heard several stories from my Sponsor who used to live this
worldline. In some ways… this world-line could very well be the one we've
been searching for.】 The 'King of the Silver Heart' was glowing coldly as
he spoke. 【The world-line where the 'end' of everything could be
witnessed.】

Those words caused the 999th turn's Lee Jihye to hesitate. 【Such a
worldline can't exist. Besides, this world-line is about to end, anyway. Even
if you interfere, even if I stop…】

It seemed that the 'King of the Silver Heart' chose not to become the
calamity of the 'Great Apocalypse'. I expected something like that, though.
If he really was thinking of harming us, then he'd have done so back in the
<Oz>.

And since I knew that, I decided to bring our Lee Hyunsung here. As a final
hidden card prepared for that one off-chance.

【These people aren't that weak. Uriel alone won't make it.】

The 'King of the Silver Heart' ended his words there. The 'Master of the
Sunken Island' then replied, her empty, wandering eyes staring at the distant
horizon. But then, life returned to her eyes right next moment, with an
expression of someone who saw something quite unpleasant.

【What if she's not alone?】

And then, pitch-black darkness blanketed the world beyond the horizon.

Something we failed to foresee was revealing itself over yonder.
The rest of <Kim Dokja's Company>'s companions were camping out near
Dokdo Island, waiting for 'something' to show up.

A short while after Kim Dokja had disappeared towards the Pacific Ocean,
they started hearing the drumbeat-like noises bellowing out from there
every so often. They flinched every time they heard those noises. No one
said anything about their intermittent flinching movement, but they all
knew what it meant, anyway.

'I want to go and help Kim Dokja'.

However, they endured it. This was all part of their strategy. If they
carelessly made a move here, then forget about saving Kim Dokja,
they might end up losing everything, instead. They simply had to stick
to the plan. According to the plan, this place was… Ku-gugugugu.

It was right then they felt the heat coming from the sky. Powerful
heatwaves completely blanketed the entirety of the ocean. When they
reflexively raised their heads, they were treated to a truly unbelievable
spectacle.

Kim Dokja was right.

⸢The burning, seething sun was falling towards the middle of the ocean.⸥

Han Sooyoung in charge of the control tower shouted out from the top of
Gong Pildu's fortress. "Get ready for battle!!"

This heat was so intense that it felt like even their souls were melting. And
within the solar flames, the bewinged 999th turn's Uriel floated silently.

【Where is the 'Secretive Plotter'?】

⸢The Outer God King, the 'Living Flame' that rises up from the east.⸥

Han Sooyoung swallowed back her saliva after sensing the enormous Status
wafting in front of her. More correctly, she tried to. However, she couldn't
sense any moisture within her mouth as if all of her salivae had evaporated.
She forced her parched throat to speak up.

"And now, we commence with the 'flame extinguishment'."

The flame extinguishment – that was the mission the first team was tasked
with. Han Sooyoung recalled the last words Kim Dokja said to her before
he disembarked.

– Don't kill her. She's also 'Uriel'.

…That damn Kim Dokja. He wanted them to subdue such a thing without
killing it??

The silence continued and the 'Living Flame' narrowed her eyes. 【If you
aren't going to answer…】

"Yoo Sangah!"

The signal was given and Yoo Sangah extended her arms out. As her
Buddhist robe wavered gently, a gigantic Mandala spun around behind her
and it shot towards the sun. The strongest debuff skill <Kim Dokja's
Company> currently possessed was activated.

[Story, 'Hour of Mandala', is activating!]

It was really negligible, but the movement of the sun had become just a
little slower.

The 999th turn's Uriel muttered out. 【…Interfering with time and space?
Is Sakyamuni in this place? I haven't sensed his aura, though?】 Ku-
dudududu!

She clenched her fist and the space-time of the surrounding world shook
powerfully as if it'd shatter at any moment.

Blood leaked out of Yoo Sangah's lips. "This is the best I can do!"
"Jung Heewon! Shin Yoosung!"

Two of them dashed forward after hearing Han Sooyoung's order.

The first one the 999th turn's Uriel discovered was Shin Yoosung. The
shadow of a huge Dragon was cast on the ocean's surface. And then, the
Poison Breath blanketed the sun's destructive conflagration.

【So, you're this world-line's 'Beast Lord'?】

A portion of Uriel's Incarnation Body touched by the Breath changed
colour, but that lasted only for a short while. Her skin reverted back to
normal in the blink of an eye.

"Why don't you try to block this, too!"

That voice came from right beside her, and the 999th turn's Uriel
reflexively swung her sword.

Claaaaaaaang!!

[Flames of Retribution] and [Judge's Sword] collided.

Just one collision and Jung Heewon had to retreat while vomiting out
blood.

[Incarnation 'Jung Heewon' is currently activating 'Hour of Judgement'!]

【The Hour of Judgement? How are you using that technique against
me?】

"Who knows?"

The [Hellfire] covered Jung Heewon's sword, and the wings of Archangel
spread out from behind her back. The 999th turn's Uriel confirmed them
and her expression hardened as she unleashed her Status.

【…So, you are my Incarnation.】
As if to oppose that statement, the power of the Constellation emanated
from Jung Heewon's body as well.

[Heewon-ie is my Incarnation, not yours!]

Two Uriels unleashed their Statuses at each other and began colliding.

The first exchange, then the second; as the collision increased in frequency,
Jung Heewon's expression quickly grew more and more agitated.

"What kind of power is…!"

【I won't get fooled by those ridiculous memories again like the last
time.】

Jung Heewon was forced to go on the defensive in an instant, leading Uriel
to urgently shout out. [■ck! Are you just going to watch and do nothing?!]

Almost at the same time, jet-black flames sneak-attacked the 999th turn's
Uriel on her back. The 'Living Flame' frowned heavily and spoke up. 【The
Black Flame Dragon.】

The Black Flame Dragon shouted out triumphantly, the bandages
unwrapped from both of his arms now. [Kekeke. How did that feel, you
stinking Angel!]

The Absolute Good and the Absolute Evil. Two Narrative-grade
Constellations who used to be sworn enemies once upon a time were
fighting together in order to stop this calamity.

The [Hellfire] and [Black Flame] bore down on the army of the sun. And as
she was bathed in the storm of blinding light rays, Han Sooyoung quietly
shuddered.

'…So strong'.
With just one hand, the 'Living Flame' was fighting against those two
powerful Constellations. This opponent couldn't be pushed back even when
the two of them combined their strengths.

【Me of this turn only amounts to this much? Where is <Eden>? Why are
you fighting alongside these people?】

[■ck, Eden has been destroyed already!!]

【…<Eden> is no more? And you wish to confront me without the blessing
of the Nebula?】

The Living Flame then turned her head away as if to indicate that she had
no more reason to fight these two. The sun's rays seemed to grow even
stronger, then some things began crawling out from the intense heat. They
were 'Outer Gods' that followed her. An army numbering several thousand
was waiting for her command.

【Go. Find the 'Secretive Plotter'.】

Their march began. Countless 'Nameless Ones' possessing burning wings
began descending to the world below. At this rate, the whole of the Korean
Peninsula might get swept aside in an instant.

[Incarnation 'Shin Yoosung' is activating 'Superlative Diverse
Communication Lv.???'!]

Shin Yoosung made her move.

Countless aquatic creatures burst out of the ocean's surface and leapt up to
bite the ankles of the 'Nameless Ones' before dragging them down.

Then, the Master of the Armed Fortress, Gong Pildu joined her as well.
Automated turrets installed atop the defensive walls began spitting out licks
of flames, and the Nameless Ones turning into Swiss cheese all screamed in
pain.
The 999th turn's Uriel spoke up. 【You even accepted such an evil man as
your companion? How pathetic.】

The 'Nameless Ones' continued to march towards unfazed towards Gong
Pildu's fortress. And just as one of the outer walls was about to be destroyed
by the constant attacks of the Outer Gods, Han Sooyoung cried out.

"Lee Gilyoung!"

As if he was waiting for that, Lee Gilyoung immediately appeared above
the wall. Jet-black Status was tightly wrapped around the boy as he roared
out to the sky. When he did, yellowish clouds rushed in from somewhere
and covered up the heavens above. It was only for a moment, but this new
army was vast enough to hide that white-hot star.

[Constellation, 'Ruler of the Deepest Pit', is baring its white fangs.]

【…Demon God Abaddon? Why is a bastard like you here??】

Surprised by an unexpected enemy's entrance, the 999th turn's Uriel
growled menacingly.

With Shin Yoosung and Gong Pildu, and now also Lee Gilyoung added to
the mix, the battle had finally become evenly-matched. Abaddon's yellow
locust swarm threw themselves at the 'Nameless Ones' and blocked them.

[Gah-aaaaaah!!]

The Nameless Ones writhed in pain. The 999th Uriel furrowed her brows.
While easily defending against the Archangel Uriel and the Black Flame
Dragon's combined assault with only one hand, she began concentrating
magical energy on the other. She was planning to break through the
encirclement with her own [Hellfire].

However, there was someone here capable of reading her thoughts first.

"Now! Attack!"
Han Sooyoung's signal prompted a lengthy scythe to leap out from the
surface of the deep ocean.

Accompanied by the slicing noise, a huge wound was inflicted on the
former Archangel's wing. White feathers scattered alongside the Story of
the other world.

【King of the <Underworld>…!】

For the first time ever, the expression of the 999th turn's Uriel had
completely stiffened.

[Nebula, <Underworld>, is releasing the stored-up Story!]

Hades and the portion of <Underworld>'s elite forces crossed over using a
portal. Which included the three Judges as well as Persephone.

The 'Nameless Ones' guarding the sun were brought down, and the
<Underworld>'s Status began pressuring the 999th turn's Uriel. However,
she steadfastly withstood it.

The Incarnations of Sakyamuni and the Archangel Uriel, as well as the
Abyssal Black Flame Dragon. And on top of that, the Myth-grade
Constellation Hades, too. Even though one of her wings was torn from a
sneak attack, and she was currently subjected under the combat force of a
fairly-strong Nebula as well, she was not being pushed back at all.

No, it seemed that she was actually searching for an opportunity to overturn
this situation, instead.

"What are you waiting for?! Hurry up and join them!"

[Constellation, 'Most Ancient Liberator', lazily makes his move as if he
finds this whole affair bothersome.] Ku-gugugugu!

Gloomy clouds rolled in just above the yellow-coloured clouds. Lightning
emitting an ominous bluish glow suddenly crashed down to the ocean
below without holding back.
The heavens breathlessly flickered; a figure of an aloof Constellation was
revealed in between the lightning flares brushing by – a Myth-grade
Constellation blessed with dancing platinum hair and a rather
uniquelyarrogant grin stood there.

The moment the 999th turn's Uriel opened her eyes wide, the Ruyi Jingu
Bang filling up her view powerfully smashed her entire body down.

She failed to withstand the impact force and her Incarnation Body slammed
into the ocean with a deafening explosion noise.
                 Chapter 473: Ep. 90 - One Person, II


"Nice work, Sun Wukong!!"

The clearly-excited Han Sooyoung cried out.

Along with the 'ku-ru-ruk' noise, bloody foams rose up above the ocean.
Not too long after, 999th turn's Uriel revealed herself on the water's surface.
She must've ripped apart the surrounding aquatic creatures before rising up,
because her entire figure was bathed in a crimson hue.

Rather than betrayal, it was the sense of wonderment filling up her
expression.

【…I can't believe it. Great Sage, even you're taking their side?】

Eventually, that wonderment changed into a longing.

The Great Sage detected that change and asked her. [Who might you be,
acting as if you know me?]
【I'm simply recalling a companion-in-arms I lost in the past. I don't have
any desire to fight against you. Get out of the way. All I want is the
'Secretive Plotter'.】

For sure, no will to battle could be felt from her voice.

However, the Great Sage still shook his head. [I also dislike that dour
bastard, but…]

As he smiled indifferently, incredible aura exploded forth from his entire
figure.

[Our maknae will be troubled if that guy dies.]

[Constellation, 'Most Ancient Liberator', is revealing his Status!]

He was the existence who finally liberated his Status previously restricted
by the headband, and he even acquired the powers of an Outer God after a
partial 'Outer God Transformation' had taken place.

Yogoes that fought together with him during the ⸢Journey to the West
Remake⸥ were exiting from the portal to descend on the Pacific Ocean.
[Monkeykingmonkeykingmonkeyking]

'Outer Gods' worshipping different kings got into scuffles with one another.
The ocean soaked in blood tumbled over violently, and the 999th turn's
Uriel began gasping out.

And finally, the taut equilibrium began tilting to one side.

"It's working! Keep pushing!"

Along with Han Sooyoung's voice, <Kim Dokja's Company>'s great Stories
began telling their stories at the same time.

[Giant Story, 'Demon Realm's Spring', has begun its storytelling!]
[Giant Story, 'Torch that Swallowed the Myth', has begun its storytelling!]
[Giant Story, 'Season of Light and Darkness', has begun its storytelling!]

[Giant Story, 'Liberator of the Forgotten Ones', has begun its storytelling!]

Although the main shareholders Kim Dokja and Yoo Joonghyuk were
missing, other members still possessed not-too-shabby percentages of the
Giant Stories' shares. And also, there were some others who had finished
getting ready and were itching to unleash the final strike.

[Only one sun in the sky is enough.]

First, it was Surya appearing along with his train. And then…

[Cutting down Outer Gods have become quite a habit now.]

[Let us combine our strengths, Breaking the Sky Saint.]

"I'm also coming!"

The Breaking the Sky Sword Saint and Kyrgios, plus Jang Hayoung, all
joined in.

And so, the 999th turn's Uriel was pushed on her back foot. Her expression
was gradually being dyed in confusion.

【How… How can all of you be together? What kind of a world-line is
this…??】

She was panicking at the Giant Stories rushing in; their sizes were quite
large, but their contents proved to be even more problematic. Just how was
it possible that such a Story existed?

Just how…?

Three Transcendents riding on the train penetrated past the sun's heat
barrier. Then, an attack containing the outrageous amount of power that
combined [Breaking the Sky Swordsmanship], [Electrification], and even
[Breaking the Sky Force Punch] shot out.

Just as that strike was about to sneak in through Uriel's opening and land on
her…

A chilling sensation suddenly enveloped the nape of Han Sooyoung's neck.

"No, stop!"

[Story, 'Predictive Plagiarism', is urgently revising the story!]

The powerful sensation only she could feel in this whole world arrested her.
And right next second, the noise akin to the time/space of the surrounding
dimension being squeezed dry rang out loudly.

Ka-dudududuk.

Han Sooyoung couldn't tell what was going on before her eyes.

【What's this? Where is 'me' in this regression turn? Could I have been
killed already?】

That rebellious voice sounded as if a portion of the abyss had been taken
away to mould it into reality.

The Transcendents approaching the rear of the Outer God to land the final
strike were falling to earth along with the destroyed train. Indescribably
dark [Black Flames] were burning on the ends of their clothing.

A lone man was standing amidst the gloomy, dark clouds in the sky. He
was someone Han Sooyoung also knew. She knew him so well that
goosebumps were breaking out on her skin.

[Constellation, 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon', is warning you of danger!]
The man slowly opened his mouth. 【Chet. I thought it was Jihye, what
with this much rampaging Status and all. Made a mistake since it's been so
long and all.】

The sun of the 'Living Flame' emitted blinding rays of light. However, the
darkness belonging to the man grew even thicker in response, just like the
shadow lengthening against the light.

The 999th turn's Uriel spoke. 【'The Monarch of the Great Abyss'. Just who
summoned a bastard like you to this world-line?】

The nape of Han Sooyoung's neck grew icy; she remembered what Kim
Dokja told her about the ruler of the northern universe, the 'Monarch of the
Great Abyss'.

【Hahah. You finally called me with that title. Besides all that, you look
like you're in a bit of trouble? Should I help you out?】 The sun's corona
flared up as if it was convulsing.

【I don't need it. Help from a scoundrel like you is…】

【Don't be like that. We're 'companions' from the same regression turn,
after all.】

The man cackled insidiously.

He was none other than the Delusion Demon Kim Namwoon who also
witnessed the 999th turn's 'Conclusion'.

And the moment his gaze moved, Han Sooyoung felt a chill run down her
entire body.

【I also wanna see the Black Dragon's face, since it's been a while.】

Kim Namwoon was already right by her face and he began studying her
with a nefarious gaze.
When his eyes slowly opened up, Yoo Joonghyuk realized that he was
wandering within the darkness alone.

The last thing he could remember was him researching the sure-kill attack
with Kim Dokja. Something went wrong in the middle of that, and he lost
his consciousness…

[Your soul form is currently in an unstable condition!]

[Story, 'Hell of Eternity', is currently in an illegible state.]

⸢When is that idiot Yoo Joonghyuk's birthday, again?⸥

Fragmented memories occasionally drifted in. He heard a voice in between
his blurry consciousness. No, rather than a voice, it was far closer to letters,
instead.

Yoo Joonghyuk quickly recognised whose speech pattern it belonged to.

⸢…The regression turn mentioned for the first time is…⸥

That silly manner of speech capable of irritating a person to no end – only
Kim Dokja spoke like that in the entire world.

⸢Ee-yah~, this part was really entertaining, wasn't it?⸥

Sentences on the pages Kim Dokja was reading brushed past his eyes. Yoo
Joonghyuk saw himself fighting against Constellations right there.

⸢The 1st regression turn, 41st, 666th…⸥

Kim Dokja's fingers tracing the letters suddenly stopped. The information
on a certain regression turn could be spied in between his fingers lingering
on for the longest time.
⸢The 999th turn.⸥

Even Yoo Joonghyuk was aware of the events that happened during that
regression turn. The ⸢Hell of Eternity⸥ was informing him of the time he
couldn't remember through all the texts Kim Dokja had read.

The latter seemed to be muttering softly while reading about that regression
turn.

⸢"I'm Yoo Joonghyuk…"⸥

The real Yoo Joonghyuk didn't know anything about the life supported by
that lame declaration.

'Yoo Joonghyuk' as read by Kim Dokja; his history remained like soot in
between the flow of the pages. Ostracised within school, tormented in his
part-time workplace by a boss busy stealing his wages, and going on a
forced march until soles of his feet became a bloodied mess during his army
days – Kim Dokja endured them all by calling himself Yoo Joonghyuk.

The latter simply couldn't understand the former.

He had no idea what it meant for the time he had to endure ending up
saving someone else living in a completely different world. He just didn't
know what it meant for a person to become more courageous by reading
about someone else's battles.

Not only that, Yoo Joonghyuk even found his own self as seen through
those texts utterly unfamiliar.

⸢"I can still fight."⸥

Did he really say that?

⸢"Doesn't matter whether it's a hundred times or thousand, I shall continue
to be reborn to kill you all."⸥
Was he really the kind of a person to say something like this?

The voices of the companions that trusted him could be found among the
countless texts.

⸢Captain.⸥

⸢I only trust you.⸥

⸢You must save the world in the next turn.⸥

The world-lines kept vanishing, the only things left behind being those
sentences. And as the volume of the words that tormented him increased,
the value of life itself became cheaper.

Just what did they see in him to fight alongside him?

'Who am I?'

Yoo Joonghyuk was overcome with emptiness as he stared at the words
outside his ability to comprehend.

1864 lifetimes.

He already knew what sort of a world he had to cross to get here.

However, he couldn't understand it at all.

⸢Is this really everything of me, these memories?⸥

Yoo Joonghyuk grew curious. If he was really nothing more than a
'character' just as Kim Dokja said, then what happened to the 'time' he
couldn't remember?

Where was himself not among the pages that Kim Dokja had read?

Or, did he not exist from the get-go?
[Your Sponsor is looking closely at you.]

Could he really be able to say from where his life had 'existed' and where it
ended?

Tsu-chuchuchut…

He reflexively looked back at the emptiness as soon as he felt the chilling
sensation. He found someone else other than him there.

【Are you doing an introspection of yourself? You don't have the time to
waste like this.】

Yoo Joonghyuk immediately recognised who it was.

'You shouldn't be able to move still'.

He glared at the 'Secretive Plotter'. He instinctively reached out towards his
[Black Heavenly Demon Sword], but the familiar hilt was nowhere to be
found.

This place was his imagined world. Items didn't exist here.

The 'Secretive Plotter' stared back at him and shook his head in
disappointment. 【At this rate, all of your companions will be
annihilated.】

'Annihilated?'

Cold sensation crept down his back.

His companions were about to enter a dangerous battle against the 'Outer
God King'. He could definitely sense the ominous aura flowing around in
the surroundings.

He needed to wake up at once. He needed to get out of here, and…
【There's no point in going with your current state. If you can't utilise the
power of the 1863rd turn, then you won't prove to be any help
whatsoever.】

'So what? What are you saying?'

Yoo Joonghyuk growled menacingly, yet the Secretive Plotter remained
unruffled. 【You have another way of utilising the power of the 1863rd
turn.】

Right away, he deciphered the meaning behind those words.

The only reason why he could regain the power of the 1863rd turn for a
short moment was due to Kim Dokja's Story, ⸢Hell of Eternity⸥. And the
one who gave that fool his Story was…

Yoo Joonghyuk gritted his teeth and asked.

'You expect me to trust you? And why are you trying to help us?'

【I was asked for a favour.】

'…A favour?'

【I'll lend you my powers just this once. I hope that you learn something
from this.】

The 'Secretive Plotter' reached out from the darkness. There was no time to
dodge, and the cold palm of a boy touched Yoo Joonghyuk's forehead. And
then…

['Disconnected Film Theory' is activating!]

Accompanied by pain severe enough to blank out the inside of his head, a
humongous Story flooded in. These were memories he already knew.
However, they were also the ones he failed to understand. Every Story of
'Secretive Plotter' coursed within his bloodstreams while emitting white-hot
heat.

The 1st turn, 2nd, 3rd, 4th… and then, 1863rd.

Countless Yoo Joonghyuks were waking up within him.

All of them were Yoo Joonghyuk. Each of them was Yoo Joonghyuk. But
at the same time, Yoo Joonghyuk was just one person.

The one person, who managed to live through 1864 lifetimes.

He began remembering things one by one.

Such as, who he was.

What he lived for.

Stories were circling around his vicinity. Within the Story, someone was
asking this.

⸢"By the way, when is Captain's birthday?"⸥

That prompted Kim Dokja to reply.

⸢Ah, I found it. It was over here. Third of August.⸥

Right. He was born in the summer. A hellishly hot and humid summer,
when horrible storms were lashing out.

He could remember everything so vividly now.

His birthday that no one celebrated or congratulated him for. All those
anniversaries that lost their meanings as he went through 1864 lifetimes.

Yoo Joonghyuk slowly opened his eyes. The energy of Story completely
saturated his whole body. This feeling was something he had not felt before
during this '3rd' turn.
He raised his head and sensed the hot rays of the sun.

Even so far away, he could still clearly sense it – the 'Outer God's' presence
calling out to him from beyond the faraway horizon. However, he didn't
feel scared.

He slowly raised his body up and confirmed the condition of his Incarnation
Body. Every single part of it was operating at a near-perfection.

Stories he had compiled so far were permeating within every fibre of his
being.

⸢In that very moment, Yoo Joonghyuk felt as if he was reborn.⸥

[Giant Story, 'Pilgrim of the Lonely Apocalypse', has recovered its
complete Status.]

This was the true power he originally possessed, the Status of a being who
reached the final turn of the world and witnessed the 'Wall' by himself
alone.

['Disconnected Film Theory' is currently activating in an abnormal manner.]

[Connection between films is incomplete.]

[The entire film may cease to exist if this connection is forcibly
maintained.]

He could only rely on this power for a brief time. However, it was more
than enough for him. Yoo Joonghyuk raised his head and looked up at the
sky.

The heavens were screaming out. The flashes of lightning strikes vividly
illuminated the scars engraved on his face every so often.

[Story, 'Hell of Eternity', has begun its storytelling!]

[Attribute, 'Terror of the Stars', is activating!]
His glare caused the stars to run away in fear.

Yoo Joonghyuk stared at them for a moment, before his figure flashed
towards the distant sun.
                Chapter 474: Ep. 90 - One Person, III


Han Sooyoung just couldn't believe what was happening before her eyes.
The Transcendents fell in an instant, and Underworld's Judges were also
defeated one after the other.

"Get back, Han Sooyoung!"

As the loud 'Clang!!' resounded out, Jung Heewon standing before her was
flung away. The Story mushroomed out from the man grinning
mischievously as if he was playing around.

[Giant Story, 'Delusional Design', has begun its storytelling!]

The entire body of the Monarch of the Great Abyss, the 999th turn's Kim
Namwoon, began emitting the [Black Flame]'s aura. That aura soon became
a silhouette of a dragon with several heads. Its maws split wide open, and
soon after, destructive air currents blanketed everything in the
surroundings.

Kwa-aaaaaaaah!!
"Yoosung-ah! Gilyoung-ah!"

The exploding chain of the [Black Flame] swallowed the kids.

Yoo Sangah left the battlefield in order to rush out and save them, causing
the time/space debuff restraining the 999th turn's Uriel to weaken.

Go-oooooh!

She was regaining her original strength after a short period of it shrinking
back.

The 999th turn's Kim Namwoon cackled after witnessing that sight.
【Well, now. What would've happened without my help, I wonder?】

【Shut your mouth. Once I find the 'Secretive Plotter', you're next.】

She shot Kim Namwoon a terrifying glare and then swung her [Flames of
Retribution] towards the battlefield.

The one opposing her was the Great Sage. The Ruyi Jingu Bang dancing
around stylishly blocked off her sword strikes. Kim Namwoon watched the
Great Sage match up evenly to an 'Outer God King' and was thoroughly
impressed by this sight.

What caught his attention even more, was the pitch-black aura oozing out
from the Great Sage's entire figure.

【The Status of Chaos? Did this guy also become an 'Outer God', too?】

【…More correctly, it seems that one of his entities have become one.】

【Hahaha, what the hell. What's up with this world-line?】

【I shall take care of him, so you bastard, go and take care of the small fries
plus the King of the Underworld.】
【Chet, I also wanted to have a go at the Great Sage just like someone else,
you know.】

Perhaps enraged by the garbage he just heard, the Great Sage roared on and
poured out his magical energy. The golden aura blanketed the entire sky
and for a moment there, forced back the [Black Flame]'s attacks.

Unfortunately, he had to suffer quite severe aftermaths all over his body as
his price.

[…Goddammit, Meihouwang! Get a grip, man!]

It seemed that the Great Sage's Stories, combined temporarily for this event,
were colliding with each other. And now, he was being slowly pushed back
from the barrage of the 999th turn's Uriel.

The Myth-grade Constellations acting as the final redoubt were being
forced back, as well; the situation on Hades's side was even worse.

Kwa-gwagwagwagwa!!

It was unknown whether <Olympus> holding him back or the internal issue
within the <Underworld> itself was to blame, but for some reason, Hades's
battle came across as rather stifling, unsatisfactory.

【Hahaha! The 'King of the Underworld', one of the three Gods of
Olympus, amount to only this much?】

Hades frowned and continued to silently wield his scythe, but he was still
pushed back, forcing Persephone behind telling the Giant Story to step
forward as well.

[Did you know? Your soul is currently trapped in the Underworld in this
world-line.]

【What rubbish are you talking about? Why am I locked up in there?】
The 999th turn's Kim Namwoon grew irritated and suddenly poured out a
huge amount of [Black Flame]. Hades was struck by the attack capable of
melting the space itself and his gigantic frame crashed into the ocean.

Han Sooyoung shuddered; that was definitely a type of the [Black Flame]
she was familiar with. But just how long did anyone have to train in order
to control it to such a degree?

【This is so weird. You telling me that the Black Flame has chosen
someone like you as his Incarnation?】

When she raised her head, the 999th turn's Kim Namwoon was already
right in front of her eyes.

Han Sooyoung flinched, but before she could shrink back, his hand
approached her. The moment she realized it was too late to dodge, sparks
danced in the air and his hand was deflected away.

[Constellation, 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon', is growling.]

【…Oiii, what's this? I'm the real one, Black Flame Dragon-ah.】

Kim Namwoon's eyes gently arced as if he was dealing with a cute puppy.

[Constellation, 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon', declares that "you, bastard,
aren't my Incarnation".]

【Aha. So you got yourself a shiny new car in this place, is that it?】 A
streak of chilling madness flashed by Kim Namwoon's eyes. 【In that case,
I guess I should turn it into a scrap heap first.】 Kaaaa-booooom!

An explosion going off right in front of her nose caused Han Sooyoung's
body to fly backwards. She tried to minimise the impact force by shrinking
herself, but even then, she still vomited out a mouthful of blood. She had
her Sponsor to thank for not getting killed in that attack.
[Constellation, 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon', is shouting at you to run
away!]

The Abyssal Black Flame Dragon personally incarnated into the skies and
wrapped around her as if to protect her. A giant dragon seemingly
sculptured out from a slab of obsidian angrily roared out into the world, its
eyes seemingly carved out from a pair of rubies burning brightly.

【Hahahaha! This is it! Now this is more like my Black Flame Dragon!】

The two existences commenced with their fierce battle, causing the ocean to
buckle as if it was being relentlessly bombarded. Shattered fragments of
islands flew about, and the Black Flame Dragon's Breath enveloped the
entire sea.

[Constellation, 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon', is revealing his Status!]

Unfortunately, it was difficult to stop Kim Namwoon after he had become
an Outer God, even if it was the Black Flame Dragon doing the fighting.

From the get-go, this opponent was an existence descending to the world as
a calamity; the total amount of Probability he was allowed to use was on
another scale.

Han Sooyoung began thinking. What should they do in order to stop this
utterly nonsensical creature?

⸢If it was Kim Dokja, what could he have done?⸥

[Story, 'Predictive Plagiarism', has begun its storytelling!]

It was right then that faint sparks danced around her as a sharp pang of pain
rang inside her head.

⸢How disappointing. Even in this situation, you're still relying on him?⸥
That was a voice she heard before in the past. In a dream she had, when she
was still progressing through the 'Isle of Reincarnators'.

Inside that dream where a man wearing the white coat was killed by another
wearing the black coat, Han Sooyoung definitely heard that voice.

⸢It's because you're like this that that fool was so full of himself in my
regression turn.⸥
The Story was actually talking to her.

'You are…'

⸢I wasn't planning to interfere anymore, but… I'm going to help you one
more time.⸥
The voice sounded as if it was being very generous to her. Along with the
sensation of time slowing down greatly, her cognitive ability expanded as
well. Countless Han Sooyoungs woke up inside her head and opened their
mouths at the same time.

⸢Everything that happens in the world has already happened. There's
nothing to be surprised about.⸥
A visceral sensation seemingly hardwired to the future completely took
hold of her brain. An ability that could create a world she didn't know
previously by combining numerous cliches, patterns, and given
information, went to work. The memories of the 'Ways of Survival' she
read, the info she heard from Kim Dokja, and the info she gleamed herself,
were pieced together logically to write a new story.

Someone was laughing now.

⸢That's right. Now that is the true [Predictive Plagiarism].⸥

And Han Sooyoung realized what she needed to do now.
[Story, 'Predictive Plagiarism', is continuing on with its storytelling!]

She couldn't tell if it'd work or not. However…

'…If it's Kim Dokja, he'd have done it'.

⸢Again, again you…!⸥

The Black Flame Dragon's loud, rough roar covered up the entire sky. The
battle had been going on only for a brief while, yet the creature's proud
figure was riddled with wounds both large and small. Just as the dragon
spread open its torn wings to pour out a Breath…

"That's enough, Flame Dragon-ah."

[Constellation, 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon', is…]

"Let me take care of this, so believe in me and take a step back."

The Black Flame Dragon's eyes were quickly dyed in confusion after seeing
Han Sooyoung step forward as if to protect her Sponsor. Rather than
explaining herself to the dragon, she took yet another step forward.

【Hoh-oh, so you want to fight me personally? With that chestnut-sized
body of yours?】

The 999th turn's Kim Namwoon emitted an incredible amount of aura. The
Giant Story ⸢Delusional Design⸥ wielded grinder-like sharp blades, already
fully prepared to cut and slice Han Sooyoung up at any given moment.
However, she didn't seem to be fazed at all.

"Kim Namwoon. You haven't changed even after becoming an Outer God."

【What's this? You sound like you know about me?】

"Right, I know a lot about you. You, the idiot who failed to fulfil his
unrequited love and even after becoming an Outer God, is still chasing after
a girl."
The 999th turn's Kim Namwoon's jaw slowly dropped.

⸢All Outer Gods have lost their memories. Or, what little remains are
unstable.⸥

⸢In that case, how did 'Kings' retain their memories?⸥

⸢Could it be that those memories are far too precious to them?⸥

"The dude who couldn't even confess properly when good opportunities
presented themselves, yet still puts on underwear with giant robots on them
just in case."

【…You, you! What the hell are you?! How do you know something that
not even my captain knew…?!】

"The reason why you always bandage your hand is probably to hide that
self-inflicted wound on your wrist, right? You didn't want Lee Jihye to
discover that."

Kim Namwoon was momentarily overcome by fluster, but he managed to
quickly fix his expression.

"Why do you like Lee Jihye?"

[Story, 'Forty-Thousand-Year-Old Crush', is getting agitated.]

【…T-that is, because Jihye is pretty…】

"Nope. You might be trash, but you don't have the setting of lusting after
women."

【Setting? What the hell are you talking about…】

"The reason why you like Lee Jihye so much is because she trusts and
follows Yoo Joonghyuk."
【What dogshit is…】

"You wanted to be acknowledged by her. That you're good enough to
replace Yoo Joonghyuk."

[Giant Story, 'Delusional Design', is getting greatly agitated!]

"Actually, you just wished to become like Yoo Joonghyuk."

Han Sooyoung stared deeply into the eyes of the 999th turn's Kim
Namwoon that were getting colder and harder.

【What an entertaining… story. However, I don't have much time left, you
see? I ain't gonna listen to your bull…】

Han Sooyoung didn't know whether saying these things were a right move
or not. No, in truth, she knew it wasn't one. Even then, she simply had to
say them. In order to save this world, she must…

"And by doing that, you… want to be forgiven by Lee Jihye."

…Must ruthlessly dig into the old wounds from another world.

"If it weren't for your mistake, the 999th turn's Yoo Joonghyuk
wouldn't have died, after all." Tsu-chuchuchut!

Almost instantly, sparks exploded forth from the entire figure of the 999th
turn's Kim Namwoon. Sounds of something creaking could be heard next.
The foundational Stories that formed his core were cracking apart. Those
were noises of his memories breaking down.

【You…】

The enraged Kim Namwoon hurriedly gathered up his Stories now
swimming in confusion and roared out. The light in his eyes faded in and
out repeatedly.

Han Sooyoung quietly observed him in the meantime.
⸢Even [Predictive Plagiarism] can't know everything.⸥

Her overheating head felt hot as if it was burning in flames.

She hadn't read the entirety of the 'Ways of Survival' like Kim Dokja had
done, nor did she live through the 999th turn for real like Yoo Joonghyuk.

However, there were certain things she could still tell without having to
hear or see them. That was the power of imagination – the power to infer
the context even though she didn't know the finer details of a particular
story.

As long as there was a situation, its development pre-arranged, and with the
'Probability' existing in this world…

Her 'Predictive Plagiarism' could exercise a near-omniscient level of power.

"Kim Namwoon."

Han Sooyoung walked in the sky one step at a time. He staggered about,
hugging his Stories while growling like a wounded beast.

⸢Han Sooyoung stared at such Kim Namwoon's Story.⸥

It was the same for Yoo Joonghyuk as well as the Constellations.

All creatures that lived for a long time were the same; just as their strengths
were reflected in their history, so did their weaknesses, also reflected in
their past. That was the fate of the ones telling such stories, the ones being
told in those stories.

Like an author using a pen to scribble out unnecessary parts, Han Sooyoung
reached out towards Kim Namwoon.

⸢Just like when Kim Dokja made the 1863rd turn's Yoo Joonghyuk give in.⸥
"You probably want to go back to those times. However, you must've
despaired at the fact that you can never go back."

【Y-you, if you keep running your mouth…!】

"However, you need to know this. The world-line you lived in is over, and
the people you loved aren't going to come back. And the likes of you can
never become Yoo Joonghyuk. You can never save anyone nor can you
atone for your sins."

Kim Namwoon's cheeks were trembling. The foundation of a being who
witnessed the 'Conclusion' of the 999th regression turn and became an
'Outer God King', was unsteadily shaking about. He made an expression of
a man whose every Story had been lost. In that moment, his face was of a
seventeen-year-old boy thrown into the world for the first time. His Story
that existed for tens of thousands of years, his unshakeable delusions he had
built up all this time, were crumbling apart with just a few well-placed
words.

【N-no, that's not true. I, I am…】

Han Sooyoung spoke as if she was putting the full stop on that small crack.
"You are simply an eternal prisoner trapped in this stinking <Star Stream>,
that's all."

Pah-chuchuchut!

【Kim Namwoon!!】

The 999th turn's Uriel roared out in her true voice, and Kim Namwoon's
fading consciousness woke back up.

[Story, 'Companion of Desperate Spirit', has begun its storytelling!]

The only thing capable of rebuilding a broken Story was another Story.
Kim Namwoon's Story that she worked so hard to disrupt was regaining its
original shape. Light was returning to his eyes, too. Han Sooyoung could
only smile wryly.
'Goddammit, I thought it was going well. Still, did I hurt him at least a little
bit?'

Soon, great rage filled up Kim Namwoon's eyes.

【…Haha, I almost got done in there. I see, so there was a reason why the
Black Flame Dragon had chosen you.】

A powerful premonition of death washed over her. The [Predictive
Plagiarism] tautly spinning around suddenly sagged like a snapped tape.
The tragic premonition of death being unavoidable no matter where she ran
off to.

It was then, she heard that voice again alongside the 'Tsu-chut!'

⸢This should be enough. Because the protagonist is here.⸥

Her senses seemingly connected to the future rapidly grew murky. Kim
Namwoon's fist raised up high towards the sky froze still. Everyone within
the battlefield could sense it. Something incredible was approaching them.

Ku-gugugugu!

A 'Status' that simply by its existence alone could lead a world to its
annihilation.

The first one to react was the 999th turn's Uriel. 【It's him!!】

She roared out a horrifying howl towards the skies and quickly left the
battle, before flinging herself towards the direction of that Status.

Kim Namwoon too stared in that direction. 【You… You got really lucky
this time. Next time we meet, I will…】

He alternated his gaze between Han Sooyoung and the Black Flame Dragon
and hesitated, before disappearing in the direction of where Uriel had gone
off to. Having lost all sense of tension, she plopped down on her butt on top
of the Dragon's body. She stared beyond the horizon where those two had
disappeared and recalled the last thing Kim Dokja said to her.

– Han Sooyoung, if in the one-in-a-million chance that something goes
wrong…

– Will you stop planting those ominous foreshadows already??

She thought that such things wouldn't happen.

– No matter what, you gotta endure until that guy shows up.

"That bastard. Making such a cool entrance and stuff."

She could hear thunderclaps going off in the distant night sky, stained by
the auras of the [Hellfire] and [Black Flame].

A man with an ancient face was descending on the heavens of end times.
                Chapter 475: Ep. 90 - One Person, IV


The coat dancing against the strong winds, that indescribable Status leaking
out nonstop from the [Black Heavenly Demon Sword].

Han Sooyoung definitely knew that guy. But even then, why was this? At
least in this very moment, he seemed like a completely different existence
to her.

"…Are you really Yoo Joonghyuk?"

He glanced in her direction, before spinning around towards the Pacific
Ocean with a loud boom. She panicked and cried out.

"Hey, you! Where are you going?!"

【After him!!】

The 999th turn's Uriel and Kim Namwoon chased after him next.

Han Sooyoung only then realized what his intentions were. Yoo Joonghyuk
was trying to lure these Outer Gods away from the companions.
"That crazy idiot…"

"Sooyoung-ssi, are you alright?"

Yoo Sangah came closer and supported her. The moment she leaned against
her shoulders, Han Sooyoung ended up vomiting all the blood flowing
backwards inside her.

"Bleeergh-!"

Her head felt hot as if every blood vessel in it was burning up. Sparks went
wild as if to scorch her frontal lobe. She endured the pain and shouted out.
"Great Sage! Hades! Uriel! You must hurry and chase after Yoo
Joonghyuk! The rest of us will take care of this place, so please hurry! You
mustn't let that guy fight alone!"

[<Star Stream> has noticed your Story.]

[You have used a power that went against the Probability!]

"Keok…"

Her vision dizzily spun around; her internals hurt as if they had completely
overturned.

[Your Incarnation Body is being swept up in the storm of aftermaths!]

Han Sooyoung detected a powerful force about to explode within her body
and hurriedly shouted out. "Yoo Sangah! Get away!"

However, Yoo Sangah held Han Sooyoung's shoulders even tighter and
shook her head. The power of Sakyamuni she had inherited was being
transmitted through the hand touching the latter's shoulder. The time and
space twisted, slowing down the growth of the aftermaths' storm. "Fight it.
You can do it. I also fought it off and survived in the past, too."

"Goddammit."
Muscles all over her body were moaning out. Faint terror seeped inside her
amongst all the horrifying pain. She had been habitually muttering out
about being careful around the Probability, yet here she was, making a
critical mistake like this. She mistakenly thought that, since a fool like Kim
Dokja managed to survive until now, she'd somehow make it through this
one, too.

Tsu-chuchuchut!

…Was she going to die? So meaninglessly like this?

[Story, 'Predictive Plagiarism', has begun its storytelling!]

It was around here that the signs of the aftermath's storm gradually
softened.

Han Sooyoung witnessed letters covering up her Incarnation Body. Those
were words she wrote in the past – words she secretly wrote in the note pad
so that neither Kim Dokja nor Yoo Joonghyuk could find out later. And
now, those words were leaking out from the flapping pages of the note pad
to wrap around her body.

However, there were some sentences she hadn't written before mixed in
among them.

⸢You're indeed me, so your writing skill isn't too shabby, I guess.⸥

The voice sounded half-mocking and half-satisfied.

[Story, 'Predictive Plagiarism', is bearing the aftermath's storm in your
stead.]

Tsu-chut, chuchuchut…

As the storm of Probability's aftermaths weakened, the letters began
scattering away gradually faster and faster.
Han Sooyoung wanted to ask. About these sentences, about what they
actually were. Unfortunately, she didn't have enough energy left to even ask
a question anymore.

⸢…This is probably as far as I can go. Send the word out to Kim Dokja.⸥

[The vestige of another world-line permeating within your Story has begun
dissipating.]

As her consciousness faded out, her Story continued to speak to her.

⸢What waits for him in the 'Conclusion' he wishes for is…⸥




While supporting Lee Jihye, I stared at the two 'Outer God Kings'.

They had lived in the same regression turn, and they also saw the same end
of the world, yet they became two different beings.

[Giant Story, 'Wanderer of the Eternal Horizon', has begun its storytelling.]

[Giant Story, 'Heart Sealing the Sorrow', has begun its storytelling!]

I could see the cross-section of the Story laid bare within the sparks dancing
in the air. The story they compiled together line by every line with their
blood – this was the story from the regression turn that I loved the most.
The one that I had read many times over.

⸢"Captain Yoo Joonghyuk. It's a relief that you are a regressor."⸥

The 'King of the Silver Heart' glanced in my direction.

The 999th turn's Lee Hyunsung – the sorrow contained within his Story
was being transmitted to me through my [Reading Comprehension]. ⸢"It'll
be okay for me to stop being sad, yes? You're going to die, anyway. Even
if you die, we'll be able to meet again in the next turn. And you'll continue
your story in that place… And, you'll get to restart this journey once more,
won't you?"⸥

The Story of Steel was crying.

⸢"I'm sorry, Lee Hyunsung."⸥

The forged steel expanded with loud noises and swallowed up his words.
Tears that should've flowed out remained frozen within his eyes, dyed in
the silvery light.

⸢"There's no need to apologise. We'll be seeing the Conclusion before you,
after all. The end you wanted to see, the promises you couldn't keep, all of
them, I'll carry them all without missing a single one."⸥

The 999th turn's Lee Hyunsung was looking at me. He was not the 'Lee
Hyunsung' I knew, but even then, he was definitely 'Lee Hyunsung'.

 –        You resemble that person greatly. Even more so than what I
 heard from mySponsor.

The voice of the 999th turn's Lee Hyunsung entered my head. He even
smiled gently, as if he knew what I was thinking about already.

How could this be? How could a man who had to endure such tragedies, be
able to form that kind of expression?

 –         And that's why I won't let you die.

I knew that he didn't hold any hostilities towards us. But I didn't think he'd
go this far to side with us, either. Just what kind of a Story did the 'Master
of Steel' hand over to him as he died?

【Hyunsung ahjussi.】

The one to cut the flow was the 999th turn's Lee Jihye.
【It's been a long time since you called me that.】【I

have no plans of hurting you. Get out of the way.】

Two neverending Stories intertwined with each other.

Lee Hyunsung spoke, sounding as if he was reminiscing about an ancient
memory. 【I'm sorry, but I can't do that.】

【Why are you stopping me? Ahjussi, you refused to be summoned as the
'calamity', didn't you? It was us who negotiated with the Bureau of this
world-line, not you.】

…So, I guess it really was the Bureau who summoned the 999th turn's
beings as calamities.

Lee Hyunsung maintained his silence for a bit before replying coldly.
【Never negotiate with the <Star Stream>. That was our promise.】

【So? What happened to us as the result of that promise?】

【…】

【We destroyed the Bureau, we fought the Dokkaebi King. Then, after we
clashed against the 'Final Wall'… I'm asking you, what happened to us after
that?】

The Final Wall – it seemed that they had witnessed that wall, as well. The
'Wall' that the 'Yoo Joonghyuk' of the original had eventually reached, too.

The 999th turn's Lee Jihye shuddered before continuing on. 【Just like you
said, our story has ended. The world-line we used to live in was destroyed,
and it's just us four that became 'Outer Gods' after surviving that
destruction.】
【We promised to overcome the 'Final Wall' even if we become the
existences outside the scenarios.】

【That wall isn't something we can overcome. You also know this.】

【In this world-line…】

【Stop it with 'this world-line' nonsense! What's so special about this
worldline, anyway? This place is exactly the same as the one we used to
live in. It's a world-line that's going to end soon.】

Lee Jihye of this world-line staggered as I supported her. Her lips were
trembling ever so slightly.

The 'Master of the Sunken Island' continued on. 【The Great Dokkaebis
that got in contact with us said this, that they were going to abandon this
worldline. That they are planning to recycle it and use it as the start of a
new story.】

Those words caused the 'King of the Silver Heart' to change his expression.
The previously-warm aura dissipated and the sensation of cold metal spread
out.

A chilling voice came out from the forged steel's lips. 【…What kind of a
deal did you make with the Bureau?】

【If this world is about to sink underneath the ocean, it's fine for us to
destroy it personally, right?】

【Jihye-yah.】

The 999th turn's Lee Jihye was smiling, but I wasn't sure whether I could
truly describe that expression of 'smiling' or not.

【The 'Dokkaebi King' of this world promised us that if we destroyed this
world-line, then he'd revive our own world-line. He'd get in touch with the
'Oldest Dream' and allow us to start our stories again.】
Lee Jihye's shoulders were trembling. I too was also sharing in that
shuddering.

That was the reason for the 999th turn's beings to cross into this world.
Even at the cost of destroying another world, they wished to regain theirs.

The 'King of the Silver Heart' replied. 【Our goal wasn't to regain our
world, but to find the true culprit of all these tragedies.】

【What will change even if we did?】

【If we wish to carry out our captain's wishes, we…】

【Even if we eliminate the source of the tragedies, the time we lost won't
come back. Our dead companions won't come back to us. The world we
lived in, it's not going to come back… The 999th turn's Yoo Joonghyuk
who died there, he's never coming back.】 Ku-gugugugu.

Something was approaching this location from afar while tearing through
the horizon.

The 'Master of the Sunken Island' spoke again. 【That's why we don't have
a choice but to end it all and start again.】

The tsunami waves that lost its vigour began rising up once more.

The 999th turn's Lee Hyunsung hurriedly started the [Steel Transformation]
and protected us with his metal. However, the force behind the waves was
stronger and faster than the metal's growth speed.

【You can't stop me. I told you this before that I'm not the only one here.】

Kwa-kwakwakwakwa!

The crimson sunset cast from behind us was burning up the heavens. That
was the power of the 'Living Flame', the 999th turn's Uriel.

And the meaning of her approaching here meant…
"Ahjussi, it can't be…?!"

Lee Jihye grasped my sleeve.

I looked into her eyes and reassured her. "Don't worry. Things you're
worried about will not happen."

I was also saying to that myself.

"Our story, it's not as weak as you fear."

[Constellation, 'Demon King of Salvation', is revealing his Status.]

[Constellation, 'Watcher of Light and Darkness', is revealing his Status.]

[Constellation, 'Prisoner of the Constrictive Headband', is revealing his
Status.]

The 'Demon King of Salvation', the 'Watcher of Light and Darkness', plus
the third Modifier I earned by putting on the constrictive headband – all of
my Stories were emitting light at the same time.

I walked over to Lee Hyunsung standing before us. "Thank you for helping
us out. However, it's alright not to push yourself."

【It's dangerous. You must hide behind m…】

"This isn't the 999th turn."

In front, the 'Master of the Sunken Island'. And at the back, the 'Living
Flame'. There was no place to run now.

The shadow cast by the massive battleship dawned upon us. And while
standing on the top of that huge wave, the 999th turn's Lee Jihye muttered
out as if she was mocking someone.
【Everything will go back. Just like what the captain told us, we'll also
regress. We'll go back to the past, and start everything from scratch. When
we do…】

The waves rolled in and crashed into us. I used the power of the 'Giant
Story' to deal with that Status. I felt searing pain from both of my hands
defending against the wave.

I saw the horizon where the sun and the ocean met just beyond the rumbling
walls of the foams. The boundary that we could never reach no matter how
far we run.

Kwa-aaaaaah!

And then, that boundary split apart right before my eyes. A single blade
was actually cutting that boundary down.

As she fell hard from the wave's highest-spot, the 999th turn's Lee Jihye
was looking at us.

More correctly, at a man standing next to me.

"You can't change anything with regression. I needed a very long time to
realize this."
                 Chapter 476: Ep. 90 - One Person, V


I sensed the power of a vast Story oozing out from Yoo Joonghyuk's entire
frame.

[<Star Stream> can't take its eyes away from the Incarnation, 'Yoo
Joonghyuk'!]

The will of the entire world was now paying attention to him.

[Absolute majority of Constellations watching the scenario have raised their
wariness due to the existence of Incarnation, 'Yoo Joonghyuk'.]

[Constellations of the 'Final Scenario' are stunned by the Story of
Incarnation, 'Yoo Joonghyuk'.]

[Portion of the Bureau's Great Dokkaebis are demanding a ⸢Probability
Suitability Evaluation⸥!]

[The 'King of Stories' has rejected the demand.]
[The ⸢Probability Suitability Evaluation⸥ is restricted within the applicable
scenario.]

Every single Yoo Joonghyuk's Story that I knew felt 'complete' now. This
feeling couldn't simply be described as him merely becoming stronger. This
'Yoo Joonghyuk' before my eyes was a different existence to the one I
became familiar with.

I got a little tense as I asked him. "Our companions?"

"Safe."

"You being here means the 'Secretive Plotter' has decided to do me that
favour, right?"

My final alternative plan in case even the plan B failed was to awake the
sleeping Yoo Joonghyuk.

[Incarnation 'Yoo Joonghyuk' currently has abnormally activated the
'Disconnected Film Theory'.]

Tsu-chut…

[Film's connection is incomplete!]

[The entire film may cease to exist if this connection is forcibly
maintained.]

The last-ditch method that I didn't want to resort to if at all possible, yet
simply had to when left with no other options – the greatest ace up our
sleeve we currently possessed.

['Yoo Joonghyuks' of all the regression turns are now looking at you.]

And I felt distant, numerous gazes coming from within him. Suddenly, I
had this ominous foreboding. What if this Yoo Joonghyuk wasn't the 'Yoo
Joonghyuk' that I knew of…?
"Excuse me, but which regression turn Yoo Joonghyuk are you?"

He then stared at me. I could see the thick scar on his cheek, a wound the
3rd turn Yoo Joonghyuk didn't possess. I was about to ask something else,
but then, several sentences flowed out from his body as if to shut my
mouth.

⸢Terror of All Stars⸥

⸢Strongest Incarnation in Star Stream's history⸥

⸢The Iron-blooded Supreme King⸥

⸢The Usurper of the Scenarios⸥

The history he had lived so far was floating up as the crude, coarse
sentences from the 'Ways of Survival'. The sentences gathered to become a
Story, and that story soon became the man standing before my eyes, the
existence that waded past 1864 lives.

"I am Yoo Joonghyuk."

He was not Yoo Joonghyuk from any of the regression turns. Not from the
0th turn, not from the 1st, and not even from the 1863rd.

He was simply Yoo Joonghyuk from all regression turns.

【…Captain??】

The 999th turn's Lee Jihye dazedly looked at us, her eyes wide open in
disbelief.

And then, another Lee Jihye shouted out at that girl. "Master! Hurry!
Take care of her! She's trying to destroy our world-line!" She yelled out
with so much anger.
I was thinking of adding something there. However, such thoughts scattered
away the moment I saw Yoo Joonghyuk's side profile. He didn't bother to
assume the attacking stance and simple stared at the two 'Outer Gods'
present here.

[Character, 'Master of the Sunken Island', is looking at the character, 'Yoo
Joonghyuk'.]

[Character, 'King of the Silver Heart', is looking at the character, 'Yoo
Joonghyuk'.]

And the two people from the 999th turn was staring back at him in return.

Lee Hyunsung looked quite agitated at the moment. 【This story… But, it
can't… Could it be, really…?】

Just like how I was searching for the 'Yoo Joonghyuk' I knew from this
particular Yoo Joonghyuk, they were now looking for the 'Yoo Joonghyuk'
they recognised.

[3rd turn's 'Yoo Joonghyuk' is remaining silent.]

[41st turn's 'Yoo Joonghyuk' is remaining silent.]

[362nd turn's 'Yoo Joonghyuk' is remaining silent.]

[666th turn's 'Yoo Joonghyuk' is remaining silent.]

There was no point in becoming one anymore as Yoo Joonghyuks were
being torn apart within those gazes. They were searching for the 'Yoo
Joonghyuk' they recognised and were shoving away other 'Yoo Joonghyuks'
in the process. They eliminated those they couldn't understand and tried so
hard to find that one 'Yoo Joonghyuk' they recognised.

And so, how long passed by like that?

[999th turn's 'Yoo Joonghyuk' is slowly opening his eyes.]
And one of them finally discovered something among the patchwork of
'Yoo Joonghyuks'.

【Capt…!]

Just before the 'Master of the Sunken Island' could take a large stride
forward, the air before her split apart with a single ray of light.
Accompanied by choking heat, a blinding beam of light crashed down like
a lightning bolt.

Yoo Joonghyuk lightly swung his [Black Heavenly Demon Sword] to
deflect that beam of light.

【That man is not the 'Yoo Joonghyuk' that you remember.】

There was no need to ask who it could be.

【He's simply the 'Outer God' who stole the 'Yoo Joonghyuk' we know

of!】 The 'Living Flame', 999th turn's Uriel, cried out.

She lived only for the purpose of killing the 'Secretive Plotter'. And she
came this far to finally have her vengeance. The conflagration became even
more vicious on her [Flames of Retribution].

The one to try and stop her was the 'Master of the Sunken Island'.

【H-hold on. Stop, Uriel. That 'Captain' is…!】

【Don't be fooled. The 'Secretive Plotter' is permeating within him.
Meaning, he's the sworn enemy we've been searching for after all this
time!】

And right next moment…

【Holy shit, so that's the captain from this world-line? Been a while, but
still, he's so damn scary…】
Finally, even the last 'King' arrived in the location.

He took a look around the battlefield, then spoke with his eyes almost
bulging out of his face. 【T-there are two Jihyes here?!】

…It was the 'Monarch of the Great Abyss', the 999th turn's Kim Namwoon.
[All 'Outer God Kings' have gathered in one place!]

[Every Constellation in <Star Stream> is paying close attention to this
battlefield!]

[Every Nebula in <Star Stream> is fearful of the advent of the fallen

beings.] [A large number of Constellations are revealing their animosity!]

They simply ignored whatever the stars were saying and quietly studied
each other.

⸢The 'Living Flame' that rises up from the east.⸥

⸢The 'Master of the Sunken Island', the calamity of the world in the west.⸥

⸢The 'Monarch of the Great Abyss', the ruler of the northern universe.⸥

⸢The 'King of the Silver Heart', the ruler of the interstellar space in the
south.⸥

⸢And the 'Great Plotter' that crawls from the place of nothing.⸥

The plan I began cooking up bit by bit ever since I discovered their names
within the book written by the 'Recorder of Fear' and deduced their
identities…

I sneaked a glance at Yoo Joonghyuk. The original plan A was actually
supposed to begin from here.

– Yoo Joonghyuk.
My signal prompted him to step forward.

The Chaotic aura of an Outer God enveloped him, and he spoke in the true
voice.

【Everyone has gathered, I see.】

Those words contained emotions that I couldn't even fathom. However,
someone present here still managed to do just that.

【Captain. I knew it. It is you, right? But how…】

【You dare to use yet another underhanded method…!!】

The [Flames of Retribution] scythed past the air and flew in. The [Black
Heavenly Demon Sword] containing the power of the Transcendent rose up
to deflect the flames.

As the friction noises loudly tangled up with waves of magical energy, Yoo
Joonghyuk raised his voice. 【Been a while, Uriel. My old companion-
inarms.】

【Shut up! You are not Yoo Joonghyuk! You are…!!】 The 999th turn's
Uriel shouted out as if she had been made fun of just now. Conflagration of
destruction spread out everywhere and ignited the oxygen in the air. Within
this hell of choking, hard-to-breathe dry heat, she continued to speak.
【The Yoo Joonghyuk I knew died in that place.】

Her Stories growled like a wounded wolf. Her expression could only be
made by someone who lost something far too precious to her. And while
carrying such an expression, she pointed her sword at us.

【And it was you bastard who killed him.】

Her Story was crying out now.
⸢[I'll kill him. I'll definitely kill him. Without a doubt, I shall make sure to
kill him.]⸥
The 999th turn's Uriel held onto Yoo Joonghyuk's Incarnation Body
wasting away due to the 'Other World Pledge' and cried in sorrow.

⸢[Regardless of what needs to be done, even if that means crossing
worldlines, I will definitely avenge you. Even if I end up leaving the side of
Good to become Evil!!]⸥

And so, the 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' became the 'Living Flame'. She was
an Archangel who chose to become an 'Outer God' for the sake of her
vengeance. That was her reason for being here.

【'Yoo Joonghyuk' doesn't die. Only the regression waits.】

【Shut up! Such words won't…!】

Yoo Joonghyuk deflected some more flames tinged with boundless rage
and continued on. 【He awoke again, and lived through the 1000th turn. He
then died, only to move onto the 1001st. And so, he continued to live on
and on. And on.】

I too know of that life. A life that no one remembered, a life that he couldn't
share with anyone else. Yoo Joonghyuk continued to live such a life all
alone.

【And eventually, he became me.】

Uriel pounced, looking as if she had heard something she shouldn't have.
She swung her [Flames of Retribution] in desperation, cutting his side, then
slicing into his stomach. And in a blink, her blade circled around and took
aim at his neck. He didn't try to stop her, as if this was the just punishment
he'd been waiting for. And then…

Like magic, Uriel's blade came to a halt.
【You, you, you… are…】

Uriel probably knew this, too – that her vengeance could never be fulfilled.
Because the one who stole away her most precious companion-in-arms
happened to be the very same companion, that's why.

Yoo Joonghyuk spoke to her. 【If you want, go ahead and kill me. The
'Secretive Plotter' who took your world-line away is none other than me,
after all.】

Uriel howled out in anguish, then cried out loudly.

Just as her sword moved again, the ocean exploded along with the loud
'Kaboom!!'

Her sword was flung in the air. The Flames of Retribution stabbed into the
ocean, and slowly sank beneath the waves while vaporising the water.

Yoo Joonghyuk wasn't responsible for that.

Shu-wuuuu…

The cannon smoke rose up from the other side of the waves. It was the
999th turn's Lee Jihye who fired a shell.

【That's enough, Uriel.】 Her voice was thickly tinged with joy and
madness as she carried on. 【Yes, we know it, too. We already knew it all
too well…】

She staggered across the ocean's surface and approached this side. Yoo
Joonghyuk didn't avoid her pale hand.

【Captain. You're inside somewhere, right? You've become something else
now, but you as you are definitely inside, right? You're still alive, right??】

Rather than tears, Chaos flooded out from Lee Jihye's eyes like fine powder
seemingly made out from the pitch-black darkness. He looked at her and
nodded his head.
[999th turn's 'Yoo Joonghyuk' is looking at his old companion-in-arms.]

The 999th turn's Lee Jihye grasped onto his sleeve and slowly crumbled.

I could only look at his back. His back, where I couldn't read his
expressions at all.

⸢It was the trickery of the world-line that caused Yoo Joonghyuk to become
many.⸥
Yoo Joonghyuk who lived during the 0th turn became the 1st turn's Yoo
Joonghyuk, then he became the 2nd turn's. And the 2nd turn went on to
become the 3rd – and then, the 4th.

Abnormal events of the past and future interfering with each other ran
rampant and made everyone forget that crucial fact, but this was the
undeniable truth.

⸢A regressor actually doesn't regress. What actually regresses isn't him, but
everything else excluding him.⸥
The time for everyone else would rewind, but his own time would continue
to march forward.

Even though the world-lines had split up and some became the 1864th
turn's Yoo Joonghyuk while someone else became the 'Secretive Plotter',
but still…

⸢From the beginning, he was just 'one person' who kept walking on one
continuous, unbroken path.⸥
However, could these people be able to handle the truth?

⸢Someone only lived on for the sake of her revenge.⸥

Uriel, still raising her flames.
⸢Someone only lived on for the sake of continuing on with his will.⸥

Lee Hyunsung, who couldn't shed tears anymore.

⸢Someone only lived on for the sake of fighting him one more time.⸥

Kim Namwoon, standing askew in the air and glaring daggers in this
direction.

⸢And someone only lived on for the sake of reviving those times she lived
alongside him.⸥
Lee Jihye, currently crumpled, looking vacant.

Yoo Joonghyuk told them that 'regression couldn't change anything'.
However, his regression did change someone's life. The 'Yoo Joonghyuk'
was the world to these people. A world that helped them live on even after
their own world-line was annihilated.

⸢Kim Dokja's plan was precisely about this 'world'.⸥

If, by any chance, these people still remembered their world even now…

And, if they accepted this 'Yoo Joonghyuk' once more as their captain,
then…

⸢If so, then there might not be a reason to continue with this battle.⸥

【If you're really the captain, then… You must know what I want, then.】
The 999th turn's Lee Jihye smiled brightly. 【Let's go back, captain. Let's
start from the beginning again.】 She held onto his wrist and spoke.
【Let's destroy this world-line together. Huh? We made a deal with the
Dokkaebi King, you see? If we destroy this world-line, he will send us
back. He will get in touch with your Sponsor, the 'Oldest Dream', and…】
I hurriedly looked at him.
– Yoo Joonghyuk.

He must never stimulate them negatively here. No, he definitely needed to
use the most suitable words to win them over. Even if he had to lie, he
needed to agree, before it was too…

"Lee Jihye."

Yoo Joonghyuk looked at her and spoke. Not through his true voice, but
with his physical voice.

The 999th turn's Lee Jihye shrunk her shoulders when subjected under his
gaze. Just like on that day when she first learned to wield her sword from
her master.

"Is that what you really want?"

【…】

"Do you believe that you'll become happy if everything reverts to how it
was back then?"

【The captain I knew, he… He'd never say things like that.】 The 999th
turn's Lee Jihye bit her lip and let go of his hand. 【He's someone who
regressed 999 times. He didn't falter even when living through that
inordinate amount of time. That man, he'd never say something so weak,
and…】

"A man who regressed 999 times can grow tired by the 1000th," said Yoo
Joonghyuk in a voice so honest that even I was left stunned. "Even if one
endured 1000 lifetimes, one can still give up during the 1001st."

The voice was so thick with boundless fatigue that even I became dazed by
it.

【There's no way… That's not possible. The captain I remember is…!】
"He would not give up. Indeed. However, if that's everything you remember
about 'Yoo Joonghyuk', then…"

I needed to say something. I need to tell him that he must not say these
things. But I couldn't.

"…Then, that Yoo Joonghyuk is dead."

That was his heart laid bare. A man who lived 1864 lifetimes, a man who
had never truly expressed himself, had finally bared his soul.

Lee Jihye cried out, sounding more like a shriek. 【Not true! That can't be
true!!】

"He shall not regress anymore."

I saw some things sparkle in the distant sky – they were stars.

[Constellation, 'Demon-like Judge of Fire', is scanning the vicinity with an
anxious face!]

[Constellation, 'Most Ancient Liberator', is asking about his maknae's
wellbeing!]

[Constellation, 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon', declares that he will use both
of his hands this time!]

Stars that watched our stories from a very long time ago were approaching
this side. And beyond them, our companions were also rushing towards us.

Han Sooyoung, Yoo Sangah, Jung Heewon… The people from <Kim
Dokja's Company> who had lived with us in this world. Within the
darkness brought on by the fading sunset, they looked like one giant
constellation.

Yoo Joonghyuk, now as one person, took in that sight and raised his voice.

"I can't go back. My final regression turn is this one."
              Chapter 477: Ep. 91 - One Single Story, I


⸢He took a very long time to get to that decision.⸥

I stared at Yoo Joonghyuk making that declaration.

The original plan wasn't like this. He was supposed to use the memories
from the 999th turn and buy as much time as possible. He was to stimulate
the 'Outer Gods' appropriately and persuade them.

"There will be no next regression for me."

Even though I was looking at a guy completely, utterly trashing my plan to
bits, for some reason I didn't get angry.

⸢"Yoo Joonghyuk, a former regressor."⸥

Only now could I truly comprehend what he said back then.

I had been thinking that the reason for the rapid growth of this turn's Yoo
Joonghyuk was down to the information I provided and the interference
from other variables. However, now I couldn't say that anymore.
The proof was the Stories rising up from Yoo Joonghyuk's entire frame.
Stories that contained not the desperation, but the will of a lifetime.

⸢Yoo Joonghyuk had bet everything on this regression.⸥

Just like a locomotive dashing forward by exhausting every ounce of its
fuel, Yoo Joonghyuk was doing everything he possibly could to live this
life.

This regression turn was not the base material for his next life.

【…Captain, you're lying, right? Huh? You're kidding, right??】

Lee Jihye's expression creaked and distorted. It wasn't merely an expression
of someone betrayed by the belief she held onto. No, that was the face of a
person whose world had crumbled.

She then reached out towards that last straw she had been chasing after all
this time. Unfortunately, Yoo Joonghyuk didn't grab that hand.

"Lee Jihye. Have I ever lied to you before?"

【…Why?】

Explosive auras were leaking out from her entire body now. I sensed the
999th's turn's history going violently out of control.

【Why, whywhywhywhywhywhywhywhywhywhywhywhywhywhy】

Stories were asking why it was not the 999th turn but us – why was it not
the world they lived in, but this one?

I was about to take a step forward, but Yoo Joonghyuk stopped me.

"Stay back."
His cheeks were trembling painfully. No matter how hard he tried to hide
his emotions, he still couldn't erase his unique behaviour. I sighed softly
and replied.

– We can't retreat anymore, anyway.

– Apologies.

– It's fine. This is your choice, after all.

At a casual glance, Yoo Joonghyuk might seem like a realist, but actually,
he was far more of an idealist than anyone out there. From the get-go, there
was no way someone would repeatedly regress unless he doggedly held
onto his ideals. And in order to protect such a dude's ideals, someone had to
take on the role of a realist.

I took another step forward while looking at the waves of 'Outer Gods',
about to rush in full of indignation.

[Yoo Joonghyuk did not choose to forsake your worldline.]

I used every ounce of my energy to use that true voice, causing the 'Outer
God Kings' to look at me. The 999th turn's Lee Jihye, Lee Hyunsung, Kim
Namwoon, Uriel…

[Have you all forgotten? He was never in a position to choose, but always
had it chosen for him.]

He had repeatedly regressed, but Yoo Joonghyuk had never regressed
because he really wanted to. Even when he had to discard the 3rd turn and
regressed to the 4th, and when he gave up on the 4th and chose to go to the
5th, it wasn't out of his will, his desire.

The regression wasn't his choice, but his fate; what chose 'it' wasn't him, but
the 'story' that desired his regression.

[We have no need to fight each other. Why must one tragedy compete
against another one?] I had no idea whether these words would work or not,
but even then, I simply had to say them. [We won't forsake you. We do not
wish to remember you all as calamities. We want to…]

I looked up at the sky. I felt dizzy for a moment there from all the
boundless gazes I hadn't seen before bearing down on me, but I didn't avoid
meeting them head-on.

Just like how Yoo Joonghyuk was not the same Yoo Joonghyuk from the
0th turn, I too wasn't Kim Dokja of the 1st scenario.

[We want to fight against that sky together with all of you.]

Beyond the skies, the stars began illuminating in sheer madness.

[The absolute majority of the Constellations can't understand your
declaration!]

[Great Dokkaebis from the Bureau are shocked by your intentions!]

Indirect messages rained down like starlight. If it was before, I'd been too
busy reading those messages, but now, I knew the truth.

The reality was, all those starlights in the sky were nothing more than
ornaments to hide the fact that the darkness existed there.

[The 'King of Stories' is now looking at you.]

It was then I heard a very faint chuckle.

【Oii, do you even know what you're talking about? Are you saying that
you want to destroy <Star Stream>?】 The snide voice belonged to the
999th turn's Kim Namwoon. 【You think we haven't tried that before?】
The depths of emotions contained within his voice was unfathomable.

He was smiling, but he wasn't really smiling.

That exaggerated smile hid the sense of resignation deep within.
【We already tried that. We shot down all the Constellations, and we even
killed the Dokkaebi King of our world-line, too. You know what happened
when we did?】

Kim Namwoon walked on the ocean's surface and stood right before me.

And as if to transmit the sweetest despair known to men, he whispered to
me next. 【The world just vanished.】 I silently listened to his words.

【We definitely cleared the scenarios properly. We even completed all the
conditions, yet… We lost everything we loved. There was no miracle, no
reward at the end of the line.】

I recalled the words uttered out by the 999th turn's Uriel.

⸢If the <Star Stream> disappears, the whole universe will fall into chaos.
Such a world-line must never be created. That is the way of Evil.⸥
That's what she said when I mentioned my goal of destroying the <Star
Stream>.

Kim Namwoon continued on. 【You know what we saw at the end of the
world?】

[You probably saw a massive wall. A great wall that surrounds all of the
worlds, the one where you can't even see its beginning or the end.]

【…And how do you even know that?】

[Because that's where our true goal is, too. What we want to achieve isn't
simply the destruction of <Star Stream>.] I repeated with my own voice
what the 'Secretive Plotter' told me earlier. [And it's to eliminate the
ringleader of all these tragedies hiding behind that 'Final Wall'.]

The 999th turn's Kim Namwoon stared at me as if he was greatly shocked
by this revelation.
His lips bobbed up and down many times before he finally roared out.
【No one can go past the 'Final Wall'! That's…】

【Namwoon-ah. These people, they possess the 'Final Key' that might
allow them to go over the 'Final Wall'.】

Lee Hyunsung raised his voice.

Kim Namwoon alternated his gaze between Lee Hyunsung and me, looking
utterly confused. I simply nodded my head towards him.

[The 'Outer God Kings' are getting agitated by your announcement!]

[Your declaration is causing a rapid change in the '98th scenario'!]

[A large number of Constellations are indignant of your choice!]

It was fine if the stars didn't want to side with us. It was also fine if other
Nebulas didn't want to join us, either.

However, if these four decided to stand on our side…

If these 'Kings' that lived through the 999th turn remained in this world-line
and fought alongside us, then…

【…Let's say that you possess such a 'key'.】

The moment I heard that voice, I felt a chill run down my spine.

【In that case, is there a reason for me not to snatch that key away from
you?】

The moment Kim Namwoon's shortsword got closer in the blink of an
eye and took aim at my neck… Claaang!

The sword's trajectory streaming before my eyes deflected his shortsword.
As the heavy impact force resounded out, both Yoo Joonghyuk and Kim
Namwoon were forced back a couple of steps.

【[Hahaha! This is it! This is that feeling!】

Blood trickled down the 'Monarch of the Great Abyss's' hand after that
collision against the [Black Heavenly Demon Sword].

【Do you have any idea how long I've been waiting for this? Do you know
how long I had to wander aimlessly just for a chance to fight against
you?!】

The 'Monarch of the Great Abyss', the being who travelled through the
inordinate amount of time just to revive that one opponent he had been
idolising.

[Giant Story, 'Delusional Design', has begun its storytelling!]

The 999th turn's Uriel supported the wobbling Lee Jihye and got into the
battle stance as well. 【You told me this once before. If, by any chance,
you've become another existence that's not you, you wanted me to kill you
personally.】

Along with the blinding explosion, the sun in the air began emitting light
once more.

【Looks like that time is now.】

What blocked the outpouring of the heatwave was the forged steel
completely filling up our view.

– You must escape. I can't stop them by myself.

The 999th turn's Lee Hyunsung was different from the others as he wasn't
summoned as the 'calamity'. Meaning, unlike them, he didn't enjoy the
'grace of the scenario'.

"Kim Dokja!"
Almost at the same time, my companions arrived on site.

Han Sooyoung flying on the back of the Black Flame Dragon was the first
to ask. "What happened here??"

"As you can see."

She bit down on her lip, hard.

I didn't say anything else and instead, looked at my companions. At Jung
Heewon, Shin Yoosung, Lee Gilyoung, Lee Jihye, and Yoo Sangah…

"This is the final hurdle."

They should also probably guessed it.

"I ask of you this. Please, make sure not to die."

At least during this fight, even I was helpless to protect my companions.

Kwa-aaaaah!

Along with the impact force akin to heaven and earth upending, violent
tsunami waves and sunlight intermingled. Blades clashing against each
other could be spied within the rising white foams trying to blind our view.

The blackish light sliced into the ocean.

Yoo Joonghyuk was fighting – while enduring against the combined
assaults of the 999th turn's Kim Namwoon and Uriel, he was displaying a
shocking level of martial prowess.

[Giant Story, 'Pilgrim of the Lonely Apocalypse', has begun its
storytelling!]

[Story, 'Hell of Eternity', has begun its storytelling!]
The hidden, shored-up power strong enough to contend with two 'Kings',
now that was Yoo Joonghyuk's true strength. Every Story he had built up
all this time was exploding forth simultaneously.

['Disconnected Film Theory's' connection is incomplete!]

[Cracks are developing in the Story's continuity!]

Unfortunately, the balance couldn't be maintained forever.

"Dokja-ssi."

I shifted my head to find Jung Heewon there. The Archangel's blinding
wings were spreading out from her back.

The Beast Lord Shin Yoosung, the Naval Admiral Lee Jihye, and the
Emperor of Steelsword, Lee Hyunsung. My companions who lived a
different life compared to the original storyline, and thus were currently
marching towards a different resolution.

We glanced at each other and nodded.

"I'll help Joonghyuk-ssi, so the rest of you, please take care of that side!"

[Constellation, 'Demon-like Judge of Fire', is unleashing her Status!]

Jung Heewon spread her wings wide and flew towards Yoo Joonghyuk
under the blessing of Uriel. It seemed that that was the Archangel's choice.
She now knew that the 'Outer God King' happened to be herself from the
farflung distant future, so…

【I told you this before. Without the Nebula's grace, you can't oppose
me.】

The [Flames of Retribution] soaring through the sky as if to puncture it was
now crashing back down towards the ocean.
However, we had no time to worry about Jung Heewon. Because there was
yet another existence pouring out her boundless Status in our direction at
the moment.

Among the parting, exploding waves, the 999th turn's Lee Jihye was staring
at us with her hollow eyes.

"Everyone, please evade!"

Yoo Sangah stepped forward and distorted the time and space.
Unfortunately, Sakyamuni's ability was useless when facing the true might
of that 'Outer God King'.

Along with the loud ripping noise, the distorted time/space was forcibly
spread open.

The battleship of the 999th turn's Lee Jihye was now rising up from the
depths of the ocean. The [Turtle Dragon] of the 'Master of the Sunken
Island' resembled more of an island rather than a ship at this stage.

"Ahjussi!"

Sensing the danger, Shin Yoosung had her [Chimera Dragon] spew out its
Breath. And when she did, all aquatic creatures hiding below the water's
surface rushed out, as well.

Gyaaaah-ooooh!

Monsters screeching out viciously pounced on the battleship's hull.
However, the island was simply far too large for them to stop. The loud
noises of monsters being crushed could be heard next. The wide expanse of
the ocean vibrated heavily and the tsunami wave rolled out.

"Hyung, take a step back! Hurry!"

"Kim Dokja, disappear to the back already, will ya?!"
My companions surrounded me as if to protect me and began desperately
fighting back.

I was aware of why they were doing this, of course. And I also knew what
they were scared of, too.

【I, I only have to erase everything.】 The 999th turn's Lee Jihye was
crying out beyond the tidal waves. 【Everything, it can be made anew. It's
nothing at all. Then, captain will realize it, too! He will know that this
world can be destroyed at any time. That it's possible, that the world we
lived in was the real deal…!!】 Kwa-kwakwakwakwa!

A huge tsunami crashed in, accompanied by the round of cannon shelling
vicious enough to blow up the entire ocean. The wave's scale was the
largest we had ever seen.

If that thing continued on its way, then even if my mother was there, the
Korean Peninsula was as good as finished.

[Story, 'Demon King of Salvation', has begun its storytelling!]

Han Sooyoung's expression changed for the worse as she shouted out. "Kim
Dokja! If you do anything stupid…!"

"Don't worry."

I lightly patted her shoulder and stepped forward. The scenes of the
scenarios we experienced together flitted in and out of my view.

[Giant Story, 'Demon Realm's Spring', has begun its storytelling!]

[Giant Story, 'Torch that Swallowed the Myth', has begun its storytelling!]

[Giant Story, 'Season of Light and Darkness', has begun its storytelling!]
Every time a new Giant Story was created, I had to risk certain death. I
believed that was the only way, and thought that was the correct way.
[Giant Story, 'Liberator of the Forgotten Ones', is looking at you.]

The constrictive headband, this shackle that my companions personally
placed on me, tightened on my head. When I was earning that Giant Story, I
didn't die. I knew very well that this was their intentions.

Kwa-aaaaaah!!

The tsunami wave got closer and closer. This power wasn't something even
a Myth-grade could stop.

⸢However, Kim Dokja knew a way to deal with this tsunami wave.⸥

Back during the last scenario of the original storyline, when Yoo
Joonghyuk was waging the final war against the 'Outer Gods', there was a
similar moment to this one.

At that time, there was a certain Constellation beside Yoo Joonghyuk.

[Constellation. 'Most Ancient Liberator', is now looking at you.]

A single 'Myth-grade Constellation' couldn't deal with the 'great
apocalypse'. However, what if there were two?

[Constellation, 'Demon King of Salvation', is looking at the 'Most Ancient
Liberator'.]

I would never sacrifice myself ever again. I'd not leave my companions
behind. Just like how Yoo Joonghyuk didn't want to give up on this life, I
shall not give up even until the end.

[Giant Story, 'Liberator of the Forgotten Ones', has begun its storytelling!]
The sole 'Giant Story' that I possessed that could become the power to fight
off against the 'Outer God King' – however, I wasn't the one possessing the
greatest share of this Giant Story.

"Great Sage!"

I sensed four rings connecting with each other inside my head.

['Meihouwang' is agreeing to your request.]

['Bimawen' is agreeing to your request.]

['Douzhanshengfo' is agreeing to your request.]

The overflowing Story began transforming my Incarnation Body.

['Great Sage Heaven's Equal' is agreeing to your request.]

My hair grew in an instant and changed to platinum colour. The aura of
boundless Story flowed like rapid torrents within all of my veins. And then,
I felt the fulfilling sensation of the Ruyi Jingu Bang's grip in my hand.

[The power of five 'Sun Wukongs' have incarnated into your Incarnation
Body!]

The golden-hued Status settled on top of my coat. The battlefield of the
Tongtian was being recreated above the surrounding ocean.

Just as the lightning bolt struck, I heard the familiar voice.

[Let's go, maknae-yah.]

I nodded my head.
              Chapter 478: Ep. 91 - One Single Story, II


Kwa-aaaaah!

The Great Sage's Status enveloping my entire body now concentrated on
the [Ruyi Jingu Bang] held in my right hand. Just like that day on the
Tongtian, when we were fighting against the Constellations.

If there was one thing different, then I was now using the complete power
of that 'Sun Wukong'.

[Giant Story, 'Liberator of the Forgotten Ones' has completely permeated in
you!]

"I shall open up a path."

I swung the [Ruyi Jingu Bang] and a huge hole opened up in the center of
the tsunami wave. However, it was filled back up in an instant.

[Youcantyoucantyoucantyoucantyoucant]

From the island that the 999th turn's Lee Jihye had brought up, the
'Nameless Ones' began crawling out. Their number was so great that
fighting them seemed impossible, but even then, the Great Sage didn't panic
at all.

[Destroy them.]

I felt this jolt from the arm raised up in the air, and thick, gloomy clouds
suddenly filled up the sky. Somersault clouds carrying thunderbolts rang
around within the heavens above. Then, blinding blue rays of light crashed
on the ocean.

Kwa-booooom!!

Several strands of lightning smacked into the sea and tore through
everything there to carve out a path. These bolts of lightning continued to
smash down many more times. What an enormous amount of Status that
was.

This was the power of the one who had reached the last scenario, the Great
Sage, Heaven's Equal, often referred to as the strongest Constellation ever
was.

[Gah-gahk, gagagagagahk?]

However, there were several creatures that managed to withstand the storm
of lightning bolts. They were slightly larger than the previous Outer Gods.

[We ki ll the Con stel lat ions]

[End of sta rs dra ws ne ar]

These 'Outer Gods' could string along more concise words. These upper
rank creatures travelled through the underwater tunnel and rose up to the
ocean's surface.

"Son of a…!"

Han Sooyoung next to us cried out.
Ku-gugugugu!

The ground beneath the ocean rocked and lava began boiling up to the
surface.

"Everyone, get away!"

We quickly climbed aboard Lee Jihye's [Turtle Dragon] and rose up to the
sky. The hazy surface of the ocean was soon filled up with wiggling
creatures.

[De stru cti on of the wor ldli ne is co ming]

The 'Outer Gods' descended to this world while spewing out some
ominoussounding lines. We had encountered a creature like that before –
during the earlier days of the scenario, on the battlefield of the [Dark
Castle].

['The Fourth Wall' is faintly stirring.]

Perhaps, the [Devourer of Dreams], now acting as a librarian inside the
wall, was watching this spectacle as well.

"How are we supposed to kill those things??"

Han Sooyoung gritted her teeth and emitted [Black Flame] from both of her
hands. Tentacles several kilometers long rose up above the ocean at the
same time, causing the tidal waves messily mixed in with magma to rise up
even taller than mountain ranges.

For some reason, I recalled a certain sentence from the 'Ways of Survival'.

⸢The calamity flooding out from the rising island eventually covered up
everything on the surface of the planet.⸥
If this went on, then the Earth of this worldline would end up exactly in that
state, too.
"Great Sage!"

I borrowed the power of the Great Sage and faced off against the incoming
tidal waves.

The Ruyi Jingu Bang grew in size in the blink and began smacking away
the 'Nameless Ones' trying to get closer. I destroyed a building-sized wave
and smashed apart a tentacle flying in. However, there was no end in sight.

⸢The tidal wave simply grew larger and larger.⸥

If I managed to beat back one wave, then the second showed up. When I
destroyed that, the third one pounced on us. And at the center of all these
waves were the 'Master of the Sunken Island' and other 'Outer God Kings'.

[…It's not going to be easy this time.]

Even the Great Sage was saying something like that.

At this rate, we'd be finished even before our enemies get here.

"Is there any other way to break past that?"

[Need more time.]

After leaving those words, the Great Sage began gathering more Status. My
heart rapidly grew warmer and the Story in my veins circulated quickly.
Since I knew what he was preparing for, I didn't bother to ask anymore. If
my thoughts were correct, then he was getting ready to use that skill from
the final pages of the 'Ways of the Survival'.

The question was, could my companions and me last until then?

⸢In order to buy time, we need to combine our strengths.⸥

No matter how excellent both Uriel and the Abyssal Black Flame Dragon
were as Constellations, it was still too difficult for them to endure. Not to
mention, there were four 'Kings' that side.
…Wait, four?

Kwa-rurururu!

The shield of steel slapped away several tentacles flying in.

I looked at those huge shoulders standing before me and spoke.
"Hyunsungssi."

The 999th turn's Lee Hyunsung looked back at me, half of his expression
filled with worry, and the other half, confusion.

"We need your help. Please, help us stop the calamity."

He quietly stared at me before asking a question. 【Can you promise

me?】 I didn't ask what that promise was, because I felt like I already

knew.

"I don't know if I can protect it, but I'll do my best."

He stared at me for a bit longer, then his eyes blinked slowly. And right
next moment, his eyes shone in the silvery light.

【I shall believe in you Story.】 Kwa-

kwakwakwakwa!

Massive branches of steel sprouted from the sides of our ship. They grew in
an instant and became walls on four sides. While crashing into the waves
and the 'Nameless Ones', they continued their rapid expansion.

A short while later, a square pathway with an open center was created
before our eyes. It was a tunnel created by the advancing walls of steel.

【Please go ahead.】
I nodded and began running on the tunnel.

How long did we run like that? I spotted a familiar face at the end of the
tunnel.

"Heewon-ssi!"

Jung Heewon was busy swinging her sword in the middle of the 'Nameless
Ones'. Companions and I quickly crossed the tunnel and aided her.

"I'm sorry, I couldn't break past them."

She bit her lower lip and muttered out in bitterness. Her voice was thick
with despair.

She couldn't even get near the 999th turn's Uriel and ended up too
preoccupied with cutting down these 'Nameless Ones' pouncing on her from
the sky.

[Gyah-ahahahah]

The steel walls shook heavily while emitting crunching noises. 'Outer Gods'
were frantically pouncing on them as if they'd devour us in an instant.

If we took just one step outside these walls, then they'd really rip us apart
like piranhas, that's for sure.

Crunch, cruuuunch…

The sounds of the 'Nameless Ones' gnawing on the metal walls could be
heard next.

"Danger…!"

And then, the 'Nameless Ones' rushed towards us from the exit of the
tunnel. They pounced on us like rabid dogs, their slobbering tongues wildly
wagging.

[Ah, aaaaaah!]
In the next second, though, something akin to bright light fell from the sky
and sliced apart every single one of them before our eyes. Someone had
carved up the tunnel we were standing in from the outside.

We were treated to the sight of the great apocalypse's battlefield outside the
sliced-open tunnel.

The dead 'Nameless Ones' created huge islands of corpses. While looking at
this horrible sight of forgotten Stories dying meaningless deaths, the
children began retching uncontrollably.

I too became speechless and looked at this battlefield.

Someone murmured in a tearful voice.

"Just why, to go this far…"

This was the 'great apocalypse'. The scenario that Yoo Joonghyuk from the
original storyline had to fight through. And even now, that very Yoo
Joonghyuk was fighting against the 'Outer God Kings' in the middle of this
great battlefield.

Boooom!!

There seemed to be flashes of light on one side of the empty sky, only for
an echo of explosion noise to reverberate all the way to the other side.
Some things moved with speed that my eyes could barely chase after. The
ones that sliced apart the tunnel we stood in were engaged in a bitter battle.

I even forgot that we were in a battlefield and was lost in that scene for a
little while.

[Giant Story, 'Delusional Design', is loudly yapping on!]

[Giant Story, 'Hell of Eternity', is continuing on with its storytelling!]

The strongest beings from the forgotten worldline were busy competing
with the Stories. The torrents of [Breaking the Sky Swordsmanship] and the
[Hellfire] resisting it, and then the remnants of the [Black Flame] mixed in
to create a massive tornado.

Strong winds generated from the sword images collided among the gloomy
clouds, and ancient Stories howled on like aged dragons. Stories were
screaming as if to tear the sky apart.

The living histories were colliding and extinguishing right before our eyes.
And at the center of all the stories was Yoo Joonghyuk's [Black Heavenly
Demon Sword].

We couldn't afford to waste the precious time he had bought for us. I
pointed to our front and spoke. "The cause of these waves is the 'Sunken
Island' itself."

The 'Nameless Ones' flooded in like dust clouds. Then, upper-rank Outer
Gods raising up even more waves behind them. And finally, the 'Sunken
Island' in the center of them all.

Most likely, the 999th turn's Lee Jihye was in the middle of that island.

"Our priority is to demolish that island. The most optimal course of action
is to subdue the 999th turn's Lee Jihye, but…"

I took a look beyond the encroaching waves. If the culprit behind this 'great
apocalypse' event, the 'Master of the Sunken Island' Lee Jihye, was
subdued, the disaster itself should peter out, but the problem was with how
to get there.

Han Sooyoung spoke up.

"Don't forget, the 999th turn's Kim Namwoon and Uriel is over there, too.
Even if Yoo Joonghyuk is facing off against Uriel, what will you do about
Kim Namwoon?"

"Don't worry. I have a plan."
Even now, we were at a disadvantage in our combat strength. Well, we had
already exhausted a considerable amount of energy during the earlier fights,
after all. However, we weren't completely on the back foot, either.

"Gilyoung-ah, Yoosung-ah. Release the insects and monsters to stop the
movements of the Outer Gods as much as possible. Yoo Sangah-ssi, if you
see an opening, try to cast one more debuff on that Lee Jihye, please. Han
Sooyoung, you take care of the 'Nameless Ones' showing up in our rear."
"What about you?"

"I'll create a path. Heewon-ssi, please come with me."

The moment Jung Heewon nodded her head, I unleashed my Status.

[Constellation, 'Demon King of Salvation', is unleashing his Status!]

With excellent timing, I sensed Lee Hyunsung's Story enveloping my body
next. The outer layer created through the [Steel Transformation] sprouted
above my skin. We certainly made the right call to go to <Oz> first. We
definitely needed his [Story metal] in order to efficiently destroy the outer
layers of those 'Nameless Ones'.

"Now, everyone!"

We leapt above the steel walls in the air simultaneously and then,
descended towards the tidal wave.

'Outer Gods' noticed our movements and howled out at the same time.

Du-dudududu!

Gong Pildu's shells, now coated with the [Story metal], flew in from afar to
penetrate cleanly through the outer layers of the 'Nameless Ones'. Using the
sounds of the cannons as our interludes, we ran on top of the waves.

Tentacles flew in at us with no gaps in between them, but Han Sooyoung
burned them away.
[Constellation, 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' is roaring out!]

The [Black Flame]'s fires caused the Outer Gods to scream in pain.

Jung Heewon and I continued to run on this path. We felt the time/space
surrounding the island faintly distort. Yoo Sangah was activating her
powers now.

"Dokja-ssi, over there!"

We saw the gigantic [Turtle Dragon] taking up the highest location of the
island in the distance. The 999th turn's Lee Jihye was standing on top of the
ship's figurehead to command the 'Outer Gods'.

【Hahaha, where do you think you're going?!】 As if he was waiting for
us, the 999th turn's Kim Namwoon revealed himself. 【I shall protect our
Jihye!】

Even though he was in the middle of fighting Yoo Joonghyuk, he must've
had enough leeway to interfere with us. Maybe, Yoo Joonghyuk was in
some kind of danger right now. I gave the signal to Jung Heewon.

"Don't worry about me and go help Yoo Joonghyuk first. I'm sure he's
slowly reaching his limit by now."

"Don't get killed. Understand?"

Jung Heewon spread open her wings and disappeared in order to aid Yoo
Joonghyuk.

【Isn't that so sweet? But, don't you worry. I'll send both of you away in an
instant!】

Kim Namwoon's figure seemed to melt. His shadow split apart into
hundreds and countless figures leapt out from them.

⸢Kim Dokja thought to himself. He couldn't dodge this.⸥
Hundreds, no, thousands of daggers were unilaterally aiming for my body.
They moved as if they were alive. The peak of 'knife fighting' Kim
Namwoon had comprehended was permeating within each and every one of
those blade tips. And each attack was strong enough to leave a fatal wound.
Even then, I quietly smiled.

"When I met you for the first time, you also wielded your knife at me."

【But, it's my first time meeting you?】

"Kim Namwoon, aren't you curious how you of this world died?"

One of Kim Namwoon's clones frowned after hearing me. 【Who cares
how that weakling got killed??】

I used the [Ruyi Jingu Bang] to deflect the incoming daggers. A few of
them still managed to leave behind deep cuts on my thigh and shoulder, but
thankfully, Lee Hyunsung's [Story metal] defended against the attacks in
my stead.

Unfortunately, even his forged steel began developing cracks at the vicious
barrage of attacks raining down.

As if to fully recreate a certain memory, I started evading the incoming
attacks.

⸢Waist, right side.⸥

⸢Right eye.⸥

⸢Left thigh.⸥

Tsu-chut, chuchuchut…

Faint sparks danced about. I took a step back after getting hit by two more
daggers.
"You were trash in this worldline. A thug who killed a powerless old man
just to clear the first scenario."

【That's what the first scenario was about, anyway. I ain't curious about
such shit…!】

"You wielded the dagger just like now, until you ended up on your knees
begging for your life like a pathetic loser. And then, died miserably after
your head exploded."

For the first time ever, his movement came to a stop. His previous
mischievous expression was nowhere to be found, only his glare aimed at
me remaining.

"Aren't you curious about who killed you like that?"

The dagger was now aiming for my left eye.

"Oh the sword forged to cut down the sleeping giants. Descend to this
place, now!"

Kwa-aaaaaah!

Everything before my eyes seemed to wane as the massive storm of
aftermath raged on. A steel giant was summoned through the dimensions
and it now stood there imposingly.

The greatest Story weapon in [Tartarus], Pluto. A bright voice belonging to
Kim Namwoon came out from its cockpit.

[Hahaha! Hey, Grasshopper man, been a while…]

However, I couldn't smile back to him. Because what I was about to do
should prove to be very inhumane to this guy.

[Huh? What's this?]
Kim Namwoon discovered something small floating before his nose and
tilted his head. Almost at the same time, the other Kim Namwoon muttered
in sheer dumbfoundedness.

【…A giant robot???】

[Uwaaaaahk?!]

Tsu-chuchuchuchut!!

[Same existences from different worldlines have met for the first time!]

The 999th turn's Kim Namwoon didn't possess a Story of fighting against
me. However, what about now?

['Disconnected Film Theory' is activating!]

Memories were connecting; as the two existences from different worldlines
met each other, the unconnected Story momentarily would become one.

The 999th turn's Kim Namwoon, the 'Monarch of the Great Abyss', glared
at me with his brows arched up high. It seemed that he had realized
everything.

【You…】

"That's right. The one who killed you in this worldline is…"

The surrounding time and space transformed. Into that of the subway from
the first scenario. To the place where I killed Kim Namwoon.

I grinned and continued on.

['Stage Transformation' is activating!]

"It was none other than me."
             Chapter 479: Ep. 91 - One Single Story, III


[Story, 'Master of Steel', has begun its storytelling!]

The walls of steel created by 999th turn's Lee Hyunsung blanketed the
surroundings and expanded rapidly. This power was strong enough to even
defend the entire planet when deployed within <Oz>.

Kwa-kwakwakwakwa!

The expanding steel intertwined with the ⸢Stage Transformation⸥ and began
creating the partitions of the subway.

This stage was utterly familiar to me. Even now, just by closing my eyes
I'd be able to vividly recall this cabin from the first scenario. [A Myth-
grade Constellation's 'Stage' has been generated!] Tsu-chuchuchut!

Now originally, ⸢Stage Transformation⸥ was quite similar to augmented
reality. In other words, the surrounding topography wouldn't change simply
because it had been transformed into a stage.
However, the case this time was slightly different.

[<Star Stream> is paying close attention to your 'Stage'.]

[The absolute majority of Constellations are watching the 'Stage'.]

[Great Dokkaebis are jealous of your 'Stage'.]

[Due to the large number of gazes, the stage grade of the 'Stage
Transformation' is increasing!]

<Star Stream>'s Probability was directly linked to the number of gazes
watching on. A scenario that a large number of beings watched was able to
generate a powerful Story, and a stage watched by many could generate
sizeable impact in return.

The anticipation carried within those countless gazes could shift the
Probability, in other words.

⸢On that day, the Delusion Demon and the Demon King of Salvation met
for the first time in that place.⸥
And the shifting Probability could sometimes turn 'fake' into 'reality'.

[Due to the effects of the 'Disconnected Film Theory', the materialisation of
the 'Stage Transformation' is incomplete!]

[Within the applicable stage, the Characters 'Kim Namwoon' and the
'Monarch of the Great Abyss' will be treated as the same individual.]

[The 'Monarch of the Great Abyss's' stage compatibility is 87.351%!]

[The possibility of a sudden end exists.]

The fake becoming real on stage could only occur for a brief period of time.
While everyone was focusing here, before the mysteriousness of this stage
came undone – I had to finish everything.
【You…!!】

I unhesitantly approached Kim Namwoon. I didn't sense myself growing
any stronger from the effects of the Stage Transformation. However, I was
filled with confidence, instead. The kind that a wolf might feel when
hunting down a rabbit.

【What kind of dogshit is this?!】

The enraged 999th turn's Kim Namwoon pounced on me. Since he was
under the influence of the ⸢Stage Transformation⸥, his mobility had become
quite sluggish, as if he was that Kim Namwoon from the first scenario
whose average stat points didn't even reach 10.

The problem was, my own body was no different from back then during the
first scenario, too.

Swiiish!

I lowered my head and dodged the dagger. I was reading the direction of his
attacks through the [Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint] so evading him wasn't
that difficult.

[The rules of the 'first scenario' will apply to the applicable 'Stage'!]

[Incarnation Bodies within the 'Stage' will grow stronger by killing another
life.]

Memories continued to resurface.

Right. We fought like this back in the first scenario. Just for the sake of 100
Coins as our survival fee, people had to die.

Just for those 100 Coins, people killed each other.

We managed to survive such a world.

[Many Constellations are recalling their 'first scenarios'.]
The 999th turn's Kim Namwoon pressed down on his temples as if he was
suffering from migraine, then began cackling at me. 【Haha… So, this is
how you want to play it? Quite interesting.】

"But, you don't look like you're enjoying yourself at all?"

His glare was filled with the prickly killing intent.

[The 'Monarch of the Great Abyss's' stage compatibility has decreased
slightly!]

Even if the effects of the ⸢Stage Transformation⸥ was absolute, this
particular stage was recreated through a simple trick. The longer I took, the
weaker the connection between the 999th turn's Kim Namwoon to his 3rd
turn counterpart would become.

[What the hell, grasshopper man! What's going on here? What's
happening?!]

The 3rd turn's Kim Namwoon raised himself up in the corner. He had been
altered into a small toy robot due to the effects of the ⸢Stage
Transformation⸥. He awkwardly clung onto my leg.

The 999th turn's Kim Namwoon saw this scene and muttered out. 【How
disappointing. To think that I'd get killed by a bastard like him and end up
as a trashcan robot.】

[What the hell are you talking about? You wanna die, buddy?? Hey,
grasshopper man! Kill that son of a bitch!]

[If there is no killing taking place in the next five minutes, all Incarnation
Bodies within the cabin will be exterminated!]

This would be my first time seeing the ⸢Stage Transformation⸥ imposing
such a strict restriction.
Wasn't this almost at the level of an actual main scenario?

【Die!】

The dagger sliced the air and flew right in. I used the surrounding objects to
dodge the attacks. The movements of my body might have become dull, but
I was not the same Kim Dokja as I used to be back then.

Kim Namwoon's attacks scratched the subway's steel doors and floors. The
power behind each of his thudding attacks was gradually getting stronger.

The aura of Chaos was faintly swirling around him. The effects of the
⸢Stage Transformation⸥ on him was already declining. The odds of victory
would tilt towards his favour if this continued on.

However, the 999th turn's Kim Namwoon seemed to be getting more and
more anxious, instead.

[Character, 'Monarch of the Great Abyss', is getting agitated.]

[Character, 'Monarch of the Great Abyss', is urgently surveying his
surroundings.]

Why was this? Why did his complexion look so poor? I took a closer look
to find his cheeks and neck soaked in cold sweat.

[Character, 'Monarch of the Great Abyss', detests this space.]

【You rat-like bastard…!!】

[A portion of Constellations are suspicious of the 'Outer God King's'

Status.] [A small number of Constellations are scorning the small fry-like

utterance.]

The movements of the 999th turn's Kim Namwoon were getting simpler
perhaps due to his increasing anxiety.
[If there is no killing taking place in the next three minutes, all
Incarnation Bodies within the cabin will be exterminated!] Three minutes
remained.

"Dokja-ssi? What's going on here…?"

And that was when I heard a certain voice. Kim Namwoon and I both
turned our heads in the direction of where that voice came from.

And immediately, chills ran down on my spine.

⸢There was another who bore witness to their fight in that place.⸥

I had forgotten about it.

⸢The most righteous person in the carriage number 3807 on that day.⸥

…That I and Kim Namwoon weren't the only people riding in that subway
that day.

【Hahahahaha!!!】

Kim Namwoon exploded in the fit of maddened laughter, abandoned me,
and rushed towards Yoo Sangah.

Perhaps due to the effects of the ⸢Stage Transformation⸥, she was now
kitted out in the uncomfortable outfit she had on during the first scenario.

He closed the distance in an instant and his dagger was swung towards her.

As the blade scythed the air with a sharp swish…

Slice-!
Sliced strands of hair danced in the air. Yoo Sangah and her hardened
expression were using agile movements to evade Kim Namwoon's attacks.
As a matter of fact, she was far more agile than I was.

【Not bad!】

[Character, 'Monarch of the Great Abyss', has received the effects of
'Blackening'!]

However, his movements should grow faster and faster with passing time.

⸢On that day, the Delusion Demon came to understand his new world.⸥

The effects of the Stage Transformation was getting stronger.

⸢…That a new set of rules was needed in a brand new world.⸥

I could see Yoo Sangah's complexion getting paler and paler.

There was no time. I needed to find a way. Somehow I…

"Hyung."

A small hand tugged at my clothes.

⸢If that boy didn't catch any insects that day…⸥

Lee Gilyoung was also here, with a babyish face of a young boy. He looked
exactly like how I remembered during the first scenario.

The boy in despair after losing his parent was extending his palm out with a
determined expression.

[Constellation, 'Ruler of the Deepest Pit', is laughing ominously.]

Several bright-yellow grasshoppers rested on the boy's palm.

"Thanks."
I grabbed the grasshoppers and started running. The insects were then
crushed along with crunching noises.

[You killed a lifeform.]

[Your Incarnation Body has been strengthened due to the effects of the
Stage Transformation!]

[You killed a lifeform.]

[Your Incarnation Body has been strengthened due to the effects of the
Stage Transformation!]

…

My physical strength increased explosively as I ran inside the cabin.

The back of Kim Namwoon's head, currently cackling away like a madman,
was now right before my nose.

【Die! Die!! Die! Dieeee!】

I simply grabbed the nape of his neck and slammed the bastard down on the
subway's floor. His legs trembled like an insect being crushed.

【You son of a…!】

He swiftly jumped out from my grasp and swung his dagger in my
direction.
I didn't bother to dodge that.

Kah-gagagagak!

Because there was no need to.

⸢The knife continued to leave behind scratches. Although blood did trickle
down, the blade failed to gouge out the flesh beneath the skin.⸥
The final scenes of the first scenario flitted past my view as if it was
overlapping with reality.

Kim Namwoon's attacks continued to get faster, but he failed to break past
Lee Hyunsung's strengthened [Steel Transformation].

【This, just what the hell is this…】

The 999th turn's Kim Namwoon spat out expletives and wielded his dagger.
However, no matter how many times he swung it, there was no use.

Because the end of this 'Stage' was already set in stone.

"Looks like you only have two minutes remaining."

【Uwaaaaaah!!】

Kim Namwoon and his distorted expression swung his dagger
indiscriminately. Only his poor blade ended up breaking, however, and it
fell to the ground. One minute thirty seconds, then one minute twenty… As
time continued to tick down, Kim Namwoon's figure slowly crumbled to
the ground.

It wasn't because he simply lost all his strength. What attacked him was a
sin far more fundamental in nature.

⸢The foundational Story of Kim Namwoon, the Demon of Delusion.⸥

The surrounding space began distorting; the pool of blood was now
spreading on the once-empty floor of the cabin. It was not the blood we had
shed.

【There's, there's just no way…!】

The shivering 999th turn's Kim Namwoon plopped down on the spot.

[Giant Story, 'Delusional Design', is losing control!]
Right here in this place was where his Story, 'Delusional Design' had
germinated.

Kim Namwoon relied on [Abnormal Adaptability] to forge a new world he
had to live in – but what about the version of him who had witnessed the
end of that 'world'? What kind of meaning did that world hold for him?

【C-crap like t-this, won't…!】

Corpses on the floor were glaring at us, their eyes wide open.

Those that I failed to protect – those with their heads missing or their hearts
pierced through. Those dying while vomiting blood were now looking at us.

Kim Namwoon's face shook hard as if he was having a seizure. It was an
expression that didn't suit him.

"Are you feeling the guilt after having come this far?"

The 999th turn's Kim Namwoon trembled and looked up at me, his lips
bobbing up and down.

⸢"You're right, I'm trash. So what??"⸥

Kim Namwoon from the initial regression turns would've definitely said
that. However, even such a guy had said something different during the
999th turn.

⸢"…I've been thinking about this sometimes. Maybe I should've been the
one to die that day. Captain, you also think that way, don't you?"⸥
The psychopath, Kim Namwoon, the Demon of Delusion.

Even after I finished reading the entirety of the original novel, my opinion
on that guy hadn't changed.

[Exclusive skill, 'Reading Comprehension', is activating!]
However, that couldn't have been Kim Namwoon's everything. The 'Ways
of Survival' I read was no doubt nothing more than just the tip of an iceberg
called this world.

And so, the 'Kim Namwoon' I didn't know must have existed somewhere,
too.

Kim Namwoon, who ended up seeing a world's end for someone's sake.

Kim Namwoon, capable of wandering aimlessly for forty thousand years
out of his love for someone.

Kim Namwoon, carrying on the sake of protecting his loyalty to his
companions.

What if such a Kim Namwoon existed in the world somewhere…?

And what if such a Kim Namwoon was the one who saw the end of the
999th turn…?

【I, I… I…】

His delusion was being eaten away.

That was the history he endured on by exchanging away his personality; the
ego of the Kim Namwoon, a second-year student from Cheongil High
School, was now leaking out from its hidden spot beneath his mask.

【I… I killed… them… That's right, I…】

The shivering Kim Namwoon held his broken dagger and began sobbing
away.

"Right. You did kill them."

As I said that, I took a look at the rear of the subway.

I saw Lee Hyunsung's steel tunnel, now merged with the ⸢Stage
Transformation⸥. And this near-endless tunnel was overflowing with
corpses.
The 'Nameless Ones', their names now long forgotten, were crying out.

"And they are the people I didn't save."

⸢A new world requires a new story.⸥

That was the price for completing the 'One Single Story'.

We lived for the purpose of completing this petty 'gi-seung-jeon-gyeol'.

[Your 'hidden scenario' is on the verge of completion!]

[All of your Stories are desiring your 'Conclusion'!]

[Every Constellation in <Star Stream> can sense that your 'Conclusion' is
drawing near!]

And now, I had to see the end of this damn story.

【Ah, aaah, aaaah…!】

The focus in Kim Namwoon's eyes blurred and he brought the tip of the
broken blade closer to his neck.

[15 seconds remaining until the application of the 'Stage Transformation's'
rules.]

[Once the time limit has been reached, all Incarnations who didn't obey the
rules will be killed instantly.]

Yoo Sangah and Lee Gilyoung were looking at this side. Even the 3rd turn's
Kim Namwoon, currently in the figure of a toy robot, was looking at me
also.
If the time limit elapsed in this fashion, then the 999th turn's Kim
Namwoon would die for sure on this stage. The stage itself might be fake,
but his Story infused to this place was all real.

He'd die in this place. Just like those he had killed. Or, like how it was for
him in the 3rd turn.

He'd die a miserable death while accepting his 'life'.

The problem, however, was with the 3rd turn's Kim Namwoon. He'd also
perish due to the fact that he was connected to his 999th turn counterpart
through the 'Disconnected Film Theory'.

I couldn't let that happen.

[The 'Stage Transformation' has been cancelled!]

The surrounding landscape changed and the stage disappeared. The
memories connected through the [Disconnected Film Theory] were fading
away. The subway scattered away, and all the actors involved also returned
to their previous positions.

However, the 999th turn's Kim Namwoon remained on his knees.

Certain stories, despite being fake, possessed power as if they were real
deal. The stage might be gone now, but the original sin didn't go away.

His ruined and frayed Story was scattering away. I quietly stared at him and
his lowered head, before lightly kicking away the dagger he was still
holding.

"Kim Namwoon, you can't be saved."

Then, I pulled out the Unbroken Faith. The gleaming white swordlight
seemed to screech out from the blade. I deliberately raised the sword up
high so that everyone could see me. And then…
[Every Constellation of <Star Stream> is waiting expectantly of the 'Outer
God King's' death!]

【No!!】

Along with a horrifying, desperate cry coming from somewhere, my
Unbroken Faith cut something down.
              Chapter 480: Ep. 91 - One Single Story, IV


Pah-su-sut.

The traces of a Story stained the Unbroken Faith. Thick smoke arose from
this burning Story.

What used to be someone's history was now scattering away as ashes.

Kim Namwoon's blood-soaked white hair strands were hooked on the edge
of the sword.

⸢This was Kim Dokja's choice.⸥

I watched his hair scatter away within this ash-grey smoke and opened my
mouth. "When I was young, I really hated you."

When I was still absorbed in reading the 'Ways of Survival', Kim Namwoon
was the only character that I couldn't sympathise with. If every person
appearing in that novel was my hyung, my father, my dongsaeng, and my
noona, then…
…Then, the character 'Kim Namwoon' was the cautionary tale for me.

"Your so-called justice had no dignity, and your killings were
indiscriminate."

The 18-year-old boy adapted to this abnormal world faster than anyone
else. He was the Incarnation who wielded his knife with reckless abandon
and sheer arrogance, while throwing himself fully to the darkness.

Unhesitantly carrying out acts of evil, while spewing out one corny line
after another. Such traits were so vividly drawn out and my younger self
could unabashedly hate this guy as a result.

⸢The evil fashioned just so that one could hate and detest it without holding
back.⸥
That was Kim Namwoon.

"You are a villain. It's the same story back then and even now."

I muttered out as if I was talking to myself. Stories staining the blade
dripped down like blood.

⸢Kim Dokja, now an adult, was looking at Kim Namwoon once more.⸥

Just like how the characters from the 'Ways of Survival' changed inside the
scenarios, the person reading that story, me, also changed too.

I was now old enough to figure out why he had to become a villain.

⸢Perhaps it was Kim Dokja's fault that Kim Namwoon had to become a
villain.⸥
…Because I read the 'Ways of Survival' back then.

Because I offered my opinions to the author, and just like how
Constellations would do, I evaluated and judged him.
– Dear Author-nim, does Kim Namwoon have to become the companion
again this time?

Because I believed that he was merely a 'character' the author had created,
not a living, breathing person.

When I thought about it, the reason why I hated Kim Namwoon was pretty
simple in nature.

"Yoo Joonghyuk always took you in as his companion."

Out of everyone from the 'Ways of Survival', Kim Namwoon most closely
resembled me.

"Even though he knew that you are an evil bastard, even though he
knew that you did evil things… Even then, he took you in." If I was
him, how would I have turned out?

Cheongil High School second-year Kim Namwoon.

A regular high school student living under the stress of the studying and at
odds with his parents.

What would happen if such a high schooler was thrust all alone in an
extreme environment where he couldn't survive without taking the life of
another, and no one was there to protect him?

"At first, I thought that Yoo Joonghyuk was thinking of practical benefits.
Because you as an Incarnation held a high potential, that's why. But when I
thought some more about it, there were other people with just as much
potential as you. Even then, Yoo Joonghyuk always accepted you as his
companion every single regression turn."

If it was me, would I have been able to make a different choice?
While repeating the 1st turn, the 2nd, then the 3rd… then even the 999th,
would I have survived by making a different choice than the 'Kim
Namwoon' from that time?

"…When I think about it again now, maybe it was not Yoo Joonghyuk
chasing after practical benefits, but me."

From when I started reading the 'Ways of Survival', Yoo Joonghyuk's age
remained '28' years old. He was an adult back then, and even now, too.
Maybe he had already known the truth – that life was an accumulation of
one's choices, that those countless choices piled up to eventually become a
Story worth a single person.

That no one was designed to be 'evil' from his birth.

Just as how the 1st turn was different from the 2nd, the 998th turn was also
different from the 999th. And that might be the real reason why he repeated
his regressions after all this time.

The blade stopped mid-air.

The Unbroken Faith had faintly dug into the dazed Kim Namwoon's carotid
artery and stopped right there.

I spoke in a half-sighing tone of voice. "That doesn't mean you can be
forgiven for what you've done, though. What I wanted to say to you,
though,
was…"

【Kim Namwoon!!】

An incredible surge of Status rushed in from behind me. Someone was
running towards this side like a tank while breaking past the vicious barrage
of shelling.

It was the 999th turn's Lee Jihye.
All because Kim Namwoon found himself in danger, she abandoned her
'island', broke past the shelling, and was hurriedly approaching here – even
at the cost of her entire figure turning into tatters by facing <Kim Dokja's
Company>'s attacks directly.

"You're blessed, aren't you. You even have a 'companion' who worries
about you to that extent."

The word 'companion' caused Kim Namwoon's empty eyes to tremble.

It wasn't just Lee Jihye rushing towards this place, either. I thought that my
back was growing hot, which was followed by the threatening sensation
encroaching upon the nape of my neck.

It was the [Flames of Retribution].

【What are you scheming now?】

The 999th turn's Uriel, who had been engaged in a battle against Yoo
Joonghyuk only a second ago, was standing right behind me even before I
had noticed it. I slowly shifted my head towards her.

She must've escaped from the battle in a great hurry, because her pure-
white wings were all torn to shreds, with deep wounds visible all over her
figure. Just a casual glance told me that she was grievously injured.

She had disregarded all of her resentment and hatred, even her desire to
win, and chose to fly over here all because of the danger to Kim
Namwoon's life.

There were some things that wouldn't change even after becoming an Outer
God.

Companions willing to risk their lives for the sake of just 'one person' –
because they were such people, they got to see the end of the 999th turn
without Yoo Joonghyuk's presence.

"My scheme, is it. That's what I want to ask you."
Along with a soft landing noise, Yoo Joonghyuk appeared behind the 999th
turn's Uriel. His [Black Heavenly Demon Sword] was aiming at her neck.

The emotions in his eyes were clearly complicated. His expressions seemed
to be criticising me, but at the same time, also sympathising with my
choice, too. Maybe it was both. His eyes seemed to imply that, now that
things had turned out this way, I should do what I wanted here.

I was going to do that without someone giving me his permission, anyway.
"You and other 'Outer God Kings' could have easily destroyed Earth if you
really wanted to."

My words caused the eyes of the 999th turn's Uriel to faintly tremble.

[The 'Great Apocalypse Scenario' is currently in progress!]

We weren't talking about any other scenario, but the 'Great Apocalypse'
taking place within the 98th scenario. A scenario that not even the
Constellations of the distant skies dared to participate in, out of fear of their
complete, eternal destruction.

At a bare minimum, the descending 'Outer Gods' in this scenario wielded
absolute power to easily scorn every single Constellation.

⸢With just a flick of one hand, every island on the Pacific Ocean was
annihilated.⸥
I could still vividly remember that sentence from the original novel. These
'Kings' could even summon an asteroid from the outer space and have it
collide with the planet if they wanted to. They were existences that, after
descending to this world as calamities, could drag in much larger
Probability and use it at will.

"Why haven't you done that from the beginning?"

And all of my plans began from this very question: why didn't they try to
destroy Earth right out of the gate, so to speak?
The 999th turn's Uriel didn't say anything for the longest time.

【…That is…】

Actually, I already had guessed what her reply would be.

Because these people weren't the 'Outer Gods' that appeared in the original
novel.

⸢Even if they were from another world-line, they were individuals who
started from 'Earth' and managed to clear the scenarios.⸥
Earth was their home, the place where their Story began, and where their
lives had ended, too.

But they survived as tragedies. They lost their precious one to an Outer God
from another world-line. Meaning, they were already sick and tired of this
thing about the invasion of another world-line.

And so… Could such people bring about the destruction of an entire
worldline just for the sake of their goals?

"You never had any intentions to truly kill us."

The 999th turn's Lee Jihye said this, that they would use this world-line as a
sacrifice to revive their own scenarios.

However, was that the truth?

She was already full of mistrust towards <Star Stream>, so could she really
have believed in the promise with the Great Dokkaebis word-for-word and
acted like this?

And would the 999th turn's Uriel really agree to go along with that?
"From the very beginning, all of you weren't capable of doing that.
This fight was your loss from the very start." That was the answer I
had arrived at.

[The absolute majority of the Constellations are greatly shocked by your
judgement.]

The way to protect our regression turn without denying the 999th turn.

My confident declaration caused the 999th turn's Uriel to glare at me with
complicated eyes. Lee Jihye from the same turn staggered towards her side
and quietly placed her hand on Kim Namwoon's head.

He was staring at me dazedly, before shifting his head away.

Kim Namwoon was crying. He must've felt sad about something, because
he was sobbing away uncontrollably. The 999th turn's Uriel couldn't do
anything and simply watched this scene play on.

【…Why don't we stop it here?】

Lee Hyunsung walking in closer voiced his opinion.

【And what should we stop?】

【Uriel, you already know this too, don't you? This isn't what we want. We
will solve nothing with this type of…】

【In that case, what should we do to 'solve' it, then?】

Uriel's voice sounded flat – a voice filled with despair worn down by
innumerable expanse of time.

【I always gave it my all. As I promised, I saw to the end of the world.
Even then, I couldn't save anyone. I became an Outer God, and carried on
while dreaming of my vengeance. Even when I knew that my vengeance
had no real point, I denied that fact and came this far. Yet, you are now
telling me to give up on something else, having come this far? Speak, 'King
of the Silver Heart'.】

【I don't know the answer to that. Just that, I believe the story of these
people will show 'something' to us.】

【'Something'? Are you saying that, even after we came this far, there is
still something else left that we need to see?】

【I also do not know that. However, I have a certain feeling. This feeling
that, the reason why we from the 999th turn became 'Outer Gods' and
survived this long was all for this moment… Don't you feel that way,
too?】 The 999th Uriel looked up to the sky.

The heavens were crying; stars up there were thoughtlessly blinking away.

[<Star Stream> is urging for the conclusion of the Story it had waited for
the longest time.]

I looked around to discover our companions had already arrived here. Han
Sooyoung, Yoo Sangah, Jung Heewon, Lee Jihye, Shin Yoosung, Lee
Gilyoung…

They encircled the 'Outer Gods' as if to surround them, and waited for my
signal while remaining ready to take action at any second.

The 999th turn's Uriel asked out aloud. 【Why is it possible for these
people, but not us?】

The [Flames of the Retribution] burning viciously cried out, too.

【…Why, why did we fail?】

It was then, someone dared to open his mouth. "Why do you think that you
have failed?"
It was Yoo Joonghyuk.

He asked while his [Black Heavenly Demon Sword] was still trained on
Uriel's neck.

"Is the conclusion you didn't want to see a failure of an ending?"

Perhaps surprisingly, I knew exactly who those words belonged to.

⸢"Even if the end of this world is a tragedy… Do not think that you have all
failed."⸥
That was what the 999th turn's Yoo Joonghyuk told his companions just
before his death.

The 999th turn's Uriel shuddered. Among her boundless frustration, the
faintest trace of joy leaked out. She walked closer to him while speaking in
a trembling voice. 【Are you really… the 'Yoo Joonghyuk' that I know?】
Yoo Joonghyuk didn't reply to her.
【I wish to speak to him! Please, call him to the surface! Even if it's just
once, I wish to meet him again. I want to ask him. And, I…】

The 999th turn's Uriel held onto his hand as if to plead with him. By now,
she too must've felt it – that inside this 'Yoo Joonghyuk' was the 999th
turn's version of him that she fell in love with.

Actually, I did ask the 'Secretive Plotter' to summon out the 999th turn's
Yoo Joonghyuk while I was busy cooking up this plan earlier.

What these 'Outer God Kings' were relying on was that version of Yoo
Joonghyuk. So I thought that I might be able to persuade these people if I
managed to get his help.

– I'm sorry, but that's impossible.

However, the 'Secretive Plotter' refused my request. Just like how the
current Yoo Joonghyuk was saying his piece.
"What will you do after that guy has been summoned here?"

【That is…】

"If he tells you to surrender, will you do exactly that? If he tells you to
listen to our demands, then are you going to follow his orders again?"

The complexion of the 999th turn's Uriel grew paler and paler with every
word spoken. I wanted to tell him that was enough – too bad, he didn't stop
there. His words poured out like merciless sword strikes. And from a
certain point on, I realized something else.

What refused my request was neither 'Yoo Joonghyuk' nor the 'Secretive
Plotter'.

[999th turn's 'Yoo Joonghyuk' is keeping his silence.]

It was 999th turn's Yoo Joonghyuk himself who refused to show up. In that
moment, a belated realization washed over me.

"So much time has passed by already, yet you still can't decide on anything
without his presence?"

Only now did it feel like I could understand everything – like, on why he
refused to heed my request.

Like, why the 999th turn's Yoo Joonghyuk chose not to appear before his
companions.

⸢The 999th turn's story was completed through Yoo Joonghyuk's absence.⸥

His companions lived on for the purposes of reviving him, to meet him
again, and to avenge his death. They endured while using those goals as the
reason for their lives.

⸢In that case, what would happen to their lives after their reason no longer
existed?⸥
Foams created by the waves rolled over our feet. The great ocean was
sinking. This sea seemed so unfamiliar, like foreigners drifting in from a
very distant place. And in the center of this ocean, the 'Outer Gods' forming
an island held their breaths and stared at their kings.

And one of those Kings was saying her piece.

【…So, that's how it was.】

Like a ship that finally discovered its destination after roaming the endless,
boundless ocean for an innumerable period of time…

【So, that is what you wanted, Yoo Joonghyuk.】

The shuddering of the 999th turn's Uriel slowly came to a stop.
              Chapter 481: Ep. 91 - One Single Story, V


Those were Uriel's last words to us. She didn't say anything else afterwards.
And while not saying anything, the 'Outer God Kings' exchanged glances
with each other.

I didn't miss that opening and spoke up. "We don't have any intentions to
fight against you, just like how you don't truly wish to destroy this world.
You are just as familiar with tragedies as I am. There is no need to create
more sorrow in this world-line."

[The scenario has entered a temporary state of lull!]

[<Star Stream> is surprised by the unexpected development of this
scenario!]

I grew tense while observing their response. The 'Outer Gods' still didn't
say anything. I couldn't even tell whether they heard my words or not.

⸢So far, things had unfolded according to Kim Dokja's plan.⸥
Using the 999th turn's memories, and arousing their memories of 'Yoo
Joonghyuk'.

⸢From the beginning, it was impossible to win this fight with a frontal
assault.⸥
If they got serious and activated the calamity's Probability with everything
they had, then this scenario would've ended just as it started. Back in the
original novel, there were a few planets that responded naively to their
'Great Apocalypse' and ended up getting destroyed, instead.

[A large number of Constellations that dislike you are dissatisfied with the
current situation!]

[A portion of Constellations are opposing against the scenario's illogical
development!]

The Constellations were probably anticipating a spectacle of their hated
<Kim Dokja's Company> meeting a tragic end alongside Earth.

Unfortunately, the 'Outer God Kings' didn't do that.

At least, not for now, anyway.

– Kim Dokja, what's next?

Han Sooyoung sidled up to my right and asked in a tense voice.

– To be honest, even I don't know.

– Wha??

– This is as far as my plan goes.

As if to imply her thoughts of 'What crap are you talking about', her face
was dyed in the colours of pure astonishment.

– Hey, you. You can't be…
– Right now, we can only believe.

That must've come across as irresponsible. However, there was no other
choice. This was the best plan I could come up with, and it also happened to
be the only way to lead this event towards the correct conclusion.

I abruptly recalled what the 1863rd turn's Han Sooyoung had told me.

⸢"I believe in the characters I've created. That's all."⸥

I could just about understand where she was coming from now. And that's
why I replied like this.

– I thought that I can only believe in these people who were like teachers to
me – these individuals that I had read about.

I trusted the 'Ways of Survival'. Not the author responsible, no, but the
characters that appeared within its pages.

[The 'Living Flame' is looking at you.]

Uriel, more righteous than anyone else out there.

[The 'King of the Silver Heart' is looking at you.]

The kind and honest Lee Hyunsung.

[The 'Master of the Sunken Island' is looking at you.]

Lee Jihye possessing a lot of affection.

[Constellation, 'Secretive Plotter', is looking at you.]

Yoo Joonghyuk, who never knelt down in defeat no matter how unfair
things became.

I believed in them. I believed in their histories that helped the young me
grow.
I believed that their worth would never be tarnished no matter how much
time had passed by.

The 999th turn's Uriel opened her mouth. Although, she wasn't talking to
me. 【Lee Hyunsung, you said that we might get to see the end in this
world-line, the one we failed to see before.】

【That's correct, Uriel.】

【And your opinion hasn't changed even now?】

Lee Hyunsung nodded. Uriel then slowly turned her head towards me. Her
irises were burning brightly just like the corona of the sun.

【…Did you say you're the 'Demon King of Salvation'?】

Against that gaze seemingly testing my righteousness, I subconsciously
swallowed back my saliva and nodded my head.

【Through this world-line's version of myself, I have seen the Stories
related to you.】

It was then Jung Heewon standing nearby flinched a little. Technically,
though, it wasn't her but probably Uriel, instead.

I was getting a somewhat-ominous vibe here.

What the 'Living Flame' said next was completely out of my expectations,
though.

【Your Stories were quite similar to those of 'Yoo Joonghyuk's' that I'm
familiar with. From the way you cleared the scenarios to how you looked
after your companions.】

"…"

【This world-line resembles ours quite closely.】
The expression on the 999th turn's Lee Jihye was rather complicated. I
realized why they stood around looking at each other for such a long time
the moment I saw her face.

They weren't agitated simply because this world just so happened to be
their home planet.

【Are you aware of the events that took place in our world-line?】

I hesitated on what to say. This wasn't something that I could explain away
easily. Instead of my lacking communication skills, though, my Stories
began speaking up in my stead.

[Story, 'Demon King of Salvation', has begun its storytelling.]

A portion of the Stories I possessed travelled towards the beings from the
999th turn via the tip of my hand.

[Story, 'One Who Opposes the Miracle', has begun its storytelling.]

[Story, 'One Who Hunted the King of Disasters', has begun its storytelling.]

I observed them reading my Stories. Diverse, colourful expressions filled
their faces. It was quite clear what overlapped with my Story while they
were reading it.

…Did I also make such an expression while reading the 'Ways of Survival'
for the first time?

That was something I'd never find out.

【…But, how could such a thing…】

It was around then that an unexpected event occurred; the Status of the
999th turn's Uriel, reading my Story silently until then, travelled over the
Story itself and invaded into the sea of my consciousness.

As if, she wanted to find out the origin of my existence.
[Exclusive skill, 'The Fourth Wall', is activating!]

Tsu-chuchuchut!

Just as I expected, the 'Wall' made a move as the blinding sparks danced in
the air.

['The Fourth Wall' is glaring at the 'Living Flame'!]

The Living Flame's left hand was deflected away as if being rejected, a
faint trace of burn marks visible on her skin. She looked at me in pure
shock, then the faint hints of understanding began permeating in the lights
of her eyes.

【I see. So, that's how it was. You are…】 Her voice sounded even more
surprised compared to when she was reading my memories. 【The last
fragment of the 'Final Wall', is it… Is that why the 'Secretive Plotter' was so
obsessed over you?】

"Please make your decision. There isn't much time left until the scenario's
end."

[The 'Great Apocalypse Scenario' has entered a temporary state of lull!]

[If the current situation persists, the distortion of the world will accelerate.]

Since they had descended as 'calamities', this scenario now had to have a
conclusion without exception. The best method for everyone involved was
for them to give up on being the 'calamities'.

The 'Living Flame' opened her lips again. 【I acknowledge the potential
you possess. Although vexing, I can even agree to forestall my vengeance.
However…】

Countless emotions brushed past her expression just then.
【…However, I don't believe that you'll successfully reach the end of this
world-line. I don't believe that an existence that merely imitated another
world-line's Story can witness a proper conclusion.】

"H-hang on a…"

【You'll probably reach your 'Conclusion' when this scenario comes to an
end.】

The last part of 'One Single Story', the Conclusion (結).

A gob-smacking heat storm began condensing with the 999th turn's Uriel as
its center. Salty air circulated around my nose as the seawater evaporated
into the rushing winds.

I reflexively cried out at this outrageous transformation of Status.

"Yoo Joonghyuk!!"

At the same time, he stepped up before me and cut down the rushing hot air
with his [Black Heavenly Demon Sword]. However, the heat still managed
to cook the backs of his hands.

His breathing became irregular. The [Disconnected Film Theory]'s effect
had almost run its course.

Ku-gugugugu!

The 999th turn's Giant Stories were activating simultaneously. For some
reason, even the 999th turn's Lee Hyunsung didn't try to stop Uriel.

I urgently shouted out. "But why…! There's no need to do this! We-!!"

The 999th turn's Uriel wordlessly strode over to us. Companions grew tense
and began unleashing their own Statuses.

[Giant Story, 'Demon Realm's Spring', is continuing on with its
storytelling!]
[Giant Story, 'Torch that Swallowed the Myth', is continuing on with its
storytelling!]

The 'Living Flame' simply took a glance at our Stories and continued to
approach us. After every 'Outer God' handed over their Status to her, she
raised her [Flames of Retribution] up high.

I bit down hard on my lip.

[The absolute majority of the Constellations are scared of the 'Outer God's'
power.]

[Many Dokkaebis are repulsed by the Story of the 'Outer God'.]

Everything within <Star Stream> would soon become stories.

However, why was a story both the Constellations and Dokkaebis didn't
want to see deemed necessary?

Just what was the reason for a story to exist in this world when it was only
good for plunging everyone into endless sorrow?

【Do you always seek to create a Story to tell someone else?】

The 999th turn's Uriel was talking to us.

The [Flames of Retribution] refined to the stunning degree was now talking
about the time outside of the scenarios.

【Who does it exist for, this Story you have compiled so far?】

While listening to her true voice, I realized what her intentions were.

A story nobody supported. Even then, she wished to see the end of this
particular scenario.

⸢And that is the answer the 'Living Flame' had chosen.⸥
The reason why she wanted to continue on with this scenario wasn't
because she agreed with the Constellations, nor did she want to side with
<Star Stream>.

【Show me your 'Conclusion'. Prove it to me that your group can reach an
end different from any other world-lines.】

Stars in the skies were looking at us. Stars that had been watching this story
for a very long time. I imagined those countless starlights, and then, end of
all the worlds waiting beyond that.

I imagined the end of this story, the one I'd been building up to for a long
time.

"Kim Dokja!"

The waves of heat completely filled up my view. The [Hellfire] of the 999th
turn's Uriel, intermingling with the odour of burning sulphur, created the
tsunami wave of lava. It was the moving wall of enormous Status capable
of immediately melting everything that it touched.

The victory would be decided with one attack.

Block that, and we'd emerge as the victors.

"Focus your Giant Stories, everyone!"

Petty tricks were rendered useless in the face of a calamity. My companions
helped me with the mobilisation of the Giant Stories, rather than focusing
on their own specialities.

Shin Yoosung, Lee Gilyoung, and even Yoo Sangah, too – everyone raised
their hands up in the air and added their share of the Giant Stories.

[Giant Story, 'Season of Light and Darkness', has begun its storytelling!]
Accompanying the noises of the heavens splitting apart, the roars of the
Apocalypse Dragon could be heard. Right next second, yet another loud
howl exploded out from Han Sooyoung's direction.

Ku-ooooooh!

The former candidate for the Apocalypse Dragon, the 'Abyssal Black Flame
Dragon' was firing its Breath.

Jung Heewon dashed forward while riding on the vicious storm of the
[Black Flame].

[Constellation, 'Lily Blooming in Aquarius', is unleashing her Status!]

[Constellation, 'Demon-like Judge of Fire', is unleashing her Status!]

Two Archangels were working together with Jung Heewon. Her [Judge's
Sword] raised up high was now cutting down the tsunami wave.

Kwa-aaaaaah!

Was it because of the two Archangels' combined attack? For a moment
there, the tsunami wave's movement grew sluggish.

Yoo Joonghyuk didn't miss that opening.

[Story, 'Hell of Eternity', is continuing with its storytelling!]

Traces of numerous regression turns branched out from his [Black
Heavenly Demon Sword]. His Status spread out and began destroying the
rushing wave.

– It's not enough.

Unfortunately, his desperate resistance couldn't last for long; the sparks
dancing all over his body were getting fiercer and fiercer. The
[Disconnected Film Theory]'s effect had finally run out, in other words.
The moment his Status began declining sharply, he let rip one powerful
attack at the center of the wave.

Breaking the Sky Swordsmanship(破天劍道).

Inner Mysteries(奧義).

Split the Dark Ocean(暗海斬).

A minute opening was created by the attack from his Inner Mysteries. I
didn't miss that.

[Maknae-yah, preparations are complete.]

Also, the voice I had been waiting for entered my ears just then, too.

Surrounding clouds gathered around me as if to envelop me – somersault
clouds, filled to the brim with cracking thunderbolts, completely encircled
me. My body was buzzing as if every lightning found in the heavens had
been hoovered up here.

[We can use this only once.]

I kicked off the clouds and dashed into the gap within the lava.

My wings generated through the 'Demon King Transformation' were lit on
fire and it felt like my eyeballs were being cooked by this horrifying heat.
However, I didn't stop.

I had a duty to protect this path my companions opened up for me.

⸢The one single story that can stand as the testament to our lives.⸥

My feet moved faster and faster until they became streaks of light. I used
the powers of [Electrification] to hold together my Incarnation Body
threatening to explode at any second.

Faster and stronger, as if I had become a single streak of lightning.
Ku-rururururu!

The lightning charged fully in both of my hands boiled vigorously. This
lightning, capable of smashing apart countless stars found in <Star
Stream>, the one that half-destroyed <Emperor>'s Heavenly Palace…

I used up every ounce of my strength to throw the Ruyi Jingu Bang.

⸢Stars in the skies boiled over, and Nebulas shrunk back. The thick dark
clouds rolling in the heavens alluded to their despair.⸥
This single attack carried all the condensed power of the Great Sage
Heaven's Equal.

⸢Just like what he did during the final battle.⸥

The lightning bolt broke past the incoming lava and advanced forward.

Kwa-kwakwakwak!

The tsunami wave of lava exploded grandly and evaporated right there and
then. The streaks of electricity branching out created a path above the
splitting wave.

It was the path of the Story we had been walking on. And I ran on it.

[Giant Story, 'Demon Realm's Spring', is arranging your 'Conclusion'.]

The Demon Realm's 'Beginning/Gi(起)'.

[Giant Story, 'Torch that Swallowed the Myth', is proudly guiding you.]
Olympus's 'Development/Seung(承)'.

[Giant Story, 'Season of Light and Darkness', is right by your side.]

The Great War of Saints and Demons' 'Climax/Jeon(轉)'. And then…
[Giant Story, 'Liberator of the Forgotten Ones', is dreaming of the Final
Story.]

…The last dot that hadn't been filled yet.

Kwa-aaaaaah!!

All the Stories we experienced together merged into one and emitted
blinding rays of light. The explosion of light so bright that it seared my
eyes, blanketed everything.

When I raised my head again, the volcanic ashes from the lava were
scattering away in the air. The sky looked desolate after everything had
come to an end. The dust blocking the gazes of the stars fell like snow and
covered the ocean's surface.

Someone was plopped down on her butt in front of the Unbroken Faith.

I could see the broken wings of an Archangel. From the beginning, she
wasn't planning to win against us. I quietly stared into her eyes.

I didn't know whether this was enough proof or not. Just that, this was the
best I could show as the current me.

The 999th turn's Uriel stared at my blade for a long time. It was as if she
was repeatedly mulling over the last line of text – as if this pointy tip of the
blade was the full stop putting an end to all of her Stories.

Then, her gaze slowly shifted along towards where that tip of the blade was
now pointing at.

It was beyond the horizon where the distant sky and the ocean met.

⸢That's where the end of this world-line was.⸥

A faint trembling flickered past her expressions.
The 999th turn's Lee Jihye, Lee Hyunsung, and even the still-dazed Kim
Namwoon were all staring in the same direction as her.

Beyond the falling grey ashes, something blurry could be seen.

Fear began clouding the expressions of the 'Outer Gods'.

I instantly realized what they were staring at. At the place where they
arrived once before during the 999th turn. At the 'Final Wall' that could
never be overcome if one insisted on living within this world of 'Stories'.

[Calamities of the 'Great Apocalypse Scenario' are giving up on the
positions of calamity.]

[The 'Great Apocalypse' is entering the termination sequence!]

[Your last 'Giant Story' is blossoming!]

[Absolute majority of the Constellations are witnessing the moment of your
last Story's awakening!]

I could now hear that 'Wall' calling out to me.

[Hidden Scenario – 'One Single Story', has reached the 'Conclusion'!]

[<Star Stream> is carefully considering the name of your last Story.]

[You accomplished a feat that every star in <Star Stream> will revere you
for.]

[You have arrived at an epic that only an extremely few stars have ever
reached!]

And finally, the message I had been waiting for the longest time could be
heard next.

[You and your Nebula have earned the qualification to witness the '■■ of
everything'.]
[The 'King of Stories' is summoning you.]
               Chapter 482: Ep. 92 - Final Scenario, I


Two days after the 'Great Apocalypse Scenario's conclusion.

During these two days, the 98th scenario meandering nowhere fast also
ended, as well.

[98th scenario – 'Candidate Selection' has automatically ended.]

[No one has challenged your Nebula.]

[Number of victories: 1]

[Contents of your reward is currently being finalised.]

[Clearing of the 'Great Apocalypse Scenario' has been linked to your
reward, and the contents are still being discussed.]

Perhaps that was inevitable. While Nebulas were busy fighting each other,
we actually were victorious in the 'Great Apocalypse Scenario'. We fought
off the ancient 'Outer Gods' and protected Earth. Not only that, with only
the strength of our Nebula alone, too.
[A large number of Constellations respect you and your Nebula.]

[Nebula <Kim Dokja's Company>'s fame is spreading far and wide in <Star
Stream>.]

[Every Constellation in the Final Scenario is now aware of your Nebula.]

[Every Constellation in the Final Scenario is curious of your 'Conclusion'.]

And now, everyone in this <Star Stream> knew of us.

– Representative-nim! Representative Kim Dokja! Please say something!

Voices from the megaphones came from outside the [Industrial Complex].

Whether it was the hologram panel or the regular TV – didn't matter where
or what, our story dominated them all. Every broadcasting station,
including terrestrial and cable, was showing the front yard of the [Industrial
Complex] in real-time.

Also, the interview footages of the Complex's residents were being repeated
ad nauseam, too.

– 'Judge of Destruction'-nim! Can you tell us the future plans of
<KimDokja's Company>…

– Call me by my name when in public, please. Han Sooyoung likes
thatstuff. I don't.

– Hey, Jung Heewon. Wanna die?!

…I couldn't remember just how many times I had heard that "Wanna die"
by now.

– The true influence behind the 'Kim Dokja's Company', 'Han Sooyoung the
Black Flame Demon Empress'. It is now revealed that, before the
apocalypse, she was a famous author…
Reading the ticker proclaiming [Genius author's insight demolishes the
Final Scenario!], I could seriously re-appreciate the fact that I had indeed
reached this far.

–We heard that your representative-nim has become a 'Myth-grade
Constellation' after defeating the 'Midday Sun'. Does that mean our South
Korea now has a Myth-grade Constellation that can step up to the
limelight?

– Incarnations are currently locked in a fierce debate after witnessing
thefootages of the battle's final moments. Just what are the true identities of
the 'Outer Gods'?

– Why did representative Kim Dokja-nim suddenly become a blonde?

The battles we fought were broadcast not only on <Star Stream>, but
throughout Earth as well – from Yoo Joonghyuk kicking 'Ra's' butt, all the
way to us fighting against the lava wave created by the 999th turn's Outer
Gods.

[Constellation. 'Demon-like Judge of Fire', is quite proud of herself.]

[Constellation, 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon', is turning its nose up.]

[Constellation, 'Most Ancient Liberator's', lips are twitching.]

And every one of those scenes was accompanied by an interview with
someone.

– You see, me? I recognised that friend's greatness even back when we
wereworking in the same company. Huh? Just which new employee tries to
be the first to go home as soon as time's up…

Department head Han Myungoh? I definitely told him not to do any
interviews, though?

He was smiling brightly, his left hand holding onto his daughter's. It
seemed that he had managed to safely rescue his child.
– He was just a regular friend. Mm, well, you know, those types of
kids?There's always someone like that in a class, that type of a person.

Now that some time had passed by, even a person claiming to be my school
mate popped up. I began thinking that maybe some managed to survive
until now.

…Those faces that I couldn't even place a name on.

– Kind, quiet, likes to read a book by himself…

Although not technically wrong, that explanation wasn't right, either.

Some words were quite convenient to use. And those words usually
couldn't explain anything because of that convenience.

The school mate muttered on about the obvious stuff for a while, before
excusing himself with a stutter as if he found the camera a bit too much. He
probably ran out of things to say.

– About Earth's saviour, the 'Demon King of Salvation'.

Another program started after that with a piece of rather sad-sounding
music. It was a specially-compiled documentary.

[Constellation. 'Goryeo's First Sword', is nodding his head.]

[Constellation, 'Maritime War God', is proud of you.]

While watching the footages, I began recalling the time before the
apocalypse. The dreams I had, the things I thought were important, etc.

The fact that all these things came across as distant memories felt very
alien to me. Of course, not everything was totally alien, though. – He
endured a painful youth stained by domestic violence, and… Someone
suddenly switched the TV off.
"Dokja-yah."

My mother was standing by the entrance of the reception room.

I smiled nonchalantly while staring at her. "You're here."

She nodded as a bout of silence filled the room. I stared at the TV within
this silence. The darkened screen reflected both my mother and myself.

A faint aroma of perfume wafted past my nose, making me feel rather
strange in the process. Once upon a time, she was the one person I just
couldn't understand.

But now, I didn't even need to resort to [Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint] to
figure out what she was thinking about.

"I'm fine, mother. Please don't worry."

A soft sigh could be heard next.

"I'm sorry, son."

"But, you haven't done anything."

"This time, it…"

"There's been a lot of interview requests, hasn't it?"

"They have been declined. There's no need for you to personally step
up. You saving this world or destroying it, it matters not to them." The
voices from the megaphones were still coming from afar.

I knew very well what my mother was worried about, and what she was
apologising for.

"I'm not the 'Kim Dokja' from back then."
I pulled the curtains back on the window, and the cameras pointing at the
plaza all shifted towards in my direction.

In the past, I was scared of the cameras; scared of someone looking at me,
and terrified of strangers yapping about me in strange languages.

"I'll do an interview."

"…Are you sure about this, son? How about giving it another thought…?"

"They also have the right to know."

I switched the TV on again. I saw the news headline pop up on the upper
part of the screen.

– What is <Kim Dokja's Company>'s goal?

– [Industrial Complex] hasn't revealed the Final Scenario's contents yet…

[A portion of Nebulas are focusing on your next course of action!]

[<Star Stream> wishes to tell the story of your 'Conclusion'!]

[Great Dokkaebis are summoning you to the 'Final Scenario' location.]

[A portion of Nebulas wish to form an alliance with your…]

"At 8 o'clock tonight. Please contact both the Dokkaebis as well as the
Constellations."




Been a while, but I found and read the first version of the 'Ways of
Survival'; the pure, unsullied version, before the author decided to alter it.

[Currently, both you and your Nebula have acquired the qualification of the
'Final Scenario'.]
[You can enter the 'Final Scenario' location at any time.]

The Final Scenario from the 'Ways of Survival' was actually a great war
against the 'Outer Gods'.

Yoo Joonghyuk from the original cut the Outer God King's head off during
that scenario and completed his own 'Conclusion' that way.

In a certain way, it was rather similar to the 'Great Apocalypse Scenario' we
had experienced already. Actually, if we were unsuccessful in our quest to
stop the Great Apocalypse, then it'd probably go on to become the prelude
to the Final Scenario, instead.

⸢The 'Outer Gods' that were supposed to become the Final Scenario's
calamities have been sealed away.⸥
I looked at the three sealing spheres located in the middle of the [Factory].
That's where the 'Kings' that descended to this world was currently asleep.
The 'Living Flame', the 'Master of the Sunken Island', and even the
'Monarch of the Great Abyss' – all three of them.

The only one not sealed away was the 'King of the Silver Heart' who didn't
appear as a calamity.

– We shall watch your Story until its end.

The 999th turn's Uriel said that to me during the final moments before
sealing herself and her companions within the [Apocalypse Dragon Sealing
Sphere]. She estimated that an incredible aftermath's storm would ravage
them after they willingly went against the agreement with the Bureau and
gave up on the positions of the calamities.

[You have concluded the 'Great Apocalypse Scenario' in an abnormal
manner.]

[A portion of Constellations are expressing their dissatisfaction at your
manner of progressing the scenario!]
[A portion of Great Dokkaebis hold inexplicable animosity towards you.]

[A small number of Great Dokkaebis acknowledge your achievement of
convincing the 'Outer Gods'.]

[Currently, a number of the Wennys hold a favourable view of you.]

Countless messages continued to rise up in the air even now.

[Hidden scenario – 'One Single Story's' completion is imminent.]

[A satisfactory 'Giant Story' has been completed due to the latter half of the
'Conclusion(結)'.]

[<Star Stream> is recommending possible names for your final Story.]

[Please select the Giant Story's name.]

[Depending on your selection, your 'Conclusion' will be decided.]

I still hadn't picked a name from among the <Star Stream>'s
recommendations.

"Kim Dokja."

Han Sooyoung entered while pushing open the creaking door.

"How are our companions feeling?"

"About the same. Yoo Joonghyuk's a bit injured, but it's not so bad. The
[Life and Death Pill]'s effects are seriously no joke, you know."

She then proudly boasted that she got herself another pill – which wasn't
like her – before placing that very pill on my palm.

"Eat it if you think you're about to croak, okay?"

"If only you sounded nicer. I'd have been moved to tears."
Han Sooyoung stared at my face with unreadable light in her eyes. This soft
darkness was scattering away like a screen of fog between us.

A faint trace of light leaked out from the sealing sphere trapping the 999th
turn's Uriel. Han Sooyoung's face glowed warmly under that light.

"I guess this really is the end."

I nodded my head.

"What was it like, back in the original? The Final Scenario, it… No,
never mind. Things have changed completely from the original,
anyway." She was right.

We had already ended the war against the 'Outer Gods' that's supposed to be
the original novel's Final Scenario. So, the 'Final Scenario' we were about to
face should be very different from the original.

"What happens when you complete the 'Conclusion'?"

"Probably a meeting with the King of Stories."

"You mean, the Dokkaebi King?" asked Han Sooyoung. She pondered
something for a bit, then continued on. "Are you going to meet that guy?"

"I will. Not right away, but still."

"What do you mean? Don't make me worried here."

There was the sound of knocking, and a faint wind blew across us. One of
the Complex's residents peeked his head through the open gap of the door
Han Sooyoung had left behind.

"Representative-nim? We have a guest, sir."

A guest?

[It's been a while, descendant.]
An old-fashioned tone of voice greeted me. An unexpected existence came
to visit, as it turned out.

"…Pungbaek?"




Heaven's wind god, 'Pungbaek'.

Only then did I remember what my mother told me earlier. She said that I
should meet up with Pungbaek before I entered the 'Final Scenario', didn't
she?

[Descendant, your choice was reckless. Letting the 'Outer Gods' live is no
different than you embracing the calamity itself.]

…Did he show up here to spout more kkondae-like rubbish?

Pungbaek must've found my actions not to his liking, because he began a
lengthy sermon at my expense. Such as, the young ones looking down on
scenarios nowadays, us not being serious about the scenarios, etc, etc…

"Excuse me, grandpa?"

[I don't have the time to waste, so I shall get right to the point. Descendant,
you might find yourself in great danger once you enter the Final Scenario.]

"Great danger?"

[I say this because I've been observing your methods for a very long time.]

He spoke as if he knew just about everything I was planning to do in my
future. Han Sooyoung next to me cackled as if she was greatly amused by
this. I shot her a glare and asked Pungbaek.

"Just what is it that you came here to tell me?"
[<Hongik> can lend you aid, descendant.]

I ended up frowning without realizing it. I now could figure out why he was
here. This dude, even until the end…

"I don't need it. You probably will demand some kind of nonsensical
payment, anyw…"

[We don't need things like that. Witnessing the birth of a 'Myth-grade
Constellation' from the Korean Peninsula is more than enough for us.]
I couldn't help but doubt my own hearing just then.

[You'll find <Hongik>'s founding gods among the Myth-grade
Constellations in the Final Scenario. If your situation turns for the worse,
ask them for their aid. If you're genuine in your request, they should be
compelled to make a move.]

"…Have you come here to tell me that?"

Pungbaek expressionlessly stroked his beard and replied. [Correct.]

"I'm a bit moved, actually."

Pungbake lightly coughed to clear his throat, then his body scattered away
in winds.

[I've conveyed everything I wished to say. Let us meet again in the Final
Scenario.]

Less than a blink later, only the chilly wind remained there.

Han Sooyoung piped up, sounding somewhat bemused. "He's really coy,
isn't he? How adorable."
"Well, he was a good Constellation back in the original, so." "I

guess we do have some allies, then. Your life wasn't in vain, man."

I'd be happy if that was truly the case.


[Constellation, 'Demon-like Judge of Fire', says she's also here.]

[Constellation, 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon', argues that only the
bad companions can be true companions, and…] [Constellation.
'Most Ancient Liberator', is…] I looked up at the sky and smirked a
little.

Han Sooyoung spoke up. "You, you grinning that unlucky grin again. It's
almost 8, so get ready. People are waiting for you."

I nodded before heading to the upper levels of the [Factory]. I could hear
the murmurs coming from the interior. All manners of media houses,
Dokkaebis, and Constellations were waiting for me.

Before I could make my entrance to the press conference venue, though,
one of the Complex's residents stopped me.

"Excuse me, representative-nim. Preparations aren't finished yet."

…Now that I thought about it, since when did people of the [Industrial
Complex] start calling me with that title?

Didn't they used to call me the 'Demon King' all this time?

"I ordered them to call you that. You being called Demon King-nim every
single time kinda made me feel like we're this world's enemies or
something."

"Well, sure, I guess… But, uh, Seolhwa-ssi, is this really necessary?"
Before I knew it, I was pushed down on a chair. And then, my lips began
quivering from the sensation of a soft brush tickling my cheek.

The focused Lee Seolhwa replied seriously while painting my face. "You're
supposed to be our representative, so we must ensure that you look
presentable first."

"Your words hurt in a variety of ways, you know."

My companions were watching us from nearby as if they had found
something quite entertaining. I felt like a monkey in a zoo.

Han Sooyoung fidgeted around with my hair from behind and asked me.
"By the way, will you remain as a blondie forever?"

"No, it's because of the Great Sage's Status seeping into me. I should go
back to normal in a little while."

"Your hair is really soft, though."

[Constellation. 'Most Ancient Liberator' says that his hair is the result of an
extensive, arduous training regime…]

"It's finished."

Lee Seolhwa finished painting me in an instant and spoke while placing a
mirror before me. Although it was a bit embarrassing to say this myself, a
man handsome enough to ponder whether to slap Yoo Joonghyuk's cheeks
or not was staring back at me in the reflection.

I sneaked a glance to my side, but my companions weren't saying anything.
Several steps away, Yoo Joonghyuk was glaring at me with eyes implying
how unimpressed he was.

"Kim Dokja."
I nodded, put my coat on, and placed the Unbroken Faith on my hips. With
the exception of the formal business suit underneath, this was my regular
combat outfit, through and through.

"Let's go."

We entered the press conference venue. Countless stars and cameras were
now looking at me in this wide-open outdoor venue.

Near-blinding rays came down from the spotlights above. My companions
and I were being projected on a giant holographic panel.

Loud cheerings came from the residents of the Industrial Complex. What
accompanied the outpouring of their cheering were the stories of those
waiting for me.

[The absolute majority of Constellations are focusing their attention on your
decision!]

[The absolute majority of Constellations are curious about the name of your
final Story!]

Those that worry about the safety of the Korean Peninsula, and
Constellations that were curious about this planet's future.

Those who were scared of what lay waiting in the Final Scenario, and those
who worried about their own survival.

Beings who were concerned about the power we possessed and were trying
to take it away.

Those saying why we chose to appear only now, and the Incarnations
pleading with us to take them to the 'Final Scenario'…

[Constellation, 'Demon King of Salvation', is starting his story.]

As the countless questions flooded in, my Story made a move. The skies
wavered and the ground quaked – when the Status of a Myth-grade
Constellation was unleashed, the entirety of the Peninsula seemed to sink
into a pit of silence. Every single one waiting for my answer looked at me.

I slowly opened my lips.

[Everyone.]

And then, I began my story.

[I have no thoughts of saving you.]
               Chapter 483: Ep. 92 - Final Scenario, II


My declaration caused unrest among the crowd. Reporters ceaselessly
snapped away with their cameras; lower- and mid-rank Dokkaebis reporting
the situation on their own channels were now carrying astonished
expressions on their faces.

[Many Constellations find your statement quite interesting!]

[Great Dokkaebis are closely listening to your statement.]

[Every Dokkaebi from the <Bureau> is focusing on your words and

actions!]

– What do you mean by that?!

– Representative Kim Dokja-nim!

It was truly something else to witness the Constellations, Incarnations, and
even the Dokkaebis carrying the exact same expressions.
With a friendly little smile on my face, I opened my mouth once more. [It's
exactly as I said. I simply can't see the reason to save you all.]

– Are you saying you will throw away Korea?

– In that case, what will happen to all the Incarnations that supported
youuntil now?!

Support, was it?

[How did they support us, then?]

Agitation spread out in an instant. My quizzical tone of voice caused the
reporters to shoot up from their seats and start yelling at me. As expected,
the power of media seemed to be mighty enough to even oppose a
Mythgrade Constellation's Status.

– Who do you think has been overlooking the <Kim Dokja's
Company>'styranny?!

– Didn't everyone go along with your wishes until now?!

Overlooking the tyranny, was it…?

Before I could respond, though, Constellations chimed in first.

[A portion of Constellations are mocking the reporters' statements.]

[Korean Peninsula's ancient Constellations are in lamentation!]

[Constellation, 'Goryeo's First Sword', is glaring at the descendants.]

Never mind whether it was a tyranny or not, I didn't even know what
exactly they had been 'overlooking' so far. Wasn't there demonstrations
against <Kim Dokja's Company> taking place every single day on the
devastated Yeouido even now?
I quietly stared at the various shouting reporters, before asking them.
[And what exactly were my wishes?] – That is…!

[Have I ever asked any one of you to do something for me?]

Right there and then, the reporters shut their mouths and glanced at each
other. Dokkaebis were now forming expressions of genuine interest. To
them, even things like this should prove to be an entertaining Story. Well, it
was an event of the 'Demon King of Salvation' forsaking his own land, after
all.

What rescued the reporters falling into the pit of confusion was a group of
Incarnations biding their time on the side of the [Industrial Complex].

– It's only natural for the one possessing great power to shoulder the
responsibility. And you are abandoning that responsibility right now.

An old man wearing a shabby hat suddenly stepped forward and said that
out aloud. Shady, cunning glare in his eyes could be seen beneath the
crooked rim of his headgear. I couldn't immediately remember who it was,
but that line, it also appeared in the 'Ways of Survival'. I heard Lee Jihye's
voice coming from behind.

"What the hell. That geezer also showed up here?"

It seemed that the group belonged to the alliance down in Busan. The
hidden movers that took over the alliance while we were away from the
Peninsula had finally revealed themselves, in other words.

Behind them, the clearly-visible flags of the veteran's association waved by
the ones wearing blue headbands. And then, alliance members from the
countryside stood left and right of this group and angrily raised their voices.

– Demon King of Salvation, you must uphold the duty of the strong. Are
younot the sole 'Myth-grade Constellation' active within the Korean
Peninsula?
Some emphasized what my duty was, while…

– I beg of you, do not abandon the Korean Peninsula! If you behave like
this,what will the poor citizens of this land do in turn??

…Some tried to appeal to my sympathy.

– Please, take us with you to the Final Scenario! Everyone who managed
tosurvive until now has the right to be rewarded properly!

– No one among us wanted to become a part of the 'scenario'! Are
youplanning to abandon all these innocent people? Can you even claim to
be this Peninsula's Constellation, then?!

In a certain way, they were right. No one among us wanted to be a part of
the scenarios. Not initially, anyway.

[I see that the various heads of the alliances are present as well. That's

good.] However, was the story still the same even now?

[I wanted to ask you all something. Just what exactly have you been
doing until now, when the 'Final Scenario' is just around the corner?] The
alliance members all looked at each other when they heard me.

– We, we… protected the Peninsula while you were away…!

– Are you looking down on all the hard work the alliances have
performed?!It was us that protected our Peninsula during your absence!

I already knew what they had been doing, anyway. Meanwhile, I spotted a
few alliance members exchanging glances with reporters.

⸢Publish the article – let everyone know that the 'Demon King of Salvation'
is giving up on the Korean Peninsula.⸥
Most likely, they were inciting the mass media.
⸢The 'Demon King of Salvation', revealing his true colours of a demon
king.⸥

I could imagine the headlines already without even asking them. I knew
why they were willing to go this far, of course.

⸢No need to be scared. The Demon King of Salvation is still a human in the
end. He's just another Korean, okay?⸥

⸢As long as he's born in this land, there are some things he can't go against.⸥

⸢Even if he now possesses great power and fame…⸥

They still believed in the system. They believed in the story of ⸢democracy⸥
upheld by humanity for a long time, the Stories like ⸢rationalism⸥ and
⸢institution⸥, or even something like ⸢majority decision⸥.
[Ancient Stories are now looking at you.]

I could see it now; everyone believed they held a share in these Stories, but
in reality, no one did. Even before <Star Stream> arrived on Earth, this
place had been under the rule of a Giant Story. And those believing in this
Giant Story were under the impression that they couldn't be wrong. The
alliance members continued to shout.

– Didn't <Kim Dokja's Company> monopolise the scenarios from the
verystart?! What can we be expected to achieve under such unfair
competitive conditions?!

[But, the Industrial Complex's door is always open to you? All the skills
and Stories we acquired are all publicly available, aren't they?]

– No, but, because you people entered the scenarios first…!

[There are plenty of people from other countries who entered the scenarios
belatedly. Divisions led by Fei Hu or Ranvir Khan are home to many who
have joined only a few months ago, but now find themselves in the latter
half of the scenarios.]

– That's the story for other countries! Our situation isn't the same!

[They don't have the 'Industrial Complex'. Their support structure is
focused on extremely few individuals, too. However, what is it like for
Seoul?]

I snapped my fingers and Biyoo created a panel in the empty air above. A
shot of the [Industrial Complex]'s interior was displayed on it.

[We publicly made available the methods to clear the lower-ranked
scenarios, and even released the list of 'Giant Story scenarios' as well. And
we didn't hold back with our support to those willing to diligently enter the
scenarios, too. We didn't place any restrictions on sex, age, race – none of
those. Because what we were looking for were brave people willing to fight
alongside us.]

The panel now displayed Incarnations going through repeated harsh
training regimes, and my mother commanding them. The faces of both Jo
Yeong-Ran and Lee Bok-Sun working as instructors could be seen next.

And so, they reached this far after going through hellish training and earned
their own Stories.

[I'm talking about these people right before you.]

There were Incarnations possessing indomitable air and vigorous Statuses
guarding the center of the conference venue. They were none other than the
'wanderers' my mother had raised. The heroes that helped my mother stop
the tsunami waves by the eastern shoreline were these very people.

[Is there anyone among you present today that received worse support than
these people?]

No one replied. They were all overwhelmed by the fighting spirit emanating
from the 'wanderers' right before their noses.
People faltering and biting their lips started shouting again.

 –        It's not like we kicked back and enjoyed ourselves all this time!
 We, we'vebeen preparing for various things! Maintaining the systems and
 infrastructures, and getting ready to rebuild our nation once you finish the
 scenario and come back…

[But, why are you getting ready for that? Do you even know what kind of
'Conclusion' is waiting at the end?]

 –         What??

[Why do you believe that this world's 'Conclusion' will be peaceful?]

This world had changed a lot from the one found in the 'Ways of Survival'.
Yoo Joonghyuk, Lee Hyunsung, Lee Jihye, Shin Yoosung – everyone had
changed somewhat from what I used to remember.

However, some things didn't change.

⸢Everyone Yoo Joonghyuk had met all wished for things to go back to how
they were.⸥
Fluster was quickly dyeing the people's expressions. Expressions of being
betrayed by that one hope they had been holding onto. I knew very well
what they wanted, of course.

⸢However, there were none among them that truly desired for 'everything' to
go back to how they were.⸥
What this crowd wanted wasn't peace for everyone, but for 'individuals'.

They had experienced hellish scenarios and managed to survive. And those
who experienced such ordeals definitely didn't want to see everything go
back to 'how it used to be'.

Because the hell they lived through had become a part of their stories now.
⸢…It'll be fine as long as the Final Scenario is over. I now possess power.
At the bare minimum, I'm now in a position to act like a boss among the
Incarnations.⸥

⸢I can't go back to how it was. Just how hard did I struggle to get this far…⸥

⸢If only the <Kim Dokja's Company> wasn't around…⸥

As the countless desires seethed under the surface, I slowly turned my head
and looked at the outer edges of the conference venue.

The alliance members, and certain folks standing even further away than
the reporters, were looking up at this side. Ordinary Incarnations covered in
dust and wearing shabby, dirty clothes and equipment were standing there.

Among them, I saw a young girl. She was only as tall as Shin Yoosung
during the initial stages of the scenarios. She was so young that it must've
been a miracle for her to survive this far. And while standing in that place
that cameras and channels didn't even pay any attention to, she whispered to
herself in a voice that only I could hear.

⸢Does that mean… we are all going to die?⸥

The cameras and their shutter flashes continued to go off, but I only stared
at that girl for a long time.

And eventually, I opened my mouth.

[I'm not a hero. From the beginning, I never planned to save any of you,
and
I'm not planning on doing that in the future, as well. However…]

I slowly looked behind to find…

[…It's possible that the other 'representative' might be holding a different
opinion than mine.]
…Yoo Joonghyuk standing there.




A little while later, me and Han Sooyoung were listening to Yoo
Joonghyuk's speech from behind the stage.

– I also don't know what the Conclusion that guy had been thinking about is
like. However, even I too think about the world's Conclusion that I wish to
see.

In normal times, the extent of his vocabulary would be limited to "I'll kill
you Kim Dokja", but once he got going, he knew how to make a
coolsounding speech. He wasn't the protagonist for nothing, after all.

Han Sooyoung wordlessly stared at me while sucking on a lemon candy.

I spoke as if to make an excuse. "It's not like I can step up to the front and
command everyone forever, you know. Yoo Joonghyuk suits such things
better than me. Even back in the original, too."

She began grinning, so I added something else.

"We need a much more trusty pivotal figure. And that's not my role."

"But, you could do it, though?"

"It's time that we revert back to how things should be. I'm not a protagonist
but a reader, remember?"

"Oh, my? Really? After coming this far?"

I hid my hands behind me and continued to clench and unfurl my fists.
Indeed, even if this Kim Dokja had become a Myth-grade Constellation, I
was still 'Kim Dokja' at the core. My palms were still soaked in sweat.
Standing before the cameras was never an easy thing no matter the
occasion.

"Is that the 'proper conclusion' you've been thinking about?"

"It's the beginning."

"What comes after this, then?"

I didn't answer her.

"Hey, you."

She strode closer, lifted herself up on the tiptoes, and grabbed hold of my
collars.

"You haven't forgotten about the promise to read my novel, have you?"

"Huh?"

"We promised. You forgot?"

I looked into her blazing eyes, and finally recalled the conversation we had
in the past. Right, while exiting from the 'Kaizenix Archipelago', Han
Sooyoung did tell me that.

She said that she wanted to write a novel once all the scenarios had
ended, and when the time came, she wanted me to read it. "You were
being serious back then?"

"You think I'll lie about something like that?!"

I could only grin wryly. "I've got a high standard, so will it be okay with
you?"

"Oh, a dude with a high standard kept reading trash like Ways of Survival
for ten years straight??"
"I might end up writing a bad review, though? Pointing out that it's got no
probability, and say stuff like I'll be dropping this series in my comments,
you know?"

"Go ahead. You'll see what happens next."

I quietly stared at Han Sooyoung's face. She looked back at me with a
serious face, not a hint of backing down visible on that expression. Right,
she was originally like this, wasn't she?

"…I might end up nagging you for more chapter uploads."

"Not a problem. I've written ten chapters in a single day before, so it's fine."

My sense of reality seemed to weaken after I continued this tit-for-tat with
her still holding my collars. The first time I met her, I never imagined that
we'd end up as companions like this. Han Sooyoung who was once the 'king
of the prophets'.

 –       Once upon a time, I discriminated between those that needed to
 surviveand people whose death didn't mean anything.

We could hear Yoo Joonghyuk's voice drifting in.

 –        I always believed that some had to die, while some needed to
 carry on. Ibelieved that was a necessity for the sake of this world. But
 now, I…

Both Han Sooyoung and I stopped yapping while listening to his speech.
Here was Yoo Joonghyuk's inner thoughts that he had never revealed to
anyone directly. His inner side that even the 'Ways of Survival' failed to
shed a light on could be heard now.

 –         But now, I'm not sure anymore.

The protagonist of the 'Ways of Survival' was speaking his heart.
Behind his back, the Stories of the regression turn we lived through flowed
out.

He was the sole existence in this world who couldn't forget the previous
world – the protagonist wounded and hurt by betrayals from the distant
past.

 –         I received help from those I believed to be evil in my previous
 lives.

We could see Yoo Joonghyuk battling against Asmodeus next.

He then met his end after a fierce battle during the 2nd regression turn.

 –       Then, I fought on the same battlefield with the one who betrayed
 mebefore.

Anna Croft, helping us fight off the Apocalypse Dragon.

Yoo Joonghyuk stared at those Stories for a long time before continuing on.
– I haven't forgiven them. But that doesn't mean I wish to seek revenge on
them during this lifetime. Because my life this time is not the one I had
lived before. Just like how this world is no longer the world that you used
to know.

People were listening to Yoo Joonghyuk's story.

They were neither regressors nor protagonists. Even then, they all carried
expressions of certain understanding.

 –         You surviving this far doesn't mean everything will be permitted
 to you.No, it simply means you now have more responsibility. The sin of
 living on, the sin of surviving by trampling on someone else's stories, the
 sin of using others' Stories as your fertiliser and daring to spread your
 branches and sprouting new buds – so, if you're alive, then be responsible
 for those sins.
Everyone that understood him, and even those who didn't, they all looked
completely absorbed in his speech.

These were the words of a human who lived his life cutting down
Constellations in the battlefields. He spoke neither the friendly words of
consolation nor of encouragement, but without a doubt, he was still
reaching them.

His voice sounded far more sincere than the true voice coming from a
Constellation like myself.

 –        I can't make a promise of saving everyone. I merely try to
 survive thescenarios, and I certainly can't live through them instead of
 you. So, there is only one thing I can tell you right now.

This was undoubtedly where Yoo Joonghyuk should be.

 –         Until the scenario for every one of you ends, I shall promise not
 to die orregress.
               Chapter 484: Ep. 92 - Final Scenario, III


Yoo Joonghyuk's massive announcement caused the crowd to go silent.

The movers of the alliances, not won over by his speech, continued to
exchange knowing glances with each other, but the crowd was no longer
within their ability to control.

"Supreme King…"

Someone softly muttered. Soon after that, reporters began dreaming up of
potential headlines all on their own.

⸢Supreme King Yoo Joonghyuk, declares his desperate resistance!⸥ ⸢<Kim
Dokja's Company>'s joint top representative Yoo Joonghyuk, "won't give
up on the scenario till the end."⸥

Incarnations who heard about him being a regressor seemed to be even
more excited than ever before. Some shouted out loudly, and the [Industrial
Complex] was immediately filled up with the roars of cheering.
"Supreme King Yoo Joonghyuk!"

"Yoo Joonghyuk!! Yoo Joonghyuk!"

Everyone was now chanting his name.

Even those making snide remarks against <Kim Dokja's Company> earlier
had been swept up in the flow and were staring at him now.

Things wouldn't suddenly improve with this, but at a bare minimum, the
foundation had been laid today. The 'world after the scenarios' should now
form with Yoo Joonghyuk as its center.

Even if I said the exact same things, I wouldn't receive a similar level of
cheering. Probably.

Han Sooyoung finally released my collars and while looking in Yoo
Joonghyuk's direction, opened her mouth. "If only he acts like that every
day."

I agreed with her. However, that was his personality, so…

Now that it got going, the chanting showed no sign of stopping any time
soon. The cheering that began with Yoo Joonghyuk's name soon moved
onto Jung Heewon, then Lee Hyunsung, and even over to Lee Jihye.

And as every name except the 'Demon King of Salvation' was being
chanted out, my companions shifted their gaze in my direction, looking
clearly uncomfortable. I waved my hand at them to indicate that it was
alright. They deserved to be cheered on, anyway.

Eventually, the chanting reached Han Sooyoung's name, too.

"Black Flame Demon Empress, Han Sooyoung!!"

The crowd in the audience gallery was now searching for Han Sooyoung
hiding behind the stage.
I spoke to her. "It's your turn. Go ahead."

But she shook her head, instead. "I hate stuff like that."

"I thought you liked being the center of attention? Was I wrong?"

"That's as a writer, not as Han Sooyoung, you know."

While lightly tapping on the ground with her heel, she lowered her gaze and
frowned a little. When she didn't show up, the chanting naturally shifted
over to Shin Yoosung's name.

The companions waving their hands on the venue as seen beyond the
curtains came across as famous movie stars in my eyes.

[Korean Peninsula's Constellations are proud of <Kim Dokja's Company>!]

While watching them carry on, I spoke up as if to voice my thoughts. "Han
Sooyoung?"

"What is it?"

"If this world was a novel, which volume do you think we are in right
now?"

She seemed to ponder this quandary for a bit before making her reply.
"Not sure. Depends on who wrote it, I guess." But, of course.

Some might write a whole book out of what had happened during a single
day, but some would condense everything that happened in 100 years into a
single sentence.

Han Sooyoung continued on. "If it was me, we should be past at least the
20th volume."

"…That's a lot."

"It should be. Lots of things happened, right?"
Indeed, lots. Without a doubt, it had been a long journey.

If it was twenty volumes-long, then just from the quantity alone, this book
should be on the scale of a proper epic.

Dusk was settling in from the skies above the conference venue. Not sure
why, but it felt as if the sun was setting much sooner than usual today.

Han Sooyoung spoke as if she understood how I felt. "But then again,
there are some people who can read all twenty volumes in one sitting."
Suddenly, a corner of my chest grew cold.

I wanted to ask her – have I been reading every story that I found at a
suitable pace?

Could I say that I've read the stories of everyone precious to me thoroughly
and didn't miss a single thing?

"Kim Dokja."

"What is it?"

"You may not be this world's protagonist nor a really cool side character."

"…"

"However, you have read it with all of your heart. I know that."

I didn't know what to say.

"And everyone you've read, they are standing there now."

Han Sooyoung looked at the people by the press conference venue.

I too stared at them. Companions I cared about were standing on a spot
almost within reach, just beyond the curtains.

They existed beyond the curtains, alive and moving.
Yoo Joonghyuk glaring at the crowd, Jung Heewon grinning back at them,
Lee Jihye jumping up and down in fluster, Shin Yoosung waving her hand
towards me…

Someone had written their stories. And I had read them.

Every story started off from there.

While waving my hand back at Shin Yoosung, I opened my mouth.

"Tomorrow morning, we leave for the Final Scenario's location."




After the press conference came to an end, the companions gathered in the
reception room.

Jung Heewon massaged her shoulder while looking at the rebroadcast of the
conference.

"Eii… Cameras just aren't my friends, it seems."

It wasn't just the Korean Peninsula, but the entire <Star Stream> was set
abuzz by the <Kim Dokja's Company>'s press conference.

– I have no thoughts of saving you.

Jung Heewon tutted after watching Kim Dokja and his bright face making
that declaration within the display panel. "Seriously, though. He can't help
himself with things people will hate him for."

"Still, doesn't he look more presentable now that his face has been fixed up
properly?"

Lee Seolhwa, in charge of Kim Dokja's make-up, nodded her head in
satisfaction.
Lee Jihye added something else. "Now that I think about it, doesn't Dokja
ahjussi's features come across a bit manlier now? I mean, he used to be on
the paler side, and kinda felt like a piece of stretched dough, you know?"

"Uht? I was thinking the same, too."

A few among them nodded their heads in agreement.

For sure, Kim Dokja of now had changed a lot compared to when they first
met him. It wasn't just the impression he gave off, either.

Jung Heewon muttered as if she was recalling the distant past. "Honestly, I
thought he was a bit of slick-tongued miser the first time I saw him."

Just how different was Kim Dokja of the first scenario to that of a man
about to face the Final Scenario?

While listening to others chat on, Jung Heewon stared at Kim Dokja's face
in the screen – at his eyes, sparkling when he was reading the prepared
script, or the corners of his lips that moved mysteriously when he smirked.

Every little thing like that was serving as proof that he definitely exited in
that place.

While feeling those expressions loom closer than before, Jung Heewon
began pondering Kim Dokja's Stories. Could it be possible that the Stories
they had created together was changing him just a little? If so, that would
be nice. What if their story had changed him like how he had changed
them?

"By the way, where is Dokja-ssi?"

"I think he's making preparations for the Final Scenario."

"Wait, that ahjussi isn't cooking up yet another weird thing all by himself,
right?"
Lee Jihye's words caused a flitting shadow to cast over everyone's
expression.

The person who lifted the mood up was the smiling Yoo Sangah hugging
the two kids with both of her arms. "He promised not to do that, so let us
believe in him."

Kim Dokja inside the screen was busy saying something only to be
subjected to a barrage of insults. Jung Heewon watched that for a long time
before placing her hand on the panel. She felt this lukewarm sensation.

"…Can I really trust him?"

She whispered in a really quiet voice, yet everyone present caught that.
Even then, no one among the group looked at her strangely.

Shin Yoosung muttered out. "Ahjussi's skin looks so nice."

They thought that they had grown closer to him by now, yet Kim Dokja's
face seemed as distant as ever.




Throughout the night, I had been thinking about the Final Scenario.

I read the excerpts taken from the 'Ways of Survival' that I found essential,
and also spoke to Han Sooyoung through [Midday Tryst] as well. It was to
use her [Predictive Plagiarism] to predict what might happen to us in the
future. When I thought that alone wasn't going to be enough, I exchanged
opinions with the 'Secretive Plotter' through Yoo Joonghyuk.

Unfortunately, it was as if the Plotter was trying to be as obtuse as possible
when it came to the matter of Conclusion.
【The path you're about to walk on hasn't been trodden by anyone. Taking
cues from other world-lines could become poison for the current you,
instead.】

Since I understood what he was saying here, I decided not to query him any
further.

"What about Anna Croft?"

"She has withdrawn from the Peninsula along with 'Zarathustras'
yesterday."

It'd been nice to get the help from her 'Precognition', but unfortunately, I
seemed to have lost that chance.

Swiiiish!

The blade of the [Black Heavenly Demon Sword] scythed past the air.
About a dozen or so steps away, Yoo Joonghyuk was currently focused on
his training. He seemed to be swinging in the exact same pose as before, yet
he treated every and each movement with care as if they contained
profound meanings. Maybe it was possible for him to repeat all those lives
because he was capable of doing something like that.

"Goddammit. What kind of a crappy development is this…"

Han Sooyoung was also racking her brain trying to guess how the Final
Scenario might unfold. However, even she seemed to be stuck, going
nowhere fast.

Even if her [Predictive Plagiarism] was powerful, it wasn't truly omniscient.
If that was the case, the 1863rd turn's Han Sooyoung wouldn't have run into
so much trouble.

I studied her for a little while before switching on my smartphone. Files
appeared on the screen – from the original version of the 'Ways of
Survival', to its final revised version.
– Three Ways to Survive a Ruined World (final revision).txt

I quietly stared at that file for a long time, before turning the phone off. I
didn't want to break the resolution I had been sticking to until now.

⸢Kim Dok ja.⸥

I raised my head as [the Fourth Wall] called out to me.

'What's up?'

⸢Ha ving a ha rd ti me?⸥

I smirked a little at that unexpected line of text.

I had forgotten about this guy. The one who had stayed the longest with me
so far was probably this 'wall', wasn't it?

'It's fine. I have you'.

It was all thanks to [The Fourth Wall] that I managed to come this far.

If this guy didn't alleviate my mental shock during the first scenario, and if
it didn't mitigate the physical pain I suffered during the countless
lifethreatening situations, then I'd have ended up as the wandering ghost of
the scenarios a long time ago.

Tsu-chut, chuchuchut.

Sparks danced in the air reminiscent of a small child's figure excitedly
quivering about. For a very brief moment there, I thought I saw a
triumphant face of a little kid above the dancing sparks.

⸢Eh hem, you wa nna see yo ur att rib ute win dow?⸥

This guy, does he think I want to see the attribute window every time I have
a chance?
'Nah, it's fine. I don't need it right now'.

Seeing it might help me out. However, there was something else even more
important than that right now.

'Actually, there's something I'm even more curious about'.

⸢Wh at is it?⸥

It was a question I should've asked a long time ago. However, since I
couldn't get any straight answers to begin with, I ended up coming up with
all sorts of theories by myself concerning this very question.

'Just why is the 'Final Wall' exactly?'

[The Fourth Wall] remained silent for a bit. I began thinking that it might
try to change the topic or filtering might get thrown in my face here. Just
how long passed by like that?

⸢It's a wa ll wh ere every st ory is writt en on.⸥

…Was it because the 'Final Scenario' was literally around the corner?

Although the answer remained just as puzzling, it seemed that [The Fourth
Wall] didn't want to hide the information anymore. So, I asked again.

'Let me change the question. What are you exactly? And why do the
fragments of the Wall exist?'

⸢Gu ard ing the pre cious themes, th at is the Wall's du ty.⸥

Suddenly, I thought of something. The 'Wall of Impossible Communication'
Jang Hayoung possessed – when I thought about it, it wasn't just her, was
it?
The important individuals from the 'Ways of Survival' all possessed similar
walls. Sakyamuni possessed the 'Wall of Samsara', while Agares and
Metatron possessed the 'Wall that Divides Good and Evil'.

⸢Be cau se, the re is more th an one theme.⸥

⸢A st ory is a col lec tion of nar rati ves.⸥

[The Fourth Wall] was a fragment of the 'Final Wall'. And the 'fragment'
meant that it could potentially be slotted back in its original position.

In that moment I felt clarity wash over me. If it was as I suspected – if this
'Wall' was the existence protecting the 'Story', then…

Tsu-chuchuchu…

[The Fourth Wall]'s figure seemed to waver before my eyes in the air. Then,
a library filled with countless bookshelves seemed to glimmer beyond it. I
reached out into the air, causing the texts from the books to scatter away.

What replaced them, though, was an incredibly ancient and worn-down
wall. This thing that reminded me of a prehistoric cave wall, was the 'First
Wall'.

I extended my hand towards this wall that protected me from the cold, the
pain, and from various trauma.

From ancient times, walls were created to protect something.

⸢You mu st pre pare the last sto ry, Kim Dok ja.⸥

And starting from an unknown era, humans began writing something on
that wall.

That eventually became the Story.

⸢You are its last.⸥
               Chapter 485: Ep. 92 - Final Scenario, IV


"Are you all finished with your preparations?"

It was a regular morning like any other. The air was clean and fresh, and the
complexion on the companions' faces wasn't gloomy, either. If it weren't for
their current combat attire, I'd have totally believed that we were on our
way to a picnic from their expressions alone.

⸢And that's why Kim Dokja was truly happy.⸥

"Preparations were done a while ago. Besides all that, it seems like you
have something to say to us, Dokja-ssi?"

When I snapped awake from my thoughts, I discovered Jung Heewon
pressing her face closer to me. As I momentarily remained at a loss with my
lips bobbing a little, Lee Jihye quickly butted in.

"I don't want to hear it, though. He's going to say some stuff about it's too
dangerous so we don't have to go etc, etc, right?"
"Right. Since when was it not dangerous?"

"This time, it's serious! It'll really be dangerous~!…"

Lee Jihye mildly raised her voice while mimicking my speech pattern.

Hang on a sec, since when did I ever speak like that…? I frowned deeply
and opened my mouth. "No, that's not it. This time really is…"

"See? I knew it. Cough up the 100 Coins, eonni."

Jung Heewon pushed the Coins to Lee Jihye with a dejected face.

Han Sooyoung watched this spectacle unfold and shook her head before
addressing me. "You better start learning, man."

"Learn what?"

"You can only make your companions promise you the same thing so many
times. If you persist with this, what will they start thinking next? Ah, this
guy, he thinks our pledge is some kind of a joke. He sees every promise we
made is a pack of lies!"

"That wasn't my intention at all. Everyone, I genuinely apologise if you
misundersto…"

Having finished the hand-over of her 100 Coins to Lee Jihye, Jung Heewon
suddenly asked a question. "By the way, what's our plan this time? It
looked like you were thinking up of one with Sooyoung yesterday?"

"There isn't one, actually."

Perhaps finding my answer suspicions, she pressed her head closer once
more. "Really?"

"It'll be different from how things had been so far. Even I don't know what
will happen during the Final Scenario."

"That's weird. You aren't hiding anything, right?"
"No, not at all."

[Character 'Jung Heewon' is activating 'Lie Detection Lv.5'!]

[Your statement has been confirmed as a lie.]

"Wowsers, you now even lie with a straight face?"

…Just when did she learn [Lie Detection]? Dammit.

I hastily made my excuse. "It's difficult to give you a detailed story right
now. Things might change later if I tell you something. Regardless of what
the scenario is, please choose what you believe to be the right decision. If
we succeed, we will be able to survive together."

"And that 'we' also includes you, Dokja-ssi?"

I quietly stared at Yoo Sangah before nodding my head.

"Yes."

"And we can all live together in a big house with everyone?"

"That's correct."

"I haven't even graduated yet, so everyone will come to my graduation
ceremony, right?"

"That's right."

"Hyung! In that case, can we go to a PC Bang…?!"

"We can."

[Character 'Jung Heewon' is activating 'Lie Detection Lv.5'!]

[Your statement has been confirmed as truth.]

Only then the hints of relief brushed past their expressions.
I took a look at their faces one at a time – Yoo Sangah, Jung Heewon, Lee
Hyunsung, Lee Jihye, Lee Gilyoung, Shin Yoosung, Lee Seolhwa, Gong
Pildu, Jang Hayoung, Han Sooyoung…

"If we're done here, let's get going."

…And even Yoo Joonghyuk, too.

Different stories existed for each individual. The stories that I hadn't had the
chance to finish reading yet.

"Let's get going, ahjussi! We haven't even entered the scenario yet, so
there's no need to make the heroic determination and stuff now, right?"

I agreed with Lee Jihye's opinion. The Final Scenario hadn't even begun
yet. I slowly breathed in and out deeply, and raised my head to find a portal
appearing on a spot high up in the air.

[Portal leading to '99th scenario' has been generated!]

Bihyung had created that portal.

"Let's go."

We stepped through the portal. The surrounding view crumbled away in an
instant, only to be resurrected just as quickly.

Behind us was the wide, expansive view of <Star Stream>, while the front
was dominated by the sight of Dokkaebis waiting for us.

"Uh? Didn't we come here before?"

Here was the 'Gate of Star Stream', the very last gateway that led to the
final gate, and home to the <Bureau>, the headquarters of all Dokkaebis.

[<Kim Dokja's Company>, your entry qualification has been confirmed.]

"…It's a straight pass this time."
Dokkaebis didn't bother with any complicated procedures and let us pass
without a fuss.

[The absolute majority of Constellations are watching your entry into the
'Final Scenario'!]

[Many Nebulas are envious of your collective achievements!]

I sensed the Constellations and Nebulas watching us from among the
darkness of the universe.

[Constellations within the 'Final Scenario' are growing tense at <Kim
Dokja's Company>'s entrance!]

[You and your Nebula have entered the Final Scenario's location!]

When I opened my eyes again, I was treated to the sight of the galaxy
swirling around in a vortex. Countless stars were continuously circulating
around while generating auroras.

They were Final Scenario's Constellations. Stars that had reached the
Mythgrade a long time ago, or those that were receiving the graces of such
beings.

However, rather than approaching us, those stars remained circulating on
the skies high above an ancient castle.

"Isn't that…"

And beyond the massive, ancient castle where the stars were dancing
around, was a wall so vast that we couldn't even see its ends.

"Is that the 'Final Wall'?"

I quietly stared at that wall.

It was as if that wall spread out within the entire landscape to arrogantly
proclaim that this here was the end of this world-line.
⸢Everything within this world exists to be recorded on it.⸥

['King of Stories' is now looking at you.]

['King of Stories' has summoned you.]

I was greeted by this jolting sensation that caused all the hair on my body to
stand up. I could definitely sense it; a creature that moved the ginormous
Story called <Star Stream> was waiting by the center of that 'wall'.

My companions must've sensed it too, since they all looked tense.

Only Yoo Joonghyuk maintained that preternaturally calm expression of
his. "I don't see any Constellations."

It was as he said; although we could see the stars spinning around in the
skies, not a single Constellation was walking around in their incarnated
form. It was as if they knew we were coming so they had all run off to
somewhere.

It was the Great Dokkaebis welcoming us, instead.

[Great Dokkaebi 'Heoche' is incarnating into the scenario!]

[Great Dokkaebi 'Harong' is incarnating into the scenario!]

[Great Dokkaebi 'Haram' is incarnating into the scenario!]

[Great Dokkaebi 'Horong' is incarnating into the scenario!]

[Great Dokkaebi 'Noksu' is incarnating into the scenario!]

When Dokkaebis possessing mighty Statuses appeared all at once, even I
couldn't help but feel the oppressive weight from their combined aura.

[You've come, <Kim Dokja's Company>.]
The Great Dokkaebi Heoche, the dude who intruded upon the <Great War
of Saints and Demons> in order to recruit us, spoke up. He continued on
with eyes of disdain squarely locked on us.

[You have all earned the qualifications of the 'Final Scenario'. Since there is
no need to test you, it'll be fine to simply enter the 'Ark'. A detailed
explanation will be provided afterwards.]

"…The Ark?"

Even before my question could end, a loud, visceral boom resounded out
from the center of the ancient castle. Its middle section opened up, and
something began rising up from the castle's foundation.

⸢And it was a massive ship.⸥

The moment I saw that ship, deja vu brushed past my brain.

⸢It was the ship first seen during the Great War of Saints and Demons.⸥

Indeed, its shape was of the vessel that saved us during the <Great War of
Saints and Demons>. It looked uncannily similar to the <Eden>'s Ark that
evacuated us away from the fierce battle between the Apocalypse Dragon
and the Indescribable Distance.

The only difference being, this one was much, much bigger and
sturdierlooking than the Ark from that time. Its hull, seemingly carved out
from the broken fragment of the wall, emitted both the contrasting white
and dark rays of light.

Great Dokkaebi Heoche continued on as he looked at that hull.

[Originally, this world-line was earmarked as the 'Final World-line'.
However, things started becoming distorted during the process, and the
world-line's distortion is now well beyond salvageable. The Conclusion of
this world can't unlock the 'Final Wall'. Meaning, the epic tale that could
satisfy the 'Oldest Dream' cannot be completed anymore.]
"What rubbish are you talking about??"

[You all shall become the 'seeds'.]

The seeds. I had heard of that term even back in the 'Ways of Survival'. A
term that denoted all the candidates of the 'One Single Story'.

Violent sparks intermittently exploded in the distant darkness of the
universe; they were ominous noises that seemed to imply the end of the
distorted world-line.

A portion of stars got sucked into those deafening booms and were
scattered away in flames before falling to the ground as shooting stars.

The Dokkaebi continued on while looking at the falling stars.

[Think of it as a great honour. It was the will of the 'King of Stories' that
you were chosen as the 'seeds' when you are responsible for ruining this
worldline. You shall ride on the 'Ark' and move onto a new world-line. And
you shall be reborn as the core 'Story' that will become the next worldview.
Just like how those crossing over from the previous world have done.]

Only then did the things he was saying make sense. Basically, he was
telling us to escape from this world.

"You… Are you really going to give up on this world that easily? You want
to abandon this world-line and leave with everyone here? You think such a
suggestion even makes sense???"

[Surely, there's no need to be that surprised? It shouldn't be such a bad
suggestion for you people, too. Your goal is to reach the conclusion where
'no one has been sacrificed', isn't it?]

For a moment there, I became speechless.

[You have succeeded, 'Demon King of Salvation'. You and your
companions can now leave this world-line and survive together.]
Explosion noises, mixed in with cracking thunderclaps, reverberated from
the other side of the distant sky. It was the noise of the Probability the
<Bureau> had been protecting crumbling away.

As I heard those noises, I belatedly began to understand several things.

Such as, why there were no Constellations to be seen nearby; or, how could
the <Bureau> possess such a powerful influence even from the very start of
the worlds.

"…Just how many times have you been repeating this?"

[Is that really important?]

"What happens to those who can't ride on the Ark? Those who didn't get
selected – what will happen to them?"

[You probably have guessed it already without asking us.]

Heoche used his chin to point behind us. That's where the [Turtle Dragon]
Lee Jihye had summoned earlier just in case was. And on top of that ship's
deck, four sealing spheres emitting sparkling light could be seen – the Outer
Gods, including the 'Secretive Plotter'.

I stared at the characters from the original novel, currently sleeping within
the spheres. Those that got excluded by the scenarios would either die or
become Outer Gods, instead.
[New Main Scenario has arrived!]


  <Main Scenario #99 – Escape>

  Type: Main

  Difficulty: ??

  Clear condition: Enter the 'Ark' together with the companions from your
  Nebula.

  Time limit: 2 hours

  Reward: You can cross over to a different world-line by riding on the
  'Ark'. Your 'Story' will start anew in that place, and the Stories you have
  compiled so far will be recorded on <Star Stream>'s 'Final Wall' to be
  passed down for all eternity.

Failure: You will remain in the world being destroyed and die.
               Chapter 486: Ep. 92 - Final Scenario, V


Companions all looked dumbfounded after confirming the scenario's
details. It was such an incredibly simple clear condition. As a matter of fact,
it had to be the easiest out of all the scenarios we experienced so far.

All we had to do was follow the Great Dokkaebi's words and climb aboard
the Ark and then, leave this world-line.

"Dokja-ssi…"

[What are you waiting for? There can't be a better scenario than this one for
you.]

I heard the voices of the Great Dokkaebis floating in the air.

[Know that many Constellations opposed you lot being chosen as the
'seeds'. We chose you even if we had to go against the flow of those stars.]

Bihyung, his lips pale-blue, was lowering his head amongst his peers.
My head became complicated. Why did the 'King of Stories' suddenly
suggest such a scenario? The me currently couldn't figure it out.

One thing's for sure, though – by listening to their suggestion, the survival
of my companions would be guaranteed. ⸢<Kim Dokja's Company>'s Story
would be recorded on the 'Final Wall'. Along with all the other Stories he
hated.⸥

I turned around to find my companions staring at me.

"Everyone."

I tried to say something, but it wasn't easy.

A truly easy path was now available before eyes. If we choose this method,
then we might not even need to resort to our plan.

None of my companions would die, too. And they wouldn't become 'Outer
Gods', as well.

We simply had to get on that ship and cross over to another world-line, and
then, live our new stories as if nothing had ever happened. We just had to
become the rulers of the new world-line with our Stories.

Just like the top gods of <Olympus> and <Asgard>, we'd simply live on
while enjoying all the pleasures the scenario offered in sheer comfort.

"Dokja-ssi."

My gaze met Yoo Sangah's as she looked squarely at me.

⸢However, would we be able to happily live in a big house in that place?⸥

Lee Jihye was grasping the key ring attached to [Twin Dragon Sword]
tightly, and…
⸢Would we be able to congratulate Jihye's graduation with genuine smiles?⸥
…Shin Yoosung and Lee Gilyoung were holding onto the ends of each
other's clothes.

⸢Would I be able to go to a PC Bang with Gilyoung-ie and play games with
him, and…⸥

⸢And, go to the Han River with Yoosung-ie and share a pizza with her?⸥

Finally, Yoo Joonghyuk was glaring at me.

⸢Just like erasing the graffiti scribbled on the Final Wall, could we really
pretend that everything that happened to us meant nothing at all?⸥
The apocalypse had begun, and that couldn't be turned back.

[Constellation, 'Demon-like Judge of Fire', is waiting for your decision.]

Just like how the dead pair of Agares and Metatron couldn't come back.

[Constellation, 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon', is observing your decision.]

[Constellation, 'Secretive Plotter', is observing your decision.]

We couldn't erase the Apocalypse Dragon's second coming as if it had
never happened, and just like how we couldn't change Yoo Joonghyuk's
past regression turns…

⸢Everything that happened in this world was already a part of us.⸥

Han Sooyoung opened her mouth. "Kim Dokja, what are you hesitating for?
You already know what needs to be done, don't you?"

Lee Hyunsung approached me even before I realized it and placed his hand
on my shoulder. As if he knew what I was about to say.

"My thoughts are the same as you, Dokja-ssi."
The Stories we've earned together, and the things that might get left behind,
were all telling our story.

People back on Earth. My mother and the 'wanderers'. Those who shared
the story with us, but not here with us right now.

[Every Story of the Nebula <Kim Dokja's Company> is now looking at
you.]

['The Fourth Wall' is strongly vibrating!]

Some time ago, the 'Secretive Plotter' said to me this:

【When we meet again, I hope you've become the proper master of that
'wall'.】

Jang Hayoung possessed the 'Wall of Impossible Communication', while
Yoo Sangah possessed the 'Wall of Samsara' she inherited from Sakyamuni.
Agares and Metatron possessed the 'Wall that Divides Good and Evil'.

And all these 'walls' each possessed a Story that would be written on that
particular wall.

⸢In that case, what is the Story that should be written on [The Fourth
Wall]?⸥

[The Fourth Wall] said this to me earlier – that I was the 'last' of that 'Final
Wall'.

⸢The finale of all these Stories.⸥

For the last time, I looked at my companions before I spoke my piece. I was
trying to confirm whether we were making the wrong choice or not.

I couldn't tell. There was no sure-fire way to figure out the truth.
However…
⸢Do what you believe is the best, Dokja-ssi.⸥

⸢Ahjussi, we'll die together when the time comes. Got that?⸥

⸢Rather than the shameful survival, I much prefer the righteous end,
actually.⸥
Their voices gave me courage.

The Story boiling up from the deepest part of my body permitted my true
voice to come out.

[We shall not be boarding the Ark.]

It felt as if I could just about see the full stop to a story I had been
pondering for the longest time.

The Great Dokkaebis were staring at me with frozen expressions. Every
Constellation within this world-line was focusing their gazes only on me.

As I felt each and every one of those gazes, this indescribable sense of
freedom washed over me, too.

⸢And at that moment, Kim Dokja realized what the story not written yet in
the 'Ways of Survival' was.⸥
I had read every regression turn found in the 'Ways of Survival'. I still
remembered them all. However, there was one part that even I had failed to
read.

⸢The Epilogue.⸥

From the 0th turn to the 1863rd. Every Story that I read was now gathering
in one spot.
The stories from the nebulas flowing within the heavens were being
integrated into this world-line. I sensed the Constellations in the distance
making their moves behind the scenes, too.

Something was approaching here.

[Do you understand the brevity of what you just said?]

The Great Dokkaebis were asking me.

Some carried expressions implying that they already expected this outcome,
while some looked quite flustered, instead. Actually, neither should matter
to them – after all, everything was simply 'Story' to these creatures.

Everything was the will of <Star Stream> to them, after all.

[<Star Stream> is proposing the names for your final Giant Story.]

[You can now choose between two proposed 'Conclusions'.]


  1. Vagabond of the Destroyed World-line

  2. Ruler of the Despairing Starlight

  …


The names of the last 'Giant Story' we had completed floated up. I stared at
the choices of 'Conclusion' given to me. Both of them sounded rather
grandiose.

⸢And both of them couldn't contain their story in its entirety.⸥

[I won't be accepting the Story names you have proposed.]
[Constellation, 'Demon King of Salvation', has rejected all the
choices proposed by <Star Stream>.] Tsu-chuchuchut!

[I shall not be completing the 'Conclusion' you're talking about.]

I slowly unsheathed the Unbroken Faith from my waist. Most likely, this
moment in time had been set in stone as soon as I first grasped this sword.
[Every Story of the Nebula, <Kim Dokja's Company> has begun their
storytelling!]

Yoo Joonghyuk unsheathed the [Black Heavenly Demon Sword], while
Han Sooyoung undid the bandages off her left hand.

Jung Heewon raised her [Judge's Sword], followed up by Lee Jihye
grasping the [Twin Dragon Sword] with both of her hands.

Yoo Sangah spread out her lotus pedestal, and Shin Yoosung's Chimera
Dragon began roaring on.

Gong Pildu installed the [Armed Fortress] faster than anyone, and I spotted
Jang Hayoung standing at the very top of this fortress while releasing the
Status of a Transcendent.

And finally, Lee Hyunsung stepped forward as if to protect everyone.

They were speaking through their actions. That's why I could tell my story
as well.

[I shall not let any one of you abandon this world-line. Properly witness the
end of the story you have created. Witness with your own eyes… what kind
of an end awaits for the world of your creation.]

The Status of the Story exploding forth from my entire body travelled on
the Unbroken Faith and extended forward.

[Stop this!]
The startled Great Dokkaebis also made a move and withstood my Status. I
unhesitantly shot out the second, then the third, shockwaves from the
Stories.

[<Star Stream> is responding to your group's action!]

[<Bureau> is activating the Probability!]

Even as the vicious storm of sparks tightened around my body, I didn't step
back. All the Stories we had created together were roaring on under the pain
akin to our Incarnation Bodies being torn apart.

[Giant Story, 'Demon Realm's Spring', has begun its storytelling!]

[Giant Story, 'Torch that Swallowed the Myth', has begun its storytelling!]

[Giant Story, 'Season of Light and Darkness', has begun its storytelling!]

[Giant Story, 'Liberator of the Forgotten Ones', has begun its storytelling!]

[Your Giant Story without a name has begun its storytelling!]

What determined a story's 'Conclusion' were the Beginning, the
Development, and finally, the Climax that had come before it. Nothing else
besides could determine what the 'Conclusion' would be like.

I swung my fist towards the sparks before me over and over again. I even
threw the Unbroken Faith into the ripples of the blinding aftermath's storm.

[Your action has caused <Star Stream> to…]

[The possibility of the predetermined 'Conclusion' is…]

[■?■■…■?■■?]

The predetermined texts were shattering right before my eyes. The
oncelegible words were changing to something illegible as if cloudy dust
had settled down on them.
And when that dust eventually cleared, what I saw next was the utterly
wrecked front hull of the Ark.

Kwa-aaaaaah!

I was aware of what would happen by doing something like this.

['King of Stories' is now looking at you.]

[The Wenny King is greatly pleased by your action.]

Even then, this was the best answer I could come up with.

⸢The method of finding the 'Conclusion' not seen before in the original.⸥

⸢The method of saving everyone while resolving the distorted Probability.⸥

Reaching the end of this world through the predetermined 'gi-seung-
jeongyeol' was impossible. Because it was simply the template for the
predetermined 'Conclusion'.

Meaning, this story wouldn't be able to cross the 'Final Wall'.

⸢And that is why Kim Dokja refused the 'Conclusion' handed out to him.⸥

A giant rupture was being generated in the world.

[Your actions have crumbled the predetermined rules of the 'scenario'.]

[A portion of <Star Stream>'s plot is crumbling away!]

[<Star Stream>'s emergency sequence is activating!]

The surrounding view suddenly began changing. I sensed the <Star
Stream> trying its best to shoe-horn me into its own 'Conclusion'.

⸢In the end, everything will become a scenario.⸥
Maybe, the Great Dokkaebis didn't know. Or, maybe they did know, yet
had no choice but to simply carry on. Within this great 'scenario', even the
storytellers would form a part of the scenario itself.

[<Star Stream> happily accepts your actions.]

[<Star Stream>'s Final Story is waking up!]

Just like how a scenario happening outside of scenarios would still remain a
scenario in the end; however, if everything would end as a scenario
anyway, then I should be the one to decide which scenario to live in.

So… take a good look.

[Main scenario has been updated!]

"…Dokja-ssi!"

Companions standing in my near vicinity all stared at me with dazed eyes.

My Incarnation Body was changing along with tingling sensation. And
also, the ominous aura of exclusion rose up above my body, too.

I knew exactly what sort of a scenario this was.

[Mak-nae-yah.]

The landscape of war spread out before our eyes.

And opposite us, Constellations were being summoned. Our enemies, and
companions we once fought together, they were all there.

Anna Croft, China's Fei Hu, India's Ranvir Khan, Japanese Alliance's
Asuka
Ren, <Olympus> and <Asgard>, and other Constellations from not just
<Emperor> but other large Nebulas were all incarnating under the <Star
Stream>'s Probability.
⸢Every Constellation of <Star Stream> was gathering here.⸥

Stars that kept amassing were burning brightly enough to illuminate the
entirety of the universe. They were illuminating me as if they'd not permit
even a single speck of darkness to exist in the cosmos.

⸢This was the <Star Stream>'s final battlefield.⸥

Tsu-chuchuchuchut!

This was none other than the 'stage' the 1863rd turn's Yoo Joonghyuk had
fought on – the place where he had faced off against the seething Outer
Gods and their 'Outer God Kings'.

If there was one thing different from back then and now…

The enemy to be fought this time wasn't the 'Outer God King'.

[Constellation, 'Demon-like Judge of Fire', is…!]

[Constellation, 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon', is…!]

[Constellation, 'Goryeo's First Sword', is…!]

Indirect messages flooded in among the blinking stars.

I heard Uriel and Black Flame Dragon's true voices, as well as my
companions calling out to me.

The sensation of chaos completely filling up my view caused dizziness to
nearly overtake me. I blocked my ringing, deafened ears while slowly
blinking my eyes.
[Main scenario has been updated!]


  <Main Scenario #99 – Enemy of the Story>

  Type: Main

  Difficulty: Indeterminable?■

  ■?■?■?!■?■?■■■■■■…


The scenario message was being restructured in real-time.

Although its content couldn't be seen, everyone instinctively knew.

They knew that, if this scenario ended in failure, the <Star Stream> would
be destroyed.

A short while later, the 'clear condition' everyone's been waiting for finally
showed up. For some reason, I couldn't help but recall a certain sentence
from the 'Ways of Survival' when I read the condition slowly rising up
before my eyes.

⸢There are three ways of surviving a destroyed world.⸥

Companions were shouting something while looking at me.

The author of the Ways of Survival did say this – there were three ways of
surviving this horrible world. Three ways.

I began thinking.

⸢Three ways didn't mean that only three people would survive in the end.⸥

I looked back at my companions and grinned brightly.
  Clear condition: You must kill the 'Enemy of the Story', Outer God
  King Kim Dokja.


Finally, this world's epilogue had begun.
     Chapter 487: Ep. 93 - Omniscient Author's Viewpoint, I


"I'm a writer."

Not too long after her novel got published, Han Sooyoung began
introducing herself like that.

It was the same story during the blind dates she begrudgingly attended after
her friend pleaded her to go.

"Ah! You're a writer!"

Her date must've heard about it before showing up here, so what was up
with this fuss? The man quickly rolled his eyes around a little before asking
her with a smile.

"Did you start your career through something like the annual literary
contest in spring?"

"No."

"Pardon? In that case…?"
"I write webnovels."

"Webnovels?"

The problem always came after this bit.

She spotted the man's eyes sneakily scanning her worn, cheap-looking
Tshirt.

"Aha, so, like… It's that, isn't it? Internet novels? Those with a lot of emojis
in them…?"

"Ah, yes~. Exactly like that."

"You know, there are lots of strange jobs to be found these days.
Youtubers, internet authors…"

The man grinned and sipped the Americano resting right before himself.
The watch attached to his wrist came from a pretty high-end brand.

…Hadn't she experienced a similar situation to this one plenty of times
before?

"It's like everyone is trying to make easy money nowadays. Don't you think
so?" said the man.

"Is there anyone who'd want to make money the hard way deliberately?"

"I make about ₩100,000,000 a year, but it's just not easy. So, like,
whenever I see those types of people, I can only sigh, you know? Trying to
pilfer other people's money the easy way…"

He must've already forgotten that this was a blind date judging from the
tone of his voice. With just a hint of anger in his eyes, his gaze shifted over
to the car keys resting on the table. Looked like they belonged to a foreign
brand, perhaps a bit too expensive considering his age.
While letting the man's words go straight out of one ear, Han Sooyoung
switched on her smartphone. Alerts for new comments were clogging her
inbox.

– Dear author-nim, isn't this too sweet-potato-like?

– Hmm… The next chapter will start with a cider moment, right? If not,
I'llbe exiting right about now.

"People who never studied hard once when they were young, just stumbled
into some random luck…" said the man.

Suddenly, it felt as if she could figure out why people read webnovels.

And she could also figure out why her friend introduced this sort of jerk-off
to her, too. Apparently, she'd find out once she got here, and now, she could
clearly see what that friend of hers was thinking about when setting her up
with this 'meeting'.

Now normally, she'd let this slide because it was just too bothersome, but…

"So, like… Were you listening?"

"Ah, yes, of course. Your annual salary was…?"

Only then did the man's eyes sparkle. His shoulders perked up as if he just
knew she'd ask him about that subject again.

"It's ₩100,000,000 after tax."

"Hmm. It's similar to mine."

"Pardon?" The man smirked. "You're a writer, but your annual salary is
₩100,000,000?"

Han Sooyoung shrugged her shoulders and pulled out her own car keys. It
was the newest model from Porsche. More specifically, it was exactly three
times more expensive than the man's own ride. Although, since she couldn't
be bothered to, she rarely drove around in it.

The man's eyes shook in sync with the shaking keys. And an awkward
smile floated up on his face next.

"Haha, but, uh… a writer's income is inconsistent so it can't really be called
'annual salary', am I right? I mean, your wage can't be fixed, right?"

The man's lips ceaselessly bobbed up and down to yap on about the cliched
stuff. It was just about adequate enough to be used as some line muttered
out by a throwaway villain during the next chapter or some such. In that
case, the protagonist would reply like this.

"But, I never said it's the annual salary?"

"Pardon? Ah, in that case, is it what you amassed so far?"

"No, I made ₩100,000,000 for the first half of this month, and hmm…
since there are two more weeks left in this month…"

"…Excuse me?"

Only then the man seemed to have realized something, because his
expression had changed quite drastically.

In the end, this whole thing had unfolded in the way her friend wanted to. If
this was a novel, it'd have been a cider moment, but in reality, she didn't
feel all that good about it.

The man was now hurriedly sending messages to someone. He was
probably asking her friend that set this blind date up all sorts of questions.

"Excuse me, can you tell me the name of the novel you wrote…?"

Just as she began thinking that she didn't want this guy to know the title,
Han Sooyoung's smartphone issued an alarm tone.
– Hello there, author-nim. I'm just a reader who enjoys reading webnovels.
Icoincidentally ran across your novel and got to read it…

She wondered what sort of a long-winded message this was. She then
tapped on the message without thinking too much about it. The tone of it
was polite but old-fashioned, and on top of that, she felt just a tiny hint of
naivete, too.

– The novel you have written is far too similar to a novel that I
reallytreasure, the 'Three Ways of Surviving a Destroyed World'.

…What the hell was up with this bastard??

⸢And that was Han Sooyoung's first encounter with Kim Dokja.⸥

Kim Dokja.

⸢Han Sooyoung watched the spectacle unfold before her eyes and ruminated
on the memories of that time.⸥
She lost a portion of her memories while creating avatars and she couldn't
clearly remember what happened back then. What was certain, though, was
that she had indeed read the novel called the 'Ways of Survival'.

All because of a fool with a username Kim 'Dokja', no less.

– Author-nim! It was also a very enjoyable read today as well.

Someone on the level of Han Sooyoung could tell whether the novel would
do well or not after reading only a couple of chapters. However, in her eyes,
this 'Ways of Survival' would never make it even if the sky collapsed on
itself.

– This, it's a really interesting beginning.

From the beginning, it was definitely dogshit.
– Author-nim, does this mean Yoo Joonghyuk remembers all those
things?Then, back in the 72th regression turn…

It was far too obsessed with lengthy expositions, and…

– Keuh, how unfortunate! I hope Joonghyuk-ie will get his act together
inthe next regression. Today was dope, too.

As for its protagonist, it was just a pretty boy devoid of personality that
seemingly wasted all of his available skill points on his outer appearance.
Not only that…

– Author-nim! Congratulations on reaching the 2000th chapter! Since
you'vecome this far, how about another 1000 chapters… Its chapter count
was excessive, as well.
'…This is entertaining? Seriously? Is he a nutcase?"

She got royally irritated and began following after this fool's comments.
She even clicked on 'downvote' too. Like a bewitched person, Han
Sooyoung read only Kim Dokja's comments and not the novel itself.

– Will Jihye finally awaken next chapter?

– Author-nim! I've discovered a typo on page 7! With my lacking opinion,
Ithink the spelling here should be… Ah, I looked into it and it's actually my
mistake. My apologies. I've learned something new today.

– Please, just smack that fool Joonghyuk-ie in the back of his head…

This guy, he never once missed writing a comment on all those thousands
of chapters. And every single one contained understanding and love for the
world created by this author.

⸢Han Sooyoung was envious of that.⸥

She believed that there was simply no way anyone would be reading a
novel as bad as this, that it had to be the author himself busy blowing his
own trumpet. She thought that the author had created two separate IDs and
wrote the novel with one while with the other one, wrote all those
comments and uploaded recommendations, too.

– Isn't recommending one's own work prohibited?

⸢Just like how Yoo Joonghyuk was an imagined character to Kim Dokja,
Kim Dokja was exactly like that to Han Sooyoung.⸥

She thought that such a person wouldn't be real, but…

That very person within the texts was standing right before Han Sooyoung's
eyes.

"Dokja-ssi!!"

A loud ringing in the ear rang out, accompanied by explosions going off in
all directions.

Han Sooyoung could see Kim Dokja in the center of the battlefield swirling
like a thunderstorm, busy breaking past the intense outpourings from the
stars. Incarnations were screaming out while the stars were roaring loudly.
And in the meantime, Dokkaebis in the sky were laughing.

【■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■!!】

Kim Dokja was shouting out. However, Han Sooyoung couldn't tell
whether he was screaming, proclaiming, or even crying in sorrow. Now that
he had been transformed into an Outer God, even his voice had been
completely excluded from the scenarios. Didn't matter what he said, the
contents were deemed unimportant now.

Gyah-aaaaah!

However, there were more Outer Gods following him now. Vestiges cast
away by the innumerable world-lines were now gathering near Kim Dokja's
side. And then, there were Myth-grade Constellations waiting for him
above the skies of the scenario.
[So, it has finally begun.]

The king of <Olympus> and the ruler of the 12 gods, the 'Lightning
Throne', Zeus was there.

[This world-line's 'Final Scenario' has begun!]

[Every existence has acquired the scenario entry qualification for the Final
Scenario!]

[Please kill the 'Enemy of the Story', Kim Dokja.]

The scenario messages popped up soon afterwards. Everyone present
understood the current situation. Zeus was the first to open his mouth.

[Sweep them away.]

Along with heaven-collapsing noises, arcs of lightning belonging to Zeus
rained down. With a 'pow!' noise of something exploding, blood splat onto
Han Sooyoung's cheek. The Nameless Ones were dying as black blood
spurted out from them.

[Sparemesparemesparemesparemespareme…]

Even the frightening 'Outer Gods' came across as mere water balloons in
front of the combined Status emitted by the Myth-grade Constellations. The
'Outer Gods' vomited out discarded Stories as they exploded en masse.

Blindingly brilliant shower of lightning rained down. And in the center of
the devastated landscape, Kim Dokja was enduring against Zeus's electrical
attacks.

Why did he make that kind of a choice?

[Tear his wings off! Surround him from all sides!]

Along with the roars from the Constellations, a massive army rushed in.
Incarnations and Constellations that had broken past the hellish scenarios to
get this far, were flooding in, all of them united as one under the single goal
of eliminating 'Kim Dokja'.

The one to come to his aid was the Great Sage, now one soul and body with
him.

[Constellation, 'Most Ancient Liberator', is unveiling his Status!]

Another electrical arc haughtily flowed in the air. The Great Sage's own
lightning pushed away Zeus', and tore through the sky as if it was paper.

For a moment there, the Constellations' spirit seemed to wane, but a voice
of encouragement resounded out next.

[It's the Great Sage, Heaven's Equal!]

[Do not back away! Kill him, and the scenario will end!]

[This is the Final Scenario of this world-line!]

This expectation that they would finally be freed from everything. Among
them were faces of Constellations and Incarnations she had seen in passing
before.

"No need to feel guilty here! He chose this for himself!"

<Olympus>, <Vedas>, <Papyrus>, <Guardian Tree>, <Twelve Earthly
Branches>, <Emperor>…

Constellations and Incarnations from those Nebulas she had heard of at
least once before were all here now. Every one of them knew who Kim
Dokja was.

⸢Every single one of them raised their swords in order to kill Kim Dokja.⸥

Through the torn black coat, the white coat underneath could be seen. Kim
Dokja taking on a role that didn't suit him was there.
The tattered Kim Dokja with a demon king's horn, and his black and white
wings spread open wide.

Kim Dokja standing in front of the Outer Gods and swinging his sword
towards the enemies.

She thought that her vision suddenly grew blurry, then Kim Dokja's figure
began 'erasing'.

The strange light in the eye unique to the cephalopod, and the exterior
giving off the dark, damp impression; where Kim Dokja used to stand was
now dominated by a giant Outer God King that seemed to be a mixture of
all the traits found in every monster of this world.

⸢The Enemy of the Story.⸥

As a writer herself, Han Sooyoung could instinctively tell. If this world was
a novel, then Kim Dokja was the 'final boss'. And this story would only end
with the death of that 'Kim Dokja'.

"Han Sooyoung!"

Someone pulled her back. Almost right away, a rapid arc of electricity flew
past in front of her nose.

"Step back! Hurry!"

It was Yoo Sangah. Only she seemed to have maintained her wits within
this scene of pure anarchy and confusion. But, how could she? "Everyone,
you must regain yourselves! Dokja-ssi is, right now…!" Kim Dokja would
die at this rate.

"We made a promise with Dokja-ssi! Have you all forgotten it?!"

Kim Dokja was a liar.
"Dokja-ssi really wouldn't do the same thing again…!"

Always believing in the goodness of a person – that was Yoo Sangah. And
because she was like that, because she could believe in the others, she
managed to be not shaken up by this situation. And that was precisely why
she always clashed with Han Sooyoung until now.

Even with Yoo Sangah's shouts, the companions still carried empty
expressions. With dazed eyes, they were each submerged in their own
thoughts. The same question was grabbing hold of them.

⸢Why did Kim Dokja make that kind of choice?⸥

But, they made a promise; he swore that he'd not sacrifice himself in this
manner ever again.

⸢Just why?⸥

"This story is not over yet."

Yoo Sangah was wrong, though. The direction of this story had been
chosen already. Kim Dokja had become the 'Enemy of the Story', and this
stinking scenario would end only when he was dead. The author responsible
for writing this tragedy had chosen it that way.

…The author?

【■■■■■■■■■!!】

Kim Dokja's voice sorrowfully reverberated out. That voice returned to her
as memories from a certain moment in the past.

– Han Sooyoung, you're a writer, right?

Her brain kicked into gear.

– What are you going to piss me off with this time?
– I wanted to ask you about something.

– What is it?

– Are writers truly omniscient within the stories they write?

– What's up with this totally out of the blue utterance?

– No, well, it's just that I'm kinda curious. While you were writing, were
youin control of everything? Like, this person would act like this, and that
person would behave in this way…

– That, obviously…

Han Sooyoung oh-so-confidently made her declaration.

– Can't be controlled.

– Why not? Aren't you the author?

– You think an author is a real god or something?

– Doesn't the author create everything within a story?
Situations,characters…

Han Sooyoung muttered, you don't know anything, and carried on.

– All the characters would start acting on their own the moment they
arecreated. Authors simply provide them with stages, that's all. It's all up to
the characters themselves on how they would respond to the situation and
make their moves.

– Not as a figure of speech, but for real?

– Yeah, really.

– You know, that's a really lazy way to write, don't you agree?

– Wanna die?!
Kim Dokja got bent in half when she punched him in the guts.

What was he thinking about back then?

– Interesting. Even an author isn't the god of the stories… In that case,
justwho determines the 'scenarios', then?

From the tip of her toes, this incredible chill crept up all over her body.
Maybe, just maybe, Kim Dokja over there right now was the answer to that
exact question.

Tsu-chuchuchut!

Perhaps, he was thinking about that one method to change the conclusion of
this stubborn world of scenarios.

[Great Dokkaebis are panicking from the deluge of the Probability!] [<Star

Stream> is paying attention at the course of the shaking Probability!]

'Scenario' wasn't perfect.

['Final Scenario' is going through a rapid change!]

It was definitely the author who created the story. However, it was the
characters that lived within that very story. And the one that determined
their fate was…

[Korean Peninsula's Constellations are cheering on the 'Demon King of
Salvation!]

[<Eden>'s Constellations are cheering on the 'Demon King of Salvation!]

[<Underworld>'s Constellations are cheering on the 'Demon King of
Salvation!]

[Constellations of planets with unknown names are cheering on the 'Demon
King of Salvation'!]
[Countless Constellations are donating Coins!]

[The absolute majority of the Constellations are watching the 'Demon
King of Salvation's' last battle!] …The ones watching that story.

Tsu-chuchuchuchut!

[Many Constellations don't wish for the 'Demon King of Salvation's' death!]

The only beings that could change the 'scenarios'.


Kim Dokja hadn't become the 'Enemy of the Story' to die. And he certainly
didn't choose sacrifice in order to betray his companions, either.

⸢The 'Ways of Survival' was Yoo Joonghyuk's story. In that case, whose
story was this world?⸥
Han Sooyoung watched the world's Probability shake unsteadily and
bitterly muttered to herself. "…That's right. No reader would want to see
the protagonist get killed."

Kim Dokja's and <Kim Dokja's Company>'s influence had grown
incredibly in this world. The proof of that was him becoming the subject of
the Final Scenario.

Constellations, whether they liked it or not, all watched Kim Dokja's Story,
and they either sympathised with it or were jealous of him. Every star in
this world was watching his story regardless of whether he wanted it or not.
And most likely, Kim Dokja himself was aware of that.

Perhaps, he could've been thinking about it for a long time.

⸢This was the last gamble Kim Dokja made after becoming the 'Character'.⸥
She sensed Kim Dokja glancing in her direction from afar. As if to say, she
should be able to understand since it was her. As if to say, she should be
able to start a brand new story that no one knew from this moment on.

⸢He was sacrificing himself not to sacrifice himself.⸥

It could very much be an impossible task. The conclusion could be forever
out of their reach. However, this was the only 'no one will be sacrificed'
method Kim Dokja could come up with.

So, the things Han Sooyoung had to do now was pretty clear.

'That guy alone can't do it'.

Han Sooyoung looked behind her. She needed to let her companions know
what exactly Kim Dokja wanted to achieve here.

Unfortunately, there was something that Han Sooyoung, absorbed in her
own attempt at understanding, failed to realize.

[Story, 'Predictive Plagiarism', is predicting the character's mentality.]

And that was the fact that not everyone here was an author. Meaning, not
everyone could see this situation in an objective manner like her.

Even before Han Sooyoung could open her mouth, someone among the
companions dashed forward first.

The clear-cut animosity was permeating within the unsheathed blade. Han
Sooyoung realized the direction this sword light was aimed at and cried out
in pure shock. "Wait!! Hold on!! That guy, he's trying to-!!"

She knew whose sword it was, and that's why she couldn't believe it.

⸢Right in this moment, this one person grew to deeply resent Kim Dokja.⸥

The strongest sword of Kim Dokja that had been protecting him for a very
long time. And that sword was making a move to end this scenario.
    Chapter 488: Ep. 93 - Omniscient Author's Viewpoint, II


[Your ■■ is ■■.]

When Jung Heewon first heard that message, she felt a bit weirded out. She
recalled what Kim Dokja told her some time ago. He said that each
individual had a specific ending reserved for them. So, she believed that she
too would have something like that as well.

However… it was ■■?

Jung Heewon knew someone that suited such description far better than her.

The person she fought alongside the closest than anyone.

The person she wouldn't hesitate to become a sword for.

The person who treated his companions preciously. The person who always
sacrificed himself first.

⸢That's why, a person she couldn't help but resent.⸥
Jung Heewon broke past the waves of 'Nameless Ones' and ran. Venomous
liquid exploded nearby and splashed onto her thigh, boiling her flesh dark.
She urgently pulled out the internal healing salve Lee Seolhwa gave her
earlier and applied it on the wound, then started running again. She shook
off the Constellations trying to interfere with their outpouring of attacks,
and leapt up by stepping on the Nameless Ones surrounding Kim Dokja as
if to protect him.

She could see 'something' far away. Something that used to be 'Kim Dokja'.

【■■■■■■!!】

And now, the being that had become the ⸢Enemy of the Story⸥.

"Heewon-ssi!"

Lee Hyunsung managed to get to her and grabbed her shoulders.

"Hold on-!"

Even before he could continue with his words, a message popped up first,
instead.

[The Final Scenario's streaming to all locations will begin!]

Every channel within <Star Stream> was now opening up.

Tsu-chut, chuchuchut…!

The scenario message flickered about unstably.

[Everyone, don't panic and just focus on the scenario. This scenario will be
the final one for you. Once you hunt down the Outer God King, your long
journey will come to an end as well.]

[This story shall be recorded on the 'Final Wall', and the journeys of the
stars will become the 'epic tale' that shall be handed down for all eternity!]
Great Dokkaebis greedily shouted out. Their eyes were burning with naked
desire to record the Story they had guided till here on the Final Wall.

[Giant Story, 'Brilliance of the Ancient Dawn', dreams of the final story!]

[Giant Story, 'Master of Asgard', dreams of the final story!]

Giant Stories were writhing viciously now. To remain as the 'One Single
Story', these Giant Stories were urging on the Constellations and
Incarnations.

[Constellation, 'Spear that Draws the Borders of the Oceans', is pulling out
his weapon!]

[Constellation, 'Master of Abydos', is incarnating into the scenario!]

[Constellation, 'River Nile's Monster Bird', is roaring out viciously!]

However, not everyone was being led around by that urging.

Despite the orders from the first-seat god Zeus, several gods from
<Olympus>, including Dionysus, were hesitating to attack. It was the same
story for the Incarnations, as well.

"…Do we really need to kill that person?"

The one to say that was the Japanese Incarnation, 'Asuka Ren'.

"The 'Kim Dokja' I met was not a villain."

"She's right! Kim Dogeza is not a bad person!"

They were people who received help from Kim Dokja's companions during
the fight against other Japanese that chose to become the calamities of the
[Peace Land].

Besides them, several Incarnations affiliated with <Emperor> and
<Olympus> agreed with them.
[Quite a few Constellations agree with the opinions of the Incarnations!]

[<Star Stream>'s Probability is falling into unrest!]

Once they detected the Probability moving towards a suspicious direction,
the Great Dokkaebis quickly stepped forward to rectify that.

[Do not forget, everyone. He's the 'Enemy of the Scenario'.]

[You may not be aware of this, but from the beginning, 'Kim Dokja' had
been clearing the scenarios with the purpose of ruining this world-line.]

Quite unlike themselves, these usually-arrogant Great Dokkaebis began
speaking in a polite tone of voice. And as the footages of Stories began
playing in the vast skies above, the Dokkaebis' speciality began as well.

[He betrayed this world-line and made deals with the 'Outer Gods'.]

Inside the screen, Kim Dokja was making a deal with the 'Secretive Plotter'.
Since there was no voice being transmitted, his expression came across as
especially sinister.

That wasn't all. Everything he had done so far was now being laid bare to
the rest of the world. From when he released the grasshoppers in the
subway and didn't try to save anyone else, to when he didn't do anything
back in the Geumho station even though he could've saved many others…

This collection of only the worst moments of someone was trying to create
a brand new Kim Dokja in this world.

[If he achieves his goal, then only the pure destruction awaits this world.]

Soon, the screen changed to that from the ⸢Journey to the West⸥.

The Giant Story ⸢Liberator of the Forgotten Ones⸥.
It was the scene of him, surrounded by the Outer Gods, liberating the
'Nameless Ones' trapped inside the scenario. Unfortunately, perhaps due to
the Dokkaebis' interference, him inside the Story no longer looked saintly.

No, he truly looked like the leader of a cult freeing demons in order to
really destroy this world.

[He acquired the knowledge of the future through uncommon means, and
he used that for his own benefit.]

Kim Dokja holding onto his smartphone was now ordering his companions
around.

[Him becoming the 'Demon King of Salvation', then the 'Watcher of Light
and Darkness', they were all simply part of his plan.]

The storytellers worked together to drag Kim Dokja's position down from
'protagonist' to the villain. They were changing his Story into a sly and
cowardly one.

[<Star Stream>'s Probability is mobilising!]

This action definitely went against the nature of the storytellers themselves.
Even then, these Great Dokkaebis didn't hesitate one second. Because these
storytellers also desired their own ■■, as well.

[And now, he has become the 'Outer God' Monarch to destroy this world.]

Tsu-chuchuchuchut!

The public sentiment within <Star Stream> was rapidly changing.

Asuka Ren's complexion paled greatly. Anna Croft and her unreadable
expression walked past the Japanese woman's side and muttered to the
latter.

"It's too late now."
'Zarathustras' began advancing forward, and those Constellations greatly
hesitating also joined in the battle.

Gah-aaaaaaah!

The 'Nameless Ones' screaming in pain collided against the front of the
Constellations.

⸢All the creatures related to Kim Dokja were pointing their blades at each
other.⸥
And Jung Heewon found herself in the middle of this battlefield, watching
Kim Dokja's fight.

Even if she didn't help him out, there were plenty of 'Outer Gods' fighting
alongside him next to him. They were huge cephalopod-type monsters,
Outer Gods with baby-like bodies yet with heads of giant flowers, etc.

Even if Jung Heewon borrowed Uriel's powers and went all out, she'd not
be able to win. Standing among them, Kim Dokja truly looked like the great
calamity trying to end this world-line.

⸢Jung Heewon thought that she understood Kim Dokja.⸥

She didn't know the conclusion Kim Dokja truly wanted. However, she
believed that she knew without being told what it was. She thought that the
end of the world she wanted was the same as what he wanted.

⸢However, could this be the end he truly wished for?⸥

Maybe, there was no such thing as companions to him?

[Constellation, 'Demon-like Judge of Fire', is…!]

She knew. Jung Heewon knew better than anyone what Uriel was trying to
say. She also knew that Kim Dokja treasured his companions. Perhaps too
much, and that's why he was capable of doing something like this.
Kim Dokja, he was planning to sacrifice himself and allow his companions
to see the end of this world.

⸢No matter how far she reaches out, she just couldn't touch him.⸥

It was as if a huge wall was standing before her eyes. And this wall was
preventing her from getting nearer to him.

"Just how…"

Perhaps, Jung Heewon was too exhausted now to long for the desired
conclusion.

⸢Kim Dokja is a type of person who didn't listen to anyone.⸥

The grip of the sword in her hand felt cold. This sword that Kim Dokja had
personally crafted for her and placed in her grasp. This sword that remained
as the symbol of her beliefs from the [Paradise] all the way to here.

['Judge's Sword' is crying out!]

The sword that should react only in the vicinity of 'evil' was now crying out.

The Great Dokkaebis declared as if to make a mockery out of her.

[This is the hidden truth regarding the Enemy of the Story, 'Kim

Dokja'.] She wanted to confirm it.

If you are truly the 'Kim Dokja' that I know.

And, if what you want isn't the same as what I want, then…

⸢…Then, whether it'd be alright to end him with her own hands.⸥

"Heewon-ssi."

As if he understood her heart, Lee Hyunsung remained next to her side.
"I shall go with you."

He literally became a shield of forged steel and ran forward while creating a
path. He pierced through the waves of the stars and storms of the Nameless
Ones. Just as Jung Heewon had something to confirm, so did Lee
Hyunsung.

Something that needed to be confirmed over and over again.

Kwa-kwakwakwakwa!

As if riding on the wave itself, the two of them flew up and landed near
Kim Dokja's rear in an instant. Such a thing was only possible because the
other Outer Gods were all concentrated on his front.

"Heewon-ssi!"

Was it because of the Ring of Chaos drawn on the back of her hand? The
'Nameless Ones' ignored her even after discovering her presence and simply
rushed forward.

Kim Dokja standing tall like a huge skyscraper was now before her. Thick,
pitch-black liquid dripped from that massive body.

Without even realizing it, Jung Heewon reached out and touched that
exterior.

It was unfamiliar.

In the past, she got to hold the sleeping Kim Dokja's hand tightly. It was
after he returned from another world, passed out for the whole day in a
room the companions had prepared for him. What did his hand feel like
back then?

Perhaps he sensed her presence, because the large head of the Outer God
King shifted and looked behind himself.

Ku-gugugugu…
White breath leaked out from that huge head.

"Kim Dok…"

Even though she knew she shouldn't, Jung Heewon still ended up taking
several steps back. His huge jaw was opening towards her.

[Scenario's Probability is activating!]

[All of your Stories are warning you!]

The Outer God King's large black eye reflected her current expression.

She didn't want to make that kind of a face. She didn't want to look at Kim
Dokja with that sort of eyes. Unfortunately, her hands were already moving,
independent of her will.

"Aaaaaaaah!!"

The [Judge's Sword] cut down the tentacle reaching out to her. As if they
were now irreconcilable enemies, her sword moved uncontrollably.

The tentacle burst open noisily and Story leaked out from it.

⸢"Dokja-ssi, we're happier now compared to back then, right?"

"…If you mean now is better than before, then yes, you're right."⸥

It was a Story even she knew well.

⸢"I think so, too."⸥

She listened to that story while staggering unsteadily no her feet. The story
that only Kim Dokja and Jung Heewon remembered managed to grab hold
of her mind.

After getting rid of her blurred vision, she got to see the surrounding view.
She thought that she managed to cut down quite a number of tentacles so
far, yet there didn't seem like any noticeable wound on his body. And in the
meantime, Kim Dokja's size had ballooned up even more, to an extent that
it became hard to believe this used to be a single person.

He now resembled a massive wall standing tall all by himself.

【■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■…】

A wall that would never be filled up no matter what was written on it. And
as she stood in front of this wall, Jung Heewon despaired.

Who cared about the [Final Wall]? She couldn't even manage to overcome
a wall of just one person.

She then spotted Han Sooyoung shouting at her in the distance while trying
to get here. If it was her, could she be able to cross this wall?

– It must be nice, being a writer and all.

During the <Kim Dokja's Company>'s vacation, Jung Heewon lying on the
middle of a mountainside said that to Han Sooyoung.

– What do you mean, nice?

– No, well, a person who can write well also knows how to speak
eloquently too, right? I wish I could be like that, too.

– What, so you can write a love letter to Lee Hyunsung?

– No, not that.

Jung Heewon wordlessly stared in Kim Dokja's direction. Just from that
stare alone, Han Sooyoung seemed to have figured out what her
conversation partner wanted to say.

Kim Dokja, struggling so hard in front of his own companions. The fool
that was idiotically trying to carry out a joke-like scenario of [Workers'
day-off] – Han Sooyoung saw him and replied like this.
– Anyone can write a story.

Jung Heewon raised her head and looked at this creature that used to be
Kim Dokja.

She was not a writer like Han Sooyoung. On the other hand, she was also
not an avid reader like Kim Dokja. So, she could neither write like Han
Sooyoung nor read like Kim Dokja.

However, that still didn't mean she couldn't write or read anything.

 –         Who cares if you can't write well? Just like you said, you aren't a
 novelist,right?

For sure, this world could be inside of the novel, the 'Ways of Survival'. It
could very well be a story written by an author living somewhere, and read
by someone else.

However, this 'novel' was her life.

⸢And that was why she too had the right to write this world's next sentence.⸥

Jung Heewon slowly lowered her sword and asked. "…Dokja-ssi. Do you
remember that time?"

She didn't know if he was listening or not. Despite that, she still placed her
hand on the very small knick she created on this massive, expansive wall.
The scenes she experienced together with Kim Dokja leaked out from that
knick. There they were, climbing up the heaven's stairs while kitted out in
formal attire.

"I was really happy back then. When we went to the department store
together to buy new clothes and visited <Eden> like a bunch of celebs."

She liked this world. Everything was being destroyed and all she could see
was extensive devastation, yet because this was such a world, she got to
find her true worth.
"…You said this, didn't you? That this world is preferable. We're people
like that, aren't we?"

Kim Dokja's answer didn't arrive.

Jung Heewon widened the wound on the tentacle. As if to say, don't forget
this wound, please remember her just as he'd remember this wound.

"That's why, you are someone who can only do this, right?"

Jung Heewon understood Kim Dokja.


⸢If she doesn't kill Kim Dokja, this world will perish.⸥

The eye of the massive Outer God King was now looking at her. And it
seemed like he was expressing his agreement from the way his head was
moving. Jung Heewon looked straight into that eye and spoke.

"How can I even kill you…"

Her vision blurred again, her body shivering.

Kim Dokja's salvation was cruel. Like rescuing a drowning person with a
blade, those saved by him were inflicted an unhealable wound.

"Don't make me laugh… This is no salvation…"

Jung Heewon tottered as if she was about to lean against the wall.

A world where no one tried to save another. In this world where only
victims existed, no, a world where the wounds of the victims were in full
display, here was the lone hand full of scars extending out to her.

⸢Kim Dokja was already extending his hand out from there.⸥

It wasn't just the person reaching out, but the one grasping that hand also
required courage to do so.
Courage to hold that scarred hand, courage not to give up.

Even if she knew this wouldn't heal her, even if she knew that holding that
hand would only inflict her with a greater wound – courage to hold that
hand in order to live for one more time.

⸢Some salvations aren't completed by the one giving them out, but by those
receiving them.⸥
Jung Heewon's palm left a deep imprint on the tightly-held Outer God's
skin. She stared at that imprint for a very long time, then slowly raised her
head, her hand grasping the sword tightly.

And when she did, a certain message resounded out within her ears.

[Completion of the Incarnation 'Jung Heewon's' ■■ is imminent!]

Just like holding the hand tightly, she strengthened her grip on the sword.

[Your ■■ is 'Salvation'.]
    Chapter 489: Ep. 93 - Omniscient Author's Viewpoint, III


The sight of Jung Heewon running forward could be seen.

She slid among the 'Nameless Ones' like the moonlight sliding off the
blade.

The answer she was searching for was there.

[Incarnation Jung Heewon's ■■ is 'Salvation'.]

Everyone had their own ■■. Finally, the moment of choosing their own
conclusions had arrived for the <Kim Dokja's Company>'s companions.

"Jung Heewon!"

Her [Judge's Sword] drew a spectacular trajectory. The companions
watched that sword trajectory and hurriedly chased after her.

Lee Gilyoung was about to leap into the air along with Yoo Sangah, but had
to stop because of a girl was about to be left behind.
"Shin Yoosung…"

Shin Yoosung standing there all alone, was crying. Standing in the exact
same location as before, her feet not going anywhere, and her gaze fixed
on one spot – it was quite clear what she was looking at right now. [Story,
'Saviour of a Star', is continuing on with its storytelling.] It was the Story
that only Shin Yoosung possessed.

A Constellation and an Incarnation, connected through that radiating
starlight. The light emitted by the Story was so beautiful and radiant that
Lee Gilyoung unknowingly reached out towards Shin Yoosung.

⸢Lee Gilyoung was envious of Shin Yoosung.⸥

Just what was it like for one person to understand another?

He was too young to truly understand the meaning of the word 'understand'
itself. Sometimes he'd feel this sense of deprivation because of that, but on
the other hand, he actually liked the fact that his age could be used as an
excuse.

⸢It's possible for you to not get it yet. But, that's okay.⸥

⸢You don't need to do this, but I'm sorry that we have to rely on you,
Gilyoung-ah…⸥

⸢Hey, kid, stop showing off and get back.⸥

He was relieved. He even thought that it was a fortunate thing.

It was fortunate that he got to meet such people in a world like this one.
People that he could rely on and act like a child, yet still could remind him
with the fact that he was indeed a child.

⸢However, Shin Yoosung was here, too⸥
There was another child with them who didn't act like one. It was a girl who
always looked up at a star. Lee Gilyoung also looked up at the same star –
the star he liked. He knew very well the sorrowful light that star emitted,
and how its colour would change when it tried to hide its true intentions or
tried to lie.

⸢However, he didn't know as well as Shin Yoosung did.⸥

"How long are you going to stand around dazed like that? Let's go."

Shin Yoosung absentmindedly turned her head towards him. While meeting
her gaze, Lee Gilyoung snatched up her hand. Then, the two kids began
running. Sweat filled the tightly-held small hand.

'I don't understand Dokja-hyung as much as Shin Yoosung'.

She was the Incarnation of the Constellation, 'Demon King of Salvation'.
No one could pry them apart or get in between them.

"You think you're the only one worried about hyung? You think you're the
only one feeling sad?"

Lee Gilyoung shouted without even looking back and continued to drag
Shin Yoosung. He hated the idea of looking younger than her. But for at
least today, he wanted to behave like a child.

"I don't like the Han River. I like oceans better. And I don't like pizza but
prefer fried chicken."

He too had been saved by that star, that's why.

"Going to the PC Bang! Playing phone games! And…!"

The star he liked so much could be seen in the distance. However, it didn't
look like a star now.

"And, also…"
The star, the subject of jealousy and envy from the Constellations that ruled
the heavens, was now…

【■■■■■■■■■■■…】

…Now looked like a scary great demon from the webtoons the boy enjoyed
reading so much.

The moment that huge head with tentacles wiggling about turned in his
direction, Lee Gilyoung's running legs froze still.

The king of another world, now grown to a height even taller than a
skyscraper.

The 'Enemy of the Story'.

The villain who would destroy this world.

⸢Did that demon look like Kim Dokja to Shin Yoosung?⸥

"I…"

Lee Gilyoung muttered while trying to fight against his body's trembling.
Against the fear that that thing might not be Kim Dokja he used to know.

[Do not get fooled!]

[That creature will destroy this world!]

[He's a being that only cares about himself. To him, your survival holds no
meaning at all.]

Actually, the Kim Dokja he had been looking at was wrong.

⸢"Hyung, are you a god?"

"…Wha?"
"Or, are you the 'protagonist'?"⸥

The fear that the words spoken by the Dokkaebis turned out to be correct.
⸢"I'm not a god nor am I a protagonist. In fact, I've been always envious of
the real protagonist."⸥
Lee Gilyoung finally managed to stop the trembling and worked up his
courage to look up. The vast Outer God's eye was now looking straight at
the boy.

Kim Dokja's heart couldn't be seen; not a single thing about that Outer God
felt like Kim Dokja.

The only thing remaining was belief.

– Gilyoung-ah. There is more than one way to form relationships.

Some time ago, he had a chat with Yoo Sangah regarding his dilemma
related to Shin Yoosung. At the time, she answered like this after closing
shut the book she was reading.

– It's similar to how different people interpret the same sentence differently.
So…

Lee Gilyoung wasn't much of an avid reader so that comparison
didn't resonate with him. Still… – I think I understand.

He too had his own skill of conversing with the others.

– It kinda feels different when talking to a praying mantis and a cockroach.

The [Diverse Communication] was such a skill, that allowed him to
communicate with species different than his. However, the boy lacked a
skill to understand other human beings.

What kind of a person was Kim Dokja? He wasn't sure.
However, there was this one image that popped into his head first when
trying to think of the person called Kim Dokja – the sight of people with
their heads or bodies blown up.

⸢"I'm going to trouble you for a bit."⸥

And then, the face of Kim Dokja as he placed a grasshopper within the
boy's grasp.

[Story, 'Insect King', has begun its storytelling!]

Suddenly, the surrounding view shook and a Story began waking up within
the boy.

[Constellation, 'Ruler of the Deepest Pit', is grinning insidiously.]

A swarm of yellow locusts buzzing in from somewhere swirled like a
tornado and began enveloping the entire world.

⸢On that day, Lee Gilyoung thought to himself that it'd been nicer for the
whole subway train to be flipped on its head. Just like the grasshopper that
died in his hands.⸥

This incredible feast of Status caused the 'Outer Gods' to scream.

Constellations of <Star Stream> began pouring out their messages.

[Constellations leaning on the Absolute Evil spectrum are warning the
'Ruler of the Deepest Pit'!]

[Portion of Demon Kings are greatly astonished by the Incarnation's
power!]

The Story flowing vigorously ignored the gazes of the Constellations and
continued on with its storytelling. This story was something the boy hadn't
told any adults yet.
And it was a story that Shin Yoosung, also a possessor of the [Diverse
Communication], knew a little bit of.

⸢"You didn't even have enough money so why did you go and have a
kid…"⸥

This intense stink of the brown coal, the sight of his father and mother lying
on the ground like dead cockroaches – memories of him poking on the cold,
unmoving flesh. A funeral without portraits came to an end, and the
fatigued eyes of his relatives looking at him.

⸢"That girl Yeong-Mi, I knew she'd do something like this. She was told
that that bastard wasn't good for her, yet she…"⸥

⸢"So, who's going to take that boy in? What about the eldest brother's…"⸥

⸢"We can't. There are three kids in our place already."⸥

Lee Gilyoung didn't know the proper words to describe his life that had
been rejected from a very young age. He didn't have any ability to explain
or express how big of a wound that was. And that wound continued to
fester, unable to be healed or discovered.

⸢"Look for an organisation. There are places that look after kids like him."⸥

Lee Gilyoung got dragged by his aunt's hand and climbed on the
Seoulbound train. And he felt dizzy while looking at the map of ant tunnel-
like Seoul's subway network.

There were so many tunnels here, and he didn't know where he was heading
off to.

The grasshoppers inside the insect catcher cried like a lost child.
⸢"This boy, really now! Throw them away! Hurry! They don't live all that
long, anyway. So disgusting!"⸥
What would've happened to him if the scenarios didn't start on that day?

"Dokja hyung!"

What if he didn't get to meet these people?

"Dokja hyung! I'm over here!"

Lee Gilyoung cried out loudly enough to tear out his vocal cords.

It was fine if his voice couldn't reach its target. It was fine if he wasn't Kim
Dokja's Incarnation.

⸢"Gilyoung-ah. If you can't say it, then it's okay to not say anything.
However, you must remember this one thing, okay?"⸥
The boy wanted to say this to him.

⸢"When you wish to say something, this hyung will be by your side to
listen."⸥
…That, Dokja hyung wasn't a villain.

…That, he was a just regular person who happened to rescue the boy from
other regular people.

[Kill him! We only have to push a little bit harder!]

[They are failures from a different world-line! Do not mind it and push
harder! Killing them now will end this!]

The ranks of the 'Outer Gods' fighting out in the front were crumbling now.
One of the sides seemed to break down completely, then a group of
Incarnations led by the Myth-grade Constellations began advancing towards
Kim Dokja. He needed to stop them somehow.
Tsu-chuchuchut!

[Applicable action is prohibited by the ⸢Bureau⸥'s Probability.]

[The target you wish to protect is the ⸢Enemy of the Story⸥.]

He needed to convince them that Dokja hyung wasn't a person like that.
But, how should he… Ku-gugugugu…

Even as his enemies rushed in, Kim Dokja simply stood there like a wall.
He seemed to be saying something every so often, yet those words couldn't
be understood. Lee Gilyoung wanted to understand them, though. He hated
leaning against the wall, all powerless and helpless. He wanted to stand on
Kim Dokja's side.

He didn't care if this sort of world was destroyed or not. If Kim Dokja was
the enemy of a story, then he'd also become this 'Enemy of the Story', too.

However, Kim Dokja was too difficult to understand for him.

He hated the fact that he was a little kid. If only he was an adult. If only
he was Han Sooyoung, Yoo Joonghyuk, or Jung Heewon… …If only he
was Shin Yoosung.

He felt the sensation of the tightly-held hand. Shin Yoosung was still there.

"…You idiot. Wake up."

The swarm of locusts flying around settled down.

Shin Yoosung spoke up. "I can't understand ahjussi, either."

[Exclusive skill, 'Superlative Diverse Communication', is activating!]

"I'm just doing my best trying to understand."
The skill of these two kids that allowed them to control the Chimera
Dragon activated simultaneously. And now, they were in the most optimum
state to understand each other.

Lee Gilyoung couldn't read Kim Dokja. However, Shin Yoosung seemed to
know how, at least just a little bit.

The Story these two read together began rocking the world. And it was as if
Kim Dokja's face could be seen ever so faintly now. It seemed like the
figure of Kim Dokja they knew was almost within reach.

[Story, 'Saviour of the Star', is having a chat with the Story, 'Insect King!]

"Hey, kids."

Han Sooyoung stood next to them as if to provide protection. And Lee
Hyunsung, Jung Heewon, and Yoo Sangah stood nearby to protect them in
turn.

⸢Adults looking at the world together with the kids were here.⸥

Lee Jihye's battleship cast a shadow from the air. Both Gong Pildu and Lee
Seolhwa could be seen near the cannons of the vessel. Lee Jihye then
unsheathed her sword as if to imply that she was ready to fire at any time
she wanted to.

That prompted the Great Dokkaebi Onsae to ask them.

[Are you trying to protect him? Even though you know what kind of
existence he is? He's no longer the 'Kim Dokja' that you know. The truth
has been exposed to the rest of the world…!]

"Don't make me laugh. That ain't the truth. You think truth is that simple?
What you've shown is simply edited footage. And that's how you've all
been creating scenarios so far, right?" Han Sooyoung spoke to the
approaching Constellations as if to issue a warning. "Don't care whether
he's become the 'Enemy of the Story' or whatever, he's still our companion.
So, don't you dare touch him. Got that?"

[Constellation, 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon', is roaring out!]

[Constellation, 'Demon-like Judge of Fire', is exposing her Status!]

[Constellation, 'Most Ancient Liberator', is charging up his lightning!]

"You touch him, and we'll kill you all."

The moment the Constellations protecting <Kim Dokja's Company> made
a move, the powerful momentum of the opposing Constellations froze still
for a moment there.

Tsu-chuchuchuchut!

[A portion of Constellations agree with Incarnation 'Han Sooyoung's'
words, and…!]

Great Dokkaebi Harong detected the tremor within the Probability and
promptly cut the messages off.

[How laughable. You want to protect him? You lot who can't even
understand what he's saying?]

[<Star Stream> is warning the Great Dokkaebis for their interference in the
scenario!]

Frustrated by how the scenario wasn't unfolding in the way they desired, a
Great Dokkaebi enduring the aftermath's storm asked them.

[Can you not see his current appearance?]

Incarnations that got near Kim Dokja shrunk back and began retreating
away. It was the same story whether they were Incarnations hostile towards
him or carrying a favourable impression of him.
The Outer God, now reaching high up into the heavens. The moment
everyone looked into his eye containing the abyss itself, they shuddered and
collapsed on their butts.

[None of you know what he feels, what he desires, and what he thinks
about. Because you are all measly humans. Because you are creatures that
can never understand another existence even if you devote your entire
lifetime to
it.]

Everyone from <Kim Dokja's Company> looked up at Kim Dokja. What
the Great Dokkaebi said was true. They couldn't understand him.

[The target you wish to protect is the ⸢Enemy of the Story⸥.]

As if to wake up the characters that had forgotten their roles, the Great
Dokkaebi shouted out loudly. [None of you have a choice in this matter!
Kill him. If you don't, this scenario will not end!]

['King of the Stories' is observing the direction of the Final Scenario.]

The oldest storyteller in this world was also watching the unfolding events.

Along with her companions, Han Sooyoung raised her head, and looked at
the place where the 'King of the Stories' was – the being that summarised
all the scenarios. She looked at the endlessly-stretching [Final Wall].

⸢That wall is where their story would be recorded.⸥

"The scenario won't end? Nice. Is that not what every reader wishes for?"

[Incarnation 'Han Sooyoung' has gotten much closer to her ■■.]

Han Sooyoung then looked up at Kim Dokja. When she glared
continuously at the giant head of the cephalopod, she thought that it began
to resemble Kim Dokja's face just a little bit.
"The story I'm writing definitely requires that idiot Kim Dokja's presence."

Han Sooyoung roughly unfurled the bandages like an author ripping up the
manuscript she didn't like. Her Story dyed in the [Black Flame] spread out
in the air like pitch-black ink.

As if to imply that she could write as long as she wanted to.

[<Star Stream> is surprised by the Incarnation 'Han Sooyoung's' decision!]

[Many Constellations are astonished by the Incarnation 'Han Sooyoung's'
■■, and…]

[The target you wish to protect is the ⸢Enemy of the Story⸥.]

[Applicable action is prohibited by the ⸢Bureau⸥'s Probab…]

Tsu-chuchuchuchu…!

[Constellation, 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon', is proud of his Incarnation.]

Han Sooyoung smirked. "Let's not end the scenario, forever."

[Incarnation Han Sooyoung's ■■ is 'Neverending Story'.]
    Chapter 490: Ep. 93 - Omniscient Author's Viewpoint, IV


Every Dokkaebi dreamed of becoming the 'Great Dokkaebi'. That was the
peak of one's tale that a <Star Stream>'s Dokkaebi could reach.

Yet, those that did reach the top continued to dream.

Bihyung stared at the [Final Wall] utterly filling up the view out from the
front of the Ark. Even though so many stories existed, most of the wall was
still empty.

[…Is there a reason to go this far??]

Bihyung's anger caused the Great Dokkaebis' communication line to go
silent. He then continued to observe the <Kim Dokja's Company>'s
companions from the skies of the Final Scenario. And at the figure of Kim
Dokja as the Outer God.

Starting from the subway that day, all the way up to the Final Scenario;
while Kim Dokja became the Demon King of Salvation, then became the
'Watcher of Light and Darkness', Bihyung also became a higher class
Dokkaebi, before eventually ending up as a Great Dokkaebi himself. ⸢The
biggest mistake a storyteller can make is excessively interfering in a
scenario.⸥
Dokkaebis' mission was to attract as much attention of the Constellations
and create stories that would be recorded on the 'Final Wall'.

That was why Dokkaebis should never be dragged around by the scenarios
themselves. They must never be seduced by the Stories blooming from
within the scenarios, and especially should not empathise with the
Incarnations' pain.

But, Bihyung made that very blunder.

While looking at their Story, several of the feelings he had forgotten in the
past woke back up again – that flutter of one's heart when one scenario
ended and the next one came around; that sense of fulfilment after seeing
the Constellations rejoice or wallow from the scenario he had cooked up.

Bihyung learned about 'scenario' from Kim Dokja.

[They are not carrying out the scenario incorrectly. From the beginning,
'scenario' flows in a reversible, malleable way. Meaning, it flows in the
direction that many stars wish to see. Other Constellations of <Star Stream>
are…]

[Looks like you care greatly about this Story since you helped to foster it,
but listen well. There is something called the flow of the bigger story.]

Bihyung was about to raise his voice only to hold himself back. He had to,
as every other Great Dokkaebi was now focusing on him. Although vexing,
he had no choice as the youngest in this group.

Great Dokkaebi 'Garang' finally broke the silence it had been maintaining
until now. [A young Great Dokkaebi such as yourself probably finds such
Conclusions quite fresh. However, I've witnessed Stories like that many
times before. Do you honestly think that, in its immense history, there had
been no one else who resented <Star Stream> and tried to destroy it?]
The Great Dokkaebi Garang, one of the oldest Dokkaebis in existence, and
also the closest aid to the 'Dokkaebi King', too.

[There have been countless destructions before.]

Bihyung simply couldn't unpack the remorse faintly discernible from that
tone of voice.

[Not all destruction is the same,] replied Bihyung.

A few Great Dokkaebis glared at him as a warning. However, he tried his
best not to shrink back and held Garang's gaze. The latter stared at the
former with mysterious, profound eyes and only after a lengthy amount of
time, opened its mouth. [Indeed, the ■■ they dream of is slightly different
from other Stories.]

Perhaps that statement got on its nerves, the Great Dokkaebi Onsae stopped
observing and tried to intervene. Garang raised its hand first and stopped its
colleague while continuing on with its words.

[But, that difference is the threat itself. Not every Story will become a
foundation for the next one.]

[What do you mean by that?]

[There are certain Stories that will completely break the scenario.] Gah-

aaaaaaah!!

The screams from the 'Nameless Ones'.

Once upon a time, they too were beings that participated in different
scenarios. They cried out in despair and attacked the Constellations. And in
their center was the Outer God King Kim Dokja leading these godly beings
from the other worlds.

⸢The Enemy of the Story.⸥
To Bihyung's knowledge, no other calamity was given that title. He hadn't
even heard of the plan to give that title in the first place.

Garang continued on while watching Kim Dokja's resistance.

[At the beginning of every scenario, the protagonists will always experience
the deviation from the normal world. They will fight against the enemies
appearing before them, experience dilemmas, and sacrifice something in
order to emerge victorious before returning to their original world to
receive their deserved rewards.]

Bihyung knew of that theory. The first thing the lower-ranked Dokkaebis
would hear about was that ancient rule of the scenario.

[Although outdated, that is still the focal point of the scenario. This cycle
has to be protected so that the next scenario can be created, and the next
worldline can open up. Conflicts will be mended, wounds will be healed;
the world must remain in one piece as if nothing had happened to it.]

The distant foot of a mountain range collapsed before exploding
spectacularly. The number of Constellations gathering was constantly
increasing.

Bihyung knew the truth. This very 'Final Scenario' had been planned from
the get-go.

⸢The end of the world will come, and then, it'll be defeated.⸥

That imaginary enemy called the 'Outer God King' only existed for that sole
purpose. Stars that once used to be at odds with each other would unite
against the advent of a powerful enemy and fight together; some may die
and some may survive, but they would still get to resolve all the old
conflicts. The world would regain its peace. The gossipers would sing about
this history and pass it down through the generations.

⸢And nothing will change. <Star Stream> will continue on.⸥
And that was the truth of the 'scenario' that the Dokkaebis pursued.

The scenario must cycle back and repeat itself.

[The absolute majority of Constellations are excited by the 'Final
Scenario'!]

To ensure that no one realized what the <Star Stream> actually was, and
why the scenario had to be repeated, brand new stories had to be supplied to
the Constellations. However, there were a few that resisted against this.

[Giant Story, 'Demon Realm's Spring', is continuing with its storytelling!]

[Giant Story, 'Torch that Swallowed the Myth', is rejecting the
predetermined development.]

Those that resisted against the scenarios predetermined for them, and they
wished to bring down the existence of the <Star Stream> itself.

[Incarnation 'Han Sooyoung's' ■■ is 'Neverending Story'!]

The ⸢Neverending Story⸥.

The contradicting ■■ that didn't acknowledge the end as an end, was
glowing brightly over yonder. That was the conclusion an author, not a
storyteller of the universe, had decided on.

They were existences that rejected the <Star Stream>'s cycle and chose to
fight on forever.

Kwa-aaaaaaah!

As the explosion roared on, the Great Dokkaebi Garang finally made its
declaration. [Let us close the lid on this world-line here.]

The Great Dokkaebis keeping silent, and those that were observing the
responses of their peers until then, all nodded their heads in unison.
Even before Bihyung could say something, Baram next to him spoke up
first. [Bihyung, I'm sorry, but things have come down to this. It seems that
you'll have to overlook it this time.]

The moment Bihyung saw Baram's expression, he realized the truth. Every
single Great Dokkaebi gathered here was the universe's best storytellers.
They were the rulers that lorded over the scenarios and manipulated the
stars while controlling this world-line.

Even then, for the first time ever, they had grown fearful of the 'story' they
had created.

[We will use up the remaining Probability in order to forcibly execute the
main scenario.]

'Forcibly executing' the scenario was the last trump card up their sleeve that
the Dokkaebis could resort to. It was kind of a 'deus ex machina' that could
forcefully restrict the flow of <Star Stream> at the cost of the truly
nonsensical amount of Probability.

Especially so when trying to use it during the Final Scenario – the amount
required simply defied one's imaginations.

Tsu-chuchuchuchu!

When the Bureau's Probability began moving, the skies over the whole of
<Star Stream> was blanketed by blinding explosion of sparks. There didn't
seem to be any spot left for darkness to hide within this world-line.

[They must end as 'evil'.]

As if to agree with the will of the Great Dokkaebis, Giant Stories began
supporting them.

[Giant Story, 'Temple of the Destroyed Myth', is complying with the
Bureau's will!]

[Giant Story, 'Advent of the New Dawn', is agreeing with the flow!]
[Giant Story, 'Eternal Olympus', respects the Bureau's will!]

Bihyung watched the final pages being written by the Great Dokkaebis
from a step away.

[Other Great Dokkaebis are strongly urging you to make your decision!]

He was yet to agree with this conclusion.

[Bihyung!]

Even though Baram called out to him, he didn't reply.

[<Star Stream> is resisting against the Great Dokkaebis' interference!]

The sparks in the skies soon reached the Great Dokkaebis. An incredible
storm of aftermaths was rushing in. Even if they were Great Dokkaebis,
trying to intervene in a scenario still required this much price to pay.

[I, 'Great Dokkaebi Garang', declare my intention to officially participate in
the scenario!]

Garam's declaration prompted other Great Dokkaebis to make theirs as
well.

[I, 'Great Dokkaebi Noksu', declare my intention to…]

[I, 'Great Dokkaebi Haram', declare…]

Over ten Great Dokkaebis were hardening their resolve. The meaning of
officially participating in the scenario meant they were giving up on the
positions of neutral bystanders.

A short while later, a message could be heard in the empty air.

[<Star Stream>'s Probability is experiencing a massive and sudden change!]

[<Star Stream> permits the meta-like intervention.]
[From here onwards, 'storytellers' will no longer be the scenario's
bystanders.]

[Many Constellations are greatly stunned by the Great Dokkaebis'
decision!]

[A portion of Constellations are denouncing the Great Dokkaebis' act of
brutality…!]

Bihyung stared at those Great Dokkaebis. He stared at their desire to end
this world, even going as far as to ignore the Constellations and their
messages of opposition.

It could be that they had been writing the 'scenario' for far too long.

There was another gaze from afar staring at these Great Dokkaebis.
Bihyung met this gaze.

It was from Kim Dokja, who had become an Outer God and then, the
⸢Enemy of the Story⸥. After he became an existence outside of the scenario,
not even Bihyung could understand him now.

Even then, why? Bihyung thought that, in that very moment, Kim Dokja
seemed to be smiling. It could very well be that these Great Dokkaebis still
didn't understand anything about that guy. Still failing to understand what
kind of a person Kim Dokja was.

Failing to realize what it meant to officially participate in the scenario, and
to become its characters.

Bihyung silently received that gaze, and took a step forward.

[Your ■■ is calling out to you.]

And so, it was now Bihyung's turn to choose his ■■.
The intervention from the Great Dokkaebis caused the scenario's balance to
tilt the other way.

[The target you wish to protect is the ⸢Enemy of the Story⸥.]

[Your actions are restricted by the ⸢Bureau⸥'s Probability!]

Not just Han Sooyoung, but the rest of the companions were being sucked
into the storm of the Probability's aftermaths as well. Pale-blue sparks
tightly wrapped around their bodies like binding ropes.

"Sooyoung-ssi, this!"

"Those sons of bitches… They are planning to end the scenario in this
way."

[Giant Story, 'Season of Light and Darkness', is quietly seething in anger.]

[Giant Story, 'Liberator of the Forgotten Ones', has begun its storytelling!]

The <Kim Dokja's Company>'s Giant Stories did absolutely everything in
order to resist the Bureau. However, it wasn't enough. Their enemy this
time was the strongest 'Giant Story' in this world.

[Now! Attack its head!!]

Constellations managed to pry open the gap among the Nameless Ones and
advanced forward, before finally firing their weapons at Kim Dokja.

"Kim Dokja!"

Han Sooyoung cried out, but her voice couldn't reach him.

[You can't protect the target.]

[Target you wish to protect is an existence you don't know.]

"…Screw you, don't give me that crap."
She recalled what the Great Dokkaebis said as if it was some kind of a
curse.

A human couldn't understand another even after devoting one's lifetime.

⸢However, they weren't just one person.⸥

Han Sooyoung looked around her. Lee Hyunsung, Jung, Heewon, Lee
Jihye, and then, Shin Yoosung and Lee Gilyoung; finally, her companions
riding on the battleship were looking back at her.

Perhaps, there was none among them who weren't 'Kim Dokja'. Everyone
here, they held at least one handful of share in Kim Dokja's life.

However, there was one person missing from this picture.

'Where did that guy disappear to??'

Han Sooyoung bit her lip. Unfortunately, she couldn't wait any longer.

"Aaaaaah!"

Jung Heewon screamed as if her body was being torn apart while moving
forward. The storm of aftermath was shattering her muscles and blowing up
her blood vessels. Still, she forged ahead even as her tattered, bloodied
body tottered unsteadily. She took one step at a time towards Kim Dokja
while gripping the [Judge's Sword] tightly. It wasn't to cut him down,
though.

Claaaaang!

Jung Heewon deflected a blade of a Constellation flying in only to vomit
out a mouthful of blood. Lee Hyunsung was right behind her.

Ku-dudududu!
The Outer God-ified Kim Dokja was fighting against the Constellations
from within the storm of aftermath. And his companions were protecting
him even as they were left in tatters by the exploding sparks.

"…There are this many people here, yet we can't protect Kim Dokja?"

[Story, 'Predictive Plagiarism', has begun its storytelling!]

[Story, 'Saviour of the Star', is searching for the 'Demon King of
Salvation'.]

[Story, 'Insect King', is searching for the 'Demon King of Salvation'.]

[Story, 'Judge of the Apocalypse', is searching for the 'Demon King of
Salvation'.]

Every Story they owned was searching for Kim Dokja. They were crying
out towards the man they used to know.

[Story, 'Predictive Plagiarism', is continuing with its storytelling!]

If they couldn't fight together because they couldn't understand him, and if
that's why they couldn't protect him, then…

[Many Constellations are sighing in lamentation at the <Kim Dokja's
Company>'s tragedy.]

[A Portion of Constellations are lodging a protest at the Bureau's treachery
and…!]

Blood trickled down Han Sooyoung's lips. Dizziness assaulted her
overheating head and her consciousness was wavering. It was also right
then that someone grasped her shoulder.

She thought that curly blonde locks were dancing past her eyes, only for
something to start protecting her and the companions. It felt like a
transparent wall was enveloping them.
['Wall of Impossible Communication' is protecting <Kim Dokja's
Company>!]

Jang Hayoung materialised her wall, and while supporting Han Sooyoung,
began walking towards Kim Dokja.

"Is there anyone here who likes the 'Demon King of Salvation' more than
me?"

Tsu-chuchuchut!

⸢Dokja-ssi, I'll stop telling you about that story of the lost things. It feels
like you're fed up…⸥

⸢Hyung, I'm right here. I have something I want to tell you.⸥

⸢Don't worry. I won't go anywhere without you, ahjussi.⸥

Sentences were scattering away.

Stories that <Kim Dokja's Company> had compiled so far were now
intertwining into one theme.

[A fragment of the 'Final Wall' has been revealed to the world!]

[Great Dokkaebis are greatly astonished!]

['Wall of Impossible Communication' is placing its fragment into its place.]

While being supported by Jang Hayoung, Han Sooyoung reached out to the
'Outer God King' Kim Dokja. She felt the sensation of touching a wall. A
cold and uncaring wall.

[Nebula, <Kim Dokja's Company>'s first 'theme' has been publicly
unveiled!]

This wall existed in order to let others know that someone was beyond it.
To let them know there was a person requiring a wall in this world.
To let them know one could converse with another without hurting each
other.

Han Sooyoung wrote her very first words on that impossible wall.

⸢You idiot.⸥

She couldn't believe that she wrote something that stupid. However, she
didn't have any energy left to write a follow-up.

It was then that the wall began shaking.

Accompanied by a light knocking noise, a new sentence she didn't write
appeared above the wall.

⸢■■■… Han Sooyoung.⸥
     Chapter 491: Ep. 93 - Omniscient Author's Viewpoint, V


That was Kim Dokja. That sentence, it definitely came from him. She didn't
need to hear his voice to know that.

Han Sooyoung wrote the next sentence.

⸢What's this, you were alright?⸥

Being an author didn't mean you were in control of every word you write.
And also, she was the type of person who could only write stuff like that.
However, Kim Dokja should be able to read that fine. Because he was the
greatest reader she knew.

Knock.

Along with a slight knocking noise, she heard his laughter. Sounds of
weapons clashing coming from everywhere hurt her ears. Her companions
were still bitterly fighting. No time to leisurely waste time, in other words.

⸢You knew this would happen from the get-go, didn't you?⸥
⸢…■■■■■⸥

She couldn't clearly see the sentence written on the wall. As if, the
communication earlier was just a pure fluke of really low odds.

⸢Hey, you! Write legibly, will ya?!⸥

Even though Jang Hayoung was helping out here, Kim Dokja's message
still couldn't be seen.

['Wall of Impossible Communication' is unleashing its power!] Tsu-

chuchuchut!

Far too many sentences were aimlessly floating above the wall.

Every single one of them happened to be what she and the rest of the
companions said to Kim Dokja. Some of them were clear to see, while
some were indistinct.

"Sooyoung-ah."

"…I know."

While listening to Jang Hayoung's voice, Han Sooyoung reached out to the
wall one more time. She tried really hard to find Kim Dokja's message by
combining the floating sentences.

[Story, 'Predictive Plagiarism', has begun its storytelling!]

[Target is an existence you can't understand!]

What connected each letter was context. Letters cast out in the sea without
context were akin to a book that had been created to be unreadable.

⸢"I'm going home now."⸥

⸢"You'll lend me a spare battery when we go camping?"⸥
All she could do now was to connect those context-less sentences
somehow.
Inject context into these nonsensical sentences to give them meaning.
Shuffle those that weren't plot development so that they looked like it.

However, it was not enough. No matter how she connected them, there
would always be some part without meaning.

"Kim Dokja! Say something! What is the plan?! Just what do you want us
to do here?!"

No reply came back to her. The roaring Outer God King was still battling
the Constellations. The heavily-bleeding companions were collapsing
within the storm of aftermaths.

Han Sooyoung gritted her teeth. It was fine if Kim Dokja didn't want to say
it. The important part was reading his intentions. His intentions of making
such a move without letting his companions know of his plans.

It was to figure out his thought process on choosing to become the Outer
God King.

It was then words began gathering one by one.

⸢If the Ways of Survival was behind a paywall, just how much have I used
it so far?⸥

⸢If I had ₩20,000,000 in my bank account, what would I feel?⸥

⸢If there are two rooms, then how does the remaining one get filled up,
usually?⸥
"…If I had met you back in the normal world, I would never ever have
become your friend."

Those words seemed randomly thrown out like a memo. She still collected
those words and sentences, anyway.
An excellent writer had to be an excellent reader first. And Han Sooyoung
knew a way to read such things.

⸢How does one go about making money?⸥

One had to accept that sometimes, you'll run into a sentence you can't
comprehend yet and flip the page over. Just so that, one day, you'd able to
read that sentence when you did return to the very same page later.

[Target is an existence you can't understand!]

There was no choice but to desperately flip the pages over and over again,
and then some more, to gather as many clues on those impossible sentences.

⸢Doesn't my life have money-making Probability or something?⸥

Tsu-chuchuchu…!

She saw Jung Heewon kneeling down in the distance. Lee Seolhwa ran over
and supported her, while Yoo Sangah and Lee Hyunsung blocked the
weapons flying in her direction.

[Bureau's Probability is restricting your interference in the scenario!]

Kim Dokja was right. Probability was to blame for everything.

The reason why he was poor, why they ended up in this state.

[Bureau's Probability is confining your body!] Tsu-

chuchuchut!

Probability in this world was basically power. The scenario would flow
towards those possessing more plausible Probability.

[Your Nebula has violated far too much Probability.]
Han Sooyoung knew that. This storm of aftermath was the reward for
overcoming many dangerous situations through sheer luck. They had so
many companions yet none were lost on their way to the Final Scenario.

On the other hand, other Incarnations had to sacrifice so much more trying
to get this far.

⸢Why only they…⸥

⸢This is unfair.⸥

⸢Do you know how hard we had to struggle to get this far?⸥

<Kim Dokja's Company> had violated far too much Probability. No one
was sacrificed when one was needed. Or, more correctly, only one person
got continuously sacrificed.

"Kim Dokja."

He died multiple times and got resurrected again.

He even revived someone that should've died. While using the revival
attribute, or even visiting the Underworld, and going so far as to alter the
future.

⸢And that's why Kim Dokja had to become the Enemy of the Story.⸥

Because all the Giant Stories <Kim Dokja's Company> had compiled didn't
have enough Probability.

Han Sooyoung grasped at the sentences as if she was scratching the wall. It
was then a new sentence suddenly floated up.

⸢"For the time being, you take over the Nebula's safe."⸥

This was a conversation she had with Kim Dokja not too long ago.
⸢"…What's this? I might end up spending it all, you know?"⸥

She received the authority to manage the safe via the system. She wondered
what possessed Mister Miser Kim Dokja to do this. Back then, she figured
that he was simply too lazy to manage the finances and dumped the job on
her shoulders, instead.

[Would you like to confirm the current balance?]

However, would that Kim Dokja really hand over the 'safe' to someone else
with that reasoning?

As if she had been entranced, Han Sooyoung opened the safe.

⸢"Wow, you saved up a lot, haven't you. What a miserly guy you are. What
are you planning to do by saving up this much, though?"⸥

⸢"They have their uses."⸥

There was a humongous amount of Coins saved up in the safe. More than
enough treasure to tempt any star was hidden inside there. And this was the
most basic currency of sponsorship, and the power source to move the
scenario.

⸢One of the most powerful Stories in this world is [Coins].⸥

However, there weren't all that many things one could do with Coins now,
whether that was reinforcing the Incarnation Bodies or purchasing stuff
from the [Dokkaebi Bunble].

That's why she was quite curious. What was the point of so obsessively
hoarding all these Coins?

[Will you spend these Coins for the growth of the 'Giant Story'?]

And then, Han Sooyoung finally realized that very reason.
"I will."

[Nebula's cache of 143,245,199 Coins will be paid to the Probability!] Ku-
gugugugu!

The moment her declaration came to an end, Stories rushed in like wild
predators lusting after fresh meat. Entrancing golden light blanketed the
companions.

[Giant Story, 'Demon Realm's Spring', is greedily gorging on the Coin's
Story!]

[Giant Story Torch that Swallowed the Myth's figure is ballooning up!]

[Giant Story Season of Light and Darkness's contrast is getting even
clearer!]

The Giant Stories would grow to possess even more power by devouring
the available funds. The Story's details would be realized more faithfully,
viscerally, and also more colourfully.

Ku-gugugugu!

When the strengths of the Giant Stories began resisting the Bureau's
Probability, both the Great Dokkaebis and Constellations began panicking.

Jung Heewon's sword grew lighter and lighter, while Lee Hyunsung's shield
was getting sturdier and sturdier. Monstrous beasts and insect kings Shin
Yoosung and Lee Gilyoung summoned began tearing into the
Constellations in the back.

"Fire!!"

Lee Jihye's battleship began firing its cannons and the Incarnations in the
frontlines dissipated without a trace.

Unfortunately, their higher odds of victory lasted only for a brief while.
[Bureau's Probability has increased its level of restriction!]

The jet-black rifts began spreading in the heavens from the excessive usage
of the Probability. The entire stage for the scenario was shaking unsteadily.

Stories began leaking out from the mouths of several Great Dokkaebis.
They had bet their lives on this must-win battle. In order to create the
conclusion they wanted to see, these Dokkaebis personally jumped into the
scenario and willingly became the part of the story.

Tsu-chuchuchut!

"Black Flame Dragon!"

Powerful [Black Flame] wrapped around Han Sooyoung. While filtering
away attacks coming in at her, more [Black Flames] were fired out. Right
next to her, Jan Hayoung was relying on the Murim's skills to guard her
back.

Why did Kim Dokja entrust her with this role?

There was someone better suited for this job, the protagonist of a certain
story. However, Kim Dokja still entrusted this job to her.

Su-susususu…

Jang Hayoung's wall was scattering away again. It was going away after
exhausting all its powers.

The Bureau's restrictions made it harder to even breathe.

Kim Dokja, momentarily within reach, grew distant again. The flow of the
story was once more going over to the Great Dokkaebis. Han Sooyoung
cried out.

[Your ■■ is 'Neverending Story'.]

A story where none would be lost.
A story, where everyone would live together in a huge house at the end of
all the scenarios.

The companions were fighting for that simple dream. However, their
Probability wasn't enough and that dream couldn't become reality.
[Constellation, 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon', is now looking at his own
Incarnation.]

It was right then, a lightbulb flashed brightly in her head.

Not enough Probability?

⸢The reason why Kim Dokja entrusted this role to Han Sooyoung and not
Yoo Joonghyuk.⸥
[Constellation, 'Maritime War God', is looking at Incarnation 'Han
Sooyoung'.]

Drip, drip…

Blood dripped down from her wounded shoulder. Han Sooyoung
haphazardly wrapped some bandages around the injury and looked up at the
sky.

There they were, distant stars of <Star Stream>, visible among the storm of
sparks raining down. Far, far more Constellations than ever before were
watching the last moments of this world.

[Many Constellations are dissatisfied with this scenario's development!]

[Quite a number of Constellations are criticising the tyranny of the Bureau
and the Myth-grade Constellations…!]

Han Sooyoung suddenly smiled insidiously. "That's right. You were all
Constellations…"

Kim Dokja should've known this. Because he too was a Constellation.
He was a reader who knew better than anyone on how to make a scenario
more entertaining and even tenser than before.

⸢And that's why Kim Dokja hadn't said anything to his companions.⸥

Han Sooyoung clenched her hand tightly. Since she had spent all the Coins,
she was now literally empty-handed.

However, Kim Dokja hadn't just left her with Coins only.

"…When the first scenario started, you all said this to us. That we had been
living for free. So, we should start paying the price for that."

What Kim Dokja had left behind was…

[Constellation, 'Bald General of Justice', is focusing on Incarnation Han
Sooyoung's words.]

[Constellation, 'One-eyed Maitreya', is focusing on Incarnation Han
Sooyoung's words.]

…The entirety of their lives lived so far.

"What you said back then, I'm returning it in full back to you."

Along with Han Sooyoung's signal, Biyoo shut the channel off as if she was
waiting for that.

And then, the Constellations' channel went dark.

[Channel BY-9158's all broadcast screens have been blocked.]

[Constellation, 'Heavenly Wind God', is panicking at the sudden blackout!]

[Constellation, 'Joseon's Number One Sorcerer', wishes to see what happens
next!]

After the world had fallen into darkness, the panicky voices of
Constellations from other scenario locations watching the channel could be
heard resounding out.

Every subscriber had to go through Biyoo's channel to watch the <Kim
Dokja's Company>'s story. Even those subscribing to other channels had no
choice but to see this world through Biyoo's, at least at this moment.

"From now on, our story will be a paid service."
    Chapter 492: Ep. 93 - Omniscient Author's Viewpoint, VI


The announcement of the paywall brought about a deep silence in the
channel.

Only Han Sooyoung's heavy breathing could be heard within the pitch-
black darkness of the stage.

"If you wish to continue watching this tragedy…"

What <Kim Dokja's Company> lacked right now was 'Probability'.

Probability. The thing that made the story flow naturally and in a plausible
manner. The set of rules that could only be changed by the gazes of
countless Constellations, and the Coins they sponsored.

"…It's time you guys pay, too."

Only then did she figure out Kim Dokja's plan in its entirety. And because
she did, she could say this out aloud now.
Selling off the tragedy of his life lived solely for the purpose of saving his
companions, just like how his mother did once upon a time; Kim Dokja
wanted to change this scenario by selling the tragedy <Kim Dokja's
Company> had created.

[The absolute majority of Constellations are greatly shocked!]

Han Sooyoung's declaration caused the Constellations to grow hesitant.

She recalled the memories from back when her novel went behind the
paywall for the first time ever.

⸢Author-nim, it'll start from tomorrow.⸥

She felt the exact same emotion back then as today. The feeling of not
knowing what would happen in the future.

How many people would end up reading my writing?

How long would I be able to live on by selling off this story?

'You stinking Kim Dokja. So, you slapped me with this kind of role, is that
it??'

What she needed to do right now wasn't selling some novels.

[Giant Story, 'Demon Realm's Spring', wishes to tell the next part of the
story!]

[Giant Story, 'Torch That Swallowed the Myth', wishes to tell the next part
of the story!]

[Giant Story, 'Season of Light and Darkness', wishes to tell the next part of
the story!]

[Giant Story, 'Liberator of the Forgotten Ones', wishes to tell the next part
of the story!]
…The words written by <Kim Dokja's Company>'s blood and tears.

What she needed to sell was their life story. Stories that she couldn't
carelessly change or tell in a jokey manner. Even then, she offered up these
Stories for sale to the Constellations.

Biyoo and her concerned eyes were looking at her from the sky. Han
Sooyoung smiled as if to say, don't worry.

"There's no one? That's too bad. Things are about to get really interesting
from now on."

Only she could do this job. Only Han Sooyoung, designated as the baddie
among <Kim Dokja's Company>, could sell this story.

As if to sympathise with her, the movements of the Outer God King was
getting duller. Maybe, he was wallowing in sorrow.

[How laughable. Who do you think will be interested in your measly little
story?]

The one to shatter this silence was the Myth-grade Constellation, Poseidon.
The figures of other Myth-grade Constellations could be seen in the
distance as well. They were all mocking Han Sooyoung.

[Do you really believe that your 'Story' is worth that much?]

It was the same with the Great Dokkaebis; they all seemed to be thinking
that Han Sooyoung's choice was an error in judgement, one made while
under the weight of the encroaching end.

Tsu-chuchuchut!

Once the Constellations left, the channel's size shrunk down. Some
channels even tried to butt in using this opportunity. Channels that
belonged to Dokkaebis hostile towards <Kim Dokja's Company>.

[Finish them.]
Constellations manning their positions at the back made their moves. They
were mostly Myth-grade, or those top-ranked Narrative-grade
Constellations that almost equalled them in power.

[Constellation, 'One Responsible for the Universe's Cycle', is surveying the
scenario's battlefield!]

[Constellation, 'Mirror that Emits Smoke', is incarnating into the scenario's
battlefield!]

[Constellation, 'Master of Thunder and War', is incarnating into
the scenario's battlefield!] Indian myth's Brahma.

Aztec myth's Tezcatlipoca.

Even Slavic myth's Perun.

The Constellations from the different large-scale Nebulas that never
showed themselves in the lower scenarios until now – their movement
alone was 'Story' in itself.

And when the Giant Stories began their actions, the flow pressuring the
battlefield intensified even more.

Gah-aaaaaah, Puh-guh-guk!!

The 'Nameless Ones' desperately blocking the Constellations approaching
Kim Dokja were blown up indiscriminately.

Myth-grade Constellations possessed the largest shares of the 'Giant Story'
of each Nebula. Once they began moving their Probability, the balance of
the engagement tilted in their favour in an instant.

Han Sooyoung watched the incoming wave of the stars and muttered out.
"Even in places you didn't bother to look, we managed to eke out a living."
The screens might be blacked out, but the sounds still continued to be
transmitted. And probably, her voice was being heard by every
Constellation in the channel.

⸢Han Sooyoung also knew. Not every Constellation liked them.⸥

<Kim Dokja's Company> had a lot of enemies. Some cheered their Story
on, but some others either were jealous of them, or in some cases, even
hated them. At times, malice with no basis could be found, too.

However, there was one common denominator among that gamut of
emotions. And that was the fact that they had been watching a certain Story
for a very long time.

⸢A story that you spent a very long time with will eventually become a part
of you.⸥
Just like Kim Dokja and the 'Ways of Survival'.

"However, the moment you close your eyes, this story you've been
watching will end right here."

Her words didn't target any particular listener; meaning, it was a declaration
aimed at everyone.

Eventually, Constellations annihilated the front ranks of the 'Outer Gods'
and rushed in. The <Kim Dokja's Company>'s companions stepped up to
block them.

Kwa-aaaaaah!

A baptism of Status in the form of Poseidon's wave with Zeus's lightning
added on top, crashed in. Outer Gods burning away like meat being grilled
by electricity died in their droves. Even those from <Kim Dokja's
Company> wouldn't be able to receive that wave with their current body
conditions. Even then, Han Sooyoung believed in her companions.
"Even if I die, I will never stop moving."

Han Sooyoung fired [Black Flame] with every ounce of her energy.
However, its power was less than a quarter after being suppressed by the
Probability.

And just as Poseidon's wave reached the front of their nose and began
pouncing on them…

⸢For a very brief moment there, it felt as if the world came to a standstill.⸥

Also, it felt like a fundamental something that created this world seemed to
have changed, as if a thin brush was painting over it. And then in the
following moment, the frozen world began moving forward again.

[A fatal error has occurred in the Final Scenario!]

Poseidon's wave and Zeus's lightning pounced on her and <Kim Dokja's
Company>.

Kwa-dudududu!!

More correctly, pounced on the protective barrier in front of them.

It was the sturdy, vast wall of forged steel. Which was Lee Hyunsung's
Story. His Story that blanketed the entire planet back in <Oz> was now
protecting his companions.

But, he should still be under the restrictions by the Bureau. So how could
he?

"Sooyoung-ssi."

A terrifying amount of sparks was streaming all over Lee Hyunsung's
body. But, it wasn't only him. Everyone from <Kim Dokja's Company>,
wasting away under the Bureau's restrictions, were now enveloped in the
dancing blue-hued sparks. Their once-imprisoned muscles regained their
freedom, and the arrested magical energy was being freed as well. [The
error in the channel's donation payout has been normalised.] The message
entered their ears in the next moment.

[Delayed donation amounts will now be paid out!]

Biyoo could be seen crying softly in the air next. At the same time, an
incredible amount of indirect messages smacked Han Sooyoung in her ear.

[Constellation, 'Demon-like Judge of Fire', happily donates half of the
Coins she owns!]

Just how much was the half of Coins amassed by a Constellation at the cusp
of reaching the Myth-grade? Han Sooyoung couldn't even estimate the
amount.

[Constellation, 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon', is paying an
incredible amount of Coins while grumbling unhappily!]
[Constellation, 'Most Ancient Liberator', is…] So, so many stars
began glowing brightly.

The Nebula's safe started filling up rapidly with wealth.

[Nebula safe total balance: 83,112,540 C]

[Nebula safe total balance: 162,423,800 C]

…

…

[Nebula safe total balance: 1,041,512,080 C]

The total Coins surpassed 100 million in no time, before breaking past a
billion mark.
That pretty much determined what Han Sooyoung should do next. Which
was to spend every single cent of that donated amount into the Probability.

Tsu-chuchuchuchut!!

"Everyone, hold on!"

[Constellation, 'Mass Production Maker', is grinning brightly.]
[Constellation, 'Mass Production Maker', has donated the number of Coins
that exceeds the upper donation limit!]

The geezer wearing the pineapple-themed T-shirt.

Back when Han Sooyoung went to shoot a commercial for the
[Ferrarghini], she had a chance to chat to him for a brief spell.

⸢You really think such adverts will sell your car?⸥

When Han Sooyoung asked, the Mass Production Maker replied in a
somewhat obtuse manner.

⸢I'm not advertising to sell, but advertising the product about to be sold.⸥

And now, she thought she could understand that answer just a bit.

[Constellation, 'Joseon's Number One Sorcerer', is donating 5,000 Coins!]

[Constellation, 'Meirangong Marquis Zhuangmou', is donating 5,100
Coins!]

[Constellation, 'Father of the Rich Night', is donating everything in his
secret stash!]

[Constellation, 'Mother of the Darkest Spring', is donating half of the
Underworld's balance!]
[Constellation, 'Supreme God of Light', is donating 2,100,000 Coins!]

[Constellation, 'Lily Blooming in Aquarius', is donating 1,500,000 Coins!]

Constellations of familiar Modifiers.

[Constellation, 'Lame Trickster', is donating 15,000 Coins.]

[Constellation, 'Monarch of Small Fries', is donating 450,000 Coins.]

[Constellation, 'Adventurer that Stands up an Egg', is donating 18,000
Coins!]

[Constellation, 'Master of the Niten Ichu-ryu', is donating 4,000 Coins!]

[All the stars in the Big Dipper are donating 300,000 Coins!] [A

small Constellation from a small planet is donating 300 Coins!]

Constellations that were familiar, but not counted on.

[A great number of Constellations staying anonymous have added
their strength to the Nebula <Kim Dokja's Company>'s Probability!]
And finally, even the Constellations they didn't know.

Every Constellation that came along for the ride with <Kim Dokja's
Company>'s Story was now sponsoring their story.

Light returned to the once-darkened channel, and the broadcast began once
more.

[Channel BY-9158's broadcast will begin again!]

The story was starting again. All these Coins contained the wills of the
Constellations.

⸢Their desire to see the end of this Story.⸥
Han Sooyoung too understood this desire. However, there were some who
failed to do so.

[What are you all doing?! Could it be that you're sympathising with those
Incarnations?? With the ⸢Enemies of the Story⸥?? Everyone, you must wake
up!! Have you all forgotten who you are?! Oh, dear Constellations, don't let
your eyes be stolen away by a demeaning story like that!]

The Great Dokkaebi roared out. That prompted someone to answer back.

[Constellation, 'Demon-like Judge of Fire', says she's more clear-headed
than ever before.]

Tsu-chuchuchu…!

An incredible storm of Probability was pushed back, and Poseidon's wave
sunk back to the ground.

Han Sooyoung slowly closed her eyes. A breeze was blowing in.

[Will of <Star Stream> accepts the new flow of Probability.]

Something was changing.

[<Star Stream> is considering an alteration to the scenario's rules.]

All Probability from the Bureau ruthlessly suppressing her and her
companions were dissipating away. The scenario's balance that had been
heavily tilted out of equilibrium was regaining itself.

[You still can't understand 'Enemy of the Story'.]

Kim Dokja remained difficult. However…

['Enemy of the Story' wishes to be understood by you.]

…However, it wasn't as if nothing had changed.
[Scenario's rules are changing.]

[From here on, all Constellations can choose a camp to side with during the
Final Scenario!]

Han Sooyoung slowly looked around her.

The surrounding view began changing as if a layer of the world had been
peeled back.

【■■■■■■… Go!! Fight on! This is our battlefield!】

A man astride a horse brushed past Han Sooyoung's side. Without a doubt,
he used to be an Outer God only until a second ago. An existence that used
to be a 'Nameless One'. The strange monsters covered in tentacles and
sticky fluids, and caused one to feel instinctive fear simply by looking at
them.

【We can win this! Do not give up until the end!】

Their figures were changing. Some changed into people, some into dwarves
– they were from all sorts of different species, but regardless of what, they
were no longer the existences of unknown.

【Beomgak! Move! This is the Final Scenario we've been dreaming of!】

【Mark!】

All those 'Nameless Ones' now had names in this place.

[You have sided with the 'Enemy of the Story'.]

These beings rushed towards the Constellations as dusk fell on the
battlefield. They formed ranks and advanced towards the Constellations.

【I shall accompany you!】
Among them was a man who resembled Lee Hyunsung, and also a child
resembling Shin Yoosung. Even some that resembled Jung Heewon, Lee
Gilyoung, and Lee Jihye.

【Not bad. So, then. This world-line has reached this far?】

For a brief moment there, Han Sooyoung saw a girl who seemed to
resemble her, too. And all of them were fighting as the ally of the ⸢Enemy
of the Story⸥.
Her dazed eyes chased after their backs.

⸢Every abandoned world-line was converging here.⸥

The world that she couldn't express with mere words. The world that the
[Predictive Plagiarism] couldn't read, because it could only be imagined by
a reader.

⸢This was the world Kim Dokja had been dreaming of.⸥

Han Sooyoung slowly turned around towards the spot where the Outer God
King was only until a moment ago. And a certain man stood on that very
spot where a deep abyss cast by the massive creature's size used to exist.

⸢"Han Sooyoung, what should an extra do in order to garner attention?"⸥

The white coat revealed itself fleetingly underneath the tattered and torn
black coat.

⸢"You're an extra because no one pays you attention."⸥

Han Sooyoung staggered towards that spot.

⸢"Well, there isn't any clear solution. Normally, you grab some attention by
sacrificing yourself, or…"⸥
She walked and walked some more, and eventually, reached the front of
that man.

⸢"…Or, you give them stories of their own."⸥

The man quietly stood there and waited for her.

Han Sooyoung stood up straight in front of Kim Dokja. Quite unlike her
usual self, she thought she might start crying now. Her vision blurred and
couldn't see his face properly.

"You did well."

And Kim Dokja was standing there.
            Chapter 493: Ep. 94 - Beginning of the end, I


Seeing him smile with such a thick skin, she suddenly felt compelled to
hurl several choice words at him. She wanted to say, she'll definitely kill
him if he went ahead and did something like this again.

Just like how it had been. She really wanted to do that, but…

"Han Sooyoung."

…She couldn't.

When she lowered her head, she saw Kim Dokja's ankles. The battle-ready
formal suit crafted by the Mass Production Maker was now in tatters.

His entire body, having fought Constellations as an Outer God King earlier,
was riddled full with wounds, so much so that it'd not be strange for him to
keel over right now.

"…Are you alright?"
And him worrying about her instead of himself only made Han Sooyoung
unable to figure out how to digest her current emotions.

[Constellation, 'Father of the Rich Night', is looking at you.]

[Constellation, 'Queen of the Darkest Spring', is satisfied with your reply.]

[Constellation, 'Maritime War God', is nodding his head.]

…

The gazes of the stars shone from the sky. Even though the indirect
messages continued to rain down, Han Sooyoung's back remained cold. The
blackedout channel of a few moments ago still remained vivid in her mind.

⸢If she had made even the slightest mistake…⸥

Constellations might not have lent their help. Probability might not have
flowed in a way she planned. Her companions might not have endured.

What had been entrusted to her up until a few moments ago was not some
simple manuscript that could be revised at will.

This burden of knowing that one misstep would bring down everything they
had built up together – Kim Dokja had been completing the scenarios while
constantly feeling that emotion.

He supported Han Sooyoung tottering unsteadily. She was about to slap his
hand away, but instead, sighed and spoke up. "Don't ever make me do that
again."

"Only you could've done this."

She bit her lip the moment she heard him.

"You know better than anyone what the readers want, right?"

⸢What was the 'end' Kim Dokja wanted?⸥
What Han Sooyoung thought about even when she found herself in a
desperate situation of making the whole world her enemy, was that very
question.

And perhaps, the current her should be able to reach the answer.

"Is this the end you've been thinking about?"

"Well, it's the beginning of that end."

There were many creatures brushing past them to enter the battlefield. Only
until a few moments ago, they had been the 'Outer Gods', but now, they
were existences with faces and their own names.

【Attack them!!】

【Those Constellation dogs!!】

Some faces they almost recognised, some others they couldn't. Someone
resembled Kim Namwoon, while a face resembling Lee Jihye could be
seen, too. However, they weren't Kim Namwoon nor Lee Jihye; no, they
were simply extras from those stories that ended a while ago.

⸢And every single one of these existences was fighting to change this
worldline's conclusion.⸥
Everyone from the abandoned world-lines, from the 0th turn to the 1863rd,
had gathered here.

【Go!! Everyone!!】

Han Sooyoung felt emotions swell up in her chest after watching their
march. These people gathering here to resist the pre-determined conclusion
were all <Kim Dokja's Company>'s allies.

[Nebula, <Kim Dokja's Company>'s entire roster has become the 'Enemies
of the Story'!]
Companions approached them in their unsteady steps. They too, could
finally see Kim Dokja's world.

[Story, 'Predictive Plagiarism', is sharing its understanding with the rest of
<Kim Dokja's Company>'s members!]

[Story, 'Saviour of the Star', is sharing its thoughts with the rest of <Kim
Dokja's Company>'s members.]

All the Stories were talking to each other now.

Companions scanned their surroundings with dazed expressions. They too
were witnessing the sight of the horrifying masks covering up the Outer
Gods slipping away.

Han Sooyoung observed each and every one of her companions, before
abruptly realizing something.

One of them was still nowhere to be seen.

"Where did that guy disappear to?"

When she thought about it, she found it really odd.

That guy hated the Constellations more than anyone out there. That guy,
who fought the hardest among the companions, was nowhere to be seen
within the battlefield for a while now.

Kim Dokja promptly answered her.

"Over there."

"Wha?"

Han Sooyoung hurriedly scanned her surroundings.

KWA-BOOOOM!
An explosion occurred in the frontline and thick dust cloud was kicked up.
Constellations from Asgard were busy crushing the Outer Gods.

[…You disgusting bastards.]

Dozens upon dozens of 'Nameless Ones' died every time Constellations
crossed the battlefield.

If it was before, this scene would've been one of monsters dying; but now,
it depicted the deaths of actual persons. 'Nameless Ones' lost their arms,
their legs were torn off, and their guts were spilt.

They couldn't even mount a proper challenge. Most of the 'Outer Gods' that
heeded Kim Dokja's call and showed up here were the lower-ranked
variety. Although there were a few higher-ranked creatures mixed within,
they had already been felled after being subjected to a concentrated barrage
of attacks from the Myth-grade Constellations. Defending against the
concerted attacks of the Constellations with the remaining forces was
impossible.

However, something was wrong.

⸢Even when there was such an overwhelming difference in combat
capability, they were still ably holding on.⸥
Upon closer inspection, she realized that there was 'something' at the very
front of the Outer Gods' ranks.

Tsu-chuchuchut!

Darkish-blue sword light swept across the battlefield.

Golden afterimages scattered in the air where the sword's trajectory scythed
by.

[Kuwaaaaahk!!]
The head of a Constellation stomping on an 'Outer God' just now flew away
without warning. And then, another one. Then, yet another one. A
pitchblack figure, currently bathed in the baptism of spewing Stories rather
than blood, was continuously wielding his sword.

"Isn't that…?!"

She was well aware of the fact that there was a seriously powerful
individual among the 'Outer Gods' fighting out in the furthest front.
Initially, she thought that, 'since this is the Final Scenario, the really strong
ones have come out of the woodwork'.

This 'Outer God' continued to cut down Constellations like pieces of papers,
its sharp tail wagging this way and that.

But now that she took a closer look, that was no tail at all but a pitch-black
sword, instead.

[Attribute, 'Iron-Blooded Supreme King', is activating!]

Corpses of Constellations formed a mountain. And on top of this very
mountain was a throne of blood. The master of this throne was arrogantly
looking down on all the stars of the world.

"This swordsmanship… you, you're Yoo Joonghyuk."

Anna Croft gritted her teeth and emitted her sword aura.

The greatest Incarnation in America, Anna Croft, reputedly strong enough
to never lose in a tactical battle.

"I'm the strongest on the continent!"

Soon after, Fei Hu's long spear stabbed through the air and flew right in.

China's number one Incarnation, Fei Hu – master of one on one combat.
"This will be my first time fighting you. However, I shall emerge victorious
nevertheless."

And lastly, Ranvir Khan's palms made their move; his palms left behind
clear shadows like Kali's hands, while pouring out around hundred or so
ripples.

Kwa-aaaaaaah!!

The battlefield was rocked by yet another loud explosion. Stories continued
to tell their stories beyond that explosion noise, however.

[Story, 'Life and Death Companions', is continuing on with its storytelling.]

[A portion of Stories are being shared due to the special effect of 'Life and
Death Companions'.]

[Story, 'Hell of Eternity', is continuing on with its storytelling.]

While witnessing this spectacle of swords slicing down indiscriminately
and both Constellations and Outer Gods dying with their bellies cut wide
open, Han Sooyoung abruptly recalled a certain old question that circulated
among the gossipers.

Who was the strongest Incarnation in the world?

[Everyone, kill that guy! We can break through as long as that man is
dead!]

Now, she could answer it without a shred of hesitation. There couldn't be
differences in opinion on this one.

⸢The world's strongest Incarnation was Yoo Joonghyuk.⸥

Constellations that had long discarded any semblance of their pride
pounced on him. Even though his shoulder split open and his thigh
ruptured, Yoo Joonghyuk's expression remained calm as he blocked the
Constellation army rushing in at the frontlines.
Such a battle was only possible because he had regained a portion of his
past memories. However, there was one thing she still couldn't figure it out.
[Incarnation Yoo Joonghyuk is currently the 'Enemy of the Story'.]

"How can that guy be the first…??"

How did Yoo Joonghyuk join Kim Dokja even before Han Sooyoung or the
rest of the companions could?

Yoo Joonghyuk's battlefield was steadily being pushed back after the
Mythgrade Constellations pitched in. The closer he got, the more visible the
murky aura of Chaos surrounding him became. It was the power of Chaos
usually seen from the 'Outer Gods'.

⸢Yoo Joonghyuk had become one with 'Secretive Plotter' once upon a time.⸥

Only then she understood it – the reason why he could become Kim Dokja's
ally faster than everyone else.

Han Sooyoung immediately flew off her handle. "You sons of bitches, not
even saying a single thing to me…!"

⸢Yoo Joonghyuk was well aware of Kim Dokja's intention.⸥

Sometimes, rage would be accompanied by deep understanding.

⸢This tragedy could only be established when the characters deceived each
other.⸥
Because Yoo Joonghyuk hated Constellations more than anyone, he was
able to read Kim Dokja's intentions. And that was how he could make his
move without hesitation.

⸢That was the only way to hide the fact that this was simply a 'story' from
the Constellations watching on.⸥
Pah-chuchuchut!

Yoo Joonghyuk had arrived in their vicinity before long; he sheathed his
sword and spoke up.

"It'll be hard to continue defending like this."

He looked back with disinterested eyes, only to meet Han Sooyoung's glare.

He opened his mouth first. "You were late."

"Shut the hell up."

Three of them lined up side by side.

Yoo Joonghyuk's [Black Heavenly Demon Sword] roared out a keen,
vicious cry, while Kim Dokja's pair of black wings spread wide open as if
to protect the two people next to him.

Han Sooyoung clenched and unfurled her fist currently enveloped in [Black
Flame] and spoke up. "…I can't figure out why this feels like it's been a
really long time."

Their companions finally reached their rear.

"Dokja-ssi! Sooyoung-ssi!"

"Hyung-!!"

Lee Hyunsung knelt down and protected everyone with his shield, while
Jung Heewon stood next to him and held her sword upright.

The Chimera Dragon carrying Shin Yoosung and Lee Gilyoung roared out.
Yoo Sangah's lotus pedestal spun around and surrounded the companions'
sides. And lastly, Lee Jihye's battleship protected the sky above them.

"Load the cannons!"

Cannons were shoring up their strengths at the ends of the vessel.
Gong Pildu established his fortress atop the battleship and aimed his own
cannons at the ground as if to imply that he could take care of everything
here.

[Every star in Nebula, <Kim Dokja's Company>, is shining brightly!]

Biyoo was shining like a blue sun amidst the dancing sparks; she was
sweating profusely while receiving the Coins pouring in the <Kim Dokja's
Company>'s direction.

Probability gleaming richly was now giving them blessings.

Kim Dokja then spoke to his quiet companions manning his sides.

"Everyone, thank you."

Their expressions faintly trembled when he said that.

Jung Heewon bit down on her lip, while Lee Hyunsung wiped tears welling
up in his eyes.

Han Sooyoung could feel it.

⸢From the start, Kim Dokja didn't plan on sacrificing himself.⸥

Maybe, he had thought about it over and over again – the way to make
everyone happy at the end of this world.

He should know fully about the wound his companions suffered when he
sacrificed himself, and then, he must've foreseen the destruction they might
suffer as the price for fighting together.

And that was why he chose this scenario.

A scenario that changed scenarios. A scenario that didn't stick to the
predetermined conclusion. A scenario where everyone could reach the end
together.
Han Sooyoung thought that it'd be nice for this story to end right here.

Every emotion permeating within the words got transmitted vividly. She
felt as if she now knew what Kim Dokja was thinking about, and what he
truly wanted here.

Only after reaching the end of everything did he finally open up his heart.
⸢And that was precisely why Han Sooyoung thought that things must not
end here.⸥
"Let's talk about that later."

Jang Hayoung opened her mouth first, and…

"Everyone, fight to your heart's content. I won't let anyone die."

…Lee Seolhwa ended the conversation.

"Here they come!"

The march of the Constellations commenced once more.

[Do not panic! Their numbers have grown a little bit, that's all!]

[They are nothing more than a small Nebula!]

The story that couldn't find its bearing continued to flow within the
rapidlychanging scenario.

Han Sooyoung swung her fist; [Black Flame] shooting out from her
knuckles pierced through the heads of the Incarnations. Yoo Joonghyuk's
[Breaking the Sky Swordsmanship] deflected both Anna Croft's and Fei
Hu's blades, while Jang Hayoung's [Breaking the Sky Force Punch] shoved
away the group of Constellations trying to rush in from the side.

['Hour of Judgement' is activating!]
Jung Heewon's [Hellfire] burned away the stars rushing in from the front.
And Lee Hyunsung's forged-steel shield blocked the unseen weapons
cutting through the air.

"Everyone, get down!"

Lee Jihye's turtle ship finished loading its cannons and began spitting
flames out. Along with blinding flashes of explosions, the enemies in the
frontlines were swept away.

"Bring down that ship first!"

Incarnations waiting for their chance all leapt up into the sky. That
prompted Gong Pildu's turrets to spit out fire and noise, as well.

"Kuwaaaahk!"

[You pathetic fools!]

A handful of Constellations used the falling Incarnations as their footholds
to fly up. They flew up higher than the turtle ship and began firing their
charged-up magical attacks.

[Die…?!]

Even before the Constellation could finish its words, its body was torn apart
in half. The Chimera Dragon roared out and ripped the Constellation's body
to pieces with its massive maw.

"Hyung! Behind you!"

Lee Gilyoung's locusts stopped the Constellations trying to fly in.

The companions advanced forward bit by bit. Just like the time they had
tread so far, they inched forward on the road where the starlight couldn't
reach.

Han Sooyoung began thinking.
In the eyes of other Constellations, they must've looked like monsters trying
to destroy this world. However, that didn't matter – because that was the
more exciting alternative, after all.

"Kim Dokja! Destroy that ark!"

They could see the ark beyond the Constellations rushing in like storm
clouds to protect it. And even now, more Constellations were rushing out
from the hull of the broken ark.

They were actually stars asleep within the [Ark], waiting to depart from this
world-line.

['Enemy of the Story' is approaching the ark.]

['Enemy of the Story' will destroy all Stories in this world!]

That ark had to be destroyed in order to end the influx of the Constellations.

"Hurry!"

[Collision of Probability has caused the rapid change to the scenario!]

[<Star Stream> has begun revising the Final Scenario's condition!]

But then, there were certain Constellations standing before the ark.

[Constellation, 'One Responsible for the Universe's Cycle', is intervening in
the battlefield!]

[Constellation, 'Mirror that Emits Smoke', is intervening in the scenario!]

[Constellation, 'Master of Thunder and War', is intervening in the scenario!]

These Myth-grade Constellations had been observing the unfolding
situation until now. Only by defeating them could the ark be within reach.

Each individual combat power was more than enough, but they still lost out
in the overall combat force.
[Constellation, 'Spear that Draws the Borders in the Oceans', is greatly
enraged!]

Poseidon and Zeus busy slaughtering the 'Nameless Ones' out by the
frontlines joined in, leaving the companions stuck in a boxed-in position.

Ku-dudududu!

Yoo Joonghyuk watched the spear slice past the ocean of corpses and return
to its wielder, and spat out venomously. "…Poseidon."

Even if this was <Kim Dokja's Company>, they still wouldn't be able to
cope with these enemies all at once. There was some leeway still left to be
found on the expressions of the Great Dokkaebis.

Han Sooyoung was angry; they possessed this much Probability, yet why
couldn't they surpass those creatures?

She cried out. "Hey!! When will our own Constellations show up?!"

Those that were supposed to come hadn't appeared yet. Uriel, her own
sponsor, the Underworld's couple, and…

But then, Kim Dokja asked back. "Does it have to be Constellations,
though?"

"What was that?"

Kim Dokja grinned. Han Sooyoung really detested that smile.

"It isn't just the Constellations that can participate in this battle now.
Because there's enough Probability here thanks to a certain someone."

At that moment, Han Sooyoung felt the back of her neck grow cold. The
enormous amount of Probability that had been injected to <Kim Dokja's
Company> was suddenly emptying out at once. Something that could only
be summoned after using up that much Probability was arriving here.
⸢The existences that all Constellations feared.⸥

The licks of flames belonging to the conflagration burned on the ground. A
sun that burned away the Story of eternity was rising up from the east.

⸢No star would dare to compare itself to her brightness – the 'Living
Flame'.⸥

And on the opposite side of the burning, screaming stars, a pure-blue ocean
was crashing in. A tsunami wave flooded in from the west, as the 'Sunken
Island' rose up once more.

⸢The calamity of the western world, 'Master of the Sunken Island'.⸥
[Kuwaaaahk!!]

Constellations got swept away by the wave and dissolved away as sacks of
Stories in an instant.

Soon afterwards, the northern skies grew jet-black, and Constellations there
began crashing to the ground like falling raindrops.

⸢The ruler of the northern universe, 'Monarch of the Great Abyss'.⸥

The 'Outer God King' smiled as he began bursting the heads of the stars like
a rampaging hooligan.

And the existence incarnating into Lee Hyunsung blocked the storm of
aftermaths they had created.

⸢The 'King of the Silver Heart', the ruler of the interstellar space in the
south.⸥
And then, an existence approached them from a place of nothing.

With every step he took, the gigantic [Splitting the Sky Sword] clawed the
night sky and brought down many stars shining up there.
【It's been a while, Poseidon.】

It was a man with the exact same face as Yoo Joonghyuk, replete with a
long scar on the cheek, too.

The 'Secretive Plotter' nonchalantly strode over and grabbed Poseidon by
the latter's neck, before grinning brightly.

【This will be my 26th time killing you.】
           Chapter 494: Ep. 94 - Beginning of the end, II


I thought that 'it' had finally happened when I became the Outer God King.

[You have become the 'Enemy of the Story'.]

This wouldn't be my first time experiencing the sensation of Story in my
entire body shattering into tiny little pieces. A similar thing happened back
when I was booted out of the scenario and fell in the 'story's horizon'.

If there was one thing different between then and now, it would be me not
getting expelled from the scenario even after becoming an altered existence.
No, it was the exact opposite.

[You have become the boss monster of the last scenario.]

[You will be alone forever.]

[No one will understand you in this worldview.]
I memorised the loneliness I felt in that moment. This feeling of being cast
away all alone in this universe. The feeling of becoming a monster that no
one could understand for all eternity.

However, this also wasn't my first time experiencing such a feeling either.

⸢"I'm XX Time's reporter. Do you have some time to speak with me?"⸥

⸢"It's him. The son of the murderer."⸥

That was why I needed to take up this role. Only I could perform it to its
fullest, after all. That was the price to pay for reading the story called 'Ways
of Survival' to its conclusion.

⸢【Your companions will never understand your decision.】⸥

The 'Secretive Plotter' told me that as if he already knew what my plan was.
And I understood why he had no choice but to say those words.

⸢"We'll find out later, won't we?"⸥

Neither he nor I were wrong. Just that the Stories we compiled were
different, that's all.

Kwa-kwakwakwakwa!!

The tsunami wave of Stories unfolded right before my eyes. And the
blinding sparks of Probability spread out above this wave. And on top of
them all, the gazes from the Constellations were streaming in.

[Constellation, 'Queen of the Darkest Spring', is watching your Story.]

[Constellation, 'Father of the Rich Night', is watching your Story.]

[Constellation, 'Mass Production Maker', is watching your Story.]

…
This wasn't a gamble that I alone could realize. Me becoming an Outer God
King was merely the beginning of the final pages.

Yoo Joonghyuk fought hard, my companions held on bravely, and Han
Sooyoung gamely attracted the Constellations.

And the Constellations believing in us made their choices.

⸢The plan was a success.⸥

The 'Living Flame' that rises up from the east.

The 'Master of the Sunken Island', the calamity of the world in the west.

The 'Monarch of the Great Abyss', the ruler of the northern universe.

The 'King of the Silver Heart', the ruler of the interstellar space in the south.

And finally, the 'Great Plotter' that crawls from the place of nothing.

The scenario's volume began expanding rapidly with the gathering of all
five 'kings'. Historical-grade Constellations failed to deal with their
combined Statuses and began vomiting out Stories on their knees.

These kings had been excluded from the scenario until now. After escaping
from the reaches of the 'Hounds chasing after the Abyss' through the
abundant Probability, they had personally descended to the scenario.

The 'Secretive Plotter' was looking in my direction. I nodded my head in
return.

⸢And now, it was time for their stage to open.⸥

[U-uwuuuuh-!]

Several terror-stricken Constellations forgot their stations and began hastily
running away. The 'Monarch of the Great Abyss' grabbed the nape of one of
those Constellations. The 999th turn's Kim Namwoon began laughing.
【Now, now. You leaving so soon makes it a wee bit troublesome. It only
just began, after all.】

He must've recovered some of his energy through the Probability's
overflow. He glanced at me and muttered out.

【And you, don't get ahead of yourself. We didn't come here to help you
out.】

But then, the 'King of the Silver Heart' stood next to me and spoke up.

【We came to aid you.】

"I know. Thanks."

As expected, Lee Hyunsung remained a trustworthy person regardless of
the number of regressions he lived.

The 'Master of the Sunken Island', 999th turn's Lee Jihye, also made her
move. Narrative-grade Constellations hurriedly rushed in from both sides
and tried to block them somehow, but it was a waste of time.

[T-the island, it's, it's moving-!]

From the front of the island covered in verdant moss, silvery cannons shone
brightly. The biggest warship in the world-line, the perfected [Turtle
Dragon], spat out flames towards the rest of the world.

Kwa-aaaaaah!!

The overwhelming spectacle of an entire corner of the battlefield being
blowing away without a trace caused me, Han Sooyoung, and even Yoo
Joonghyuk to become utterly dazed.

And at the furthest front of the battlefield, two 'Kings' were facing off
against the Myth-grade Constellations.
⸢Two people who fought together a really long time ago were there.⸥

The 999th turn's Uriel was wrapped around in the [Hellfire]'s corona. And
the other was Yoo Joonghyuk who had survived the 1863 hellscapes to
eventually become an 'Outer God'.

⸢In that moment, Kim Dokja recalled a certain ancient battlefield.⸥

It was from Yoo Joonghyuk's 999th turn.

Yoo Joonghyuk and Uriel entrusted their backs to each other and fought
together during the great war against Constellations. Yoo Joonghyuk, blind
in both eyes and roaring out, and Uriel protecting him – it was one of the
scenes that I loved the most from the entirety of the 'Ways of Survival'. And
that scene was being re-enacted right before my eyes.

[Story, 'Battlefield of a Hero and Flame', is waking up from its prolonged
slumber!]

A Story that had disappeared a really long time ago was now connecting the
two kings.

【…I shall leave <Olympus> to you.】

The 999th turn's Uriel spread open her wings wide first. Just as she
unleashed her Status, Constellations pounced on her as if they were waiting
for that moment.

They were the top Constellations from <Papyrus> and <Vedas>, as well as
some other lower-ranked Constellations that fought against us in the
'Demon King Selection' – the 'Last Pharaoh', and the 'Bird that Eats the
Thunder'.

[Story, 'Flame of Annihilation', has begun its storytelling!]

The moment the 999th turn's Uriel wielded her sword, the first lines of the
Historical-grade Constellations rushing in at her turned into powder and
scattered away. Incarnations with pale complexions hurriedly turned around
to run, while Narrative-grade Constellations shouted out venomously.

[Stop that sword! Stop her from swinging it, no matter what!!]

Uriel's sword carved out a burning path, and the 'Secretive Plotter' ran on it.
It felt as if the history of the universe flowed within every step he took. His
steps seemed neither too fast nor too slow, yet no one dared to stop him.
[Story, 'Hell of Eternity', has begun its storytelling.]

The most dreadful Story in all of the world-lines began telling its story.

[Giant Story, 'Pilgrim of the Lonely Apocalypse', has begun its

storytelling.]

Everywhere his foot landed resounded with the cries of a destroyed world.
The original sin of the worlds stuck to him like a shadow and continued to
chase after him.

⸢No Constellation could stand in his way, and no Story could save him.⸥

Didn't matter whether one was an enemy or an ally, as long as one was a
Constellation, one couldn't help but get seduced by his story.

When I abruptly regained my wits from that vast sorrow stained in
wonderment, he was already grabbing at Poseidon's neck.

The latter managed to recover himself in time as well, and hurriedly shoved
the 'Secretive Plotter's' hand away all the while unleashing his own Status.

[Constellation, 'Spear that Draws the Borders in the Oceans', is greatly
enraged!]

<Olympus>'s Giant Story began making its move. Poseidon's [Traiana]
bared its fangs while enveloped in a powerful Story. This was the might of
a Myth-grade Constellation that anyone should quake in fear from.
However, I too was a Myth-grade now and I was perceiving his actions
differently.

⸢Poseidon is terrified.⸥

His spear uselessly cut through the air, and it was no longer as sharp as
before. It was a mistake unbecoming of an arrogant Constellation, and Zeus
next to him roared out in alarm.

However, it was too late by then.

Sliiiice!

Something cut Poseidon's torso down, and on his chest covered in blue
scales, the lengthy and black wound could be seen. From this wound, Giant
Stories began flooding out nonstop.

[Keo-heo-uhk…!]

Poseidon tried to press down on his chest while swinging his [Traiana] all
over the place.

The spear that drew the borders in the oceans – wherever his [Traiana] drew
a line, that place would become an ocean. However, such a thing didn't
happen this time. For the first time ever, the spear's blade that feared no one
couldn't find what to aim at and simply trembled helplessly.

⸢The place where his ocean couldn't reach.⸥

Both of Poseidon's eyes were soon dyed in the pitch-black abyss.

Most likely, he was watching the darkest Story known in this world right
now. The one about the outer space, where both the ground and the sky held
no meaning as effects of gravity didn't reach there. A complete devastation
with not one precious thing remaining after everything was destroyed.
And the master of that devastation was looking up at the <Olympus>'s
constellations.

【Doesn't matter which world-line it is, you don't seem to change at all.】

He didn't sound sad. If anything, he sounded relieved, actually.

Along with the cold metallic noise, the blades of the [Splitting the Sky
Sword] extended out to the night sky.

[Shut your mouth-!!]

Poseidon managed to beat back the fear and hurriedly swung his [Traiana]
once more, But in that exact moment, the [Splitting the Sky Sword] also
made its move, as well.

I remembered seeing Yoo Joonghyuk use a similar skill to that once before.
It was a skill to cut down the stars designed by a Transcendent who had
surpassed his own limit through incredible dedication and hard work.

However, something felt different. That attack, as if…

⸢As if, it was a sword technique created so that one man could face

off against the entire world.⸥ Breaking the Sky Swordsmanship.

Transcending the Inner Mysteries.

The Universe Slash.

Only then did it hit home. The power the 'Secretive Plotter' displayed back
then, during the battle of ⸢Journey to the West⸥, was only a portion of what
he could produce.

This sword trajectory was the most beautiful I had ever seen.

His blade caused the world to split apart.
Kwa-dudududu!

The sword strike cracked apart a nebula in its entirety and scattered stardust
away. And at the end of that magic-like rays of light was Poseidon. Along
with 'puh-ga-gak!' noise, his arm and leg got cut off simultaneously.

[Poseidon!!]

Zeus freaked out and shouted loudly.

Stories exploding forth from the 'Secretive Plotter' were swallowing up the
battlefield. The emptiness he felt while living through the scenarios was
expanding.

Tsu-chuchuchuchut!

Poseidon vomited out Stories and fell on his knees, prompting the
<Olympus>'s 12 gods to rush in. Ares and Hephaistus roared out and swung
their sword and hammer. Unfortunately for them, however, they were
smacked away by the [Splitting the Sky Sword]'s blade like a bunch of
children.

Zeus yelled out in pure anger.

[Oh, the great schemer! Do not get too full of yourself! You haven't even
witnessed a fragment of the myth that created <Olympus> yet!]

Even as he was saying that, Zeus's figure was beating a hasty retreat.

It was so obvious – the ark was waiting in the direction he was heading to.

[Father!]

The <Olympus>'s Constellations abandoned by him spewed out Stories
from their whole bodies as the Nameless Ones gnawed on them. Dionysus
carried a resentful expression as he roared in anger towards his father.
I quietly stared at those Constellations before speaking to Han Sooyoung
and Yoo Joonghyuk. "We need to stop Zeus."

Inside of the ark Zeus headed to was filled with sleeping Giant Stories not
just belonging to <Olympus> but countless other myths, as well. If we let
him be, this scenario would become disadvantageous for us once more.

We quickly began running with everything we had on the stage currently
covered in Stories from the dead stars and gods.

Han Sooyoung, meanwhile, muttered in a puzzled voice.

"By the way, that guy…"

After cutting Poseidon down, the 'Secretive Plotter' was just standing
around, dazedly looking up in a certain direction. I shifted my head towards
where he was staring at.

The reason why he didn't chase after Zeus was simple. From the beginning,
his purpose wasn't the annihilation of <Olympus> nor the destruction of the
ark itself.

No, what he stared at was a certain something located much, much further
away.

The ⸢Final Wall.⸥

Endless pages were flipping within his eyes as if he was utterly determined
to see what was beyond that thing this time.

[<Star Stream>'s Probability is experiencing a rapid change!]

Great Dokkaebis began shouting out at the unexpected distortion of the
Probability.

[Hang on! This, this is…!]

[Oh, the 'Oldest Dream', this…!]
[Due to the <Star Stream>'s rapid change, the scenario content has been
revised!]

[Clear condition for the applicable scenario will change depending on the
camp you have chosen to side with.]

I confirmed the revised scenario detail.


  <Main Scenario #99 - ■■■>


For the first time ever, the title of the main scenario was gone.

A scenario that had never happened before.

A scenario that not even the Great Dokkaebis heard of had begun.


  Type: Main

  Difficulty: ???

  Clear condition: Please destroy the ark and put a stop to Great
  Dokkaebis' plan.


I heard the freaked-out voices of the Great Dokkaebis next. With this, they
were about to pay the price for giving up on being the 'storytellers' to
become characters in this world.

Also, the facade surrounding us began changing, as well. As if, the world
had finally permitted our existence.

"It's you…!"
The clearly-astonished Asuka Ren was looking at me. It seemed that even
she could now see my true appearance, at least faintly.

As the sparks wildly danced about, the creatures of fear and disgust, 'Outer
Gods' were revealing their true appearances. They were no longer the
beings outside of the scenario.

[The absolute majority of the Constellations are watching your Story.]

The scenario we had created was now being officially birthed into this
world.

['Oldest Dream' is now looking at your existence.]

Quite likely, the 'Secretive Plotter' also heard these messages. More
specifically, the messages popping up before my eyes.


  Reward: Final Wall
           Chapter 495: Ep. 94 - Beginning of the end, III


"…Hyung, it says that the reward is the 'Final Wall'."

Lee Gilyoung catching up to us spoke in a puzzled voice. However, I too
had no idea about this.

The reward was the [Final Wall]…?

I wasn't sure of what that vague description could mean – was us reaching
the Final Wall the reward itself, or after the scenario ended, we'd be given
the ownership of the wall?

Besides, could someone even claim ownership of the concept of the Wall in
the first place?

Nothing was certain at the current juncture. But, it was a certainty that we'd
reach the truth of this world when this scenario comes to an end.

【Please, go ahead.】
Under the 999th turn's Lee Hyunsung's protection, the companions ran
forward. As for the Constellations trying to chase us down, the 'Secretive
Plotter' and the other Outer Gods blocked them.

The ark was right before us. Destroying it would take us to the end of all
scenarios.

[Stop them-!!]

Starlight descended from the night sky once more. It was shocking to see
that there were so many stars left still. It was also hard to tell just where
these Constellations had been hiding all this time.

[It's the Outer God King! Kill him!]

Constellations pointed their weapons at me and jumped in. Even though
they lived like puppets of large Nebulas and never truly cleared scenarios
until now, they still managed to acquire the qualifications to enter the 'Final
Scenario'.

Surprisingly enough, some of them were either former or the current
subscribers of my channel. Ones that donated something every now and
then to urge me on – ones that desired powerful sources of cider, and asked
me for more stimulating plot development.

And now, they were standing against me.

[Kill him!]

A few of my companions seemed to be surprised by their hostility towards
us.

Han Sooyoung couldn't hold it back in and opened her mouth. "You guys
still hadn't exited yet?"

What popped up in my head just then was the words the 'Mandala's
Guardian' said to me back in the Isle of Reincarnators.
⸢No matter how shoddy a story is, an existence hearing and watching it for a
long time will grow to love it.⸥
Back then, I didn't understand what he meant by that. I only thought that the
'Mandala's Guardian' saw the tragedy of the scenario called [Great War of
Saints and Demons] in such a light, that's all.

However, after I mulled over it some more, I realized that that statement
probably didn't only apply to the [Great War].

The Constellations originating from Japan and fought against us during
[Peace Land] were incarnating before our eyes one by one. I even saw the
'Eight Pieces of Fire' Kagu-tsuchi and 'Controller of High and Low tides',
the Water Dragon Ryujin.

The one confronting them among our companions was the protector of the
skies.

[Incarnation, 'Lee Jihye', is unleashing her Status!]

[Constellation, 'Maritime War God', is unleashing his Status!]

Along with the sensation of a boundless ocean spreading out, the
surrounding stage was submerged in abundant Status. The opponents may
be Narrative-grade Constellations, but the current Lee Jihye would never be
pushed around by them.

However, she didn't fire away and took a look in my direction instead.

"Ahjussi."

I too knew why she was hesitating like this.

[Go! If you can't be of any use, then go and blow yourselves up!]

Constellations were pushing the backs of the Incarnations forward. These
Incarnations from the Japanese side, their eyes blank, staggered towards us.
Just before we could unsheathe our weapons, someone cried out from a
nearby location.

"Everyone, please wake up! Please, you must take a good look at who
you're trying to fight against!"

That was a voice I definitely recognised.

"Izumi is dead, and Hiroshi also died. Just how many more must die before
we all wake up? Have you all forgotten the tragedy back in the [Peace
Land]?"

It was Asuka Ren.

[Incarnation, 'Asuka Ren', has become the 'Enemy of the Story'.]

Surprisingly enough, she had already chosen to side with us.

[Incarnation, 'Asuka Ren's', attribute, 'Mangaka' is activating!]

Her sword moved like a pen.

The moment her attribute came to life, Stories of not just me but the
surrounding 'Nameless Ones' began shifting. Our broken Stories, the
scattered phrases, were being woven into a single piece of footage.

When I thought about it, it wasn't just Han Sooyoung who possessed
'author'-type attributes. Although different in some ways, Asuka Ren's
attribute was also rather similar in other ways to hers.

"Please, stop this. You know who these people are. You yearned to be more
like these people, didn't you?"

⸢That was the beginning.⸥

Incarnations half-controlled by their sponsors were about to attack us, but
then, began dropping their weapons one by one. With terror-stricken
expressions, they either plopped down on the ground or cried out in sorrow.
"Can't… do this… I, I can't do this anymore…"

Incarnations knelt down and muttered out while holding their heads.
Meanwhile, the Constellations were exposed to danger in an instant after
their puppets stopped listening to their commands. They hurriedly shouted
out.

[G-get up! Hurry!]

Incarnations understood the pain of fellow Incarnations very well. Meaning,
they were different from the Constellations that fell into the dime-a-dozen
villainous roles after carrying out the scenarios for far too long.

"Jihye-yah."

Even before I could finish, the turtle ship fired its cannons.

Kwa-aaaaaah!

The group of the Constellations were swept away as the percussion noises
resounded out. Some managed to endure, though, and soon collided with
my companions.

[Uwaaaah!!]

A faint light leaked out from the hull of the ark.

We couldn't afford to let more Myth-grade Constellations wake up from
their slumber within the vessel.

Fortunately, our advancing speed was not slow at all. Yoo Joonghyuk's
[Breaking the Sky Swordsmanship] and Han Sooyoung's [Black Flame]
continued to assist me from the side and we made good headway.

If there was one thing tugging at my mind, it'd be the Probability.

Tsu-chuchuchu…
The Probability created out of the Coins donated by the Constellations…

I looked up to find Biyoo controlling the channel with a pained grimace on
her face. It hadn't been that long since she hatched as a Dokkaebi, so it was
taking a lot out of her to exchange that many Coins into Probability. Stories
began dripping out from her lips now.

"We're almost there!"

The unexpected event happened at the same time as Han Sooyoung's voice
resounded out.

[The Bureau is exercising the authority to restrict the channel BY-9158!]

Tsu-chuchuchuchut!

At that moment, my heart grew cold.

Originally, individual channels belonged to each Dokkaebi. However, the
system called [channel] was a power founded upon the 'Giant Story' in the
Bureau's possession.

[The Bureau is restricting the Coin donations to the channel BY-9158!]

Suddenly, my movements became sluggish. It was the same for my
companions. The tailwind pushing us from the back was swiftly changing
into the headwind, instead.

In the distance, I spotted the ten Great Dokkaebis raising their hands
together at the heavens.

"Those stinking sons of bitches…!"

It seemed that Han Sooyoung had realized what was going on here.

[Baaaaaaht!]
Biyoo let out a painful cry as if she got electrocuted and fell from the sky.
Yoo Sangah dashed out way before I could and carefully caught the small
falling figure.

[Constellation, 'Father of the Rich Night', is protesting against the cowardly
action of the Bureau, and…!]

[Constellation, 'Queen of the Darkest Spring', is greatly enraged by the
unfair treatment from the Bureau, and…!]

[Constellation, 'Demon-like Judge of Fire', is shouting out "Those ■tty
Dokkaebi sons of bit■s should…!!"]

…

Our channel was breaking down.

The Great Dokkaebi Garang spoke up. [Your Story cannot be permitted.
We simply cannot present such a Story to the 'Oldest Dream'.]

I failed to understand it. They had already become a part of the scenario, so
they would be met with an incredible storm of aftermath simply by trying to
exercise the Bureau's Giant Story.

[Horong, Noksu, we shall remember your sacrifices.]

Two Great Dokkaebis were being extinguished in the middle of the sky.
Debris of Story were falling off from Garang's figure, as well.

I felt a chill run down my whole body. Only now did I realize how
determined those damnable Great Dokkaebis were.

[<Star Stream>'s Probability is going through another rapid change!]

The number of 'Nameless Ones' flooding the surroundings rapidly declined.
Their faces, back to their original selves through the grace of the
Probability, were reverting back to the heads of the monsters once more.
【…Hounds are coming.】

Along with the 'Secretive Plotter's' declaration, all the kings from the 999th
turns gathered in the center. Those needing to exhaust an inordinate amount
of Probability would invariably suffer greatly from the suspension of the
donation.

The 'hounds chasing after the abyss' appeared amidst the incoming storm of
aftermath and began biting into the kings' legs and arms.

【Hey, it freaking hurts, you sons of bitches!】

The 999th turn's Kim Namwoon roared out.

Meanwhile, Yoo Joonghyuk cut down the Constellations rushing in at us
and shouted out. "Kim Dokja!"

I looked up to the sky. The atmosphere up there was suspicious. This
change wasn't as simple as a Myth-grade Constellation controlling the
weather. Something incredibly horrific that I had never experienced before
was about to unfold here.

[Onsae, Heoche. Thank you for all your hard work until now.]

Two more Great Dokkaebis were being extinguished now.

⸢Great Dokkaebis were trying to end their story in this place.⸥

Hair rose up on my arms. I had never felt fear on this level during my
time carrying out the scenario. [Oh, the 'Oldest Dream'!]

The sky was opening up. I took a closer look before realizing that it actually
wasn't the sky, but the wall – the [Final Wall] that surrounded the entire
universe.

And now, something was crossing over the gap in the Wall resembling a
torn page.
⸢In that moment, Kim Dokja intuitively foresaw the destruction of this
world.⸥

My vocabulary was not good enough to adequately describe what that was.
Just what was that?

It was like seeing a shoddy doodling drawn by a child and his pencil. That
thing was at once a gigantic sword, maybe a spear, or maybe even a missile.

What I knew for certain, though, was that an unknown something was
falling in this direction.

Tsu-chuchuchuchu!

For the briefest moment there, I thought I saw something like someone's
'hand' within the gap where that formless mass fell out from.

[Constellation, 'Demon-like Judge of Fire', is…!]

[Constellation, 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon', is…!]

And now, only one thing was for certain – getting hit by that would kill us
all.

⸢Kim Dokja unleashed all of his Status.⸥

Every 'Giant Story' in my possession began their storytelling
simultaneously. I quickly looked back at my companions.

"Everyone, we…!"

And right next second, my vision was dyed in pure white as a massive
explosion of Probability blew up before our eyes.
Tsu-chuchuchuchut!

Bihyung quietly stared at the Great Dokkaebis melting into the scenario one
by one.

Storytellers were becoming a part of the last scenario. As he stood there
watching, both big and small lower-ranked Dokkaebis quickly rushed
around him.

[Bihyung-nim! Just what is the meaning of…?]

The Bureau that had been maintaining a neutral stance until now began
changing the entire aspect of the scenario through force.

As a consequence, the topography of the Bureau was changing. The
storages that contained Stories all broke down at the same time, and those
infamous Constellations currently under arrest by the Bureau's security
force were being freed as well.

Bihyung stared at a certain Constellation right in the middle of this chaotic
scene.

⸢The fool who never thought of himself as the protagonist.⸥

It had been the same story from the moment they first met. Even with a
physical stat totalling less than 10, this guy didn't cower against a Dokkaebi
like him. This guy, he often smiled to imply that he had plenty of leeway,
and often carelessly got himself killed, too.

⸢The fool who knew the next part of the Story even better than himself, the
storyteller.⸥
Thanks to this guy's Story, Bihyung got to grow his channel faster than
anyone, and got to enjoy favourable assessments every time ranking
evaluation came around.

⸢His Story was now facing an end.⸥
Kwa-kwakwakwakwa!

Having become a Great Dokkaebi, Bihyung could now tell what that
heavensplitting thing was. That thing had come from beyond the 'Wall'.
That was

the fragment of immeasurable delusion flying in from beyond the Wall that
divided this world – the Wall that was both the First and the Final.

The ark could be seen now getting ready to soar. It seemed that the
remaining Great Dokkaebis were planning to board the ark and escape from
here.

Meanwhile, this stage would be annihilated with the descent of that
fragment.

⸢In that moment, Dokkaebi Bihyung made up his mind.⸥

The remaining Great Dokkaebis, gathered in one place to perform the
ceremony, realized Bihyung's intention and cried out. The first one to grab
him was Baram.

[Bihyung! What do you think you're doing?!]

Bihyung didn't reply and stared at the ground below. The ones he'd been
watching until now were down there.

Incarnations he sent his clone to speak with. And now, they were in the
same place as he was. Bihyung looked at his own hands. His palms that
used to be so small back then, were now as big as a grown adult male's.

[I've been observing that Story for a very long time.]

Their first encounter wasn't all that positive; one of them was the culprit
selling the tragedies called the scenarios, while the other had no choice but
to carry those scenarios out while risking his life.

That was why Bihyung had to make a move now.
He had to do this one thing, since he had opened this tragic stage with his
own two hands. This action had to be done if he wanted to remain as the
'storyteller' right until the end.

[Baram. You told me that there will come a time for every Dokkaebi to
choose their own 'One Single Story'.]

[You must listen to me, Bihyung! You're wrong this time! That Story isn't
right! That Story, it's…]

Bihyung let go of Baram's hands and smiled.

He knew of a guy who always smirked just before dying. He couldn't
understand it before, but now he thought he could figure it out. That guy
must've been feeling this way, too.

[It's likely that I have grown to love that story.]

Bihyung then unleashed his own Status towards the Bureau's Great
Dokkaebis.

Puh-gur-guhk!

The horn of Garang, working as the representative of the Great Dokkaebis
and abusing the Bureau's powers of interference, broke off.

The Probability controlled by the Bureau scattered away in an instant and a
ripple effect suddenly occurred.

That storm of aftermaths came back to Bihyung in full. He turned around to
leave while vomiting out his Story that was changed to a pitch-black colour.

[Bihyung!! You dare to…!!]

More specifically, he stood in the way of the delusion's fragment falling
towards the ground.
All the Stories he had recorded until now began crying. Every Constellation
watching this storyteller added their own Probability to his action.

Bihyung began thinking as horrifying pain of the aftermath's storm tore into
his body. The protagonist of the Story he had been reading wouldn't
welcome his actions at all. Because that dude wanted to save everyone's
life.

Even then, there was a certain rule that you couldn't go against.

⸢There is no story where no one was sacrificed.⸥

To protect the story, to guard the Probability, and to become the 'One
Single Story' reaching the ⸢Final Wall⸥, this action had to be performed.

⸢Dokkaebi Bihyung had finally decided on his full stop.⸥

The 'Pah-su-sut' noise of something being pierced could be heard next.

He looked back and for a second there, he thought he saw Kim Dokja's
face.

[Your ■■ is 'sacrifice'.]
           Chapter 496: Ep. 94 - Beginning of the end, IV


The moment that dark, sinister irregular mass exploded in the sky, I
grabbed the kids nearby and went down flat on the ground. Lee Hyunsung
spread out his steel wall, and the rough screeching metallic noises coming
from above assaulted our ears.

How long passed by like that? Both the sounds and sensation of touch all
disappeared.

[Transmission has been completed.]

And then, a puzzling message entered my head.

Muscles in my entire body ached as if I had been beaten up. Lee
Hyunsung's defensive barrier covering the sky was also gone, too.

…What on earth happened here?

I couldn't properly understand the current situation.
Scanning my vicinity revealed the fact that I was all alone. Not the kids I
had been shielding, Lee Hyunsung and Jung Heewon enveloping us, even
Yoo Joonghyuk leaping into the air to wield his sword – none of them
could be seen.

What I could see, though, was a wide-open plain. I looked behind to
discover a dense forest with trees reaching high into the heavens, and
opposite it, a land filled with stinking sulphur.

⸢Great Dokkaebis exercised the Bureau's powers and interfered with the
scenario.⸥
I could clearly remember that much. After that, the Bureau began restricting
our Coin donations, and realizing that that wasn't enough, they even
summoned a strange missile-like thing, too.

And then, after that…

⸢[Ah, ah. Can you hear me now? Well, deary me. I ended up working extra
because the Korean patch wasn't installed yet.]⸥
I felt this chilling sensation and quickly took a look around. A Story could
be heard coming from somewhere. And it was something I was intimately
familiar with.

⸢[This is not a film shoot.]⸥

Something else popped up in the air right after that. It was a small shadow
covering the sky the moment that dark, sinister summoned thing exploded.

I hurriedly scanned my surroundings.

⸢[This isn't a dream, it's not a novel, nor is it 'reality' that you people used to
know. You get it now? So everyone, shut your mouths and listen to me.]⸥
Definitely nearby. He was somewhere nearby, for sure.
Just how long did I wander around this plain for?

Eventually, I spotted him collapsed on the field of reeds.

"Bihyung."

I carefully picked him up. He used to be as big as a grown adult male after
becoming a Great Dokkaebi, but now, he had shrunken back down to the
size of a baby.

Just like on the first day that I met him.

"Bihyung!"

The starting point of all my tragedies.

If I hadn't met this guy, I'd have probably remained as a regular contracted
worker for Mino Soft even now.

⸢[Hold on. Are you saying that you want to sign the <Stream Contract>
with me??]⸥
If I hadn't signed the damn contract with this guy, I'd not have been able to
come this far.

Crumbs of Story fell from Bihyung's body. Their falling speed got
progressively faster and faster. ⸢"Just what have you contributed to the
<Kim Dokja's Company>'s Story? Why are you shamelessly involving
yourselves in their Coin compensations?"⸥

⸢"Aren't you fed up with such a story by now? For how long are you going
to seek out Stories that conform only to the Bureau's standards?"⸥
Bihyung's Stories that I didn't know of were crumbling away.

I shook him again, trying to wake him up. I even resorted to smacking him
in his cheeks, too. That prompted a frail voice to enter my ears.
"…That hurts. I'm beginning to pity Bawul you smacked around back

then." Bihyung opened his eyes and smiled bitterly.

He spoke not in the true voice, but in a trembling, faltering regular voice. It
was Dokkaebi Bihyung's real voice, heard for the first time after such a
long while.

A voice that I hated.

This bastard was responsible for turning people into Incarnations and
spreading scenarios everywhere, changing this world into a kingdom of
voyeurism. And that was precisely why I had to ask him.

"Why did you save me?"

The reason why Bihyung ended up in this state was because he touched the
Probability he shouldn't have.

Just like those Great Dokkaebis being extinguished after forcibly interfering
with the scenario, Bihyung too ended up in this miserable state by jumping
headlong into the aftermath's storm he couldn't handle.

⸢Bihyung would die in this place.⸥

Stories I possessed began trembling.

This wasn't my plan. This wasn't the Story I longed for.

['The Fourth Wall' is violently shaking!]

Instead of a reply, Bihyung vomited out a mouthful of pitch-black Story.
His body was getting smaller and smaller.

"…I'd like to sit up for a minute."

I helped Bihyung up.
The flights of stars could be seen in the cold night sky. Stars that went
along this way and that according to the flow of the scenario. The flow of
the distant stream of stars…

Bihyung was staring at the ⸢Star Stream⸥.

"I've transferred all of your companions. And the majority of the
Constellations, as well as the Incarnations near you, should've survived as
well. This place is safe from the external shocks."

"You…"

"You'll soon figure out the details yourself. You're a smart cookie, after
all."

Several stars were falling in the sky. While I searched for words to say, the
number of falling stars gradually increased.

Stars were dying in the distant 'context of constellations'.

Bihyung should have lived his life while dreaming the dreams of those
stars.

"Kim Dokja. You and I aren't companions."

He must've enjoyed the stars' Stories, and must've watched their
tragicomedies together. He must've witnessed the deaths of countless stars.
And, on one hand…

"You are an Incarnation of the scenario, and I'm just a storyteller."

…He must've thought that those deaths looked quite beautiful.

It was true that I hated Bihyung. I tried so hard to stoke the flames of that
emotion.

[Story, 'King of a Kingless World', is looking at its storyteller.]
[Story, 'One Who Opposes the Miracle', grieves for its storyteller.]

[Story, 'One Who Hunted the King of Disasters', mourns for its storyteller.]
My Stories scattered like fading screams and spoke to Bihyung.

He chuckled. With a proud face, no less.

"I actually wanted to witness your Story till its end, though."

Beyond the skies he was looking at, was the ⸢Final Wall⸥. The dream
Bihyung had been dreaming. The place where the king of all scenarios, the
'Dokkaebi King', resided.

I wanted to say something. I wanted to ask if he really was giving up here.
Ask him if he had forgotten about the promise we made back then.

⸢"Dokkaebi Bihyung, sign the contract with me. If you do, I shall make you
the king of all Dokkaebis.⸥
I still hadn't fulfilled that promise yet.

⸢He was the first reader of the Story Kim Dokja had compiled.⸥

My hands grew lighter. I slowly lowered my head, but Bihyung wasn't there
anymore. As befitting a damn storyteller, he made sure to leave behind his
story even as he died.

I staggered back up to my feet.

⸢He wanted to create a Story where no one had to be sacrificed.⸥

[Your great epic has encountered an opportunity to change!!]

Blood seeped out from my tightly clenched fists. All of my Stories were
wailing out. They screamed towards <Star Stream> and at the [Final Wall].

⸢This story hasn't ended yet, Kim Dokja.⸥
That was the dead Bihyung's Story talking. The Story he left behind
moments before his death circled around me and was exhausting its own
paragraphs.

Bihyung was dead, yet the Story he left behind was still alive.

I somehow managed to get a grip on myself. Bihyung was right; the end I
wanted to see had only just begun. I needed to find out where he had sent
me, and where my companions had ended up in. And then… Tsu-
chuchuchut…!

The Probability's sparks were raining down in the middle of skies above the
vast plains. And the scenes of the outside faintly revealed themselves
beyond the storm of sparks.

The devastated stage of the final pages, the battlefield I was in only a few
moments ago, was now filled to the brim with corpses of unmoving
Constellations and Incarnations.

The moment I saw that, I figured out where I was.

[Welcome to the 'Final Ark'.]

This was inside of the 'ship' I was supposed to destroy.

[The 'Final Ark' is currently in the middle of the takeoff procedure.]

[Final scenario has been revised!]
  <Main Scenario #99 - ■■■■>

  Type: Main

  Difficulty: ???

  Clear condition: Destroy the Story Core that powers the ark, and stop
  the world-line migration plan of the Great Dokkaebis and Myth-grade
  Constellations.

  Time limit: 24 hours


  Reward: Final Wall

  Failure: Destruction of the world-line.


…So, that's how it was.

If this was indeed inside the ship called 'Final Ark', then it made sense to
see such a world hiding within the craft.

This place I was standing in, it was the land of the beginning where
countless myths were born. The myths that were currently asleep inside this
very ark.

Ku-gugugugu…

Rough vibration could be felt coming from the opposite side of this land.
Something was approaching here.

⸢Run, Kim Dokja.⸥

The existences that recovered their original powers while carrying their
worldviews on their backs – the Myth-grade Constellations were flooding
in this way.
⸢The ark is a type of a 'Giant Story weapon'. In order to completely wreck
the ark, you must destroy the Story core deep inside it somewhere.⸥
I read the Story Bihyung had left behind while running within the interior
of the ark.

[You have currently infiltrated the residential cabin D-21.]

[The influence of another myth is far too strong within the applicable area.]
[Your Nebula's members can't be contacted currently.]

Maybe the abnormally higher influence of another Giant Story was to
blame, because I couldn't get in touch with my companions. Fortunately
enough, though, one other person from my group had been transferred into
the same cabin as me.

[The influence of the same Nebula can be felt strongly!]

"Kim Dokja!"

Just before I reached out and said something, Han Sooyoung shouted out
first.

"Shut up and run! Don't come this way!!"

The thicket behind her was cleanly sliced through right then. Something
was chasing after her. She hurriedly yanked an item out from her inner
pocket and threw that thing behind her – which was a smoke grenade.

['Mass-production SSS-grade smoke grenade' is activating its effects!]

[For next 20 seconds, the surrounding field of vision will be screened off!]
While the Constellations falling into confusion raised a noisy ruckus, we
hurriedly escaped from the thickets. Han Sooyoung seemed to have finished
analysing the situation by now, too.

"Did that guy die?"

I didn't reply.

The heavily-panting Han Sooyoung spat on the ground.

"That stinking Dokkaebi bastard. How could he even call this his final
parting gift?"

Indeed, could anyone even call this a gift at all?

I looked up at the ark's ceiling. There should be countless owners of 'Giant
Stories' besides us still sleeping inside this ship.

"Kim Dokja."

"According to Bihyung's Story, the Story core is at the center of the ark. We
should be near its front section."

The moment I finished saying that, the true voices of Constellations rang
out from the rising smoke screen.

[After them!!]

[They are still nearby! We can't head to the next world-line with them!]

Han Sooyoung used the [Midday Tryst] to speak to me.

– Should we just kill them all?

That was an option, sure. However, the current battlefield wasn't ideal. This
part of the cabin was actually another Nebula's worldview. Meaning, their
own ⸢Stage Transformation⸥ was active in this location.
[The residential cabin D-21 is the location of the Universe Tree Yggdrasil's
roots.]

Han Sooyoung frowned deeply.

– Son of a gun. Why did it have to be <Asgard>?

[Constellation, 'God of Harp and Horn', is performing the requiem of the
apocalypse.]

[Constellation, 'One who Lost His Arm to the Wolf of Apocalypse', is
searching for his disappeared arm.]

[Constellation, 'Thursday's Thunder', is overly emphasizing his mightiness.]
Constellations were flying around in the air searching for us. Most of them
were Narrative-grade, but…

– …Since when was Thor that powerful?

The 'Thursday's Thunder' condensed lightning on Mjolnir and stared at the
sky, his eyes now in the shade of eerie blue. Thor was a Narrative-grade
Constellation. On this stage, however, he could unleash Status rivalling that
of Zeus.

I addressed Han Sooyoung.

– We need to find a stage that's advantageous to us.

– Will there be such a thing in this place, though?

Unlike them, <Kim Dokja's Company> didn't really have anything in
particular to call its worldview.

– There is one.

Even then, there should be one stage here where we could fight on equal
footing. If my thoughts were correct, that was. If it was that place, then all
of our other companions should also be able to exercise their full power,
too.
The problem was with how to get there.

[Story, 'Pebble and I', has begun its storytelling!]

Of course, there was that method, too. Han Sooyoung's eyes grew wider.

[Story, 'Pebble and I', is telling the story of 'We're just pebbles'!]

– What the heck is this?

I grasped her wrist and cautiously stepped in front of the Constellations like
small pebbles rolling on the ground. As expected, they couldn't locate us at
all.

[Constellation, 'Goddess of Love and Cats', is forming a depressed
expression.]

[Constellation, 'Guardian of the Great Horn Bridge', is searching for
someone.]

Han Sooyoung saw all these Constellations failing to find us even though
we were walking right past them, and her jaw dropped nearly to the floor.

– This is madness. What kinda dogshit cheat is this?

Sure, it was a cheat, alright. At a bare minimum, you wouldn't spot a
'pebble' unless you actually acknowledged the fact that there were some of
them lying on the ground.

[A Constellation that likes to change gender is giggling away.]

It was then, a bad premonition entered my head. Even Han Sooyoung was
making a similar expression to mine.

However, we were almost there. Even if Loki had discovered our
existences, the main forces of <Asgard> were far away now, so…

"Are you thinking of using that same method to escape this time?"
The Story ⸢Pebble and I⸥ didn't work on those who had detected the actual
form of the Story itself. And unfortunately for us, I had used this Story on a
certain someone once before.

I slowly turned around to find an eye swirling in crimson light staring at us,
                Chapter 497: Ep. 95 - Gaecheon/開天, I


[Currently, BY-9158's picture transmission is in a temporary suspended
state.]

Biyoo must've done that voluntarily. It might be because of Bihyung's
death, or maybe there was a problem trying to transmit from within the ark
itself. Whatever the case might have been, it was a good thing for us.

It'd been so much nicer if only the person before our eyes wasn't there,
though.

"Anna Croft."

I stared at the prophet's blonde hair fluttering in the wind. I also sensed
additional presences within the dense forest. They probably were the squad
under her direct supervision, the 'Zarathustra'.

– Why isn't this pebble or rock or whatever not working on her?

I didn't reply to Han Sooyoung. Didn't have enough time now to explain
everything that happened in the 'Isle of Reincarnators', anyhow.
Rather than patiently wait for my answer, though, Han Sooyoung simply
gripped my wrist hard. And then, she pointed at Anna Croft with her free
hand. Vicious licks of [Black Flame] danced on the tip of her pointing
finger.

"Move outta way or die."

Their gazes collided in the air.

Eerie, bluish ghostly aura permeated within Han Sooyoung's irises as she
activated [Predictive Plagiarism]. At the same time, the eyes of Anna Croft,
wielder of [Great Demon's Eye], also swirled in a crimson aura. Faint
sparks danced in the air as the gazes of these two capable of reading the
future collided.

The latter maintained this tense stand-off for a bit before opening her
mouth. "Kim Dokja, do you want to escape from this floor?"

Han Sooyoung's complexion changed colours and she growled unhappily.
"Hey, you. You ignoring me now?"

"I can help you."

"Weren't you trying your hardest to kill us not too long ago?"

As Han Sooyoung's words came to an end, I sensed the movements of the
Constellations in the surroundings. I even noticed a few that began
destroying the terrain indiscriminately in order to locate us.

It would be hard to buy more time here.

"I didn't have a choice. If we sided with you back then, we'd all have been
wiped away."

"And the current situation is different how?"
"Are you really going to waste your time this way? I'm pretty sure it's
you people feeling the urgency, not me." "Do we have a reason to trust
you?"

"Are you the type to trust someone even with a good enough reason?"

In any other circumstances, I'd have gladly accepted her help. However,
Anna Croft was someone who signed a direct contract with the whole
Nebula.

"You're the Nebula <Asgard>'s Incarnation."

[Nebula, <Asgard>'s Giant Stories are waking up from their ancient
slumber!]

And the current floor just so happened to be the cabin where <Asgard>'s
Constellations resided.

Anna Croft readily admitted to that and nodded her head. "True. I'm their
Incarnation. In that case, don't you find this even more strange? I'm right
here, looking at you both, yet why haven't they rushed here yet?"

I too had been keeping an eye on the Constellations loitering around our
vicinity. It looked as if they couldn't even hear our conversation. Quite
likely, she resorted to some kind of an unknown method to block their
gazes somehow.

"What are you scheming?"

I stared into Anna Croft's deep, mysterious eyes.

[Exclusive skill, 'Reading Comprehension', is activating!]

⸢More than anyone out there, the Incarnation Anna Croft places importance
in realistic causes.⸥
In a certain sense, this world's most righteous person could be none other
than Anna Croft. If Yoo Joonghyuk's cause was built upon rage and hatred,
then Anna Croft's was built upon the foundation of righteousness.

The survival of the absolute majority.

Her aim was to safely preserve the city of her birth, Las Vegas, the United
States of America, and on top of that, Earth itself during the hell of
scenarios.

⸢However, America was destroyed during this world-line.⸥

Her home vanished on the same day that the great apocalypse began. All
that remained were the small number of 'Zarathustras' following after her.
Even then, her complexion wasn't as gloomy. No, her expression seemed to
be filled with a certain fervour, instead. It was an expression of a person
getting nearer to the world she wanted to see.

While feeling the gentle vibration spreading within the entirety of the ship,
I opened my mouth. "You're thinking of taking over this ark, aren't you."

Right then, Han Sooyoung next to me gasped out as if she had reached the
same conclusion as me.

Anna Croft grinned refreshingly. "How wonderful it is that you're so quick
on the uptake."

"It won't be easy to drive out the Constellations and take over the ark."

"However, it is the last chance given to humanity."

Her plan was quite clear.

The 'Final Ark' was a Giant Story weapon designed to transport Story seeds
to another world-line. If she managed to defeat the Constellations and
acquire the controlling authority of this ark, then she should be able to
transport humanity to a brand new world-line.
And everything would begin anew in that place.

"Not one Constellation can be left alive. Even if that includes you."

While listening to her, I recalled an ancient text from the 'Ways of
Survival'.

⸢Anna Croft's ■■ is 'Perfect Night'.⸥

A world of darkness where not one starlight shined – Anna Croft wished for
humanity to live freely again under that darkness. If it was the world she
dreamed of, then my companions should be able to survive as well. I felt
slightly lonely as I opened my mouth again.

"In that case, we'll be temporary allies. We'll work together until we reach
the ark's core."

"Until then, I shall lend you the power of my [Precognition]."

Han Sooyoung next to me sent a message in my direction.

– I've been checking her through Lie Detection, and she hasn't been lying.
Doesn't look like she's been using Pokerface, either.

I nodded my head. "Alright. Let's work together."




While going through the Story Bihyung had left behind, I read the
surrounding topography.

⸢The exit at the outside of the forested area is towards the branch reaching
out to the heavens.⸥
One thing I realized while following after Anna Croft was that our current
area was not a plain, but a 'floor' above a certain tree.
– Gotta admit, their worldview setting is pretty slick.

Han Sooyoung muttered out, evidently impressed by the sight.

Seeing such a detailed recreation of <Asgard>'s worldview, I began to fully
realize just how long they had been preparing this Final Ark.

This shouldn't be the whole Universe Tree Yggdrasil. It was probably a
mock-up. Even then, this tree was more than wide and expansive enough
already. Most likely, the <Asgard>'s Constellations would live on while
enjoying the vested rights founded upon this Story in the next world-line.

Anna Croft quietly stared at such Constellations, before shifting her head
away and focused on the way ahead instead. Han Sooyoung observed her
and spoke to me.

– By the way, will she be alright? The price of betraying a Nebula should
be huge, though?

Before I could answer, though, Anna Croft opened her mouth first.
"My situation is not something you should be concerned about."
"…What the hell. You can even eavesdrop on this?

"I only guessed that you were using Midday Tryst since you two haven't
said anything for a while."

"Sounds like you have a trusty backer or something?"

Han Sooyoung's words caused Anna Croft's expression to harden for the
first time. "What do you mean?"

"I was wondering if it's logically possible for a measly little Incarnation to
block off the gazes from an entire 'Nebula', that's all."

Han Sooyoung's right; no Incarnation could've pulled that off, regardless of
who you were.
I quietly glared at the back of Anna Croft's head.

[Exclusive skill, 'Reading Comprehension's', concentration level is rising up
even higher!]

I did have my suspicions. The aura of chaos gently crumbled away behind
her. And beyond that, I thought I glimpsed a pair of crimson eyes not too
dissimilar to Anna Croft's.

From the get-go, there were only two existences in this world capable of
interfering with the channels Constellations watched.

Ku-gugugugu!

It was right then that lightning suddenly went off in the air. The ground
split apart and the surrounding atmosphere began quaking ominously. The
sounds of incoming storm could be heard next.

[Constellation, 'One-eyed Father', is slowly blinking its remaining eye.]

Tsu-chuchuchut!

Anna Croft's complexion paled instantly.

Even the god of creation 'Ra' we fought back in the 98th scenario didn't
possess might of this calibre. As for the Status, it easily exceeded Thor's we
encountered earlier by a huge margin.

This worldview's most powerful being had just woken up from his slumber,
in other words.

"…Odin."

We began running.

Even if <Kim Dokja's Company> had grown stronger, it was an act of utter
stupidity to fight the Myth-grade Constellation Odin in <Asgard>'s turf.
[Constellation, 'One-eyed Father', is now looking at his world.]
A terrifying gaze was sweeping across the entire world. And not too long
after that, I felt something was looking at us.

"It's this way! Hurry!"

There was a tree branch leading up to higher floors of Yggdrasil in the
place Anna Croft was pointing at. We quickly ran on that branch and almost
at the same time, the ground beneath our feet lost strength and began
collapsing. "Faster!"

I squeezed out every ounce of my energy and ran, and also activated the
wind, as well.

[Exclusive skill, 'Way of the Wind Lv.???', is activating!]

All the Giant Stories I've collected so far strengthened the Way of the Wind
even more and it added greater momentum to our travelling speed. I wanted
to activate [Demon King Transformation] as well and spread out my wings
if it was possible, but one of the wings was wounded just before the
transmission and I couldn't do that.

Du-dududududu!

Some things was busy chasing us down.

[Constellation, 'God of Harp and Horn', is heeding the father's order.]

[Constellation, 'Goddess of Love and Cats', is answering the father's order.]

[Constellation, 'One Who Lost His Arm to the Wolf of Apocalypse', is
howling out!]

[Constellation, 'Guardian of the Great Horn Bridge', has detected someone's
presence!]

"We're almost there!"
Anna Croft turned around while saying that, and extended her hands out.
Suddenly, the surrounding view changed and the field before her seemed to
disappear. It was her speciality, [Phantom Barrier]. Constellations got lost
in the darkness suddenly enveloping them and roared in surprise.

Tsu-chuchuchut!

Anna Croft's eyes became bloodshot, before blood trickled down from her
mouth and ears. It was the cost of going against her own Nebula. Even then,
she didn't back down and shouted out.

"Iris! Selena! Lead the allies away!"

The two people running way ahead of us took 'Zarathustras' and ran
towards the end of the branch.

"Run! Hurry! It's right in front of us!"

Anna Croft went down on one knee while bleeding profusely. She was in
no shape to run by herself now.

"Han Sooyoung."

Even before I was finished, Han Sooyoung picked Anna Croft up and ran. It
didn't take too long for us to reach the end of the branch. What waited for
us there was a mysterious bridge emitting a rainbow of colours.

⸢It's the rainbow bridge leading to other floors, the [Bifrost].⸥

The fantastical bridge only seen within the myth was now laid out before
my eyes. Selena and Iris were already halfway across this very bridge.

I decided to activate [Electrification] and cross this thing in one go using
the momentum. But then… KWA-BOOOOM!!
I thought I saw a light flash in the heavens, and then, the center of [Bifrost]
was abruptly cut off. A massive spear that carved up the sky was being
summoned back.

I instantly recognised what that spear was: the God-king Odin's weapon,
Gungnir.

He chose to eliminate us here by cutting off the bridge leading to another
world. I looked back at the group of Constellations hot on our heels and bit
my lip.

We'd definitely be defeated if we choose to fight Odin in this place.

Ku-gugugugu!

In the end, the only answer here was to cross the bridge.

However, the width of the broken-off section was far too wide, and the
storm generated by Odin was madly whipping about in the open gap. Even
if I activated both [Way of the Wind] and [Electrification] to their fullest,
there was no guarantee of us crossing it safely.

Han Sooyoung shouted out in frustration. "Hurry! Isn't there another way?!"

She forcibly shook Anna Croft, prompting the latter to reply helplessly
while vomiting out blood.

"My Precognition… isn't perfect… But this time, I… saw clearly. Four
people… crossing this bridge…"

Four people? I want to ask for clarification, but she had bled far too much
and stopped speaking altogether.

But then, a certain scene popped up in my head.

⸢Kim Dokja began thinking. 'Will it work?'⸥
However, there was no other path remaining. I looked up to the sky and was
greeted by the deluge of indirect messages from the Constellations
panicking from the channel's sudden upheavals.

[Constellation, 'Demon-like Judge of Fire', wishes to see the channel's
broadcast!]

[Constellation, 'King Heungmu', complains about the channel's blackout!]

[Constellation, 'Bald General of Justice', is searching for the disappeared
Kim Dokja!]

"Biyoo! Start the broadcast!"

"Wha?? Are you mad?!"

If we opened the channel now, every Constellation in the ark would learn of
my current location. However, the thing I was planning to do would only
work with the channel open.

Tsu-chuchuchuchut!

[Many Constellations are surprised by the screen spreading wide open!]

[A portion of Constellations realize that you're in danger and are freaking
out!]

[A small number of Constellations feel an odd sense of deja vu at the
current situation.]

I knew all too well what that deja vu the Constellations were talking about.

⸢A long time ago, there was an event where they had to cross a cut-off
bridge.⸥
The 'deux ex machina' that activated on the broken Dongho bridge.
[The absolute majority of Constellations remember the situation from back
then!]

[Nebula, 'Kim Dokja's Company's' Giant Stories are shifting!]

Along with the gazes from the Constellations, the Probability began
writhing wildly.

['Stage Transformation' is activating!] Tsu-

chuchuchuchu…!

['Deus ex Machina' is activating!]

The bridge that the Constellations created back then was being recreated
right before our eyes.


  [Deus ex Machina – Even-numbered bridge]

  Description: A bridge of light created by the blessing of a Constellation.
  Only the 'even' number of people can cross it. When an odd number of
  people try to cross it, the bridge will be extinguished immediately.


The even-numbered bridge – been a really long time since I last heard that
name.

"Han Sooyoung! Take Anna with you and run!"

"What???"

"Hurry up!"

I activated [Way of the Wind] on Han Sooyoung and made her cross the
bridge forcefully.

– Hey, you!! Eiii, shit! I don't know anymore…
I confirmed the distancing back of Han Sooyoung before turning around.
Constellations had begun emerging from Anna Croft's [Phantom Barrier]
one by one already.

I unleashed my Status towards them while thinking to myself.

⸢The even-numbered bridge can only be crossed by an even number of
people.⸥
The distant Han Sooyoung's voice and Odin's enraged roar entered my ear
one after the other.

I unsheathed the Unbroken Faith; I wasn't planning on dying in this place.

⸢Anna Croft said 'four people'.⸥

Just before I was about to unleash the electricity from the [Electrification]
on the incoming Constellations, a loud explosion occurred at the back of the
attacking group.

Someone was ramming through the Constellations like a tank while running
towards this way.

It was a familiar Story; there was this one particular guy who got
summoned to this floor only about a moment ago. His face revealed itself
from beyond the rising murky fog of the Story.

– Keep running, Kim Dokja.

The dude busy smacking all the enemies away and smashing the skulls of
the Constellations, was busy dashing in this direction while carrying a scary
light in his eyes.

I could only grin wryly. I didn't mind anyone else, but would've preferred
not crossing the bridge with that guy.

– Hey, don't you throw me to the river this time, you bastard.
              Chapter 498: Ep. 95 - Gaecheon/開天, II


Yoo Joonghyuk was running towards the bridge, while <Asgard>'s
Constellations were chasing after him.

The Bald General of Justice shouted out. [Do your best, descendants!]

That prompted the One-eyed Maitreya to retort. [Your bald head is caked in
sweat.]

[Worry about your own head first.]

[Aren't you going to help them?]

[I don't have an Incarnation, so how can I?]

[You can simply incarnate directly.]

[You must've lost your mind after being trapped here for too long. With the
remaining Coins, it's impossible even to send a symbolic form down there.]
The Bald General grumbled unhappily and while wiping his head, looked
behind him. That's where the boring monotone-coloured training hall lied in
wait.

The 92nd floor scenario location, the 'Infinite Sanctum'.

One could only escape from this place after clearing a total of ten separate
trials. And several Historical-grade Constellations, including the 'Bald
General of Justice', have been trapped in here for many decades.

The One-eyed Maitreya complained bitterly. [That damn Cheok family
fool. What a terrible hardship this is all because of that man.]

The first one to sniff out this <Infinite Sanctum> was Goryeo's First Sword.
⸢If you're a true martial art practitioner, then you simply have to go there.
The challenges are very easy, so you could say that place is more like an
undiscovered, hidden candy.⸥

The next person to clear this scenario after Cheok Jungyeong, the Maritime
War God, said this:

⸢Indeed it is quite doable. You'll be accomplishing a great achievement by
clearing it.⸥
The Historical-grade Constellations that longed to reach the level of martial
prowess attained by Cheok Jungyeong and Lee Sun-Shin all headed to the
'Infinite Sanctum' after hearing those words.

And then, this was their sad state after several decades of failure.

[We've all momentarily forgotten that we are not the same as Cheok
Jungyeong or Lee Sun-Shin.]

Regardless of where or what, talent would always pose an issue.

The Bald General spat out one sigh after another.
The collision noises of weapons repeatedly rang out from the center of the
training hall.

[Are those idiots still fighting?]

The One-eyed Maitreya's lone eye shifted over to the location where two
old men were still duking it out. One was a tiger-like man with massive,
rippling muscles, while his opponent was a fox-like man who enjoyed slim
yet firm muscles himself.

Blinding shower of sparks exploded as two swords clashed in the air.

[Kim Yoo-Shin! I'll definitely defeat you today!]

[Gyebaek, you're still no match for me.]

The ⸢Stage Transformation⸥ suddenly activated around them and the
Hwangsanbeol's battlefield spread out. It was none other than the very same
battlefield Kim Dokja had recreated in the past via [Ganpyeongui]

Kim Yoo-Shin's Fragrant Dragon Flower Unit attacked Gyebaek, and the
latter also unleashed his grandiose Status and crisscrossed the battlefield
like a phantom.

It was indeed an amazing battle, but the other Historical-grade
Constellations simply looked on with bored expression on their faces. The
'Slumbering Lady of Fine Brocade' shook her head helplessly, while
'Founder of Hannamgun' tutted disapprovingly.

The One-eyed Maitreya sneered. [Even though they are showing off like
that, they know the truth. They know that this isn't Hwangsanbeol.]

There should have been a time when they fought earnestly. There was this
deep-seated grudge, the resentment that couldn't be resolved even with
one's death, after all.

These two betted everything of themselves and fought in Hwangsanbeol.
Such a thing definitely did happen.

[Story, 'Sun Setting on Hwangsanbeol', is continuing with its storytelling
every now and then.]

The fastest thing to get shaved away after becoming a Constellation was
their own 'Story'. The more a Constellation depleted its story, the weaker its
power would get. They would grow bored, disinterested, fall into
depression, or lose themselves in tedium.

Constellations would desperately seek out other Stories in order to escape
from such a quagmire. In other words, they would search for a new tragedy
to escape from this horrible eternal cycle, even if it was only for a brief
moment.

Claaaang!

As the sounds of the weapons clashing got faster, 'Seo Ae Il Pil' spoke.
[Still, aren't they fighting a bit more spiritedly than before?]

[It seems that the fire's been rekindled after the 'Demon King of Salvation'
summoned them back then.]

What the 'Slumbering Lady of Fine Brocade' said caused the Constellations
to simultaneously shift their eyes over to the scenario channel. There they
were, Kim Dokja and Yoo Joonghyuk crossing the bridge.

Han Sooyoung had arrived on the other side and was busy shouting out.

– Kim Dokja!! Faster!

The noisy clashings of weapons also ceased. Both Kim Yoo-Shin and
Gyebaek stopped recreating Hwangsanbeol before anyone had noticed it
and began holding their breaths. One by one, beings gathered around the
display panel out of curiosity.

Several of them saw the bridge Kim Dokja was crossing and pretended to
know what it was.
[Hold on, isn't that the 'Even-numbered bridge'? How nostalgic.]

[What rubbish are you spewing now? You weren't even a subscriber back
then.]

[Hmph…]

Odin was chasing after the fleeing Kim Dokja and Yoo Joonghyuk. The
godly spear Gungnir, famed for never missing its target, was now taking
aim at the former's back. Not only that, the storm was growing stronger,
gradually slowing down the duo's fleeing speed.

The One-eyed Maitreya shouted out. [What's this?! Odin, that guy is a
Mythgrade Constellation, so what about saving his face…]

[Dokja-gun is also a Myth-grade Constellation.]

[Are all Myth-grades the same?? Our Kim Dokja is a still weak wet-
behindthe-ears Myth-grade!]

As if to say their fight earlier was a lie, Kim Yoo-Shin and Gyebaek sat side
by side before the screen and shouted at the same time.

[It seems that the descendant was negligent in his training.]

[He might summon me again through Ganpyeongui. I should prepare for…]

[You think he'll call you, Gyebaek?? Obviously, he'll summon me when in
that sort of a situation.]

When the hint of Hwangsanbeol being recreated showed itself again, the
One-Eyed Maitreya quickly issued a stern warning. [Both of you, shut your
traps and just focus on the screen.]

[Anyways, that man isn't going to throw Kim Dokja again, I hope?]
Sparks were dancing around Yoo Joonghyuk's right arm as he ran on the
bridge. Just as Constellations began worrying, he suddenly grabbed Kim
Dokja by his collars with that arm.

[I knew it!! I bloody knew it…!!]

Yoo Joonghyuk then powerfully threw Kim Dokja forward, but also
stepped onto the latter's back – and they began scything past the storm as if
he was surfing the waves.

Right next second, the Gungnir thrown by Odin caused a massive explosion
along with the blinding wall of light.

Kwa-aaaaaaah!!

When the light rescinded, only the debris of the destroyed bridge, [Bifrost],
remained there.

[…What happened? Did they make it?]

The screen changed to display Kim Dokja's group safely entering the next
cabin.

[…Oh, oh. They made it!]

As if this event also concerned them too, the Korean Peninsula's
Constellations looked at each other and celebrated. Even Gyebaek and Kim
Yoo-Shin awkwardly glanced at each other before lightly bumping fists.
Unfortunately, their happiness couldn't last for long.

– Chase after them.

Because the <Asgard>'s Constellations began moving after the enraged
Odin issued the order.

⸢<Kim Dokja's Company> will not be able to escape for long.⸥
Everyone here understood this fact. Even if this was Kim Dokja they were
talking about, he still shouldn't be able to escape for long from the large
Nebulas in such a disadvantageous stage.

Not only that, the channel had been opened publicly again, so other Nebulas
in the ark should start aiming at <Kim Dokja's Company> as well.

As a heavy silence descended on the group, someone muttered out in
resignation.

[I guess it'll be difficult this time…]

[Honestly, that friend should've died a long, long time ago.]

That prompted several Constellations to nod their heads.

Kim Dokja's life so far had been a series of miracles. Back when he fell
below the Dongho bridge, back when he destroyed the [Absolute Throne],
when he became the 'Demon King of Salvation', or even when he went to
the 1863rd turn – he should've died many times over.

When he appeared as the 'Outer God King', every single Constellation
thought that he'd definitely die for real this time.

⸢The Incarnation who was stuck in a much lower scenario than them only a
few years ago.⸥
And now, Constellations were watching the back of Kim Dokja striding
forward in the scenario way ahead of theirs. Some watched with envious
eyes, while some, contempt at themselves. Everyone wanted to say
something, but no one dared to open their mouth.

The first one to speak was Gyebaek. [I once overheard the Shindansu's
prophecy in the past. This world-line can supposedly become the final
world-line.]

No one could predict how far <Kim Dokja's Company> could go.
No one knew just where they would end up, or what kind of ■■ they would
witness. Maybe, they might not even reach the end of this world like so
many had predicted, and come to a dead stop.

Gyebaek grasped his greatsword and slowly got up from the spot. His glare
was now locked on the portal in the center of the training hall. That was
where the final trial of the 'Infinite Sanctum' was.

Kim Yoo-Shin asked him. [Could you perhaps be planning to challenge it?
You might really die this time.]

[If I die, then this place is my ■■.]

Gyebaek's reply caused Kim Yoo-Shin to grin. [Our ■■ is Hwangsanbeol.]

While cracking his neck muscles, Kim Yoo-Shin also stood up from his
spot.

The third person to stand up was the Bald General of Justice. [I shall
challenge it again as well.]

His eyes containing his resolution seemed to shine brightly.

That prompted several other Constellations to stand up as well – the
'Slumbering Lady of Fine Brocade', 'Founder of Hannamgun', 'Seo Ae Il
Pil',
and…

[I hope that you all haven't forgotten that time when we almost got
slaughtered while attempting it as a party.]

The One-eyed Maitreya's words caused everyone's complexion to grow
gloomy. They kept failing to break past the last gateway of this scenario
until now.

[However, we can't go and aid them if we don't break through that trial.]
The thing was, the final pages of the 'Infinite Sanctum' couldn't be cleared
with so few participants. It was just that the one-man-army Cheok
Jungyeong and Lee Sun-Shin leading an armada were freaks of nature, that
was all. If only there were handful more Constellations here…

It was then, a bright light exploded in the corner of the sanctum.

[Someone is entering the 'Infinite Sanctum's' tenth floor!]

The One-eyed Maitreya's complexion brightened as he shouted out. [Oh?!
There are newbies incoming?]

Two beings revealed themselves from the receding light.

A short while later, the One-eyed Maitreya's jaw dazedly slackened after
realizing who these two were. One was a very big person, while the other
was very small.

The first one to speak was the smaller figure.

[It's just as Cheok Jungyeong has said. You all are still stuck here? What a
bunch of pathetic fools.] Kyrgios spat out as vicious fighting spirit oozed
out from his body. [My disciple might die because you lot have been
meandering about.]




As the rays of light shattered simultaneously, both Yoo Joonghyuk and I
got sucked into the worldview's exit. When I regained my wits, I found
myself being trampled by his feet.

"I told you not to throw me!!"

He must've found stepping on my back rather unsanitary, because he began
lightly dusting his combat boots.
Han Sooyoung waiting for us quickly approached us. Judging from her
expression, she must've been planning to give me another earful. Whether it
was a fortunate thing or not, though, Anna Croft opened her mouth first,
instead.

"I had no idea you'd utilise the Stage Transformation in that manner.
Honestly, I'm somewhat impressed, Demon King of Salvation."

Han Sooyoung shifted her glare to Anna next. "Didn't you see all this
through your [Precognition]?"

"I did see people crossing the bridge, but I had no idea that it'd be that kind
of a bridge."

"What a complete rip-off you are."

I ignored these two's bickering and scanned our new surroundings. The
corridors resembling a tree branch's vascular bundle stretched out in all
directions.

It seemed that this was the corridor of the 'Final Ark'. I couldn't see the
'Zarathustras' that entered here before us anywhere, though.

Anna Croft closed her eyes and felt for something for a bit, before opening
her mouth. "It seems that everyone has scattered in different passageways.
Fortunately, no one has lost their lives yet."

"Our companions seem to be safe too," said Yoo Joonghyuk, and I nodded
my head.

[Influences of other myths will be weaker in the applicable location.]

[Nebula, <Kim Dokja's Company>'s connection is being established again!]

Now that we were outside the <Asgard>'s worldview, I could start detecting
the Stories of my companions a little bit. I sensed that they had been
scattered here and there.
[Story, 'Demon King of Salvation', is letting its existence known!]

I strongly emitted my Story in order to gather my companions in one place.
If it was them, they should be able to locate me without too much fuss.

Boooom!!

Meanwhile, a chain of explosions rocked out from the <Asgard>'s exit we
closed shut behind us. Some people were trying to open the door and come
out. It was obvious who they were.

"Let's continue moving."
