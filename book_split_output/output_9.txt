400: Ep. 76 - Book of Revelation, II


If you were to unpack the contents of my declaration, then they went along
the lines of "kill us, and you will definitely die, too".

At first, the Constellations were agitated, then they began whispering
among themselves, and finally, silence descended in their midst. Some
stared at Agares, while the others, at Metatron. They were the holders of the
highest authorities on this battlefield, but they simply maintained their
silence with unreadable expressions on their faces.

However, even though no orders were issued, the clouds of war
unexpectedly began churning slowly on the outskirts of the gathered
masses.

[<Kim Dokja's Company>. We know very well what you're trying to do.] It
was a Constellation from <Papyrus> who roared out with true voice.
[However, we still have a score to settle with you.]

"I wonder about that. It's hard to tell who is owing who here."
My retort prompted the Constellations of <Papyrus> to free their weapons
from their sheaths.

[You said that you're neither 'Good' nor 'Evil'. That also means you are both
'Good' and 'Evil', too.]

Nebula <Papyrus> had chosen to affiliate themselves with 'Evil'.

[We will kill all those bastards that have sided with 'Good', at the least!]

What a wise decision that was. The Chaos Points only rose up when 'Good'
fought against 'Good' and likewise, when 'Evil' fought against 'Evil'.
<Papyrus> had figured out a way to judge us without going against the
rules of this battlefield.

[The Oldest Evil wishes for your elimination.]

[The Oldest Good wishes for your elimination.]

We were nothing more than viruses in this 'Great War of Saints and
Demons'; hosts that interfered with a system that was operating normally to
spread infections around.

With <Papyrus> as the center, the waves of 'Good' and 'Evil' were growing
larger and larger.

Constellations burning in animosity towards each other only a few
moments ago were now all redirecting their hostilities towards us.

Ku-gugugugu!

The expressions of my companions froze up. Yoo Joonghyuk changed his
attitude and spoke. "Kim Dokja."

He must've known it, too – even if <Underworld> and <Asgard> were with
us, even if the members of <Kim Dokja's Company> were in one place…
…If we clashed directly against them, then someone in our group would
definitely die.

Suddenly, my perception sped up and time slowed down somewhat.

⸢Their advancing speed is quicker than I thought.⸥

⸢Too many Constellations came to their decision too quickly.⸥

⸢Maybe, I should've reached 80 in the Chaos Points first.⸥

Several sentences flitted in and out of my head.

I recalled the 'Ways of Survival'. Who should I ask for help if I were to
emerge victorious from this situation?

My adopted parents in the <Underworld>?

'The Great Sage, Heaven's Equal', who hadn't participated in the war yet?

Or, the Outer God-grade 'Secretive Plotter'?

Cheok Jungyeong and the Constellations from the Korean Peninsula?

Even the faces of my teachers and Jang Hayoung floated up to the fore, too.

Especially Jang Hayoung; although I desperately needed help, I thought
that it'd be for the best if she didn't show up.

['Fruit of Good and Evil' is stimulating your guilty conscience.]

Maybe, this could be my sense of responsibility. I hoped that Jang
Hayoung, born to this world because of me, wouldn't get swept up in the
scenarios. My small wish that she'd get to live her own story in her own
terms.
The reason why I didn't advise Jang Hayoung to join <Kim Dokja's
Company> or reveal the information on the future was that I felt such
ambivalent emotions.

"Aaaahhhhk!"

The ranks of the Reincarnators meeting the enemies at the forefront were
collapsing. They screamed as tsunami waves swept them up and tore them
apart.

[Die!]

Han Sooyoung looked at the Constellations and Demon Kings rushing at us
while spouting trite remarks, and smiled nervously. "Looks like we're going
to win. Those muttering such lines would die the quickest."

The corners of the companions' lips twitched energetically at her timely
joke.

"Here they come."

Their utterances might have been trite, but their Statuses were certainly not.
'Good and Evil' might have been the stalest of Stories in this world, but it
was also one of the most powerful, as well.

The nervousness I felt through my skin was different from all the other
battlefields I had experienced so far.

This was all for real.

This was the 'Great War of Saints and Demons', and this was the true power
of the Constellations.

Kwa-kwakwakwakwa!

The Status of 'Good' and 'Evil', seemingly large enough to completely
blanket the entire great battlefield; its crashing waves had reached right
before our noses in no time at all.
300 meters.

200 meters.

100 meters.

Yoo Joonghyuk spoke. "Now."

Everyone knew what their roles were. The members of <Kim Dokja's
Company> unleashed their Statuses simultaneously.

[Narrators of Nebula <Kim Dokja's Company> have gathered.]

[Story, 'Demon Realm's Spring', has begun its storytelling!]

[Story, 'Torch that Swallowed the Myth', has begun its storytelling!]

'Demon Realm's Spring' wrapped around us as if to protect us, and 'Torch
that Swallowed the Myth' began screeching as if it'd rip anyone
approaching us to shreds. Still, these two alone wouldn't be enough to stop
them from coming.

Even if they were the same 'Giant Stories', the time experienced was
different. That enormous gap couldn't be bridged with the 50 years in
Kaizenix Archipelago.

Even then, this was our story.

30 meters.

Lee Jihye finished loading the cannons and raised her sword up high.

Just as the Dragonhead figurehead began reddening up as the 'Maritime
War God's' blessing descended upon us…

"Wait!!"
I stopped Lee Jihye. Her jaw slackened from shock; I reached out and
grasped her sword faltering aimlessly in the air. The cannon on the verge of
firing withdrew its energy.

"What the hell are you doing, ahjussi?!"

Other companions were also surprised by my unexpected action. To think,
I'd suddenly interfere when we found ourselves in a situation where we'd
surely die even if we struggled with all our might.

Rather than a verbal answer, I pointed towards the opposite side, instead.

"Uh?"

With exactly ten meters to go, the waves of 'Good' and 'Evil' had come to a
standstill as if it was all a lie.

Tsu-chuchuchuchut!

…As if, they were being powerfully restrained by something.

The faces of Constellations grumbling away and the Demon Kings spewing
out choice words could be seen pretty close to us. Some carried dissatisfied
expressions, while others looked relieved.

"…But, why so suddenly?"

I realized the reason pretty soon.

A single Constellation and a single Demon King were floating up above the
frozen tsunami wave, that was why.

They were Metatron and Agares. Two of the strongest beings in this
battlefield had for the first time, unleashed their true voices.

[All Constellations, withdraw your hostilities and return to your positions!]

[The battle will be paused for the time being.]
I raised my head up towards the air above after hearing their sudden
declaration of a cease-fire.

The reason for the cease-fire could be seen etched in that spot.

[Chaos Points have surpassed 80.]

[Countdown to Apocalypse has begun.]




Chaos Points of 80.

It really was a close call, too close for comfort.

What saved us wasn't Constellations or the Demon Kings. No, it was the
weakest faction in this battlefield, instead.

"There must've been the cases of the same camps clashing during the
Reincarnators dying at the frontline."

Weak 'Good' was still 'Good', and weak 'Evil' was still 'Evil'. The 'Good and
Evil' became obsessed only with killing us, and as a consequence of
disregarding such 'weaklings', it was now on the path towards the
apocalypse.

[From here on, Chaos Points will rise by one point every thirty minutes.]

Once the Chaos Points exceeded 80, its rate of increase would speed up.
Even if there was no clash from here onwards, it'd continue to climb up,
and in exactly ten hours, it'd reach the critical point.

In other words, the revival of the Apocalypse Dragon would commence.

[The Most Ancient Calamity at the deepest part of Hell is feeling pleased.]
One of the absolute worst calamities in the history of the <Star Stream>, the
Apocalypse Dragon. Whether it be the 'Good' or 'Evil' camp, none wanted
to see its revival.

Once the dragon revives, at least a quarter of all Constellations in the <Star
Stream> would die, that was why. Anyone from this battlefield could
become part of that quarter.

[Great battlefield of 'Great War of Saints and Demons' has come to a
temporary standstill.]

[Representatives of 'Good' and 'Evil' are currently in an emergency
conference.]

And so, that message floating in the air signified both 'Good' and 'Evil'
struggling bitterly in order to survive no matter what.

[You have accomplished a feat no one has achieved so far!]

[A Myth-grade Story is germinating within you!]

[Your new Modifier will reflect this Story.]

"Chet. I wanted to see how much stronger I got, though."

I patted Lee Gilyoung's head as the boy grumbled to himself.

We were currently sitting inside the passenger compartment of the
battleship,
[Turtle Dragon]. Jung Heewon and Shin Yoosung were nursing Lee
Hyunsung as he lay unmoving like a dead man, while Lee Jihye looked
wholly unconvinced by something else.

"Is this really the end? But, we haven't even fought for real, though?"

Even though she said that, there was a relieved expression on her face as
well.
[Constellation, 'Demon-like Judge of Fire', is congratulating you on your
success.]

[Constellation, 'Demon-like Judge of Fire', is feeling apologetic towards
you.]

"…Uriel? It'll be fine to speak in your true voice."

Uriel currently squatting by the corner of the cabin lowered her head
towards me. For some reason, I thought I could understand where she was
coming from, just a little bit.

Right now, she felt responsible. The fact that her Nebula had attacked
<Kim Dokja's Company>, and then, in regards to the things done by those
claiming to be 'Absolute Good', too.

[Constellation, 'Demon-like Judge of Fire', is looking up at you with tearful
eyes.]

"You don't have to worry, Uriel. We don't hate you. And as for <Eden>…
Honestly speaking, my grievances towards them aren't much. We've
received their help before, too."

[Constellation, 'Demon-like Judge of Fire', asks if you're telling the truth.]

I was lying.

However, it'd only hurt Uriel if I revealed how angry I was.

[Constellation, 'Demon-like Judge of Fire', says that the Scribe isn't such a
bad being…]

"I also know what kind of a Constellation Metatron is. Please, you should
rest for a bit," I said, before leaving the cabin.

[30 minutes have elapsed.]

[Chaos Points are rising up by one.]
[Current Chaos Points: 82]

Alongside the messages entering my ears, there it was, a giant grey sphere
floating up in the air.

Its inside couldn't be spied on. Most likely, every single top-ranked Demon
King and Archangel was in there, having a conference right about now.

And it was also quite likely that the 'Good' and 'Evil' were talking crap
about <Kim Dokja's Company> and 'Demon King of Salvation' in one
voice, too.

"Kim Dokja."

I flinched and looked back to find Han Sooyoung staring at me.

I spoke first. "Whenever you call out my name lately, I can't help but get
scared first. It's like, you must've caused another accident."

"It's you who causes accidents instead," complained Han Sooyoung, before
shifting her gaze over to the sphere and asking me. "What are they really
thinking about?"

"What do you mean?"

"Isn't this whole thing unfolding too smoothly?"

"It's because they don't want to die, either."

"You really think that's all?"

She narrowed her eyes and glared at me.

[Story, 'Predictive Plagiarism', is continuing its storytelling.]

Judging from the whitish fragments of the Story floating around, it seemed
that she had activated 'Predictive Plagiarism' and kept it up ever since that
conference had commenced.
I asked her. "What do you think, then?"

"They are just too quiet. Even if they are terrified of the Apocalypse
Dragon… Something just feels off, you know."

Indeed, the instincts of an author could be very sharp; actually, I agreed
with her opinion, too.

A conference of 'Good' and 'Evil' – it sure sounded nice. However… The
Metatron I knew would never back off in such circumstances. He was the
type of guy who'd sacrifice anyone in order to perfectly fulfil the Absolute
Good's premise.

I stared at the grey sphere and spoke. "I don't know what they are cooking
up over on that side, but there is a way to find out what will happen in the
future."

"What is that?"

I looked straight at Han Sooyoung. And soon, her jaw dropped.

"God damn it, we had that method, didn't we."

Whether it was a conference or war, it'd come to an end in the next nine
hours.

And if it was that sort of a near future, then we knew of a being who could
read it better than anyone else in this world.

We quickly dashed towards the cabin at the rear. The thing was, the person
we were looking for was already with us by now.

"Hey, Miss Prophet!"

We barged in to the room, only to find an unexpected guest there. Yoo
Joonghyuk and his scary scowl were busy grabbing onto Anna Croft's
collars at that moment.
He spoke. "…What bullshit are you talking about?"

"It is exactly as I said."

The shocked Han Sooyoung hurriedly shouted out. "Hey, you crazy
bastard! What are you doing?!"

Yoo Joonghyuk looked back at us with an emotionless expression before
releasing Anna Croft's collars. She formed a refreshing grin after
discovering us and waved her hand.

"Thank you for saving me. As expected of the 'Demon King of Salvation'."

"Well, I wasn't really trying to save you or anything, but…"

"You came to see me for the same reason, I suppose?"

Han Sooyoung and I stared at Yoo Joonghyuk. And he glared right back as
if to ask why we were looking at him.

As expected, he was really quick with things like this. He came up with a
solution to this situation way quicker than us, in other words. Han
Sooyoung began gnashing her teeth as she was unhappy about this. Sadly,
though, he didn't carry the expression of a victor.

Anna Croft spoke. "Let me get right to it, then. I can't see the future."

"What do you mean by that?"

Several thoughts floated up in my head, then.

Now that I thought about it, Anna Croft couldn't predict the future related to
me. I remembered that [the Fourth Wall] had something to do with it. What
did she say back then? Was it, there's noise hiding the future as if someone
drew graffiti all over it?

But then, Anna Croft was shaking her head. "It's not the noise obscuring the
future, but I simply can't read it at all. It's not as if someone has doodled on
the page, but more like the page with the doodling on it didn't exist in the
first place."

Han Sooyoung and I exchanged glances. An ominous foreboding slowly
crept up over me.

"Kim Dokja, this…"

Not like doodlings on a page, but the page itself had disappeared. No matter
how hard I thought about it, there could only be one type of future like that.

"…Can it be?"

As if it was waiting for this moment, messages suddenly floated up in the
air.

[Chaos Points is rising up by one point.]

[Current Chaos Points: 83]

"But, it hasn't been 30 minutes yet?"

"It's not rising up because the time has elapsed," said Yoo Joonghyuk in a
hardened voice.

Time hadn't passed by, yet the Chaos Points had risen up. In that case, there
could only be one possibility.

[Members from the same camp have clashed!]

[Current Chaos Points: 84]

Someone was trying to destroy this world.
           Chapter 401: Ep. 76 - Book of Revelation, III


[Members from the same camp have clashed!]

[Current Chaos Points: 85]

We were left completely dazed at the same time after looking at those
system messages.

"…Just who is it?"

Han Sooyoung threw out that question after somehow squeezing it out of
her lips. No one could answer her, however.

She asked again. "It can't be the kids going around causing accidents,

right?" I retorted back. "You think they are like you?"

Even if they were still just kids, they wouldn't do something so rash with
our situation being what it was.

Sure, I was slightly worried about Gilyoung, but…
I looked at Anna Croft and addressed her. "Anna."

"I'm still searching."

Although the page of the future had been ripped away, the events leading
up to its disappearance should still remain. Just like how a defective book
would still need some time before it got destroyed.

[Chaos Points are increasing!]

"We can't leisurely wait any longer."

The first one to fly out of the room was Yoo Joonghyuk.

Anna Croft's forehead was soaked in sweatdrops as she endeavoured to find
the pages of the future. In the end, both Han Sooyoung and I decided to
move, as well.

"Anna, once you find something, let me know through voice projection."

We left her behind and flew out of the cabin. Our companions had gathered
on the deck after sensing that something was wrong.

"Dokja-ssi, what's going on?"

I conveyed the situation in the simplest terms possible when Jung Heewon
asked me. "Some people are attacking their own camp."

"Ehng? Why do something like that?" said Lee Jihye, while frowning to
show that she couldn't understand it. "I thought everyone would die if those
Chaos Points went up any higher? Isn't that why Angels and Demon Kings
went inside that thing…?"

"Can they be people with similar goals as our own?"

"If that was the case, then they wouldn't have increased the Chaos Points at
this point in time."
I didn't need to explain in detail, but my companions seemed to have
arrived on their own answers.

"In that case, could it be…?"

I nodded my head. "No matter what happens, we must stop them. If we
don't, something really horrifying will occur."

"What kinda crazy bastards would… But, why??"

Why would anyone try to speed up the destruction of the world?

I found it hard to provide a proper answer to that. However, there was this
one thing in the <Star Stream> that worked as the universal answer to every
single indecipherable situation imaginable.

"…There are truly a vast array of 'Stories' in this world, you know."

It wasn't only 'Good and Evil' that existed in this world. Just like <Kim
Dokja's Company> that was neither good nor evil existed, there were
people in this world chasing after those Stories we simply couldn't relate to.

Some would live to prevent the end times, but some would only live for the
apocalypse.

Tsu-chuchuchuchu…!

Probability was shifting unstably in the air; sparks erupted in several places
on the battlefield.

Yoo Joonghyuk standing on top of the figurehead seemed to have latched
onto the location of the biggest arcs of sparks.

"There are five in total. Scatter, now."

He finished giving orders, and his figure disappeared towards the north.
I quickly gave instructions to my companions. "Han Sooyoung, you take
the east. Yoosung-ie, Jihye, and Gilyoung-ie, you guys take the south,
please.

Heewon-ssi, please remain on the battleship, since we don't know what
might happen."

"What about you, Dokja-ssi?"

"I'll head west."

Sparks were exploding in all directions. One by the north, one by the east,
one by the west, and two by the south.

"We don't know yet which camp started raising chaos. If it's done by the
members of the same camp as you, don't fight them and call for other
companions."

The situation had flipped on its head now.

If we had increased the Chaos Points by fighting 'Good' with 'Good' and
'Evil' with 'Evil', then we needed to fight 'Good' with 'Evil' and vice versa.
Only by sticking to the original rule of the 'Great War of Saints and
Demons' could we prevent the increase in the Chaos Points.

"Damn it, I'm really annoyed that our situation has changed so suddenly
like this. I get why the Constellations were so pissed off earlier."

"We're going ahead!"

Lee Jihye and the kids departed first, and right afterwards, Han Sooyoung
and I also made our move.

Her figure, as she dashed forward while scattering black flames about, was
filled with wounds, both large and small.

I spoke to her. "Be careful."
She scowled ever so slightly and flew towards the east.

This punk, I was only worried about her, but even then…

– You be careful, instead. Idiot.


The [Midday Tryst] arriving a beat later made me feel a bit strange. Was I
overthinking it when I found both Yoo Joonghyuk and Han Sooyoung had
changed a lot?

[Chaos Points are increasing!]

[Current Chaos Points: 86]

I activated [Way of the Wind] and dashed across the air.

As I was in the middle of [Demon King Transformation], the skill's
accelerative force had become truly astonishing. I crossed the sky in an
instant and arrived at the origin of the sparks. I began to closely scan the
vicinity.

…In hiding, was it?

Corpses of Reincarnators were strewn about on the battlefield. And there
were a handful of terrified survivors that had fallen on their butts, looking at
all the dead bodies.

Without a doubt, someone went on to massacre the people from the same
side here.

[Exclusive skill, 'Reading Comprehension', is activating!]

[Attribute, 'Scenario Interpreter', is activating!]

[Your insight that analyses the situation by collecting circumstantial
evidence of the incident has increased!]
I quickly read the fragments of Stories scattered about. I was right about a
massacre taking place here. However, I couldn't spot any traces of the
culprit running away.

"S-save us, Demon King-nim!"

Six remaining Reincarnators knelt down and began prostrating before me. I
carefully observed them; most of the six were wounded gravely, blood and
Stories continuously pouring out from their bodies.

Except for this one guy, whose Story happened to be exceptionally stable.

"You."

The eyes of the man slowly raising his head up were filled with a certain
evil leer. I spoke while meeting those eyes straight-on. "You, are you a
'Seeker of the End'?"

At that moment, the man desperately lunged at me. But I was already ready
for him and easily evaded his attack, before grabbing his neck.

"Keok, keo-heok…!"

[Exclusive skill, 'Character List', is activating!]

As I thought, he was the culprit I was searching for – a Demon King's
subordinate. There was no real need to peer deeply into his Attribute
Window anymore.

"You've begun your actions already? But, it shouldn't be the right time

yet?" The man with his neck grabbed by me formed a disgusting grin.

"T-the great apocalypse will soon come. All scenarios are already set in
stone. The noble and absolute Story will come to reality!"

I recoiled just a little bit after looking at his eyes glaring like a religious
fanatic.
Right, most of the 'Seekers of the End' were like this guy back in the
original story, weren't they.

They believed that there was only one 'Absolute Story' that supported this
world, and that every scenario was merely the will of that Story coming to
fruition.

⸢Ke kekeke.⸥

I heard [the Fourth Wall]'s mocking cackle resound in my head.

Without a doubt, these 'Seekers of the End' had no idea that the Story they
thought they knew was actually a novel that I had read already.

⸢It's tr ue that a ll are des tined to be des troy ed.⸥

'There's no such thing as destiny'.

I recalled the countless regression turns Yoo Joonghyuk had lived. The
'Great War of Saints and Demons' repeated for hundreds of times, and their
conclusions were largely the same.

However, that was only during the 'original story'.

"Speak. How many of you have infiltrated this 'Great War of Saints and
Demons'?"

Geu-reuk, geu-reuruek…

Foams bubbled up on the man's mouth.

"Do you wish to free the Apocalypse Dragon? You do that, and
everything will come to an end. Rather than reaching the end of the Story
you've been chasing after, the Story itself will be over, instead." The man
didn't reply and simply cackled on.

I sighed out. "Looks like you don't want to answer."
[Demon King, 'Demon King of Salvation', has unleashed his Status!]

The Reincarnators around us screamed at the ripples of the Status and
quickly backed away. The man who received the brunt of my Status head-
on shuddered greatly, before blood oozed out from all seven of his orifices.

I spoke without opening my lips. [Recite the list of your friends that are
participating in this battle.]

Even under the threat of the imposing Status, the man didn't fall into the
clutches of fear. No, it was quite the opposite, actually.

"De, mon King, of, Sal, vation…"

He began forming an expression of sheer rapturous ecstasy. As blood
continued to leak out of his lips, he began speaking in a voice of someone
being saved.

"Kill me! Hurry!! Please kill meeee!"

I couldn't figure out what the hell was wrong with this guy's head. In any
case, I couldn't waste any more time here. If I couldn't extract the list from
this guy, then I'd have to personally search around.

I was about to smash the man's head in without hesitation, but then, a
message suddenly floated up.

[Members from the same camp have…]

[Current Chaos Points: 87]

Damn it, I forgot that he was also 'Evil'.

Just as I let go of his neck, the Story leaking out of his seven orifices
suddenly increased in volume and his body began rapidly expanding. And
then, he began smiling in a bizarre manner.

… Self-detonation sequence, was it?
It was too late to dodge.

But then, right afterwards, a streak of light flew in from somewhere and
penetrated the man's body in a straight line.

Kwa-jijijijik!

It was a spear made out of light so bright that it must've come from the sun
itself.

Inside this bright ray of light, the 'Seeker of the End' shuddered as if he was
being electrocuted. The explosive power expanding outwardly was now
being absorbed into the spear of light.

He lost all signs of vitality in an instant, and died after turning into jet-black
ash.

I studied the Story of light being scattered all around me.

…Wait, didn't I know that Story already?

[You've forgotten to call for me on such a grand celebration. I'm
disappointed, oh, Demon King of Salvation.]

The moment I heard that true voice, I figured out who it was.

"Surya!"

It was the 'Supreme God of Light' Surya.

He used to be a Constellation of <Vedas> once upon a time, but after the
Olympus battle, ended up sharing a 'Giant Story' with us, instead.

[You've achieved an amazing level of Status since the last time I saw you. I
heard that you have defeated Indra.]

"I simply got lucky."
[True, the absent-minded Indra might come across as a neighbourhood
dummy sometimes, but still, he's not someone you can defeat by relying on
luck.]

Perhaps because he had left <Vedas>, Surya didn't seem all that perturbed
while talking about Indra's fate. He scanned the fragments of the 'Seeker of
the End' he ended just now, and spoke.

[I was wondering why the Giant Story's state felt off, but now I see that
'Seekers of the End' have shown up in this place.]

"Were you aware of them?"

[These bastards had infiltrated <Vedas> once before.]

…Even <Vedas>?

Now that I thought about it, I heard somewhere that there was an internal
conflict taking place in Vedas before. Maybe the 'Seekers of the End' were
responsible for that?

Tsu-chut, tsu-chuchut!

Sparks dancing around in all corners of the battlefield began subsiding at a
visible pace. It was likely that my companions had successfully managed to
suppress the situation.

"…It seems that it's been taken care of, more or less. Maybe, there weren't
that many who managed to infiltrate this battlefield in the first place."

Even though the 'Seekers of the End' had made their entrance, this was a
rather tame conclusion.

But, then…

[Members from the same camp have clashed!]

[Current Chaos Points: 88]
…What??

I hurriedly scanned the battlefield, but couldn't see a single spark exploding
anywhere. Forget about the same camp this and that, there was no battle
taking place at all.

[Members from the same camp have clashed!]

[Current Chaos Points: 89]

Even then, the Chaos Points continued to climb higher. A chilling sensation
crept down my spine.

Hang on, could this be…?

[It's not on the surface.]

I heard Surya's words and reflexively looked up into the sky.

More correctly, at the grey-coloured sphere floating up there. Archangels
and Demon Kings should be having a conference within it, yet it was
rocking viciously to and fro while an incredible amount of sparks exploded
from it.

…A 'Seeker of the End' was in there, too?

[Members from the same camp have clashed!]

[Current Chaos Points: 90]

The Chaos Points would climb only when those in the same side fought
against each other. But, if such a thing was happening inside that sphere…

[Atmosphere of the great battlefield is beginning to change!]

Clouds gathered in the sky began spinning into a massive whirlpool.
[Aura of Calamity at the hottest place in Hell is opening its

eyes!] …God damn it. Ku-gugugugu!!

Even Surya's expression had hardened noticeably.

[It seems that I've come seeking my own grave today.]

Right then, a message I really didn't want to see floated up.

[Chaos Points have exceeded 90!]

[Giant Story of Apocalypse is beginning to stir.]

[Giant Story, 'Final Dragon of the Book of Revelation', is getting ready to
tell its story!]

An earthquake erupted throughout the entire great battlefield.

The indescribable despair I felt during the 95th scenario was reviving again.
            Chapter 402: Ep. 76 - Book of Revelation, IV


[Every Constellation in the <Star Stream> has detected the existence of the
Calamity!]

[Many Constellations have fallen into a state of fear!]

As the surrounding atmosphere transformed rapidly, Constellations
enjoying the cease-fire all began repeatedly roaring out as well as speaking
in their true voices. Some were panicking grandly, wondering what was
going on here; some sensed the Status of the Calamity and became scared;
some Constellations began lodging inquiries to the Bureau, hoping to
escape from this scenario.

The bitter struggles of the stars trying to survive turned the battlefield into
pure pandemonium in no time at all.

[The Bureau of the Star Stream is responding to the emergency situation!]

Finally, the Bureau was stepping forward.
Seeing that the messages regarding Constellations had decreased by a
whole lot quite rapidly just then, it seemed that the Bureau also found the
current situation rather concerning as well.

[The Bureau of the Star Stream has begun an internal meeting on the
applicable issue.]

It was quite likely that even the Bureau didn't expect this 'Great War of
Saints and Demons' to become this big.

Well, from the get-go, the 'Chaos Points' were simply added in as the extra
spice for the sake of speedy progress of the 'Great War of Saints and
Demons'. But then, that extra points system had surpassed the Good/Evil
Points, and it was even trying to awaken the Apocalypse Dragon now.

If that Dragon did wake up, then countless Constellations would end up
getting killed. In other words, it'd be the same thing as the number of the
Bureau's customers declining rather precipitously.

[Even if the Bureau steps forward, they won't be able to revert the
calamity, as if it never happened in the first place.] I agreed with Surya's
assertion.

We were in the 80th main scenario. Even if this was the Bureau, they
wouldn't be able to cancel the 'Giant Story'.

So, now wasn't the time to place our faith in their potential response.

"In order for the Apocalypse Dragon to wake up, the Chaos Points need to
rise up by another 10."

Although it wasn't a lot, we still had some time.

If we failed to prevent the release of the Apocalypse Dragon, then there was
a very good chance that my companions would be killed here.

What should I do to prevent that from happening?
Of course, I could immediately come up with a method to do that –
eliminate the source behind the rise in the Chaos Points.

The problem was that the source was hidden inside that 'sphere'.

Tsu-chuchuchuchut…!

"Even if it's a 'Seeker of the End', it shouldn't be able to hold on for long
inside there."

Through the 'Ways of Survival', I knew who was on the list of the 'Seekers
of the End'. No one on that list was capable of lasting for a long time while
inside that sphere.

Not only were Metatron and Agares were in there, but the highest-grade
Constellations in this world were with them, too.

Even if they were to take their time, Archangels and Demon Kings
should've discovered the 'Seeker of the End' and killed it by now. With that,
Chaos Points should stop rising up…

[Members from the same camp have clashed!]

[Current Chaos Points: 91]

It was around at that time that sparks exploded in the air. The sphere
violently shook around before a portion of its side faintly spread open, and
something began falling from there.

There were six torn wings visible on her back; it was an Archangel I knew
well.

I activated [Way of the Wind] and flew up in haste.

The body of the Archangel I caught was quite light. A certain fragrance
wafted into my nose; Stories were falling like flower petals from the deep
wound running across her back.
"Gabriel."

[Constellation, 'Lily Blooming in Aquarius', is looking at you.]

She was the Archangel Gabriel, who had experienced the 1863rd turn with
me before coming back home; the Constellation who fell into a deep pit of
shock after learning that she'd betray <Eden> in the future.

I momentarily wondered if she was the reason for the unfolding crisis, but I
knew that couldn't be the case; even in the original story, there was a very
good reason to her betrayal, and technically speaking, you couldn't even
really call what she did a betrayal, either.

Gabriel's lips moved with great difficulty. It was hard to hear her voice.

I pressed her for an answer. "What happened in there? Please talk to me."

She looked up at my face with fatigued eyes, but then, handed something
over to me. It was her Story.

Her trembling lips moved. Her voice couldn't be heard, but I could
definitely understand the words being conveyed.

⸢Please, save <Eden>.⸥

Gabriel's Story began telling its story.




Metatron looked at the Angels lining up by his sides, as well as the Demon
Kings standing on his opposite side one at a time. They all seemed to be
anxious. Also, their expressions displayed their failure at understanding
how they arrived at their current situation.
In the middle of all those faces, the oldest rival to Metatron could be seen.

[To think that we'd be in this place because of a single Nebula. How

absurd.] It was the master of the 2nd Demon Realm, the 'Ruler of the East

Hell'.


While lighting up a thick cigarette, Agares asked his question. [How will
we decide on the victors and losers? Will we enter the 3rd 'Great War of
Saints and Demons' right away? Honestly speaking, I'm against it.
Gathering this much Probability again would be next to impossible, after
all.]

To start this 'Great War of Saints and Demons', both <Eden> and the
Demon Realm had to swallow huge losses.

Even among all the 'Giant Stories' of the <Star Stream>, the 'Great War of
Saints and Demons' boasted an unparalleled scale. If this scenario ended in
annulment, then the 'Story of Good and Evil' they barely managed to
scrounge up would scatter again, and both the 'Good' and the 'Evil' could
end up on the road to extinction.

Metatron looked up at the outside sky, faintly visible through the grey
sphere. Flashes of lightning could be seen within the dark, gloomy clouds
ominously gathering above them. Was it because of the end-of-the-world
type vibe? He abruptly recalled an event that had taken place a long time
ago.

[Agares. It's already been several thousands of years since the master of the
1st Demon Realm had passed on.]

[I don't have the time to leisurely reminisce about the past with you.]

[Do you still remember that day?]
[It was the day I inherited this abominable 'wall', so how could I have
forgotten it?]

['Wall that divides Good and Evil' is growling.]

Ominous sparks danced around Agares's Incarnation Body. When that
happened, a similar phenomenon happened around Metaron's Incarnation
Body, as well.

['Wall that divides Good and Evil' is falling into a reminiscence of the past.]
A wall that was one but at the same time, two. A fragment of the Final
Wall, that decided the 'Good' and the 'Evil' of the world.

With that wall in the middle, the representatives of <Eden> and the Demon
Realm were staring at each other.

[For a long time, you and I decided on the 'Good and Evil' of this world,
didn't we?]

Just what was 'Good'?

Even Metatron, the leader of <Eden>, didn't have the answer to that
question. Because 'Good' was simply a collection of countless Stories, that
was why.

He read the Stories of his predecessors, figured them out, and learned about
'Good' that way. And those 'Good', rather than explaining themselves,
simply pointed to other Stories and spoke like this, instead.

⸢That is not 'Good'.⸥

And that was how 'Evil' was created.

'Jung-ui' (Justice, 正義) had morphed into 'Jung-ui' (To define, 定義), and
along with that, 'anger' had been invented.

⸢And therefore, we are not 'Evil'.⸥
That was how 'Good' was created.

That simple dichotomy had managed to tear the <Star Stream> in half.

The simpler and more unyielding the principle, the stronger its ability to
spread out. Countless Constellations jumped on the bandwagon of the
principle of 'Good' and 'Evil'.

[You probably have no idea. No idea about how boring it can get, trying to
exist as 'Evil' in this world.] Agares breathed out the cigarette smoke and
continued on. [It was you who forced the 'Good and Evil' into this state.
You erased the particulars of 'Evil', and you also spread that damn
'promotion of virtue and disapproval of vice' like some kind of a plague.
Indeed, you bastard, are the original culprit who managed to break the Story
of 'Good and Evil'.]

It didn't really matter what kind of minute details, or whether sadness and
pain existed within the scenario. What did matter, however, was the
conclusion.

The 'Good' judged and punished the 'Evil'. That was enough for the others
to shed grateful tears and clap their hands. Without a doubt, such a time did
exist.

Metatron spoke up. [But, you also agreed to do that, didn't you?]

[Back then, that was the only way for us to survive.]

The 'Good' stayed alive by punishing the 'Evil', while the 'Evil' continued to
exist by resisting against the 'Good'.

And so, tens of thousands of years passed by like that. The division
between 'Good and Evil' became blurry, and justice/definition had
disappeared. The 'Good and Evil' ended up becoming a concept of bored
old men.
No one welcomed the idea of 'promoting virtue and disapproving vice'
any more. Drop.

Agares dropped the cigarette he'd been smoking on the floor, and as if he
was stepping on an insect, squashed it to kill it.

[Through the repetition of the scenarios, the 'Good' has become a source of
stuffy boredom, while the 'Evil' has become an antiquated cliché. I have to
wonder, maybe it's about time that we stop with this foolishness.]

Agares's words prompted the Demon Kings to pull out all of their weapons.

Metatron spoke again. [If we fight here, then everyone will perish together.]
['Evil' has always been easier than 'Good'. Even if you all disappear, we will
still remain.]

[The world forgetting about 'Good' does not mean I have forgotten mine.]

[Then, prove it.] Agares's eyes began burning up. [We will no longer be the
plaything of the 'promotion of virtue and disapproval of vice' any more. I
am 'Evil'. I was born 'Evil', and proving that you exist used to be the reason
for my existence. And from today onwards, I shall break free from that
reason.]

The Demon Kings all roared out in unison. Their Statuses overflowed as if
to sweep away every Archangel present at any given moment.

But, right at that moment…

[Members from the same camp have clashed!]

[Current Chaos Points: 83]

System messages rose up in the air. The sudden spike in the Chaos Points
caused the shocked Archangels to exchange glances with each other.

[What's going on?!]
[It's the outside! Someone is slaughtering the members from the same side!]

Agares and the Demon Kings also became flustered. And in the middle of
all this confusion, only Metatron maintained his composed chuckle.

[I've been thinking about this for a long time, but it seems that this is the
only way forward.]

[What are you…?!]

[If you want a fight, then I'll give you one. However, what meaning is there
for us to fight inside this place and end the 'Great War of Saints and
Demons'? Who do you think will remember the 'Good and Evil' that fought
inside this tiny little sphere and met its ignoble doom?]

There was a hint of bizarre, creepy madness in Metatron's voice.

Sensing that something very ominous was about to occur, Agares loudly
shouted out.

[Metatron! Just what the hell are you thinking?!]

[My thoughts are as thus.]

As soon as Metatron finished talking, Michael, standing right at the
forefront of the Archangels, unsheathed his sword.

Now that the strongest Archangel had pulled its sword out, Demon Kings
didn't hold back and unleashed their Statuses while roaring out, as well.
And in the following moment, Michael's sword pierced into someone else.

[…Mi, chael…?]

Eyes trembled softly in sheer disbelief.

The person Michael had stabbed wasn't a Demon King. He began laughing.
[How regretful. I always wanted to kill Uriel first, though.]
Archangel Raguel continued to shake its head in disbelief but eventually, it
died on the spot as the Stories poured out from its wounds.

Demonic aura began boiling all over Michael's entire frame after he
murdered one of his kin. A corrupted Angel's powers would grow stronger
by killing fellow Archangels.

[Members from the same camp have clashed!]

[Current Chaos Points: 87]

Status that almost reached that of a Myth-grade Constellation exploded
forth, and the massacre commenced in earnest. Angels that had no place to
run hurriedly unleashed their Statuses, but they couldn't even put up a
proper fight before getting killed. Originally, there was a restriction placed
on Michael that prevented him from attacking a fellow Angel on the side of
Absolute Good.

Even then, if such a thing was possible, that could only mean…

[Scribe, just why…?!]

Metatron's book was emitting bright white light. This slaughter was taking
place under the tacit approval of 'Scribe of Heaven'.

[Members from the same camp have clashed!]

[Current Chaos Points: 88]

The sight of hell itself unfolded as an Angel murdered another Angel.

Demon Kings watched the proceedings like onlookers spectating on the
wildfire on the other side of the river, shook from sheer terror, and hastily
stepped back.

Michael grinned brightly, and while wiping the Angel blood off his cheek,
spoke. [And now, 'Good' will forever be remembered.]
[The Oldest Good has begun its storytelling.]

The battle of Saints and Demons were, in the end, a battle between Stories.
And these Stories knew better than anyone on what to do so that they would
be remembered forever.

Agares, enraged beyond means, roared out.

[Could it be that, you bastards, wish to revive the Apocalypse Dragon…?!]

Just as it urgently tried to unleash its Status, something dug deeply into its
back – a covert, sneaky demonic energy that could even rival its own
Status.

[The Oldest Evil has begun its storytelling.]

Agares unstably wobbled about and looked behind itself.

[…You bastard, why?]

[You said it yourself, haven't you?]

The Demon King felt the sensation of the sharp claws cutting out its heart.

Asmodeus, the 'Seeker of the End', was smiling brightly.

[…That 'Evil' is always easier than 'Good'.]




Gabriel's Story was really short. Short, but more than long enough to
explain everything. Hell had unfolded inside that sphere already.

⸢"Run away, Gabriel. Request aid from those people."⸥

And a small number of Archangels, including Raphael, sacrificed their
Statuses at the last moment to send Gabriel outside the sphere.
[Definition of 'Good' and 'Evil' are rapidly changing!]

[Members from the same camp have clashed!]

[Current Chaos Points: 92]

"Kim Dokja."

Yoo Joonghyuk and Han Sooyoung had arrived by my side already. Their
eyes were demanding an explanation.

Rather than providing a detailed but time-wasting one, I simply spoke of
the core of the issue at hand. "It's Metatron. He was planning to wake up
the 'Apocalypse Dragon' from the very beginning."

As if she knew what had transpired already, a big scowl formed on Han
Sooyoung's face.

"That fool, I thought he knew what happened in the 1863rd turn?"

During 1863rd regression turn, <Eden> was destroyed by the Apocalypse
Dragon. And Metatron was well aware of that.

"He must be believing that this is the only way to avoid their destruction."

It was Yoo Joonghyuk who said that. He continued on. "If the Apocalypse
Dragon wakes up, then at the bare minimum, this 'Great War of Saints and
Demons' should become a Story no one will ever forget even until the final
days of the <Star Stream>."

"What the hell? What's the point of that if everyone is about to die?"

"Not everyone will die. Some that manage to survive will end up
remembering the 'Good and Evil' forever."

Even if both Eden and the Demon Realm perished, the story would be
different as long as the 'Good and Evil' didn't vanish.
Even if everything were to come to an end, the ideology would still be
inherited, that's why.

Countless Constellations and Incarnations would die, and without a doubt,
the Apocalypse Dragon would be designated as 'Evil'. Then, the rest of the
world would gather together to fight against that calamity.

And <Eden> and the Demon Realm would forever be etched in everyone's
memory.

Han Sooyoung shuddered uncomfortably at that out-there show of will.

"Those crazy sons of bitches…"

[Members from the same camp have clashed!]

[Current Chaos Points: 93]

I watched the Chaos Points slowly climb up and felt the helplessness creep
in bit by bit. All of this was Metatron's scenario.

"Kim Dokja, what are we going to do?"

From afar, the rest of our companions, plus Uriel, were flying towards our
location.

…I need to think.

We had worked too hard to get this far.

Tsu-chuchuchut!!

It was at that moment that a portal opened up in the air as sparks wildly
danced about.

"…Dokkaebis?"

[Great Dokkaebi, 'Heoju' (empty throne) has appeared in the scenario!]
[Great Dokkaebi, 'Heoche' (empty body) has appeared in the scenario!]

Two Great Dokkaebis, one wearing a formal black suit while the other, a
white one, descended from the sky while scattering around dignified
Statuses. They must've come here on short notice because their crumpled,
untidy shirts and ties were flapping around in the strong winds.

They approached me immediately and spoke as thus.

['Demon King of Salvation', this 'Dark Stratum' will soon perish. And, it's
almost a guarantee that you will die here.]

I figured that the Bureau would start making their move by now. I didn't
expect Great Dokkaebis to personally show up here, though.

"If you came here to prophetise the apocalypse, then I'm afraid you're a bit
too late now. The system's been yapping on about it for a while."

The two Great Dokkaebis looked at each other as if they were taken aback
by my composed reply.

[Just as the rumours suggested, he does possess a glib tongue.]

[And that's why the King is so interested in him, most likely.]

Just before I could ask for a clarification on that, one of the Great
Dokkaebis broke out into a smirk.

…As if it was about to make an offer that I couldn't possibly refuse.

[Oh, Demon King. Let us get straight to the point. Give up on this 'Great
War of Saints and Demons'.]

This Great Dokkaebi laughed as if entertained by something, and while
looking at Gabriel lying down on the ground, spoke again.

[If you do, we shall take you to the 'Final Scenario'.]
             Chapter 403: Ep. 76 - Book of Revelation, V


The Final Scenario.

Acting as if they already knew what I wanted, the two Dokkaebis wearing
the contrasting black and white formal suits pressed me for an answer.

[You must decide now. Die in this place, or head off to the Final Scenario
with us.]

The Great Dokkaebis, Heoju and Heoche.

I knew a few things about these two Great Dokkaebi siblings. Well, they
did appear frequently in the latter half of the 'Ways of Survival', after all.

Besides that, though. To think, they would mention 'Final Scenario' with
their own lips… It seemed that the Dokkaebis were finally getting ready for
the end of this world as well.

Just as Constellations and Incarnations repeatedly fought to ensure their
continued survival, the storytellers also had a story that they needed to
convey at any cost.
And the Great Dokkaebis were getting ready for that final story.

– Final Scenario? What are these two talking about?

Han Sooyoung didn't seem to know.

Herself from the 1863rd regression turn must've not told her of it, it seems.

I recalled that version of Han Sooyoung, wearing the exact same white coat
as me. That meticulous person wouldn't have forgotten about it, so it was
more likely that her choice was deliberate.

– It's too long to explain right now.

I couldn't really tell. However, she might have believed that not knowing
would be more advantageous for herself in the 3rd turn.

I felt just a bit strange after recalling Han Sooyoung from the 1863rd turn
after such a long while.

That turn, when I went to visit it, was already facing its final battle. Did
Han Sooyoung survive that battle? If she did, what kind of person would
she have become now?

I shifted my head to find Yoo Joonghyuk staring at me.

– Are you going to accept their offer?

– You're actually asking me that?

As if he knew it, he turned his head away.

He looked as if he was rueful about something. If I had accepted the offer,
then he might have lopped my head off right this instant or something.

Meanwhile, Great Dokkaebis were still waiting for me.

[Your decision?]
"Well, I'm sure you've already guessed it… No thanks."

[And your reason is?]

"Because it's suspicious."

[Suspicious?]

"From the get-go, the offer itself is strange. Give up on the 'Great War of
Saints and Demons', and you'll take me to the Final Scenario… Can't you
really see what's missing from that? You're a storyteller, yet your degree of
understanding towards my Story is strikingly low."

Great Dokkaebi Heoche looked at me in dumbfoundedness, before eyeing
Great Dokkaebi Heoju.

The latter nodded his head and spoke. [If you accept the offer, then we shall
lend our aid to ensure the survival of every <Kim Dokja's Company>
member present in this place.]

Both Yoo Joonghyuk and Han Sooyoung looked at me simultaneously at
that unexpected declaration.

A path that would save everyone from <Kim Dokja's Company> present
here, plus taking us right to the Final Scenario?

"Even if it's the Bureau, wouldn't doing something like that as you please
tilt the balance of Probability?"

[That is something for us to worry about.]

This could be a once-in-a-lifetime chance, an opportunity to save everyone
and reach the Final Scenario. An offer so tempting that one wouldn't even
dare to think about rejecting it.

Even then, my head was colder than it was ever before.
"It sounds like you're in a really tight situation right now. Surely, me giving
up on the 'Great War of Saints and Demons' can't be everything there is to
your offer?"

[…!!]

"I'll have to sign the 'Stream Contract' with you guys in exchange. Am I
correct?"

The Stream Contract. A type of contract that I had with Bihyung once upon
a time.

The two Great Dokkaebis formed surprised expressions. I decided to land
another blow. "In order to become the 'Final Storyteller', you are trying to
take my Story and use it, aren't you?"

[…How do you know things like this?]

"I'm not interested in your offer."

[Then, your group will die here.]

"We don't know that. Didn't you say it earlier? It's 'almost' a guarantee. In
that case, there's a very low chance of us not dying."

[Have you not seen the Calamity from the other world-line?]

This time, it was my turn to be surprised. It seemed that Great Dokkaebis
were now more or less aware of the events of the 1863rd regression turn.

[The Apocalypse Dragon isn't some simple Calamity that a single
Constellation or Nebula can stop.]

I knew that. I knew how horrifying the Status of that Dragon was. Well, I
did directly sense it back in the future world-line, didn't I?
Even then, I still smiled. "I thought creating an entertaining scenario was
the duty of the Dokkaebi? You should just get ready to start the broadcast,
instead."

As if she was reacting to my words, Biyoo popped up in the air with a
welltimed 'ta-da!'

[Baat!]

[Many Constellations are astonished by your choice.]

[A small number of Constellations believe that you're insane.]

[Constellation, 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon', is cackling away.]

[Sponsorship community's big whale has sponsored 300,000 Coins for your
ambitious spirit.]

As expected, thanks to the enormity of the situation, the incoming
sponsorship amount proved to be rather sizeable, too.

The Great Dokkaebi glared at me with unreadable eyes for a little bit,
before slowly vanishing from the view.

[You shall regret this decision.]

Their figures scattered like smoke. And with that, the certain method to
save every one of my companions had vanished alongside them, as well.

[…Your decisiveness always surprises me.]

Even Surya seemed to be impressed by my decision this time.

I looked at the unconscious Gabriel within my arms.

Han Sooyoung, looking at her, asked me a question. "Kim Dokja."

"What now? What? What do you want."
"…You thought about this long and hard before answering, right? It's not
because of some cheap sympathy or a momentary rush of blood or
something, right?"

I nodded my head.

"…In that case, fine."

A faint trace of resentment could be felt from her tone of voice.

I spoke. "It's okay for you to get angry. I did reject an incredible
opportunity just now, after all."

"…"

"However, by not doing that…"

"Yeah, well, sure. You have your reasons. Honestly, I knew you'd say no,
anyway."

"What? Why?"

Han Sooyoung's sigh-filled replies were followed up by Yoo Joonghyuk.
"Because that's how you operate, you fool."

Looking at him glaring back at me with his usual eyes, I instantly realized
what these two had to give up for my sake.

Right. This was how I lived my life. And it was not how Han Sooyoung or
Yoo Joonghyuk lived theirs.

"…Sure, this type of method does suit the stupid Story of <Kim Dokja's
Company> the best. I'm definitely recording today's events in my memoir
later. Obviously, after surviving this place, that is."

"You better worry about what to do next, instead."

Han Sooyoung and Yoo Joonghyuk, two very different people.
I realized something just then. I managed to get this far because these two
lived on their own terms – respected my decisions in their own ways.

I began thinking; with these two around, maybe not all hope was lost, after
all.

[Members from the same camp have clashed!]

[Current Chaos Points: 96]

Sparks were still flying around in the sky. The battle taking place inside that
grey sphere should be winding down by now. The Good and Evil, planning
to survive by driving this world to destruction, would soon reveal
themselves from there.

Han Sooyoung asked. "Are we going to stop that?"

Yoo Joonghyuk shook his head. "It's impossible to breach that sphere from
the outside."

"What then?"

"We can't stop the Chaos Points from reaching the 100 mark. The
Apocalypse Dragon will revive. And with that, the 'First Tail-Flick' will
begin."

The First Tail-Flick.

It seemed that Yoo Joonghyuk knew about that Calamity. I recalled the
prophecy of the Apocalypse Dragon appearing within the 'Ways of
Survival'.

⸢From the center of the hottest Hell, a Dragon with seven heads and ten
horns will awaken.⸥

⸢It will be a Dragon among Dragons. A leader of all Dragons born within
the center of Chaos, and the world's oldest hatred.⸥
⸢The Dragon will look at the heavens and the earth once, before flicking its
tail. That single tail-flick will cause stars to fall, and one direction of the
world to vanish.⸥

Back in the 1863rd turn, I didn't get to witness that 'Tail-flick'. Back then,
the Apocalypse Dragon wasn't in the fully-revived state. However, things
would be different this time around.

Yoo Joonghyuk spoke in a resolute tone of voice. "We have no other choice
but to fight it head-on."

"Fuck… I knew you'd say something like that."

Han Sooyoung sounded resigned in her reply.

[Members from the same camp have clashed!]

[Current Chaos Points: 98]

Only two more points remained in the Chaos Points.

I saw my companions rush over here from the distance.

"Ahjussi!"

"Dokja hyung!"

I saw Shin Yoosung and Lee Gilyoung, and Lee Jihye leading the battleship
as well as Jung Heewon. Uriel was accompanying them, her expression
complicated.

She saw Gabriel in my arms and was taken greatly by surprise.

[…Gabriel!!]

I handed the wounded Archangel over to her. I quickly looked at my
companions first as there wasn't a lot of time for a detailed explanation.
"Ahjussi, is the Apocalypse Dragon really going to wake up?"

I nodded my head.

As if to instil discipline, Han Sooyoung began shouting out. "You all better
be ready for this. This isn't going to be a picnic."

"When was it ever?"

Along with Lee Jihye's reply, the companions quickly finished with the
preparations.

Everyone… Han Sooyoung, Yoo Joonghyuk, Shin Yoosung, Lee Gilyoung,
Jung Heewon, and Lee Jihye, all carried a hardened, determined expression.

Finally, I shifted my gaze over to the face of the still-unconscious Lee
Hyunsung.

[Members from the same camp have clashed!]

[Current Chaos Points: 99]

And then, the Apocalypse Dragon's imminent revival drew near.

[Many Constellations are in a state of terror!]

[Constellations of <Star Stream> have fallen into a chaotic state.]

[Nebula, <Olympus>, is getting ready for the Calamity!]

[Nebula, <Vedas>, is getting ready for the Calamity!]

[Nebula, <Hongik>, is…] Ku-

gugugugu!

Something from deep within the island writhed, causing the heaven and
earth to shake violently. It felt as if everything was now enveloped within a
gigantic flap of a wing; the surrounding view felt like it was precariously
hanging on as if it was an ill-fitting block. Smaller Stories had already
started breaking down bit by bit.

As if it wanted to deprive the names of all 'calamities' that had existed so
far, an enormous Story began waking up.

"Kim Dokja. The ones at most peril when the Apocalypse Dragon awakens
are the Constellations."

"According to the prophecy, that's right."

"And you're a Constellation."

The First Tail-Flick would destroy a direction in the sky. Simply put, all the
stars and the contexts for the Modifiers found within the applicable location
would be destroyed.

Han Sooyoung began smirking. "Hey, Kim Dokja, which direction were
you, again? East? Or was it the west? If you are unlucky, I guess you'll be
the first one to die?"

"That could be true. So, I might as well pray for my survival before I die."

"…What bullshit are you spewing now? Wait, are you and the Apocalypse
Dragon acquaintances?"

Although her tone of voice wasn't exactly nice, Han Sooyoung's eyes were
sparkling brightly, nonetheless.

I decided to satisfy her expectations somewhat. "You see, the 'Apocalypse
Dragon' isn't actually referring to a 'specific Dragon'. Just like how the
Oldest Good or the Oldest Evil doesn't refer to any specific Constellations,
the 'Final Dragon of the Book of Revelation' simply refers to the Giant
Story itself."

"Hang on. Doesn't that mean…"
"At this point in time, it's not been decided on 'who shall become the
Apocalypse Dragon'."

Han Sooyoung's jaw fell ever so slightly.

[Current Chaos Points: 100]

[Chaos Points have reached the limit!]

Along with the chilling sensation travelling down my back, the whole
world began to dye in the jet-black colour.

The threatening aura breaking out from beneath the surface began
encroaching into the entire island.

[From the hottest Hell, the 'Demonic Dragon Palace' is opening its doors!]

Blinding rays of light exploded out and the surrounding space shattered
away. Giant shadows began appearing from there.

After excluding the Outer God-level beings, there were still other monsters
in this world that managed to get near the powers of Constellations or
Transcendents.

The peak of all types of monsters in the world… Guh-

ohohoooooh!!

A Dragon's Roar, capable of freezing up the listener's body, resounded out.
Shadows of the ruined cities seemed to fleet by, as the ancient Dragon
Kings that had been forgotten under the lengthy period of time began
waking up.

[Kuwaaaahk!!]

Constellations struck by the Dragons' Breaths screamed as they turned to
ash. Hundreds of draconic shadows blanketed the sky; the Constellations of
the <Star Stream> freaked out as they were subjected to the ripples from the
vast Statuses.

Every single one of them was a Dragon King, equal to the power of a
Constellation.

All these countless Dragons had shown up here, hoping to be selected as the
lone Apocalypse Dragon tasked with destroying this world.

[Giant Story, 'Final Dragon of the Book of Revelation', has begun its
storytelling.]

[Giant Story, 'Final Dragon of the Book of Revelation', has begun selecting
the Dragon of Calamity.]

I looked up at that overwhelming spectacle and spoke. "We have a Dragon
among us, don't we?"

Shin Yoosung looked at me after hearing me speak. There was a Dragon
with thick metal armour covering its entire figure sitting next to her.

1st-grade Dragon King, Chimera Dragon.

Thanks to Shin Yoosung's diligent care, it had become strong enough not to
get pushed around by any regular Constellations.

A Dragon that was born in the Demon Realm's Paradise, loudly roared into
the heavens above.

Han Sooyoung watched it fly up into the sky and asked me a question.
"You really think that guy will become the 'king'?"

I shook my head. Sure, the Chimera Dragon possessed an unbelievable rate
of growth, but it was still too early for the creature to become a viable
candidate for the role of Apocalypse Dragon.

"Then, why are you so confid…"
"We still have one more, right?"

"What? Where…"

Han Sooyoung formed a rather dumb-looking expression.

But then, her right hand began wiggling violently as if it was responding to
something. Right in the next second, the empty sky split wide open, and the
pitch-black darkness exploded out from within.

Dozens of Dragons nearby screamed pitifully and fell down. The heavens
flickered as if the darkness had overtaken it, and black bolts of lightning
crashed down to the earth.

Through the gap of the abyss, something began revealing itself. It was a
Dragon, covered in elegant scales seemingly crafted out of pure obsidian.

A Status that other ancient Dragons couldn't even hope to match; eyes
gleaming like the reddest of rubies; every time its wings, seemingly carved
out from the darkness itself, flapped, entrancing black flames blanketed the
sky.

I looked up at that lifeform possessing the beautiful, streamlined shape and
spoke. "Let's all pray that your sponsor emerges victorious."

It was the existence closest to being the Apocalypse Dragon at this point in
time.

[Constellation, 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon', has incarnated into the
scenario!]
                Chapter 404: Ep. 77 - Final Dragon, I


Metatron scanned the desolate, ruined conference venue. Demon Kings and
Archangels wielding their respective weapons up until a short while ago
were all lying still on the floor.

The Story of Good and Evil was scattering away.

The effects of the Chaos Points that broke past the critical point were now
invading into the grey sphere.

One of the Angels still conscious reached out towards him.

[Scribe…]

Along with 'Peo-geo-geok!', Michael's heel smashed that Angel's head into
meat paste. He kicked the dead Angel away, before pulling out an
Archangel the size of a small child hidden inside its robe.

The unconscious Archangel dangled in Michael's hand as she was brought
up in the air.
[Should I kill Raphael as well? It's a bit of a waste to let her go like this…]

[If that's what you want. It doesn't matter if you let her live. The Chaos
Points have been filled to the maximum already, anyway.]

[Well, in that case, what about that Demon King?]

Metatron shifted his gaze over to the corner of the sphere, where a heated
battle was still taking place. Agares and his heavily-wounded body were
there.

Asmodeus and other 'Seekers of the End' were pouring out coordinated
attacks on him, but Demon King Agares didn't show any signs of
collapsing, even though Stories streamed down from all over his body, even
though his two eyes burned in resentment like a dreadful phantom.

While stuck inside the deadly battle, the Demon King continued to suck on
his cigarette. Not just one, but several of them, in fact.

[Stigma, 'One Ciggie for Prodigious Strength Lv.???', is in activation.]

[Stigma, 'One Ciggie for Agility Lv.???', is in activation.]

[Stigma, 'One Ciggie for Magic Power Lv.???', is in activation.]

That was Agares's Stigma, [Universal Cigarette], at work. Its speciality,
developed after living as a smoker for a very long time. A unique Stigma
for the Demon King that possessed the Story to overclock the Incarnation
Body's abilities.

Even after receiving the combined attacks of five, six Demon Kings,
Agares remained standing, prompting Asmodeus to say something in
admiration. [As expected, the renown of the 'Ruler of East Hell' wasn't for
nothing, I see. However, how long will you be able to hold on like this?]

Agares didn't reply, simply choosing to pull out a new cigarette and light it
up.
Metatron and Michael crossed the now-dead battlefield and approached the
Demon King.

Agares spoke. [Metatron, you better think again. You won't be able to
protect the 'Good and Evil' in this fashion. What meaning is there in being
remembered after everyone has perished??]

[As long as it's remembered, it shall revive again sometime in the future.]

[Revive? Like your accursed Corrupted Angel?]

Michael frowned deeply.

[Demon King, 'King of Corrupted Angels', is unleashing its Status!]

Michael's Status crashed in like a surging storm, causing Agares to back
away while losing more of his Stories. However, the Demon King's gaze
was still firmly fixed on Metatron.

[What point is there in trying to carry on like that? That is not us. We
reviving in that manner will no longer be 'Metatron' or 'Agares', but merely
the 'Scribe of Heaven' and the 'Ruler of East Hell'!]

[That is precisely what we are, oh, 'Ruler of East Hell'.]

A certain everlasting Story was now flowing behind Metatron's back –
Stories that he had read, lived, and believed in.

[The Oldest Good is smiling widely.]

This was the 'Scribe of Heaven', the one who recorded the 'Good' of the
world. An existence who judged what was 'Good', and would become its
leading standard.

While looking at his oldest rival, Agares too sensed the Story unhurriedly
flowing next to him.

[The Oldest Evil is tilting its head.]
That was the immeasurably lengthy history of 'Evil' he had pursued so far –
a history of resisting the 'Good', eliminated by it, and being punished for it.

At that moment, Agares sensed that the thousands of years of his life were
now being summarised into a single comma.

This 'flow' would not end here as long as the 'Ruler of East Hell' was alive,
and the 'Scribe of Heaven' continued to exist. As long as they fought against
each other, and repeated their wars over and over again.

Even if Metatron and Agares were killed, someone else would become the
'Scribe of Heaven' and 'Ruler of East Hell'.

[If such a thing is 'Good and Evil', then…]

Agares spat his phlegm on the floor and formed a bitter grin.

[…I shall give up on 'Evil'.]

A cigarette flew up from Agares's fingers. It spun in the air while emitting
dense smoke.

Asmodeus hurriedly shouted out. [Stop him!]

The swirling, spinning smoke enveloped Agares's entire body.

[Stigma, 'One Ciggie for Cowardice Lv.???', is activating!]

Greyish, murky smoke exploded as the attacks rained down.

The smoke dissipated, and the only thing remaining on the spot was a
single cigarette. The 'Seekers of the End' had no choice but to withdraw
their weapons in bitterness.

Metatron looked at the discarded cigarette on the floor. Thick smoke
swirled in the air from its tip.

His enemy was gone, and only the 'Good' remained. Was this a sense of
loneliness, or a type of freedom he felt? Metatron couldn't tell.
Someone trampled on the dying bud and killed it off.

[The Oldest Evil is closely observing the new 'Evil'.]

He raised his head to find Asmodeus grinning primly towards him. [What a
miss that was. I was thinking of taking over Agares's 'Wall'.]

Metatron looked at the Demon King and replied. [You'll soon possess it.]

Whatever the case might have been, the intended purpose had been
accomplished now.

[Current Chaos Points: 100]

The Chaos Points were now maxed out, and the Apocalypse Dragon had
entered the revival sequence. And soon, the apocalypse would begin.

[Conference venue is disintegrating.]

The grey sphere wrapped around the conference venue crumbled away bit
by bit, and the corpses of the Archangels fell to the ground below.

Asmodeus asked a question, seemingly enjoying that spectacle in the
meantime. [By the way, will this really be alright?]

Metatron remained silent. Time to argue whether it'd be alright or not had
long passed by already. He watched the angels falling, and provided the
most textbook-like reply he could think of.

[Everything is according to the will of 'Good'. In order to reach the most
ideal ■■…]

'■■'.

The dearest wish of all Constellations, as well as where the story of a star
would come to an end.
Asmodeus spoke. [■■… It seems that all Constellations that seek it end up
becoming quite similar to each other. You really do resemble someone I
know. Your dispositions are completely opposite of one another, though.]

Just before Metatron could ask who that was, he heard the Dragon's
Howling tearing through the sky.

Guwaaaaahh-!!

Dragons, easily numbering well past several thousand, were freely roaming
around the skies to wage a bloody war. Explosions rang out seemingly
endlessly. Dragons and their torn wings were crashing back to the earth.

This was not the spectacle Metatron expected to see.

…The Apocalypse Dragon hasn't revived yet?

[What are you so surprised about? We aren't the only ones pursuing ■■,
after
all.]

Asmodeus stared back at a certain man looking up at them from the ground
and grinned brightly.




[Constellation, 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon', is roaring out!]

The Black Flame Dragon was indeed strong.

It rose up like a meteor while ripping apart dozens of Dragons blanketing
the sky, and announced its presence through the display of its mighty
Status.

As expected from one of the strongest Constellations in the 'Ways of
Survival'.
Han Sooyoung became excited as her sponsor went on a rampage and
shouted out while waving her bandages around. "I'm proud of you for the
first time ever, Black Flame Dragon!! Kill them all!!"

"Be strong, Chimera Dragon!"

Shin Yoosung tightly clasped her own hands and looked up at the sky with
an ardent look on her face.

[Abyssal Black Flame Dragon's sense of presence is strengthening!]

[Chimera Dragon's sense of presence is strengthening!]

Every time Black Flame Dragon and Chimera Dragon defeated their
opponents, their statuses also rose up higher. Seeing their spirited battle,
even my heart felt like it was pounding away powerfully, too.

After studying the Dragons for a little while, I signalled Yoo Joonghyuk
with my eyes.

"Got it."

He replied to my gaze and along with our other companions, made their
move. His job now was to get in touch with the Nebulas near us before the
Apocalypse Dragon made its move.

And I too had something to do in the meantime as well. I observed each of
the Dragons flying in the air and thought to myself.

This wouldn't be the first time the Apocalypse Dragon had revived. It was
quite likely that the previous 'Apocalypse Dragon' was also among the
ranks of the Dragons overhead.

[Several Dragon Kings have sensed your presence.]

"Damn it."

Kuwaaaaaah!!
I reflexively activated [Electrification] and defended against the Dragon
Breath. A few Dragon Kings glared in my direction, but then, flew away
again while tilting their heads. It was as if they had seen something rather
strange.

…What was up with them? Not to mention, I wasn't even a Dragon.

But then, I heard a certain message.

[You are eligible to enter the 'Dragon's Festival'.]

…What?!

[Will you enter the 'Dragon's Festival'?]

My head temporarily blanked out after that message suddenly floated up to
my view.

No, hang on a minute. I might be a Constellation, but I was definitely not a
Dragon, so how come such a message…

"Why aren't you participating in the proceedings?"

…Just when did this guy get this close to my side?

I raised my guard up and turned towards the voice's origin.

A remarkably beautiful humanoid, whose gender was indecipherable, stood
there. Its hair shone in a bright reddish colour; I couldn't sense any
powerful Status from it, but still, its outer appearance did possess a certain,
unexplainable mystical aura.

…A Reincarnator?

Could be.

This island was home to a tiny number of truly powerful beings who were
hiding their powers, like Yoo Hoseong, the 'One Invincible Fist'.
"I asked you why you haven't participated yet."

"I'm not sure what you mean, but I lack the qualification to do so."

"Why not? Do you not possess the heart of a Dragon?"

Only then did I finally realize it.

[Story fragment, 'A Young Gold Dragon's Broken Heart', is stirring!]

Now that I thought about it, my heart actually used to belong to a Gold
Dragon, a fragment of a Story I absorbed back in the 'Story Horizon' a long
time ago.

[Story fragment, 'A Young Gold Dragon's Broken Heart', wants to
participate in the Dragon's Festival.]

I was wondering why my heart was pounding away so madly since
earlier… Was that the reason why?

The Reincarnator asked me again. "If you're truly a Dragon, you should
really be enraged by this situation."

"…What kind of a situation is this, then?"

"A situation where the great and noble Dragons are being spent as materials
for some scenario."

Right then, my wildly-beating heart suddenly cooled down rapidly.

The Reincarnator continued on. "'Good and Evil', communicating, the
cycle of life… Inside the great themes of the <Star Stream>, Dragons have
continuously been exploited. If you're truly a Dragon, then you must enter
the Festival. Become the Final Dragon that will bring the Revelation to
reality and contribute towards the annihilation of the world. And witness
the end of the scenarios that have stolen your identity, your existence." I
carefully studied the Reincarnator.
Good and Evil, communications, Samsara… If one was a Reincarnator that
lived for a very, very long time, it was possible to experience all those
themes of the <Star Stream>.

If one was indeed a Reincarnator that lived for a really long time, that was.

I pondered for a little while before replying. "Not every story of the
scenarios is interconnected by a series of misfortunes. Some things were
discovered only because scenarios exist. You might not have been aware of
it by staying in the Isle of Reincarnators, but without a doubt, scenarios are
changing."

I hated myself for saying those words, but still, I was being genuine with at
least half of them.

I could see Yoo Joonghyuk and my allies rendezvousing with other
Constellations.

The mysterious Reincarnator watched the same scenes as me before
replying. "Changing? How did the scenarios change, then? Can Dragons or
monsters become the protagonists of the Stories now?"

"There are Stories like that already."

"However, they must be quite unpopular."

"Some are rather popular, actually. Some are even from the past, too. I'm
sure you've heard of them before? Such as, in ⸢The Song of the Nibelungs⸥,
or ⸢The Legend of Saint George⸥…"
"Dragons were never the protagonists in those stories."

Several Dragons in the air lost their way and crashed into one another
before falling back to the earth.

The Reincarnator continued on. "Dragons were always hunted beings.
Referred to as the origin of all evil, and portrayed as nothing more than
pathetic villains who kidnap human princesses or hoard mountains of gold.
When you think about it, it's a rather funny story, isn't it? Why would a
Dragon be interested in gold or females of other species?"

"Those aren't the only stories out there. There are a lot of scenarios where
Dragons come out to the human world to have fun, as well. For instance…"
"Dragons that 'polymorph into beautiful humans'. Do you really think they
are pure Dragons, then?"

I found myself unable to reply.

The Reincarnator spoke. "Tens of thousands of years ago, Dragons were
being exploited in the exact same manner. In the end, every single scenario
was meant for other species, for other Constellations."

As it continued to talk, I sensed an ominous Status leak out more and more
from its voice.

"Not one scenario has treated a Dragon as a Dragon. Dragons were always
exploited, were chained to restrictions, and were seen as the scenario's
target of subjugation. Probably, nothing has changed greatly even now.

It was getting harder and harder to breathe. The surrounding air was
shifting unstably.

The Status capable of tying a Narrative-grade Constellation like me to the
spot – the Abyssal Black Flame Dragon, roaring towards the sky until then,
hurriedly began flying in my direction.

I stared at the Black Flame Dragon and spoke up. "I'll change it."

"You will? But, how?"

"I'll make sure that Dragons don't suffer that miserable fate ever again."

[Constellation, 'Secretive Plotter', is looking at you.]

The gazes of the stars were gathering on us.
[A massive number of Constellations are looking at you.]

[Many Constellations are freaking out after seeing who is next to you!]

The 'Reincarnator' looked at me with emotionless eyes. "Interesting." Its

external appearance began changing next. It was 'polymorph', the magic

often employed by Dragons out to have 'fun'.


"Tens of thousands of years ago, there was a Dokkaebi that spoke to me of
the exact same offer. It said that it'd create a world where Dragons could
become the master of the scenario."

It felt as if everything in front of my eyes grew darker. All five of my
senses didn't want to listen to me. My dimmed vision began shaking around
uncontrollably, as Stories leaked down from my nostrils.

Shin Yoosung cheering on collapsed like a puppet with its strings cut;
blood was pouring out from Han Sooyoung's mouth and nose as she was
staring at us in shock.

Even as the tinnitus loud enough to rupture my eardrums roared on, her
message somehow managed to enter my head.

– Kim, Dokja, what, the hell, is this…

My hands and feet were shaking. I fell down on my butt, and tried hard to
raise my head up.

How could this even be called 'Status'??

[Constellation, 'Demon-like Judge of Fire', is urging you to run away!]

[Constellation, 'Queen of the Darkest Spring', is looking at you with an
urgent expression!]

[Constellation, 'Father of the Rich Night', is…!]
The boundless Dragon Voice rushed into my ears next.

[The Dokkaebi that deceived me back then has become the ⸢Dokkaebi
King⸥ now.]

The sun vanished and the whole world was now covered in something's
shadow.

The Dragon of the end times, the Final Dragon of the Book of Revelation,
unfurled its wings of Calamity at last.
                Chapter 405: Ep. 77 - Final Dragon, II


['The Fourth Wall' is violently reacting!]

The prior generation's Apocalypse Dragon flew up and generated a storm of
Stories. My vision continued to waver precariously as I wobbled about like
a scarecrow without a pole to hold me up.

In the blink of an eye, the creature reached high up in the air and screeched
out a mighty howl, seemingly killing every other noise existing in the world
at the same time. The heads of the Incarnation Bodies exploded, and the
Constellations in the battlefield began vomiting out Stories while covering
their ears.

Tsu-chuchuchuchu…

The parts of the sky where the Apocalypse Dragon flew by were torn apart
to reveal a jet-black hole.

Other Dragons flying around in sheer confusion ran away in terror, while
some of them who didn't know their place rushed in only to become bloody
sacks of meat after getting brushed by the Apocalypse Dragon's wings.
In the center of that chaotic sky, the 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' was
waiting for the Apocalypse Dragon to arrive.

[Constellation, 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon', is staring at its enemy.]

It roared out and charged at the Apocalypse Dragon. The two mighty
creatures got into a tangle and began a deadly battle in the sky.

However, rather than calling it a battle, it was closer to being fisticuffs
between an adult and a fifteen-year-old kid, instead.

[Constellation, 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon', is enraged!]

It was several sizes larger than every other Dragon, yet when compared to
its current opponent, it simply looked like a little hatchling.

"You better not lose!! If you do, I'm gonna kill you!"

Stories streamed out from Han Sooyoung's figure as she cheered for her
sponsor. Her Giant Stories were telling their stories for the sake of her
sponsor right now.

"The most destructive apocalypse! The deepest abyss! I'll say all those
words as many times as you want, so don't lose!! Please!!"

As if to answer her calls, the 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' spewed out a
powerful Breath.

Other Dragons struck by the attack fell like burning kites. It was almost as
if the entire sky was covered in the black flames.

[You're indeed a powerful Dragon. Before I went to sleep, there was no one
like you.]

[Don't make me laugh, you geezer. I didn't descend to this place just to hear
your kkondae-like rubbish.]

[It seems that I need to fix your poor manners somewhat.]
The Apocalypse Dragon dodged the Breath with a flapping of its wings and
went on the counter-offensive. It was so fast that there was no time to even
think about evading it.

Shu-wuoooo…

The Black Flame Dragon was quick-witted enough to dodge that, however.
It literally transformed into a 15-year-old boy in an instant and through the
Dragon Voice magic, activated [Meteor Strike].

The Apocalypse Dragon was struck by the falling pieces of rocks and
became enraged.

[…Polymorph? You were the same as the rest of them.]

[Screw you! You also polymorphed earlier too, geezer!]

[That is not what a pure Dragon should do.]

The Black Flame Dragon reverted back to his original form and roared out.
[I will live the way I want to! Whether it's as a human or an Orc, it's my
choice!]

[You seem to be a lacking candidate to represent all Dragons.]

Sparks danced wildly as the battle of biting and slashing continued on.

The Apocalypse Dragon silently absorbed the Black Flame Dragon's attacks
and eventually, its jaw slowly split open wide. The latter began charging up
its Breath as well.

A clash of a Breath against another Breath; thick, heavy breaths made out
of black flames collided with the Apocalypse Dragon's crimson flames.

In the ensuing moment, the colours of the sky changed instantly, followed
by the kind of heat that made me think there was a burning sun right in
front of my eyes.
Although spectacular, I couldn't stand there and admire the sight.
Reincarnators that couldn't withstand the intense heat turned into piles of
ashes as the scenes of flames dancing entrancingly engraved themselves
deeply into their minds.

[Giant Story, 'Final Dragon of the Book of Revelation', has selected its
'Final Dragon'.]

The Abyssal Black Flame Dragon was the most eligible candidate to
become the Final Dragon currently. But, if you flip that around, it also
meant that it was still not the 'Final Dragon'.

[The victor has been decided in the 'Dragon's Festival'.]

From below the churning crimson clouds, a creature powerlessly fell down
to the ground.

"Black Flame Dragon!"

Its wing skin was on fire, and its body had suffered several tears. As it fell,
its eyes were locked on me, conveying its words as if it was thoroughly
unhappy about this outcome.

⸢Ah, ah… So, I guess it was too much of an ask, fighting with only one
hand… I'll leave the rest up to you, boy.⸥
This development was exactly the same as the storyline from the original
that I knew.

The previous generation's Apocalypse Dragon possessed the power that
rivalled a masterful Myth-grade Constellation. And that Dragon would
evolve into a Calamity that surpassed far beyond the previous Status this
time around.

Han Sooyoung spat out another mouthful of blood and angrily shouted at
me. "Damn it… Kim Dokja!! This wasn't a part of your plan!"
"It's going according to the original story."

"What does that even mean?! Are things going well or not??"

I heard Yoo Joonghyuk's message coming in from behind.

– I've summoned up everyone I could manage, Kim Dokja.

Constellations were busy gathering right behind him. They were all staring
at the sky with stupefied faces.

Ku-gugugugu!

The humongous frame of the Dragon that seemed to have sucked in all the
light in this world began gathering the Probability of the <Star Stream>.

[Just what is that…?]

The Apocalypse Dragon's revival was already set in stone. A scenario
needed an incident, and this creature was that incident itself. As long as the
<Star Stream> willed for an incident to happen, its revival was a guaranteed
thing.

Back in the original story, several varied attempts were made to stop its
revival, but not one of them succeeded.

There was a reason why I stuck around searching for the Apocalypse
Dragon even though I knew that; why I chatted to it regarding the Stories
featuring Dragons, and even why the Abyssal Black Flame Dragon
sacrificed its Status to continue with the battle it was certain to lose; all of
those were to… to buy us more time.

[Giant Story, 'Final Dragon of the Book of Revelation', has begun its
storytelling!]

The smartphone inside my inner pocket began buzzing noisily and emitting
light at that moment.
⸢The Calamity from the Book of Revelation opened its eyes within the
hottest place in Hell.⸥

It seemed that the Apocalypse Dragon's revival was supposed to happen
even within the final revised version sent by tls123.

⸢Dragons that lost their lives within the extremely difficult Story roared on,
and…⸥

⸢The crimson season of the apocalypse in full swing has come knocking.⸥

The falling Dragons cried out in sorrow. The countless score of them,
sacrificed to the Story and became frozen in names only after even their
souls were ripped away from them, were paying their reverence towards
their king.

On the other side of the sky, I saw Metatron and Asmodeus; it seemed that
the conference venue's battle had ended just then.

Metatron spoke while looking up at the humongous body of the Apocalypse
Dragon.

[You have finally come, oh, Evil Dragon of Harmagedon…]

The Evil Dragon of the Giant Story, [Harmagedon]; although it was the
symbol of Evil once upon a time, even the Oldest Evil couldn't bear the
weight of this primal evil.

And that very Evil Dragon was looking down at the Constellations of 'Good
and Evil' in an aloof manner.

[Oh, aged Stories. It's now time to uphold the promise of Armageddon.]

The air exploded violently and the Apocalypse Dragon's giant frame
pierced straight through the atmosphere. An unbelievable amount of sparks
danced outside the sky where the creature had disappeared.
[The Main Scenario is being updated!]

[Calamity's Probability has exceeded the scenario's limit.]

[Scenario's difficulty is automatically being adjusted.]

[Scenario befitting the Calamity's difficulty is being reassigned.]

I knew that would happen. If I remembered correctly, the 'Apocalypse
Dragon' was the 85th main scenario's Calamity back in the original
storyline. And the 'Great War of Saints and Demons' was the 80th.

[Scenario jump has occurred!]

[Calamity's difficulty is abnormally high.]

[Due to the excessive scenario jump, abnormal conditions have developed
in your Incarnation Body.]

…

…

…
[89th Main Scenario is starting.]


  <Main Scenario #89 – Final Dragon of the Book of Revelation>

  Type: Main

  Difficulty: Indeterminable

  Clear Condition: Defend against the 'Calamity of the Book of
  Revelation'.

  Time Limit: Applicable scenario does not have a time limit.

  Reward: Giant Story related to 'Final Dragon of the Book of
  Revelation', ???

  Failure: Destruction of the <Star Stream> will accelerate.



  * This scenario will be divided into different phases. Refer to the
  System Messages for more info and prepare for the Calamity.


I calmly read the scenario messages.

…89th scenario, was it.

The scenario's number was higher than compared to the original storyline.
The thing was, the later it got in the scenarios, the higher the amount of
Probability being allowed.

Meaning, the Apocalypse Dragon about to descend would be stronger than
when it appeared in the original story.

[Calamity warning is ringing throughout the entirety of <Star Stream>!]
[Soon, the revived Apocalypse Dragon will start its actions.]

[Every region within the <Star Stream> will now be considered the location
of the 89th scenario.]

"Dokja-ssi, we've brought them all."

I looked back to find Jung Heewon and <Kim Dokja's Company>, plus the
Constellations that followed us.

Only a few hours ago, they were busy fighting each other; these were now
our new allies that Yoo Joonghyuk managed to rally together while the
Black Flame Dragon and I managed to buy us some time.

[My apologies. We didn't gather as many as we thought.]

Dionysus scratched the back of his head in embarrassment. Constellations
from <Olympus> stood behind him.

The 'Goddess of Love and Beauty', Aphrodite.

The 'Atrocious War God', Ares.

The 'Spokeswoman of Justice and Wisdom', Athena.

The 'Master of Skywalk', Hermes.

The 'Volcanic Blacksmith', Hephaistos.

The 'Pure Hunter of the Moonlight', Artemis…

They were folks responsible for creating 'Gigantomachia' with us.

[I did call Father and the fish uncle, but…]

The 'Lightning Throne' Zeus or the 'Spear that Draws the Boundaries of the
Sea' Poseidon didn't seem to have joined us. When looking back to the
splendour the Myth-grade Constellations exhibited back in 'Gigantomachia',
it sure was quite a regretful thing.
[This isn't going to be enough, right?]

"If I'm being honest, then… No, it isn't."

<Olympus> was indeed powerful, but it was still impossible to stop the
Apocalypse Dragon with only these people. If the 'First Tail-Flick' was
exactly as described in the original story, then our current combat force
would barely get to survive the first impact wave of that tail.

And then, I heard someone else's true voice.

[My old companions say that they shall aid you, 'Demon King of

Salvation'.] Blinding rays of light formed from the northern sky.

[Constellations of the Nebula, <Vedas>, have incarnated into the scenario!]

Several Constellations broke past the thick clouds accompanied by the
rapturous flames and made their entrance. The moment I saw their exterior
appearances, pages of the 'Ways of Survival' flipped open all on their own
in my head.

I expected to run into them sooner or later, but I certainly didn't think we'd
meet like this under the current circumstances.

The 'God-King of Yakshas', Kubera.

The 'Purifying Flames', Agni.

And on top of that, even the 'Unending Storm', Vayu.

They were all Narrative-grade Constellations affiliated with 'lokapala' of
<Vedas>, alongside the 'Supreme God of Light', Surya.

[Where is the bastard named Apocalypse Dragon?]

[We now have a chance to acquire a pretty decent Story after a long while.]
[Indra's wounds were too severe and he couldn't come.]

This was only the beginning.

[Constellations of the Nebula, <Papyrus>, have incarnated into the
scenario!]

From the eastern skies…

[Constellations of the Nebula, <Guardian Tree>, have incarnated into the
scenario!]

And then, from the western skies…

[Constellations of the Nebula, <Asgard>, have incarnated into the
scenario!]

[Constellations of the Nebula, <Twelve Zodiac>, have incarnated into the
scenario!]

…

One-time enemy Constellations were gathering together in front of the Star
Stream's Calamity.

Yoo Joonghyuk, Han Sooyoung, and the companions of <Kim Dokja's
Company> stood close to me as the blindingly bright stars continued to
incarnate next to us. They all carried tense expressions.

"There's no need to be so timid, everyone. We're one of them, after all."

For sure, the gazes of the Constellations looking at us were different
compared to the past. If the eyes staring at us back when <Kim Dokja's
Company> had been created were close to contempt and disdain, they were
much closer to jealousy and envy now.

<Kim Dokja's Company> had reached this far with our own strengths. And
again, we'd reach the 'Final Scenario' with our own powers.
After the Constellations of the regional conflicts that hadn't yet entered the
great battlefield joined us, the overall number easily surpassed five
hundred.

Unfortunately, there was a problem with the mentality of the newly-joining
folks.

[A Giant Story just because of a single Dragon? What a profitable business
opportunity this is.]

[All of you, scram. Our Nebula shall hunt the Apocalypse Dragon down.]

[Nope, that Apocalypse Dragon shall be hunted down by none other than
us, <Guardian Tree>.]

[Surya, will you give us a ride to that Apocalypse Dragon?]

Surya heard them yapping away and formed a dumbfounded expression.
[Have you all lost your minds? Didn't you witness what happened just
now?]

[Ah, ah. We all saw the scenario's weird 'direction'.] It was the 'Morning
Star Goddess', Vakarine, who said that as she entered the conflict zone. [It's
simply not possible for one measly little monster to possess a Status as
ridiculous as that, Surya. Maybe, you were in need of extra coins after
exiting <Vedas>?]

[We were not acti…]

[It seems that the train's conductor is scared today, so us alone should start
the conquest, then.]

Not every Constellation in the <Star Stream> knew what the Apocalypse
Dragon was. The last time it revived was already tens of thousands of years
ago, that was why.

A certain myth would come across as just another story from the distant
past even to Constellations. The length of time was more than sufficient
enough for those who survived the Calamity, and those born after it, to
forget all about it.

Metatron spoke as if to warn them. [You must all compose yourselves first.
Acting individually is inadvisable, everyone. That Apocalypse Dragon is…]

[You, shut up and stay out of this. The whole 'Great War of Saints and
Demons' Story went down the drain because of your actions.]

As if it was waiting for this moment, the System Message rang out once
more.

['Final Dragon of the Book of Revelation' has started its actions!]
               Chapter 406: Ep. 77 - Final Dragon, III




  <First Phase Alert>

  – The 'First Tail-Flick' will commence three minutes from now.

  – The 'First Tail-Flick' is the Apocalypse Dragon's 'Revival Calamity'.

  – The 'First Tail-Flick' will annihilate a quarter of <Star Stream>.


A quarter of <Star Stream> would be destroyed.

Quite literally, that was a bombshell of information.

However, the Constellations that read the scenario message didn't seem to
realize the severity of the situation.

[A quarter of us will die? So, the Bureau did have a sense of humour, then.]

[Dokkaebis have been exaggerating more and more lately.]
Most of the Constellations present here were more adept at watching the
scenarios happen, rather than clearing it. They were beings that exploited
the stories of others so that they could comfort themselves.

They were Dokkaebi's customers, and because of that, they believed the
Bureau would never create a scenario that would annihilate everyone.

Unfortunately, these people had no idea.

No idea, that certain stories in this world even turned the audience members
into the subjects of the scenario, too.

And these Constellations simultaneously dashed towards the Apocalypse
Dragon that was charging up its power just beyond the atmosphere.

[Giant Story will be ours!]

Greed was so clear to see in their eyes.

[Final Dragon of the Book of Revelation] was the scenario that replaced the
'Great War of Saints and Demons'. If they manage to bring down the
'Apocalypse Dragon' here, then they would acquire potentially the best
'Giant Story' there was.

Perhaps feeling pressured by their movements, Constellations of the
Nebulas that were already present began dashing towards the atmosphere as
well.

[Constellation, 'Morning Star Goddess', is unleashing her Status!]

[Constellation, 'God-King of Yakshas', is unleashing his Status!]

The first ones to take the lead were 'Morning Star Goddess', Vakarine, and
'God-King of Yakshas', Kubera.

[Nebula, <Guardian Tree>, is allocating Probability to its affiliated
Constellations!]
[Nebula, <Vedas>, is allocating Probability to its affiliated Constellations!]
My companions watched the distancing backs of the Constellations and
became urgent themselves.

"Shouldn't we go after them, too?"

"We must never join them," I spoke in a resolute tone of voice.

Excluding those jumping in like moths to the flames, the majority of
Constellations with many years behind them were standing still, just like us.
They already knew the result of the upcoming fight.

I kept a straight face and asked Metatron, who was wordlessly observing
the situation. "Metatron, are you going to create the 'Sealing tool for the
Apocalypse Dragon'?"

The Archangel quietly stared at me for a little while, before forming a
warm, bright smile. [Yes, of course. That's what happened back in the
1863rd turn as well. A great 'Evil' has appeared in this world, so we should
try to save everyone, don't you agree?]

As if he had already forgotten all about the struggles to kill each other a few
hours ago, Metatron's eyes were filled with an almost-holy light. I'd been
sensing that something was a bit off about him from some time ago, but I
was sure of him being utterly insane now.

"But, if that plan is successful, you'll definitely die. And with that, 'Good' in
this world will disappear."

[No. It'll be I that disappears, not 'Good'.]

It felt like I was talking to a wall. I shook my head and turned around.

I saw the 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' that had shrunk to the same size as
Biyoo, and Han Sooyoung quietly petting it. The fatigued Black Flame
Dragon spat out a lick of small flame towards the sky.

Han Sooyoung spoke. "Kim Dokja."
"What now?"

"You. You're still withholding something, aren't you?"

I flinched just a little, before asking back. "What are you talking about?"

"No, well, it's just too suspicious. Now, normally, you'd start by giving us
the information first… But, why haven't you told us anything concrete with
this scenario?" She narrowed her eyes and glared at me, before continuing
on. "You do have a way to win, right?"

"I do."

"Oh, so you can give us your assurances, then? You aren't going to resort to
another weird method, right?"

"And what might that weird method be?"

Han Sooyoung drew a straight line beneath her chin with her finger.

I grinned and replied to her. "Don't worry. I'm not going to do that."

Unfortunately, she did not look convinced. At all.

It was Shin Yoosung who followed up after that. "Ahjussi, then why did
you activate that Stigma?"

[Stigma, 'Sacrificial Will Lv.8', is currently in activation!]

The unique Stigma that I created was busying pumping more power to my
companions while floating up a message in the air.

Jung Heewon spoke. "…Can't you just switch that off now? It's been
getting on my nerves for a while now."

"And why is the Stigma's level so damn high, too…?" Lee Jihye also
grumbled loudly.
I spoke as if to make an excuse. "I only left it switched on in order to
increase your powers, everyone. Really, I'm not thinking of doing anything
weird."

This time, Lee Gilyoung jumped in. "But that Stigma, it only comes on
when you're trying to sacrifice yourself for your companions, right?"

"Ahjussi, you're lying to us again, aren't you?"

"Dokja-ssi, could you be, again…?"

Enormous amounts of Statuses rose up from my companions and that
caused the Constellations nearby to flinch and tremble slightly. Yoo
Joonghyuk watching us from a bit of distance away was about to unsheathe
his sword, too.

I hurriedly pointed at the Apocalypse Dragon.

"N-no, hang on. Now isn't the time to mind something like that. Well, a
really fun spectacle is about to start unfolding over there, so we should just
watch that."

The lengthy comet-like tails of the Constellations were about to reach the
striking distance of the Apocalypse Dragon.

"All those friends up there, they are going to die soon."

"Get ready. It's about to begin," said Yoo Joonghyuk, as he unsheathed the
[Black Heavenly Demon Sword]. "The creature's Tail-Flick is divided into
three different stages. Fitting for a powerful calamity, three separate
shockwaves will reach us."

"Three of them?"

Lee Jihye's surprised question was answered by me, instead. "It's easier to
offset the shockwaves the closer we are to their origin. And the first two
can be defended against if we do our absolute best, so you don't have to
worry too much."
The really important part, though, was the 'third shockwave'.

If we failed to defend against that, then every single one of us would be
dead, and a quarter of <Star Stream> would be blown away.

We could see the clash between the Constellations and the Apocalypse
Dragon in the far distance. The waves of light fired by Vakarine landed
directly on the Dragon's body, while Kubera's great sabre sliced into the
creature's back. It was around then that the Dragon's tail made its move.

['First Tail-Flick' is commencing!]

['First shockwave' is being generated!]

In that moment, I couldn't tell what happened.

Pure-azure light exploded in the distance. I realized much later that the light
was actually from the spark that had been condensed to an absurdly high
degree. It was the electrical shock of destruction that became the storm of
aftermaths itself after far too much of <Star Stream>'s Probability had been
gathered and spent in that one attack.

That was none other than the 'first shockwave' created by the Apocalypse
Dragon's tail.

[A measly little thing dares… Dares to…!]

Kubera, resisting until the end, roared out, while the shocked Vakarine
screamed loudly. Dozens of Constellations that challenged the Apocalypse
Dragon all unleashed their Statuses at the same time. And then…
…Something broke.

[Constellation, 'Morning Star Goddess', has been extinguished.]

[Constellation, 'God-king of Yakshas', has been extinguished.]

[Constellation, 'Deep Night's Wolf', has been extinguished.]
[Constellation…]

Indirect messages fell like raindrops.

Stars in the whole surrounding area were exploding at the same time and
turned into ashes.

Lee Jihye muttered in a dazed voice. "…You say we can withstand that?"

I had nothing to reply with. Because it was also my first time witnessing the
Tail-Flick today.

The electrical shockwave that grew even larger after burning away the
Constellations finally finished getting ready to spread to the rest of <Star
Stream>.

And we stood in its starting point.

[This is insane! Run away!]

Several terrified Constellations turned around to flee. Unfortunately for
them, that attack was not something they could outrun.

I shouted out in my true voice. [Everyone, calm down! There is a way to
block that.]

[Stop with your insane babbling! Didn't you see that??]

[Either we use Status of the same attribute to absorb the shockwave created
by the Tail-Flick, or we cancel it out with the Status of an opposing
attribute. That is, as long as we have enough Probability to shore our
efforts.]

The electrical shockwave's rate of spreading gradually gained pace. Now
rushing in at a fair knock, the wave bared its fangs at us, as if to devour us
all.

[All of you, step aside.]
A Constellation stepped forward. Blinding arcs of lightning coiled around
his figure, as he raised a giant hammer, his Star Relic, high up into the sky.

[I am the son of Odin, 'Thursday's Thunder'.]

Indeed, it was 'Thursday's Thunder', Thor, whom I'd met back in the
Gourmet Association.

[I shall bury the Apocalypse Dragon's thunder right here!]

A streak of lightning from above crashed into the Star Relic [Mjolnir]. He
sprinted forward with a vigour befitting a Viking, and without a shred of
fear, threw himself into the Apocalypse Dragon's electrical shockwave.

Tsu-chuchuchuchut!!

Surprisingly, he managed to survive against the shockwave.

The majority of the wave rushing in was being concentrated towards his
hammer, [Mjolnir]. Like an electrical rod being showered by the lightning,
his entire body writhed in pain. Every Constellation of <Asgard> was
lending him Probability.

[Ohhhhh-!!]

Not too long afterwards, every blood vessel on Thor's flesh bulged, and his
bloodshot eyes began to pop out from their sockets. His statue-like muscles
were scorched black as well. The first shockwave was not the Tail-Flick
itself, but merely a by-product of that action, yet such a measly thing was
utterly, horrifically killing a Narrative-grade Constellation.

[Uwaaaaaaah-!!]

Just as Thor could no longer endure and was about to let go of his hammer,
someone reached his side and grasped it together with him.

[…I was never interested in the myths of northern Europe before, but who
knew, you aren't so bad.]
He was someone completely unexpected, actually.

Thor freaked out and roared. [Let go! This hammer is not a relic that
someone like you can touch! Besides, you can't even handle lightning!]
[Actually, I can. Just a little. My old man is a god of lightning.] He was the
successor to the Lightning Throne.
It seemed that, after Zeus had left, Dionysus had become <Olympus>'s
successor. The only one among them who could inherit the Status of
Lightning was Zeus's descendant, after all.

[Story, 'Carnival of Lightning', has begun its storytelling!]

A Story that I could've inherited once upon a time was running amok within
Dionysus's entire figure. He gulped down a mouthful of wine from the flask
on his hips and let out a cry in exhilaration.

[Kuwaaah~! Now that's good!]

Even though he was being burnt alive by the lightning, he still formed a
hearty smile. <Asgard> and <Olympus> were cooperating, and the two
managed to endure thanks to the powers of Stories their allies sent their
way. Sadly, though, it couldn't last long; the Status of the Apocalypse
Dragon crashing down grew even bigger than what the two Nebulas had
combined. Seeing this, Surya moaned in shock.

[If only Indra was here… I never thought that I'd miss that village idiot.]

Indeed, even back in the original storyline, the first shock wave was
neutralised by the efforts of the three gods of lightning.

But then, <Kim Dokja's Company> ended up defeating Indra, and that
meant that one of the three gods was now missing.

[Isn't there anyone who can deal with lightning?]

I wasn't planning to step forward now, but there was no other choice.

"I shall help."
[You have activated 'Demon King Transformation'!]

I was not a Constellation of lightning. But, I could use something fairly
similar to that.

['5th Bookmark' has been initiated!]

[Exclusive skill, 'Electrification Lv.23(+13)', has been initiated!]

[Your current physical constitution is different from that of the applicable
character.]

[Your 'Status' has overcome the physical constitution penalty.]

The pure, untainted white light of inner energy circulated around my body.
While scattering blinding rays of electrical lights, I joined Thor and
Dionysus.

[Giant Story, 'Demon Realm's Spring', has begun its storytelling.]

[Giant Story, 'Torch that Swallowed the Myth', has begun its storytelling.]

The two Giant Stories supported me as the storm of electricity pounced on
my body.

Dionysus said that this was exhilarating; yup, he was definitely out of his
mind.

[It's quite tolerable after a drink or two. Would you like some?]

Dionysus said those words, his entire lower half scorched black now. Thor,
now resembling jet-black charcoal, cackled from the side.

['Demon King of Salvation', looks like we'll die together in this place.]

[Dying together with you might go on to create a pretty good story, indeed.
Let us become a story passed down through generations, together!]

[Hmph, will that story be <Asgard>'s, or belong to <Olympus>?]
[Let's stop with the inane banter and concentrate.]

Mind-numbing pain rushed in from the palm of my hands.

Thor, Dionysus, and I stood against the waves of electricity like a levee.
And the first shockwave's encroaching speed gradually lessened.

Somehow, we needed to withstand this. Just a little bit more. A bit more.

Unfortunately, the speed at which we were being forced back was still
much faster than the rate that the shockwave's speed decreased.

Dionysus cried out.

[Damn it, it's going to overflow…!]

If the electrical energy was discharged like this, then all of our companions
behind us would be dead.

We knew this, yet we had no way of stopping the shockwave's march. Just
before I could shout out to them, telling them to evacuate…

…Someone's hands supported our precarious embankment from behind.

There was another god of lightning left?

Well, there were quite a few beings capable of dealing with lightning in the
stories scattered around the world, so… However, I couldn't immediately
think up of anyone. On top of that, the rate of absorbing the electrical shock
far surpassed not just my own, but both Thor's and Dionysus's, as well. Just
where did a Constellation like him…?

[It seems that you were negligent with your training, judging from your
inability to withstand this level of electrical shock.]

The moment I heard those words, a hollow chuckle left my lips.

Thor was taken back greatly and he quickly asked a question. [Who might
you be? I've never seen a Constellation like you before.]
Those words caused the great, noble Status to waver, as its owner began
emitting auras of rage.

People would often say that a handsome man's face was on the smaller side;
in that case, there would be no one in the world more good-looking than
this man right here.

[I'm not a Constellation.]

I stupidly had forgotten all about him.

I had forgotten that the one who could handle electrical energy the best in
<Star Stream> was not a Constellation, but this man. As his azure-coloured
hair scattered in the air, his own pure, untainted white electrical energy
exploded forth.

[I am Kyrgios Rodgraim, the teacher of this lazy pupil.]
               Chapter 407: Ep. 77 - Final Dragon, IV


The first shockwave gradually petered out after Kyrgios joined us. The
difference between three lightning-related Constellations working together
and four was rather noticeable.

Not only that, but a portion of Constellations also lent us their Probability
after Kyrgios showed up, and for the first time ever, our own Probability
surpassed the Apocalypse Dragon's shockwave.

[Uwooooooh-!]

Scorched black by the electrical wave, Thor and Dionysus began roaring
out as if they had gone half-mad. The latter had drunk such a large quantity
of wine that his face was completely red, even though the rest of his body
remained jet-black.

[Booze is going down so smoothly, it's so amaaaazing!]

[Now I'm really curious about the taste of <Olympus> label booze. Give me
some!]
By the time the storm of aftermath for the first shockwave drew to a close,
the two Constellations became completely drunk out of their minds.
Kyrgios stared at them with criticising eyes before asking me. [My
disciple. Are these fools your companions?] "No, total strangers."

[First Phase has concluded.]

[Congratulations. You have safely negotiated the first shockwave of the
'First Tail-Flick'!]

…We did it. We managed to withstand that damn tail flick's first hurdle.

I looked behind me. "Everyon…"

I couldn't continue on. Because a desolate, ruined landscape greeted me,
with a sea of corpses burnt by the electrical waves filling it up. Some of
them were swept up by the electrical energy we couldn't hold back, while
some of them died after their Incarnation Bodies exploded, unable to deal
with the storm of aftermath taking place nearby.

The five hundred-plus Constellations were reduced to less than half that
number through just one encounter. What an utterly fraudulent death toll
that was.

…Could I even claim that we managed to endure when it was like this?

It was just the first phase, so what would we do about the second and the
third one?

I raised my head and saw the messages from the stars brightening the night
sky as if they were losing their minds.

[The absolute majority of Constellations are stunned by the difficulty of this
scenario!]

[Many Constellations are lodging complaints at the Bureau in regards to the
applicable scenario's Probability!]
[A portion of Constellations are arguing that this scenario cannot exist.]

[The majority of Constellations are requesting for the scenario's
cancellation.]

Scenario's cancellation, was it.

What a funny thing this was, there still being idiots daydreaming about stuff
like that.

[Applicable scenario cannot be cancelled.]

[All Constellations within the applicable scenario's area are urged to
prepare for the next phase.]

No, the apocalypse would carry on.

While the messages from the Constellations freaking out continued on, the
baptism of sponsorship messages also rained down from the other side of
the sky as well.

[Constellation, 'Lightning Throne', is looking closely at you.]

[Constellation, 'Spear That Draws the Boundaries of the Sea', is glaring at
you.]

[Constellation, 'Great Mother God Who Created Man out of Earth', is
getting interested in the Story you might earn.]

[Final Scenario's Constellations are focusing on you.]

[Final Scenario's Constellations are enjoying your actions.]

[3,000,000 Coins have been sponsored.]

The Constellations of the 'Final Scenario', including the likes of the
'Lightning Throne' Zeus, the 'Spear That Draws the Boundaries of the Sea'
Poseidon, and even the 'Great Mother God Who Created Man out of Earth',
Nuwa.
The existences lording over the top stratosphere of <Star Stream> who
didn't participate in this scenario, but didn't feel threatened by the unfolding
events from the get-go, were there at the 'Final Scenario'.

The location for that scenario was excluded from the 'First Tail-flick's' area
of destruction.

Even the destruction of their fellow Constellations was nothing more than a
type of entertainment to those on the cusp of reaching the 'end' of this
world.

[Second Phase will commence ten minutes later.]

A ten-minute interval, was it.

I breathed a sigh of relief and looked back at Kyrgios. I sensed that his
Status had grown even greater than before.

"You must've reached another enlightenment, Master."

[It seems that you're now at the level to discern that, at least.]

Kyrgios's complaining voice sounded thorny. Not only were his looks
enough to slap Yoo Joonghyuk's face silly, but even the way he spoke
slapped the latter silly, too.

Lee Jihye sprinted to where we were and began shaking me by the
shoulders. "Ahjussi!! I thought we'd end up as grilled squid, you know!"

And why did this kid have to go and use that kind of figure of speech…

"Kyrgios grandpa! Where's my Grand Master? Didn't she come with you?"

[The Breaking the Sky Saint has some matter to take care of first, so she'll
arrive later.] He replied in a cold tone of voice and peered at me from the
corners of his eyes before turning his head away. [I thought that my disciple
would've been half-dead by now and came in a hurry. But I see that he's far
healthier than I hoped.]
I couldn't tell whether he was rueful or relieved from his tone of voice.

"If you arrived any later, never mind half-dead, I'd have been really dead,
you know. Let's not worry about that, though. We need to get ready for the
second phase."

As if he was waiting for it, Yoo Joonghyuk approached us as soon as my
words ended.

"According to the tale of Harmagedon passed down, the attribute for the
'Second Shockwave' is intense heat."

The Apocalypse Dragon's tail in the far-off distance was visibly getting
redhot. Although it looked to be moving at a very slow speed from here, the
truth was, that tail was vibrating at a scarcely-believable speed right now.

That intense friction heat was powerful enough to distort the axis of
spacetime itself.

Shin Yoosung grasped my jet-black scorched wrist and spoke. "Ahjussi,
about the next phase…"

The moment I saw the determined eyes of both her and Lee Gilyoung, I
understood what they wanted to say. But Yoo Joonghyuk butted in first.
"You two must stay back."

That cold-sounding declaration caused the two kids to immediately lash
back.

"Why?? We're also <Kim Dokja's Company>, you know!"

"What do you know, you sooty bastard! I wasn't asking you anyway!"

Lee Gilyoung's provocation was met with Yoo Joonghyuk's emotionless
reply. "This isn't the issue of your willingness, but effectiveness. You two
do not possess any Stigma or skills related to 'fire'."
In order to cancel the shockwave, we needed the 'Statuses' of a similar
attribute. Unfortunately for Shin Yoosung and Lee Gilyoung, though, they
didn't possess any skills related to the fire-type attribute.

Gilyoung's shoulders trembled as if he was furious; he eventually shouted
out. "In that case, you also can't fight, then! You don't have stuff like that
either!"

"But, I do."

The corner of Yoo Joonghyuk's lips curled up as he lifted up his sword.
And in the following second, the blade of the [Black Heavenly Demon
Sword] was enveloped in a fire-type sword aura.

[Character, Yoo Joonghyuk, has activated 'Furious Flame God Blade
Lv.???'.]

"You… You…!"

I gently patted the tearful Lee Gilyoung's shoulders.

As stated clearly in the original storyline, Yoo Joonghyuk possessed almost
every attribute there was.

…Hey, now that I thought about it, this guy also possessed lightning-based
attribute, so why didn't he lend a helping hand earlier?

Yoo Joonghyuk was glaring at me with his narrowed eyes. "Have you
forgotten how you pleaded with us not to aid you?"

"Ahh, I did that, didn't I," I replied, before flinching just a little.

This guy, I haven't said anything yet, so how did he read my mind?

"I shall announce the Constellations that will partake in the next phase."

Yoo Joonghyuk, already finding himself in the middle of the
Constellations, began his selection process.
A calamity, unprecedented in the history of the <Star Stream>, had come
knocking, and for the first time ever, Constellations were exposed to the
threat of their complete death.

Under Yoo Joonghyuk's command, these head-strong and proud
Constellations found themselves positioned on the frontline one by one.

[I've heard that you're a Regressor. Does that mean you have information on
this situation?]

"Of course I do."

A faint trace of trust could be seen within the eyes of the Constellations.
The more urgent the situation was, the more valuable information would
get. The rumours of Yoo Joonghyuk doing the rounds among the
Constellations were helping his attempt to instruct them.

He only took the blink of an eye to finish distributing the fighting force,
standing in the middle of the frontline himself.

Han Sooyoung watched him do that and muttered softly. "…Well, he's the
'Supreme King', alright."

Jung Heewon next to her nodded her head while polishing her sword.
"Well, he does have some parts that we have to acknowledge, that's for
sure."

"It pains me to say it, but after <Han Sooyoung Corporation>, <Yoo
Joonghyuk Company> might be the next most suitable alternative for our
Nebula's name."

"Before the top representative changes, we should create a labour union
first, though."

"A labour union, is it…"
Han Sooyoung smirked deeply and looked at Jung Heewon. They were
working together in the advance party for the 'intense heatwave'.

The [Black Flame] of the Black Flame Dragon contained the Status of red
flame, and Uriel's [Hellfire] was permeated with the strength of Hell's
flames. So, it was the same thing as these two being the strongest main
force in the current frontline.

"I never figured that we'd ever get to fight side-by-side."

"It's the same story for me, too."

Jung Heewon blew away the specks of dust clinging on to her [Sword of
Judgement].

That hard blade with its dull lustre – Han Sooyoung had clashed against
that blade on the stage of 'Proof of Stars' a long time ago.

Afterwards, she never had the chance to talk to Jung Heewon like this,
oneon-one. Well, they didn't really have anything to say to each other, and
she wasn't really talented when it came to that sort of conversation, so that
couldn't be helped.

Even if that was the case, she still had to ask Jung Heewon for an
explanation this time. "…By the way, why are you still lugging around
that?"

"Ah, this?" Jung Heewon looked at the huge 'luggage' on her back and
formed a bitter smile.

Lee Hyunsung could be seen wrapped tightly on a cross made out of steel
frame.

"This is the only way that I can protect him."

"…But, he looks as if he's already met his noble end, though? Where did
you even find a cross, anyway?"
"My sponsor."

[Constellation, 'Demon-like Judge of Fire', is nodding her head in
satisfaction.]

"…You know, this sight comes across as a bit blasphemous somehow. Is
Uriel really an Angel?"

"Weeeell, even a Demon King is like that, so it's fine."

The two women's gazes shifted towards the back of the ranks almost
simultaneously.

Kim Dokja was among those Constellations sitting outside the ranks. With
a melancholic look on his face, he was pressing the ground with his finger.
It was as if he was scribbling something down there.

Han Sooyoung spoke first. "Is he writing a will?"

"That might be. I mean, doesn't he make that sort of a face before he's about
to sacrifice himself?" Jung Heewon gritted her teeth as if she had had
enough already. "If he goes and does something like that again, I'm really
going to…!"

['First Tail-Flick' is recommencing!]

It was then, a humongous explosion of light could be seen at the far front of
the battleline.

"Get ready."

Along with Yoo Joonghyuk's signal, Constellations all gripped their
weapons tightly.

[Constellation, 'Demon-like Judge of Fire', is issuing clear warnings!]

The wave of the intense heat burned brightly. After seeing those sun-like
red flames that burned away everything in the heavens and on earth without
discrimination, Han Sooyoung spoke in a fed-up voice. "God damn it, if
only my Black Flame Dragon wasn't defeated…"

[Constellation, 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon', says he has underestimated
his opponent.]

[Constellation, 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon', says that if he had started
fighting with both of his hands…]

"Will you just shut up!"

And then, the intense heatwave swallowed the Constellations up.

Kugugugugugu!!

Stuck in the middle of the flooding wave of flames, Han Sooyoung
desperately activated [Black Flame]. The Black Flame Dragon's Status
permeated her entire being, and the heat from the wave was rapidly
absorbed into her body. It felt as if her head was blanking out and all the
Stories she'd lived so far were melting away.

…Kim Dokja was enduring against something like this?

The fact that Jung Heewon was next to her proved to be a small
consolation. No, not just her, but Constellations who were second to none
when it came to wielding fire were guarding her sides, too.

The one who perhaps best represented that was 'Purifying Flame' Agni,
over by the very front of the line, defending against the crashing wave of
flames by himself.

He'd be one of the strongest Constellations within <Vedas> after one
excluded the three Myth-grade gods of that Nebula. And, as befitting a
powerful Constellation, he was pouring out so much power that his entire
being was now lit up on fire as he withstood the intense heatwave. Hell,
even the whites of his eyes were showing…

"…Hey, that idiot is actually burning to death!!"
Along with the noise of "ta-dat", Agni's body began crumbling away in
ashes. That served as the starting point, and the screams of Constellations
reverberated from everywhere next.

[Kuwaaaaak!!]

Their line was being forced back with a speed far quicker compared to
when pushing back against the electrical wave. Constellations melting
down from the intense heatwave writhed around in pain, while the
advancing flames used them as their firewood to increase the intensity of
their heat.

They were losing.

Han Sooyoung's eyes, currently being protected by Status, felt as if they
were now going blind. The heat nearing her nose made it difficult to even
breathe. Before she had noticed it, the intense heatwave had reached right
before her.

Jung Heewon breathlessly cried out. "Uriel!!"

Uriel's and the Black Flame Dragon's powers increased and a momentary
defensive wall was created. The intense heatwave seemed to waver just for
a second there, but then, it began forcing back their Statuses once more, bit
by bit.

Han Sooyoung's and Jung Heewon's shoulders were pressed against each
other as they continued to endure. Energies from both Black Flame Dragon
were gradually seeping away, as well.

From the beginning, the Dragon had already spent a lot of its strength
fighting in the 'Dragon Festival', and due to the partial destruction of
<Eden>, Uriel was unable to receive her share of Probability and so, her
condition was about the same.

[Nebula, <Vedas>, is withdrawing a portion of their Probability.]

[Nebula, <Papyrus>, is withdrawing a portion of their Probability.]
Even the Nebulas supplying them with Probability began withdrawing one
by one.

But, that was only obvious; if they were to spend more Probability than
what their Giant Stories could afford, then even if they managed to earn a
new Giant Story now, they would still be losing out at the end, anyway.

From their perspective, getting annihilated by the Apocalypse Dragon or by
the storm of Probability's aftermaths was just about the same now.

Through her bloodstained, dried-up lips, Han Sooyoung spoke. "Damn it, I
shouldn't have been worried about Kim Dokja."

"Worried about me?"

For a moment there, she thought she felt a certain sense of refreshment
enter her, and soon, a familiar power enveloped her and Jung Heewon's
backs.

Han Sooyoung grumbled loudly. "Are you finished writing your will?"

"…What are you on about?"

[Nebula, <Kim Dokja's Company>, is supplying you with Probability.]

In <Star Stream>, Probability was one's wish, a dream; a desire not to give
up until the end on the story that everyone else had given up on already.

The ardent wishes of a small number of people who hadn't given up on the
scenario were supporting them now.

Han Sooyoung bitterly smiled. "How foolish…Why didn't you all run
away, then?"

"Where can we even go, anyway?"

Lee Jihye advanced forward while firing the cannons of the [Turtle
Dragon]. The battleship built with futuristic technology and its hard exterior
blocked the intense heatwave instead of Jung Heewon's and Han
Sooyoung's crumbling bodies.

[Giant Story, 'Next City', is crumbling away.]

Lee Jihye writhed in pain as she tried to endure against the flames all by
herself. No matter how powerful [Turtle Dragon] was as a Story weapon, it
was never designed for this sort of situation.

Han Sooyoung cried out in despair. "Damn it! Doesn't matter who it is, just
hurry up and help! There are lots of you with fire attributes, right?!"
Unfortunately, not a single one in the night sky replied to her.

[The absolute majority of Constellations are watching the Nebula, <Kim
Dokja's Company>.]

[The absolute majority of Constellations are evacuating from the intense
heatwave!]

[Constellations of the 'Final Scenario' are watching this scenario.]

Weak Constellations were too occupied with running away, while the truly
strong ones seemingly didn't want to miss this grand show.

"…Is it really only us?"

Turtle Dragon's external layer melted away, and Yoo Joonghyuk quickly
carried the unconscious Lee Jihye on his back as he continued to activate
Furious Flame God Blade.

The intense heatwave that managed to burn everything away in the
surroundings began flooding their position once more with a scale they
couldn't possibly defend against this time.

Not even Uriel, not even the Black Flame Dragon, not even the 'Maritime
War God', not even Kyrgios and that Yoo Joonghyuk…
"Thank you for holding on until now."

…And then, Kim Dokja spoke up. "It's fine now. I was confused a bit
earlier. Well, it was my first time doing it, that's why."

Before Han Sooyoung could ask what he was talking about, something
suddenly rose up from the ground behind her. That was where Kim Dokja
had been squatting earlier. There was a hexagram of darkness spread out
widely on the ground, and something was being summoned through that
very hexagram.

Kwa-kwakwakwakwa!

A gigantic frame began blocking the incoming heatwave head-on. Han
Sooyoung's brows rose up high. "…Pluto?"

That 'something' turned out to be the Giant Soldier Pluto. However, it was
no ordinary Pluto, either. There was no way that it'd be able to withstand
that intense heat even if it was the Giant Soldier.

Kuwaaaaah-!!

The one riding inside Pluto was blocking the wave all alone when various
Narrative-grade Constellations had failed to endure it previously.

Han Sooyoung saw the chilling, dangerous-looking scythe held by the
Giant Soldier and instantly figured out who it was. The thing was, the Story
weapon Pluto didn't originally belong to Kim Dokja.

[Giant Story, 'Underworld', has begun its storytelling.]

Even if it was a story where only a handful wished to see, the scale of
Probability changed depending on who that handful of people was. And the
existence that appeared now was a grand being who could handle such
Probability all by himself.
[Constellation, 'Father of the Rich Night', has incarnated into the scenario!]

He was the Constellation that protected <Olympus>'s hottest Hell.

The Myth-grade Constellation, Hades, had descended on the battlefield
with <Underworld> in tow.
                Chapter 408: Ep. 77 - Final Dragon, V


The dark but warm current of air approached us from behind. Since I knew
whose Status that was, a subtle little grin automatically formed on my lips.

[To make <Underworld> be responsible for the Probability needed for
summoning…]

"I'm still at an age where I'd like to rely on my parents."

[I heard that youths of the Korean Peninsula become independent early in
their lives, but I guess I was wrong.]

I recalled the day I left the relatives' place for lodging in a hostel. I was
seventeen back then.

I shrugged my shoulders and smiled. "Well, a young man like myself is
needed to keep the balance, you know."

[Constellation, 'Queen of the Darkest Spring', has incarnated into the
scenario!]
Abruptly, a corner of my heart began tingling just a little. I ended up
remembering the empty spots reserved for my parents during school events,
back when I was still a student.

I always wondered how my friends felt back then. What did it feel like,
having someone fill up those spots, having someone who'd come to you
when you called out to them?

[Constellation, 'Queen of the Darkest Spring', has unleashed her Status!]

And now, I thought I could finally understand what they felt back then.

Persephone stood beside me and while looking at Hades blocking the
intense wave of heat, spoke. [But, we agreed that it's my turn to ride Pluto
this time… him and his short fuse.]

The heat blocked by Hades spread out like ashes in the air. Perhaps
realizing that a powerful opponent had appeared, the Apocalypse Dragon
strengthened its momentum as well.

Kuwaaaaah-!!

Pluto at the far front was getting slowly pushed back as it continued to deal
with the intense heat. That made sense, though; Hades was yet to fully
unleash his Status.

[Constellation, 'Father of the Rich Night', is wobbling as he looks back at
his wife.]

[I told you that it'd be not possible with you alone, didn't I?]

[Constellation, 'Father of the Rich Night', is looking at his wife with an
unfortunate expression.]

Judging from the unfolding situation, I could more or less tell what was
going on here. On the armour of Pluto, with Hades inside, Stories were
wiggling about and going on a rampage.
[Story, 'Listening to One's Wife Would Get You Tteok Even When You're
Asleep' has begun its storytelling!]

Persephone sighed grandly and raised her hands up as if to conduct a
concert. And right afterwards, small, musical-note-like objects began
floating up from the tips of her fingers.

Like the introduction of a classical piece, the Story started opening up.

[Constellation, 'Queen of the Darkest Spring', is mobilising <Underworld>'s
Probability!]

Hades wasn't the only ruler of <Underworld>. Indeed, Persephone was not
'Queen Consort', but the 'Queen Regnant'. Meaning, these two possessed an
equal amount of shares of <Underworld>.

Hades's attributes were darkness and fire. The guardian of <Olympus>'s
night and hell was finally rousing up his true Status.

[Constellation, 'Father of the Rich Night', is unleashing his Status!]

For a moment there, an incredible impact force akin to my entire body
being smacked around overwhelmed me. I wobbled about, my vision
dizzily shaking around, but still, I raised my head to see Pluto standing up
there like an incarnation of darkness and fire.

[Final Scenario's Constellations are very dissatisfied!]

[Final Scenario's Constellations are keeping a wary eye on 'Father of the
Rich Night'!]

[Final Scenario's Constellations are complaining about <Underworld>'s
interference!]

[A great number of Constellations are impressed by the participation of
'Father of the Rich Night'!]

Kwa-kwakwakwakwa!
Agni from <Vedas> was dead, while the Constellations tasked with dealing
with fire from both <Asgard> and <Emperor> had run off quite some time
ago. As for Surya, he was using the rays of light from himself to generate
something similar to flames and continue his fight that way, but half of his
Story had disintegrated already. This was the power of the Calamity that
hundreds of Constellations couldn't stop.

And Hades was blocking that Calamity by himself.

[Hades, hasn't it been a while since you completely cut loose like this?]

Hades roared out, and Persephone continued her vigorous conducting in
synch with his roar. Stories flowing out from her hands permeated into
Pluto's entire frame.

This was the power of <Underworld>, having long been obscured under
<Olympus>'s shadow. They were finally proving themselves.

[Story Weapon, 'Pluto', is using the Star Relic, 'Aegis Shield'!]

Constellations from <Olympus> also added their powers, as well. Athena
lent her own shield, while others sacrificed Probability of their own Giant
Stories to lend their strengths.

Up until now, I always thought that the Constellations of the night sky
weren't all that impressive. But then, I realized for the first time ever, today,
that my thoughts should change.

[Many Constellations are grateful for the King of Underworld's
incarnation.]

[The absolute majority of Constellations are respectful of 'Father of the
Rich Night'.]

[The absolute majority of Constellations are singing the praises of 'Queen
of the Darkest Spring'!]
Now that I've gotten to witness Hades valiantly defending against the
destruction of the world, I could truly appreciate what 'myth' was for the
first time in my life.

The willingness to risk his life when confronted by the world's doom;
maybe, that was the epic of heroes that the 1st generation of Dokkaebis
wanted to show to the Constellations.

"Why are you so dazed like that? It's not over yet, so get your act together."

I looked back to find Yoo Joonghyuk and his stiff expression glaring at me.
He too had been sacrificing himself for the greater cause. What would he be
thinking of right now as he watched Hades?

[Hahaha, hey, subway grasshopper man! This is my true power! Keke,
kekekeke!]

Kim Namwoon's voice came out from Pluto's head.

Ah, so he was also there, wasn't he.

[Constellation, 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon', is enjoying Pluto's madness.]

Yup, definitely a couple from the original storyline…

[Second Phase will come to an end soon.]

In any case, the current situation was favourable for us. The flames of the
intense heatwave decreased at a rapid rate, and Hades was ably defending
against that. Pluto's durability seemed more than enough for the job at hand,
and the number of Constellations adding their Probability also was
increasing bit by bit.

How long passed by like that? Finally, the flames of the intense heatwave
were extinguished.

[Second Phase has concluded.]
[Congratulations. You have safely negotiated the second shockwave of the
'First Tail-Flick'!]

We were able to withstand this phase, all because everyone worked
together.

If Jung Heewon and Han Sooyoung didn't try their best, if Lee Jihye didn't
charge forward with her battleship, if the Underworld's couple didn't arrive
on time…

If just one part of that was missing, then we couldn't have stopped it.

[The absolute majority of Constellations are enjoying this 'Giant Story'.]

[Final Scenario's Constellations are uncomfortable with this 'Giant Story'.]

Finally, we had managed to survive two out of the three phases.

All phases of the 'First Tail-Flick' needed to be subjugated at the beginning
in order to minimise the damage. If this was back in the original story,
dozens of Nebulas would have been destroyed by now and at least
oneeighth of the sky, crumbled away to oblivion.

And some spare time to get ready for the last phase should be given to us
again.

Ku-gugugugu!

"Dokja-ssi! Over there!"

I quickly looked back after hearing Jung Heewon's voice, and discovered
something flooding out from the Apocalypse Dragon's tail.

But, the intense heatwave phase had come to an end already? This couldn't
be.

Metatron spoke up as if to put a voice to my thoughts. [It's a lot quicker
than expected.]
[Scenario's Probability is being adjusted due to the entrance of Myth-grade
Constellations.]

[Scenario's Probability has increased the phase progression speed.]

['Third Phase' will begin in thirty seconds.]

As if to stop the start of the phase, Hades used his Status to pressure the
Apocalypse Dragon. Even Persephone and other Constellations were
looking really concerned right now.

[…My son.]

If the third phase got underway now, then not even Hades would be able to
stop it.

His attributes were darkness and fire; meaning, he was not a suitable
Constellation to defend against the third shockwave.

I asked Metatron. "How long until the seal is complete?"

[I'm not certain if it can be done in time.]

A faint trace of despair seemed to have dyed the Archangel's expression. He
must've been in the middle of finally realizing what he had done.

[I shall buy us time.]

It was Michael who said that; he had been saving up his Status up until
now. Maybe he was stimulated by Hades's actions earlier, because he began
unleashing all of his Status and flapping his wings.

He was half 'Good' and half 'Evil'.

Metatron looked at the Story appearing on Michael's face and spoke up.
['Demon King of Salvation'. I'm sure you know this already. The third
shockwave can only be resisted by existences possessing the power of
'Chaos'.]
The shockwave began stirring in the distance.

The previous two shockwaves we had experienced were, technically
speaking, not real 'shockwaves', but simply the harbinger of the third wave.
What we were about to face off against now was the true 'First Tail-flick'
itself.

Metatron asked. [You also have someone on your side with the power of
'Chaos', don't you?]

I scanned my companions as well as other Constellations.

Honestly speaking, there was no point in doing that. Not even Yoo
Joonghyuk could use the 'Chaos' attribute.

Because 'Chaos' was not an attribute, but more like an anti-attribute, that
was why. Now originally, 'Chaos' was not a power Constellations or
Demon Kings were permitted to enjoy.

[Power of 'Fruit of Good and Evil' is wiggling inside you.]

But then, I was both a Constellation and a Demon King, an existence that
couldn't be categorised as either.

A Demon King who had consumed the 'Fruit of Good and Evil'.

[It should be possible with you.]

I nodded my head.

The nature of 'Chaos' was disorder. If it was me who went against the order
of both, it'd be possible to go up against the power of Chaos, too.

It was then, someone grasped my shoulder.

"I can also do this."

"Heewon-ssi?"
I saw the Ring of Chaos within Jung Heewon's eyes. Her hair, now
bleached pure white, slowly danced upwards under the mysterious and
ominous aura.

I instantly realized what she had awakened as.

"Very well. Let's give it a shot."

I then looked up into the sky.


Actually, I had been searching for a certain Constellation's presence in the
night sky for a while now, but unfortunately, I couldn't sense it. If that guy
helped us out, we'd be able to overcome this somehow. I even had a plan in
mind for that, too…

['Third Phase' is commencing!]

It seemed that it was too late now.

[Demon King, 'King of the Corrupted Angels', is unleashing his Status!]

[Constellation, 'Saviour of the Corrupted', is unleashing his Status!]

One existence who possessed two Modifiers – Michael displayed his true
power and rushed towards the forefront. Indeed, those Statuses were more
than enough to make him feel confident about himself.

[Judgement Field.]

His speciality that almost wrung me to death in the past began stretching
out towards the shockwave of Chaos. It was the wall of judgement,
bestowed onto this world through the divine grace.

Kwa-kwakwakwakwa!!

The so-called invincible Field was easily shattered, however. Forget about
defending against the wave, it couldn't even buy one second. Michael
screamed loudly as he watched his [Judgement Field] shatter like glass.
The Calamity of the 89th scenario, the Chaos's shockwave that had far
surpassed that of the original storyline, proceeded to crush Michael's body
and utterly disintegrate him.

Yoo Joonghyuk's voice resounded out from behind me. "Dodge it!!"

It seemed that Yoo Joonghyuk had realized something was off. This
shockwave was definitely on another realm compared to the previous two.

I finished making up my mind and was about to step forward, but then,
Jung Heewon stood in my way.

"Heewon-ssi."

"Please shut up. I knew something like this would happen."

Her back, turned towards me, didn't show any movement – as if she knew
what I was trying to do. Lee Hyunsung's giant frame was still dangling on
her back. I saw his sleeping face, having fallen into the steel-like slumber in
order to protect someone.

I opened my lips again. "Heewon-ssi. If someone must risk their life,
then…"

"Don't even try it. I'll really go crazy if you do."

[Story, 'Demon King of Salvation', has begun its storytelling.]

[Giant Story, 'Demon Realm's Spring', has begun its storytelling.]

As if resonating with her emotions, the two Stories began telling their
stories. They were acquired through experiencing similar circumstances.

[Stigma, 'Sacrifice's Will Lv.8', is currently active.]

And this Stigma was acquired by going through similar situations, too. I
was aware of how much this Stigma hurt Jung Heewon.
Even then, I still had to say it. "If that wave isn't stopped here, Hyunsung-
ssi will die."

I had to become more callous than anyone.

"There is a way to stop that. If you were me, Heewon-ssi, what would you
have done?"

"I don't want to hear it, so please!"

Jung Heewon turned around, her eyes red with tears.

"Yes, you do have a way! I know already! You're someone like that,
Dokjassi! You always have a damn, stinking plan that only you know, and
when you use it, you'll end up dying!"

"I think you're mistaken about something. I'm not going to die."

She didn't possess the skill [Lie Detection].

"Now is a different story compared to in the past. Heewon-ssi, you and our
other companions have changed, yes? I've chosen to do this because I
believe in you. That is why…" I spoke while turning my head away.
"Heewon-ssi. You must save me later."

I used the powers of [Way of the Wind] and [Electrification] to blow her
back to the rear.

"Kim Dokj…!!"

The moment I greeted the shockwave rushing towards my face, I roared out
in my true voice with everything I had. [Surya!!]

At the end of my roar, a train rushing forward from behind picked me up.
As it was created in haste, the train looked rather bizarre, what with only its
front portion existing.

[Let's go.]
As I sensed Surya's Status supporting me from behind, the train set off.

[Giant Story, 'Torch that Swallowed the Myth', has begun its storytelling!]

The train used the Giant Story as its fuel to advance forward – past the
fragments of Stories and towards the Chaos's shockwave.

Kwa-dudududuk!!

Accompanied by the impact force akin to my entire body being shattered
into pieces, the debris of the train flew about all over the place.

Michael's half-destroyed Incarnation Body trapped within the storm was
now looking at me. [You bastard…!]

I went past him and continued to press forward. It felt as if my
consciousness was fading away. [The Fourth Wall] continued to issue
warning bells, and all the Stories I possessed screamed out in pain.

They were shouting out in one voice that we couldn't withstand this. That
we'd all die for sure.

Beyond the shockwave that reverted all existence back to nothingness, I felt
the Apocalypse Dragon's gaze land on me.

[You cannot stop this.]

I felt that gaze and smirked.

You're right. I can't stop you. Well, you're not a mere lifeform that can be
killed, but the 'calamity' itself, after all. You're 'something' that far exceeds
Constellations and Demon Kings.

There was no way that a lone Constellation could resist against such a
Calamity.

However, I knew of another Calamity of this magnitude.
[Constellations of <Star Stream> have figured out your scheme and are
freaking out!]

[Final Scenario's Constellations are greatly astonished by your plan!]

[All Dokkaebis in the Bureau are looking at the scenario's Probability…]

A scarcely-believable amount of sparks exploded and went on a frenzy in
the air. Simply trying to call out its name caused such a reaction. I let all the
Probability the Constellations had gathered explode out into the open space,
and called out the name of a certain creature one more time.

A creature that, even though they knew its true name, no one would dare to
invite to their scenario.

[Come! ■■■■■!!]

Beyond the shockwave, <Star Stream>'s outer space could be seen; the
storm of aftermaths produced by the misaligned Probability was rushing in.

The march of the gigantic fog of darkness began erasing the traces of stars
and nebulas. I was overcome by shuddering powerful enough to nearly
blank my mind as the giant eye on the far, far side of that seemingly-infinite
fog fixed its gaze on this side.

I witnessed that thing back in the 73rd Demon Realm a while ago. Back
then, it was merely a clone. It was a different story this time, however.

['Indescribable Distance' is looking down on 'Final Dragon of the Book of
Revelation'.]

The Outer God born within the Chaos; the greater calamity that brought
about the destruction of my Demon Realm was now approaching the Isle of
Reincarnators.
                   Chapter 409: Ep. 78 - Twist/轉, I


Every muscle on my body ached as if I had been thoroughly beaten up.

I had blacked out for a second but regained my consciousness somehow. I
vomited out Stories and opened my eyes within the pitch-black empty
space. I couldn't see a single thing nearby, but I already knew where I was.

['Indescribable Distance' is glancing at you.]

The 'Indescribable Distance', also known as the Nameless Mist.

I ran into this guy's clone back in the 73rd Demon Realm.

With nothing but the strength of a clone, this guy destroyed my Demon
Realm, and went on to break Narrative-grade Constellations and
Transcendents alike.

And here I was, right inside the mouth of one Calamity that I dearly wished
not to meet again.
⸢Kim Dokja thought to himself. This is the only way to stop the Apocalypse
Dragon.⸥
…Right. I was wondering why you were keeping quiet until now.

⸢In order to stop the world's calamity, summon yet another one. Only
someone like the Regressor Yoo Joonghyuk might come up with such an
idea.⸥

I looked at the Fourth Wall's messages floating up in the air and chuckled
wryly.

⸢Even then, Kim Dokja simply had to do it.⸥

The effects from the storm of aftermaths still lingered in my vicinity.

– You have distorted far too much Probability.

– You keep this up, and all the Probability's karma you've accumulated so
farwill blow up in your face. You know what that means, don't you?

This was the Probability's karma that I had been accumulating until now.
The retribution that Constellations and Dokkaebis had warned me about.

⸢There is no Story where something precious hasn't been lost.⸥

Every large, great Story found in <Star Stream> was a story of loss.

In order to awaken a hero, something must be sacrificed, while lovers and
friends must lose something when trying to fulfil their love or friendship.

Someone had to lose something, and with that, Stories would become
complete.

⸢Kim Dokja hated that.⸥

I knew that one day, I'd be paying the price for not losing out on anything.
That the time to pay for twisting stories around and distorting the
Probability would arrive sooner or later.

⸢And that was why Kim Dokja decided to use that.⸥

Tsu-chuchuchuchut!

More lumps of Story poured out of my mouth.

This wasn't because the 'Indescribable Distance' attacked me; no, it was the
distorted Probability's fault. The distortions of the world, saved up for the
purpose of summoning an Outer God, was trying to eliminate me from the
scenario itself.

[Story, 'Demon King of Salvation', is continuing with its storytelling.]

I managed to endure only because of my Stories. They continued to whisper
into my ears – they said that you're the 'Demon King of Salvation'. You
must save people.

Just like how they did to Metatron and Agares, Stories were whispering to
me.

[Story, 'King of a Kingless World', is continuing with its storytelling.]

[Giant Story, 'Demon Realm's Spring', is continuing with its storytelling.]

[Giant Story, 'Torch that Swallowed the Myth', is continuing with its
storytelling.]

Even though I was inside the quaking fog of darkness, I still could sense
what was happening outside.

['Final Dragon of the Book of Apocalypse' is baring its animosity towards
the 'Indescribable Distance'!]

['Indescribable Distance' is making its move.]
Thankfully, everything was unfolding according to the plan. The Outer God
showing up to devour me had discovered an even tastier prey and it was
now far too focused on preying on the 'Final Dragon of the Book of
Revelation'.

The fight between Calamities had begun. The Final Dragon versus the
Nameless Mist.

These two's mutual destruction was the hope of all the other existences.

The most important thing was to buy enough time. Enough time for the
Constellations to reorganise themselves, for those damn stars to reform the
nebulas befitting their lofty titles.

[Damage to your Incarnation Body is critical!]

[Indescribable existence's Status is eating into your 'Context of Modifier'.]

[Unity between Stories is weakening.]

[<Star Stream> is stunned by your extraordinary achievement.]

[Your own Giant Story is waking up.]

I heard something faintly resembling a song from afar.

It was a melody I heard a long time ago. I wasn't sure whether that was my
mother's, from my companions, or from someone else.

Except that, as I listened to that faint song…

[Story, 'Life and Death Companions', is continuing with its storytelling.]

…I realized that I didn't want to die.
Ku-gugugugu!

One world was colliding with another. Kim Dokja, completely exposed to
the Apocalypse Dragon's shockwave, was swallowed up by the jet-black
fog of darkness.

And now, it was no longer him dealing with the shockwave, but that
horrifying Outer God, instead.

The two powers born from Chaos collided, and everything near their
vicinity was sucked into nothingness.

[Constellation, 'Mandala's Guardian', is gasping out.]

Thankfully, the collision location was much further away than it looked, so
the companions still on the ground were spared.

Complexions of most Constellations were incredibly poor after having
witnessed both the Apocalypse Dragon and an Outer God.

As if all those days where they roamed the heavens like kings were nothing
but illusions, calamities that not even Narrative-grade Constellations could
handle were engaging in bitter warfare.

Only then did the Constellations of the night sky realize the truth – that the
end of the world was indeed right in front of their faces.

For a certain someone, though, a person's sacrifice was a much bigger
tragedy than the end of the world.

"Ahjussssiiiiii!!"

Lee Jihye yelled out in sheer desperation and fired her cannons at the fog of
darkness. Of course, none of the cannon shells could damage the main body
of the Nameless Mist. One couldn't even tell where its body started and
ended, after all.
Unfortunately, the companions were unable to control their overwhelming
emotions.

"No, no, no!!"

Shin Yoosung fitfully cried out as if she had been inflicted with an illness
of repeating the exact same words. And as if it was resonating with her
emotions, the Chimera Dragon spat out one Breath after another in the air.

The eyes of Lee Gilyoung standing next to them were half-blurry,
unfocused. As his entire body quivered, ominous demonic aura began
oozing out from him.

"Contract… I will… I won't… will…"

And in front of these three, another three stepped forward. Facing the
horrifying Calamity that they had been dreading all along, each of the
companions lost their reasoning in their own ways. Some let themselves go,
falling to a flood of emotions, while others managed to hold on to their
broken reasoning in some elaborate manner.

Yoo Joonghyuk unleashed his transcended form.

Han Sooyoung was draped by the Black Flame Dragon.

And Jung Heewon had opened the eyes of God-slaying.

Without giving anyone a chance to stop them, the three stepped forward at
the same time, and they glanced at each other. Then, someone else did stop
them from the front.

It was Anna Croft.

"All of you, please stop! You mustn't break away from the battlefield!"

[Nebula, <Asgard>, is currently commanding the battlefield.]
Anna Croft's voice, along with <Asgard>'s Giant Story, managed to tie all
three of them to their spots.

Yoo Joonghyuk's expression crumpled in an unsightly manner. "Get out of
my sight."

"This isn't what the 'Demon King of Salvation' wanted!"

"What the 'Demon King of Salvation' wanted?"

Han Sooyoung's left arm was lit in black flames as if there was no more
need to listen here.

Anna Croft quickly spoke. "I've begun seeing bits of the future."

The Stories were now flowing within her [Eye of the Great Demon].

"It might be that this is because he has really done it." Anna Croft sounded
genuinely impressed. She looked at the fierce battle of the two Calamities
taking place in the distant sky and spoke. "To save this world, he really…"

"God damn it! Who cares about saving the world and shit?! We want to…!"

"His sacrifice is truly noble. Do you not understand what that means?"

"You better shut your mouth!"

Han Sooyoung blew her top and roared out. Her scary aura managed to
momentarily shut Anna Croft up.

"Why should Kim Dokja save this world? Why should that bastard sacrifice
himself for such a stupid waste-of-time?! Is this stinking world even worth
saving?!"

Her voice was cracking up from anger. It was a voice belonging to someone
who had been suppressing her rage over and over again. The prophet
looked at that face, and listened to that voice, and recalled a story from her
past.
"The 'Demon King of Salvation' also said the same thing once upon a time."

– Whether this world is worth protecting or not, one should wait and see
first.

Was it back during the Gourmet Association? The 'Demon King of
Salvation' once said that to her. Anna Croft knew very well what he meant
back then.

This world was one being ruled by Dokkaebis and Constellations. She, too,
created 'Zarathustras' in order to change this world, after all.

Anna Croft raised her head and looked at the sky once more. Even as a
prophet, she couldn't tell if he was still asking that question of this world.
However…

"He's over there right now."

Some Stories were to be proven not by words, but through one's actions.

"He has met you people in this world, has he not?"

For the first time ever, the three's expressions changed to something quite
similar to one another after hearing her.

Anna Croft continued on with a cautious tone of voice. "Please, have faith
in me, the prophet. We need to save up our strength, and then, aim for the
moment when the two Calamities fight each other and destroy themselves.
Only then will our survival be guaranteed."

"Prophet? You think you're the only one who can tell the future?"

That was when Anna Croft realized something.

Han Sooyoung's surrounding vicinity was overflowing with the Story of
[Predictive Plagiarism]. The Regressor Yoo Joonghyuk was studying and
observing the situation without rest through his [Sage's Eye] in the
meantime.
It wasn't only the prophet who could predict the future. These two also
possessed insight far superior to others when it came to reading future
events.

Even then, they still chose to save Kim Dokja.

Jung Heewon unsheathed her sword and spoke. "I don't know anything
about the future. However, I do know this. You said that you want to save
this world? It's the same for me, too."

Her determination manifested in the whitish flames billowing on the
[Sword of Judgement].

"That man is the world I wish to save."

At the end of those words, all three of them dashed into the air. Not the
Probability of the Giant Story, and not even the pressure from a Nebula
could stop them from leaving.

Anna Croft urgently reached out, but by then, they were already soaring
towards the distant heavens.

The thing that stopped them, though, was not a Nebula nor Probability.

Han Sooyoung was the first one to discover that 'thing'.

"What the hell?! Son of a…!"

Kugugugugu!!

The equilibrium of the heavens was collapsing under the continued battle of
the two Calamities. The new problem had to do with the crumbling balance
of the broken scale invading into this world.

[Isn't that…?]

One of the Constellations muttered out. Something hidden within the fog of
darkness blanketing the skies wiggled, and began separating itself.
Not content with pressuring the Apocalypse Dragon, the 'Indescribable
Distance', AKA the Nameless Mist, had begun creating a clone from itself.

"Ah, ahh, aaaah…"

A sickly-yellow eye of terror revealed itself among the fog of darkness.
Shin Yoosung's shoulders began trembling non-stop as if a nightmare of the
past managed to creep back into her consciousness.

She had seen that eye before. Incarnations who saw that eye would fail to
hold onto their minds and eventually, transform into creatures of the Outer
World.

On that day, all existences of the [Industrial Complex] were rendered
completely powerless in front of that Calamity.

However, there was someone here who remembered that day's events quite
differently from her.

[It's slightly smaller than that day, I see.]

It was Cheok Jungyeong.
                  Chapter 410: Ep. 78 - Twist/轉, II


Cheok Jungyeong unsheathed his sword as he stepped forward. His Stories,
tempered on the 'Isle of Reincarnators', wrapped around him and rippled
about like real muscles.

[Let us get going, small Transcendent.]

Kyrgios climbed up on Cheok Jungyeong's shoulder. They once worked
together to fight the 'Indescribable Distance' in the past.

The latter leapt up towards the heavens, and Kyrgios's [Electrification]
danced on his blade next. And as the bright, pure-white electrical current
enveloped Cheok Jungyeong's figure, he began glittering like a god of
lightning.

[I, Cheok Jungyeong, have been waiting for this day!]

A splendid Status revealed itself.

The enemy that his sword, used to cut apart mountains and the seas,
couldn't cut was now right before him.
He trained hard to perfect the incomplete 'Fourth Sword' for this very
moment. In order to fight against that sheer, immeasurable emptiness, he
spent countless hours creating a sword skill.

And this was the result.

His Story, condensed tightly until it was almost ready to burst, was ignited,
and Kyrgios's electrical current violently spun around in their vicinity.

Constellations on the ground all looked up.

One Constellation, and one Transcendent.

As if to mock these two's Statuses, the clone of the 'Indescribable Distance'
opened its maws wide towards them. And just before the open jaw of the
fog of darkness swallowed up the starlight… 'The Fourth Law'.

…Light gushed out from Cheok Jungyeong's sword.

'Fourth Sword that Beheads the Emptiness'.

The center of the fog slowly split apart; just like the belly of a beast being
sliced open, something began leaking out from that exposed center.

The yellowing eye protruding from the fog of darkness began to
disintegrate while spewing out Stories.

[Many Constellations cannot take their eyes away from the martial glory
displayed by 'Goryeo's First Sword'!]

[The jaws of many Constellations have fallen at this unbelievable

spectacle!] All the Constellations on the ground were astonished by what

they saw.
Even if it was just a clone, their opponent was still the 'Indescribable
Distance', the cleaner of <Star Stream> and the calamity that devoured all
distorted Probability.

The calamity widely known as undefeatable, was cut in half by Cheok
Jungyeong. No one even managed to clearly catch the shape of that sword
strike.

Only Yoo Joonghyuk managed to recognise that attack. Even the man who
previously sliced a star in half looked utterly stunned right now.

"The Will-formed Blade…"

The power to cut the world down with nothing but one's own
determination; the pinnacle reputedly only reachable through training in
martial arts. And Cheok Jungyeong had reached that lofty height after
becoming a Constellation.

[There is no existence that cannot be cut down by my blade!]

Standing within the exploding light show, Cheok Jungyeong watched the
scattering fog and felt the sense of release wash over him.

Just how long did he endure just to be able to cut that thing?

That ecstasy of the moment, when he stepped into the realm of
emptymindedness and his will itself became the sword. The Four Sword
Style's 'Fourth Sword that Beheads the Emptiness' was the cumulation of all
the martial arts he had mastered.

He looked in Yoo Joonghyuk's direction and shouted out. [Now go,
Descendants! Go and bring Kim Dokj…]

Unfortunately, he didn't get to finish what he was saying; an incredible
impact force from behind managed to wreck his entire Incarnation Body.
He fell like a meteor and crashed deeply into the ground.
As his vision rocked unstably, he forced himself to look up, and that's when
he realized what had happened to him. Someone began muttering near him.

[Oh, dear lord… <Star Stream> might be finished at this rate.]

He couldn't understand it; Cheok Jungyeong felt his body tremble
uncontrollably.

…But, how?

I cut it down just now, so how?

As if what happened a moment was all a joke, the giant eye in the sky was
still looking down on him.

There was more than one clone.

So many, in fact, the whole sky seemed to be covered by them. Clones of
the 'Indescribable Distance', dozens upon dozens of them, were descending
to the ground in order to devour every living thing down below.

[Uwaaaahk!!]

Historical-grade Constellations, overcome by terror, began running to the
other side of the horizon. Unfortunately, the calamity also flooded in from
that side as well.

Crrrraaaack!

Fangs rising up from within the fog crushed the Incarnation Bodies of the
Constellations like the soft pulp of a fruit. There was no place to run nor
hide now. Although slightly better than dealing with the Apocalypse
Dragon's shockwaves, this situation was just as despairing, nonetheless.

[Everyone, calm down! You all saw it, didn't you? We can fight back
against this creature!] Dionysus shouted until his voice turned hoarse, but
Constellations simply couldn't fight together. [Damn it…]
Constellations from <Olympus> had spent a considerable amount of their
Statuses while enduring against the two previous shockwaves and couldn't
display their usual prowess now, and even <Underworld> had used up far
too much of its Probability and was searching for the right Story. At least,
Uriel and the Black Flame Dragon were still putting up a good fight.

"Get lost!! I said, get the hell away from me, you stinking bastards!"

Yoo Joonghyuk, Han Sooyoung, and Jung Heewon unleashed their
Statuses, their backs pressed against each other.

They were planning to continue fighting against the fog of darkness and
rush towards where Kim Dokja had disappeared into as soon as an opening
was created. However, no such gap opened up for them. At this rate, they
would be wiped out before they even began rescuing him.

"God damn it! Isn't there anyone else? Isn't there any other friends of Kim
Dokja still left somewhere?!"

No matter how much Han Sooyoung racked her brain, she couldn't come up
with anyone that could help.

Both the Statuses of the Black Flame Dragon and Uriel were gradually
declining now.

[Constellation, 'Demon-like Judge of Fire', is glaring at 'Scribe of Heaven'.]

[Constellation, 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon', says he still can't use the
'Right Hand of the Void Destruction'…]

The fog of darkness had enveloped the 'Isle of Reincarnators', which was
about the same as it having finished its preparation to devour this place
whole.

It was around then when the specks of light akin to a car's headlights shone
from the distance. Along with loud screeching, something arrived by their
side after breaking past the deflagration.
A vehicle rather familiar to the members of <Kim Dokja's Company>
appeared from beyond the choking dust.

[Hmm. It'll get rather troublesome if you get injured here. You still have
three more adverts you need to shoot for me, after all.]

The door to the [X-class Ferrarghini] opened, and the grey-haired
middleaged man waved his hand with a smile. He wore a pink-coloured
polo shirt with images of pineapples etched on it, plus a torn pair of jeans.
Han Sooyoung saw his outrageous fashion sense that simply didn't match
the current battlefield and her jaw fell to the ground.

"…Mass Production Maker??"

Several Constellations fighting against the Calamity began muttering to
each other after hearing her.

[Mass Production Maker? Is he a strong Constellation?]

[No, that geezer won't be of much help.]

[I think I've heard about him before. Blinded by Coins, he continues to
pump out trashy Stories…]

Han Sooyoung stared at that 'Mass Production Maker'. He was supposed to
be a Narrative-grade Constellation, but contrary to his rank, the Status she
could feel was nothing to write home about.

The Mass Production Maker chuckled good-naturedly. [Huhuh. It seems
that I come across as not all that reliable.]

His relaxed observation prompted Thor to stop chugging wine down his
throat and shout back. [Oiii, Mister Steady! Since you came, hurry and lend
us a helping hand! We urgently need any help we can find, even from a
geezer!]

[Hmm, but, I didn't come here to fight.]
[Then why the hell did you even come here for?]

[Well, I was thinking of sponsoring some Coins.]

[You mad geezer… What good will that do right now?!]

Constellations couldn't hold their anger back and shouted out.

[If you showed up to spout nonsense, then get the hell away from here! A
stinking old man blinded by Coins…!]

Strangely enough, the Mass Production Maker didn't show any signs of
cowering. It was at that moment Han Sooyoung recalled a certain
conversation she had with Kim Dokja in the past.

While she was glancing at the 'Mass Production Maker' chatting to
Dokkaebis outside the recording booth, she asked him.

– Hey, Kim Dokja. Just who is that Constellation, anyway? He doesn't
seem all that strong to me… Why are those Dokkaebis grovelling before
him like that?

Kim Dokja replied as if it was the most obvious thing in the world.

– Because… he's got a lot of Coins.

Like Kim Dokja back then, the Mass Production Maker was grinning
brightly right now. [I can't understand you young ones. Why do you all
dismiss Coins like that?]

[Who cares about those consumables…?!]

Along with a spinning noise, a Coin popped up on top of the Mass
Production Maker's palm. It was just one single Coin. [Now, look closely.
Does this Coin look like nothing more than 'consumable' to you? Haven't
you ever wondered why <Star Stream> uses these 'Coins' as the standard
trading unit? Don't you find that strange?]
[What bullshit are you trying to say now?!]

While staring at the clones that had encroached right before his nose, the
Mass Production Maker spoke up. [Let me give you a hint. Everything
within <Star Stream> is created through 'Stories'. In that case, what about
'Coins', then?]

[…Is this the sign of senility? I'm busy, so stop talking to me!]
Constellations focused on shooting out their magical energy at the space
around them as if they no longer wanted to hear an old man's ramblings.
Han Sooyoung, however, continued to listen even when still trapped in this
urgent situation.

And, goosebumps broke out all over her skin.

It was as exactly as the Mass Production Maker had said; everything in
<Star Stream> was a 'Story'.

In that case, why was the trading unit of <Star Stream> not 'Stories' but
'Coins', instead?

Tsu-chuchuchut!

An enormous amount of Probability was welling up all round the Mass
Production Maker. And as he was bathed in the influence of that
Probability, his own Status was rising up explosively.

That gob-smacking rate of increase shocked the Constellations of both
'Good' and 'Evil', and they all looked at the Mass Production Maker.

[A very old Story has begun its storytelling.]

The Mass Production Maker – he too was a Constellation pursuing his own
version of 'A Single Story'.

In that case, what was the ■■ he was pursuing after?
[What rules this world is neither 'Good' nor 'Evil'. It's 'capital'.]

He then chucked that Coin high up in the air.

Yoo Joonghyuk saw it, so did Han Sooyoung, and Jung Heewon. But none
of them saw how much was written on that coin.

[And I possess more Coins than anyone in <Star Stream>.]

More specifically, they would have believed whatever amount was claimed
to be written on it. If one wanted to create a miracle like that with Coins,
how much would one need to spend?

[Someone has spent a lot of Coins!]

[Story, 'Materialism', has begun its storytelling!]

A short while later, a deafening boom resounded out from the other side of
the sky where the Coin had disappeared to. Accompanied by the ripping
sound, a doorway whirling about opened up there. It was a Gate.

[A one-way Gate has been generated.]

The Gate that only the Dokkaebis and the Bureau could open up was
actually opened by a mere Constellation.

[<Star Stream>'s Bureau is looking at the Probability of the applicable
scenario's…]

[Summoning has begun!]

Several humanoid shapes began appearing beyond the Gate itself. With a
relaxed face belonging to a holiday maker, the 'Mass Production Maker'
shrugged his shoulders. [Oh, by the way. You guys were right about one
thing. I'm terrible at fighting.]

Blinding rays of light exploded from the other side of the Gate.
The old man put a pair of sunglasses on as if he'd been expecting that and
continued on. [Instead, I can bring a few friends who are very good at that
by doing this.]

Some people were being summoned to the battlefield through the Gate. The
first one to recognise them was Yoo Joonghyuk.

"…Master?"

The Breaking the Sky Sword Saint and Transcendents were flying out of
the Gate now. There were several other familiar faces among the group
beside her, too.

Such as, the One Invincible Fist, Yoo Hoseong.

One of the most powerful beings on the 'Isle of Reincarnators' had entered
this scenario in order to lend them aid. The reason for the Breaking the Sky
Sword Saint's belated arrival must've had something to do with persuading
them to come here. However, Yoo Joonghyuk's expression didn't improve
even then.

…Will they be enough to stop this calamity?

There were dozens of calamity's clones, each so powerful that
Narrativegrade Constellations couldn't even deal with a single one. No
matter how powerful the Breaking the Sky Sword Saint and Yoo Hoseong
were, this enemy was not something a group of Transcendents could
overcome.

But then, there was one more familiar face right at the end of the
descending Transcendents.

"Seriously, now! Should've helped us get here from the get-go, you know!"

It was Jang Hayoung.
A few companions shouted towards her, calling her over. She smiled
embarrassedly and waved her hand back. "Sorry about being so late! I
was trying to persuade someone." …Persuade?

Jang Hayoung couldn't continue on, however.

Because the entrance of new, powerful beings caused the clones of the
'Indescribable Distance' to change the direction of their attacks.

Nervousness quickly dyed her expression as she watched the Outer God
approach her location.

Jang Hayoung had seen those things back in the Demon Realm. She knew
very well that the current her couldn't even deal with a single clone.

That was with only her own powers, though.

Right in the next instance, a golden aura exploded out from her figure. An
incredible amount of Status was being unleashed with her as its center.

Her golden locks spread out like waves and a slender golden headband
appeared above her pale-smooth forehead. And then, a beautiful
goldencoloured fur coat covered her entire body.

She slowly opened her eyes to reveal the swirling ominous aura of 'Golden
Gaze, Fiery Eyes'.

[Constellation, 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon', is narrowing his eyes.]

[Constellation, 'Demon-like Judge of Fire', is surprised silly.]

[Constellation, 'Goryeo's First Sword', is sighing out.]

[All neutral-type Constellations can't hide their astonishment!]

Everyone present recognised the owner of that Status. It was impossible not
to.
Jang Hayoung extended her hand out and the world's heaviest staff found
itself in her grip in the next moment. Boundlessly arrogant and aloof eyes
glared at the azure sky, and every cloud in the world trembled all at the
same time.

[Go and rescue Kim Dokja.]

Those words were not spoken by Jang Hayoung.

[Constellation, 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband', has incarnated into the
scenario!]
                 Chapter 411: Ep. 78 - Twist/轉, III


During her adventures on the 'Isle of Reincarnators', Jang Hayoung utilised
the [Unidentifiable Wall] several times; she used its first-stage function,
[Chat System], to engage Constellations in conversation.

– Demon King of Salvation-nim.

– …Why are you calling me like that?

From a certain moment on, she even got to talk to Kim Dokja as if nothing
had happened, too.

For a while there, she oh-so-wanted to deny that 'Demon King of Salvation
= Kim Dokja' and ended up having a mental breakdown, but she had no
choice but to come to terms with it now.

The 'Demon King of Salvation' Jang Hayoung liked so much happened to
be
Kim Dokja, and the dimwit Kim Dokja was none other than the 'Demon
King of Salvation'. She barely managed to accept that fact now. Of course,
she hadn't 100% accepted it, though.

– I was talking to 'Demon King of Salvation'-nim. So, Kim Dokja
shouldkeep his mouth shut.

–…

– It can't be helped, then. Don't say anything unnecessary, and just
gimmethe answers I want.

– …What kind of answers are they?

Now that he openly asked her that, the sorrow she'd been suppressing until
now exploded onto the surface.

– Why don't you want me to join the 'Kim Dokja's Company'?

She always wanted to ask him that question. She watched her companions
use 'Context of Constellation' and get to the next scenario, and was left
behind along with the teachers at the rear of the scenario. She did want to
go with them. She thought that it'd been nice if she could become one of
those shining stars, too.

Is it because I lack the qualifications?

Maybe, it's because I haven't been with Kim Dokja from the beginning of
the scenarios.

Jang Hayoung remembered the times they shared during the revolution of
the Demon Realm as well as the Demon King Selection fights. For the first
time in her life, she experienced bliss during those moments, and now, they
had become an indelible part of her.

And that was why, she thought that she too had become Kim Dokja's
companion now. But, maybe, she was simply deluding herself.
– I'd like you to live a free life.

Jang Hayoung's anger suddenly bubbled up after hearing his reply. She
wanted to shout back and ask, what kind of bullshit was that after they had
come this far. But then…

– Forcibly being transferred to another dimension and living in the
DemonRealm, neither of those were your choices, right?

She couldn't argue with that. As if her breathing had come to a standstill, all
she could do now was to read the incoming messages.

– Hayoung-ah, please live the life you want.

Those words were coming from the 'Demon King of Salvation'. Words of a
high and mighty Constellation, who was addicted to the Story of saving
someone and periodically disregarded his own life.

That was why these words were not from Jang Hayoung's friend, 'Kim
Dokja'.

⸢His voice can't be heard anymore.⸥

The 'Unidentifiable Wall' spoke to her. Even with the wall that allowed her
to talk to any being in this world in an instant, she couldn't hear Kim
Dokja's voice.

He resolutely remained as the 'Demon King of Salvation', just like what she
asked of him.

"Come on now. What do you want from me when you say stuff like that?"

That was why… she wanted to hear Kim Dokja's voice.

['Unidentifiable Wall', is bearing its own name!]

That was why, Jang Hayoung was standing in this place.
['Unidentifiable Wall' is evolving into the 'Wall of Impossible
Communication'!]

[2nd stage functionality of 'Wall of Impossible Communication' is now
available!]

She unlocked the power of her new wall, persuaded all the Constellations
that could aide <Kim Dokja's Company>, and brought them to this place.

All for the sake of the life she wanted to live, and not for anyone else.

Tsu-chuchuchut!!

The stupefied faces of the <Kim Dokja's Company> members could be
seen looking back at her. Jang Hayoung shouted out, as the sensation of the
Status filling her head made her consciousness dimmer and dimmer. "All of
you, wake up and get a move on! I can't stay like this for long!"

She shouted, her mind submerging deeper and deeper. The presence of a
Constellation was taking over her entire Incarnation Body.

['Wall of Impossible Communication' is currently activating 'Impossible
Longing Lv.1'!]

The 'Impossible Longing' – an ability of the 'Wall of Impossible
Communication' that allowed Jang Hayoung to form a temporary
'Sponsorship Contract' with a Constellation, even though she had no
sponsor backing.

[Constellation, 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband', is looking at his
Incarnation Body.]

The 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' – the Great Sage, Heaven's Equal,
Sun Wukong. According to Kim Dokja, one of the greatest Constellations
in the <Star Stream> itself.
That great and noble Constellation scanned the world with his aloof,
arrogant eyes, and spoke in a lofty tone of voice. [Now that I'm here, it's
kind of annoying.]

Jang Hayoung became dumbfounded by that and yelled out.

"Ah?! But, you said you'd help! And I even listened to your personal
troubles, too! So, hurry up! Please!"

From her perspective, she couldn't help but be flabbergasted by this
situation, but it wasn't as if she couldn't understand why the Great Sage,
Heaven's Equal said that. For some reason, his condition after incarnating
into her body felt strange.

Ju-jujujut…

It was as if several different beings temporarily had become 'one' creature,
and his status felt unstable as a result. That 'annoyance' he talked about
might have something to do with that condition. However, that was his
problem, not hers.

"If you don't keep your promise, then your hair will…"

[I'm doing it! Look, I'm doing it!]

Sun Wukong replied in a voice full of dissatisfaction and grasped the Ruyi
Bang. The Status leaking out from his body caused several Constellations
to display their interest.

[Great Sage, it'll be a suicide trying to send them back. Even if it's you…]

[And who you might be?]

[…I'm Cheok Jungyeong.]

As if to resist the Great Sage's Status, Cheok Jungyeong opened his chest
wide. The former wordlessly studied the emotions etched in the latter's
eyes, before throwing a question out. [Hey, you. Do you know who this
Master Sun is, then?]

Cheok Jungyeong needed a moment or two before realizing that this
'Master Sun' was the way the Great Sage, Heaven's Equal referred to
himself as.

[I'm well aware that you used to be a famous Constellation in the past. Even
then…]

[Well, yeah, sure. It's been way too long since this great me did something
in a scenario, hasn't it?]

Sun Wukong yawned disinterestedly and after shrinking the size of the
Ruyi Bang, he began digging his ear. Cheok Jungyeong was about to blow
his top from that arrogance, but then…

[Constellation, 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband', is unleashing his Status!]

Not just Cheok Jungyeong, but the Incarnation Bodies of other
Constellations near him were blown away in the air. His eyes opened wide
in shock after sensing the powerful presence that could make other
Constellations shrink away by simply releasing its Status.

[Look, the sparks…!]

One of the suffering Constellations cried out in pain. Jung Hayoung's body
with the Great Sage incarnated into it was now completely enveloped with
an insane amount of sparks. It was not an odd thing to see Probability's
sparks appear when Constellations unleash their Statuses.

The actual problem here was the fact that this area was currently going
through the 89th scenario. In an area that could deal with most types of
Probability, such a blinding show of sparks taking place meant…

[Now, look.]
The sides of the Eight Trigram, the Bagua, began spreading on all four
cardinal directions of the Great Sage, Heaven's Equal.

Geon (乾, Heaven/Firmament), Tae (兌, Lake/Marsh), Yee (離, Heart of
Fire), Jin (震, Thunder), Son (巽, Wind), Gam (坎, Water), Gan (艮,
Mountain), Gon (坤, Ground/Earth).

Those letters energetically spun around his Ruyi Jingu Bang (如意金箍棒)
and emitted swirling golden light rays. The clones of the 'Indescribable
Distance' detected that vigorous aura and began flooding towards him.

Tsu-chuchuchuchut!

The Probability's sparks were the precursor to the approaching storm of
aftermaths. As if they were pouncing on a tasty prey, the clones of the
'Indescribable Distance' opened their maws all at once towards the Great
Sage. There were a total of five, six of them.

Never mind Narrative-grade Constellations, even a Myth-grade would find
it difficult to deal with this many.

However, the Great Sage didn't back down.

The moment those vast fogs of darkness enveloped him, his entire figure
suddenly lit up in the brightest golden rays of light. And then, his Ruyi
Jingu Bang began piercing through the open-mawed fogs along with the
vicious whirlwind.

Ku-dudududu…!

Not once did the 'Indescribable Distance' get damaged after getting struck
by a lone Star Relic until now. But then, the spinning wheels created by the
Ruyi Jingu Bang increased in number to hundreds in an instant and began
pounding on the clones, and quite shockingly, horrifying screeches
resounded out from the fogs.

Gu-rurururuk…!!
On top of that, one of the clones even tried to dodge the Ruyi Jingu Bang.

Every Constellation in the battlefield couldn't take their eyes off from the
Great Sage's Status as he dyed the sky in a spectacular shower of light and
fought against the 'Indescribable Distance'.

That included Dionysus, Surya, and Cheok Jungyeong.

[It's a technique of 'Chaos'.]

Hades immediately and accurately read the seditious power permeating
within the Ruyi Jingu Bang held by the Great Sage. That power was neither
'Good' nor 'Evil'.

It was a distinct Taoist technique that only the Great Sage, who had
compiled unique Stories for himself, could use.

The Mei Houwang. (獼猴王, Handsome Monkey King)

The Great Sage, Heaven's Equal. (齊天大聖)

The Victorious Fighting Buddha. (鬪戰勝佛)

The 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband', Sun Wukong, who continued to
exist under many different names, was fighting now.

And he was engaged in a one-versus-many battle against the calamities of
the void, something that even Cheok Jungyeong could only barely defeat by
giving his all.

As if they didn't want to lose to him, two Constellations decided to pitch in
right then.

[Constellation, 'Demon-like Judge of Fire', is wringing out all of her true
powers!]

[Constellation, 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon', is roaring out as if he doesn't
want to lose!]
These two's Statuses were being overlaid on top of the Great Sage's. The
[Black Flame] from the Dragon and Uriel's [Hellfire] were combined into
one and caused the Riyu Jingu Bang to grow to an abnormal size.

[Story forgotten under a lengthy period of time has begun its storytelling.]

⸢And so, stars of Good, Evil, and Neutral have gathered in one place.⸥

Three kinds of Statuses were combined to cause an explosion of a blinding
flash.

Go-ooooooh!

The Riyu Jingu Bang, now boasting tremendous girth, slammed into the
sky. The heaven and earth rocked violently, and the enormous shockwave
distorted time and space itself.

By the time the screaming Constellations opened their eyes again, a huge
hole had opened up in the sky once covered in the fog of darkness.

The Great Sage spoke. [Now, go.]

Three people didn't miss that opening and made their move. Yoo
Joonghyuk used [Air Steps] to run in the air, Han Sooyoung rode on the
shadow clone of the Black Flame Dragon while Jung Heewon borrowed the
wings of the Archangel to shoot up vertically.

All three of them penetrated past the fog of darkness and breached the
boundary of the sky in an instant.

The moment they escaped the atmosphere, though, their movements dulled
rapidly. The cosmic space created by the clashes between the 'Indescribable
Distance' and the 'Final Dragon of the Book of Revelation' was filled up
with an astonishing amount of Stories chaotically swirling around.

"Keuph…"
Blood trickled out from the corner of Han Sooyoung's lips at the
unbelievable density of Stories. Just sensing their presence alone was so
painful that her body felt like it'd crumble away.

Kim Dokja was somewhere in this space. Not too long afterwards, they
located his trace, scattered around like bread crumbs.

⸢Only by doing this will I be able to earn the proper Climax.⸥

A broken fragment of Kim Dokja was floating aimlessly in the empty
space. Jung Heewon was the first one to reach out; as if she was catching a
very small and fragile bird, she cautiously brought that fragment into her
bosom.

Was she mistaken in thinking that she saw the distant world Kim Dokja
wanted to reach just beyond the full stop of that sentence?

After catching that sentence, and then, another one… Just like crossing a
monkey bar, by continuously moving one step at a time, they would arrive
at the end of this trail.

Han Sooyoung spoke. "I guess you're also a Constellation now, Kim
Dokja."

All Constellations were addicted to Stories, and in order to reach that single
Story they pursued after, they indulged themselves on every other type of
Story available.

And that was why they didn't have a true substitute of themselves. Because
they had to create all Stories by their own hands in the end.

⸢My companions will acquire a Story that should allow them to oppose any
Nebula out there.⸥
Even if that Story was meant for other people.

"God damn it, since when did I ask you for this kind of story??"
The clones of the 'Indescribable Distance' discovered the trio and rushed
towards their location.

Han Sooyoung shot [Black Flame] out from her hand, while Jung Heewon's
[Sword of Judgement] activated [Hellfire]; Yoo Joonghyuk's [Breaking the
Sky Swordsmanship] sliced through the space and opened up the path for
them.

Normally, they shouldn't have been able to fight against this calamity. The
only reason why they could was because of the star existing at the end of
that path.

[Constellation, 'Demon King of Salvation', is still activating Stigma,
'Sacrificial Will Lv.9'!]

The 'Sacrificial Will' – a deadly Stigma that raised the combat capabilities
of one's companions by risking one's life.

After being strengthened by that starlight, Yoo Joonghyuk swung his
sword, Jung Heewon unleashed more Hellfire, and Han Sooyoung
continued to punch over and over again.

And eventually, they began sensing the faint presence of Kim Dokja. Like
the breathing of a dying man, his weakened Stories were telling them of his
current location.

Tsu-chuchuchut…!

Suddenly, Uriel's and the Black Flame Dragon's Status began dwindling
rapidly. They had finally reached their limit, in other words.

[Constellation, 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' is issuing a warning!]

[Constellation, 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon', says that he needs to use the
bathroom and it'll be harder to use his powers…]
They finally spotted a pale, faint star on the far side of the thick fog of
darkness. Yoo Joonghyuk and Han Sooyoung both saw it. It felt so
desperately within reach, if only they could extend their hands out.

Unfortunately, the path to that star was fraught with much danger. The
number of clones rushing in continued to grow, and the pressure of the
Statuses surrounding them was getting heavier quite quickly.

All three no longer had much magical energy left in them as they had been
flying like a one-way rocket with total disregard for fuel preservation.

Ku-gugugugu!

The distance towards the clones was getting shorter and shorter.

If all three of them marched forward by breaking through all these clones,
then never mind saving Kim Dokja, they wouldn't be able to return at all.

However, what if they focused the remaining magical energy into only one
person?

"…There's only one way."

All three of them stared at each other at the same time. They couldn't rescue
Kim Dokja together.

Which meant that only one among them could reach that star.
                  Chapter 412: Ep. 78 - Twist/轉, IV


While stuck inside the fog that blocked their view, Yoo Joonghyuk
addressed his companions first. "I shall be the one to save him."

The [Black Heavenly Demon Sword] in his hand began emitting the
pureblue light.

"All of you are too exhausted. So, it's only correct that I continue on.
Transfer your remaining magical energy to me."

That prompted Jung Heewon to unsheathe the [Sword of Judgement] and
speak. "Your own condition is just as messy as ours. I should be the one to
go, instead."

His brows quivered slightly. This would be the first time she came out this
forcefully.

"Both of you better get out of my way! I alone am more than enough!"

And now, even Han Sooyoung butted in.
The gazes of the two locked in a staring contest shifted over to her. Their
eyes so clearly implied, "We get why we want to go, but what's up with you
now?" causing her to pout unhappily.

"Why are you staring at me like that for? What, I shouldn't rescue Kim
Dokja?"

"I thought you didn't like Dokja-ssi?"

"Ah, of course I don't like him."

Now normally, she'd have dumped such annoying responsibility on Yoo
Joonghyuk's shoulders. Unfortunately, she had a reason to step up this time
around.

Just as Kim Dokja rushed forward aboard Surya's train, a message from him
flew in at her, that was why.

– Hey, you're going to rescue me, right?

…If only she didn't hear that message.

Han Sooyoung grumbled inwardly and was about to open her lips to speak,
only for Jung Heewon to snatch the initiative away. "I'm sorry, but Dokja-
ssi personally asked me to save him. So, I can't yield to you nor to this guy,
not this time."

"What rubbish are you talking about? Kim Dokja asked me to save him."

"Stop lying. There's no way he'd ask you to do that."

"Argh, I'm not lying, it's the truth! You think I'm a habitual liar just because
my job was a writer?"

Their gazes collided in mid-air.

And at that very moment, Han Sooyoung was overcome with this rather
strange feeling.
Initially, she thought that Jung Heewon was lying in order to save that
moron up there. But when she thought about it some more, this woman
wasn't the type to lie about stuff like that.

She abruptly turned her head to the side, only to find Yoo Joonghyuk
forming a scary scowl.

"Hey, by any chance, you…"

With indescribable rage filling up his expression, he then began glaring at
the distant star. It was at this point that Han Sooyoung finally realized
something.

…Hang on, could this be?

"Could that bastard Kim Dokja…?!"

The star continued to faintly shine in the distance. It was almost as if she
could glimpse Kim Dokja's smirking face there.




Ku-gugugu…

The hole in the sky the Great Sage had opened up was gradually filling
back up. The clones hesitating in fear regained themselves and the fog of
darkness was blanketing the world once more.

And then, the noise from the Apocalypse Dragon's shockwave reverberated
around like crashing waves. Constellations were jolted wide awake and
they all looked up at the Great Sage.

[My bad, but I can't do that for the second time. I'm already breaking the
rules as is.]
The Great Sage spun the Ruyi Bang around, and as if he found it all rather
annoying, shrunk the pole to store it inside his ear.

[Nebula <Emperor>'s 'Promise' has been invoked against the Constellation,
'Prisoner of the Golden Headband'!]

The Great Sage that was pressuring the 'Indescribable Distance' until now
began scattering away. As if his body was being torn into several pieces, his
clear-as-day Status began crumbling away – and right before the end, he
issued one final message.

[Hey, you lot. If you keep standing around looking dazed, you'll all die
soon.]

[Everyone, attack! If we're pushed back now, we'll all die for sure!]

Dionysus and the Constellations of <Olympus> had replenished their
energy by then, and unleashed their Statuses towards the sky. Those from
<Underworld> also stopped preserving their strengths and made their
move, as well. The Korean Peninsula's Constellations concentrated their
powers on Lee Jihye, and soon, [Turtle Dragon]'s cannons fired blinding
rays of energy. Some began fighting, while some began resisting.

It was not the same for everyone, however.

Like falling meteors, stars from the sky continued to fall.

Constellations from <Vedas> and <Papyrus> trying to escape – stars with
their Modifiers already known, and those who weren't, were caught up in
the battle for supremacy between the Apocalypse Dragon and an Outer
God, and were crashing to the ground – as if to announce that the age of the
stars was coming to an end.

Metatron was looking up at the sky.

The information Jophiel, the Commander of the Red Cosmos, had sent from
the 1863rd turn didn't mention any of this.
Currently, both of his hands were occupied with creating the sealing tool to
seal away the Apocalypse Dragon. This tool, created by gathering every
Story of <Eden> as well as those belonging to Absolute Good.

Jophiel said as thus:

– Scribe, you'll die using this, but the world will remember the 'Good' once
more.

She definitely said that. So how come…

[The target cannot be sealed.]

Even though the sealing tool was almost complete, the Apocalypse Dragon
couldn't be sealed away. He didn't know why. He couldn't even figure out
how and from where things went wrong, either.

Was it due to reviving the Dragon too early?

Or, could it be because the 'Indescribable Distance' had interfered?

Was the 'Demon King of Salvation' the main culprit as he suspected?

…If they were all wrong, then maybe, Jophiel…?

At the end of his vision, he saw Michael, inching closer to his death with
half of his Incarnation Body gone. As long as <Eden> existed, he'd be able
to revive, but with this, the Nebula would disappear. Not just it, though, but
even the entirety of <Star Stream> would start crumbling away.

[Have you already given up? That's quite unlike you.]

Metatron looked back and his expression hardened instantly. [Did you
come here to kill me?]
[You'd die anyway even if I don't do anything, so why should I even

bother?] The Ruler of East Hell, Agares, cackled raucously before frowning

a bit.

[Oldest Evil has begun its storytelling.]

With that message, Metatron realized why Agares had come back here.

The Archangel spoke. […For a short while there, I was envious of you.
Envious of the fact that you could so easily abandon the Story of 'Evil' and
leave, just like that.]

[Lying is one of the virtues of 'Evil'. Have you forgotten that already?]

Agares laughed again, sounding as if he was sick and tired of it. Metatron
understood the meaning of that laughter better than anyone.

The 'Good and Evil'; they might be on the opposing sides, but they
understood each other better than anyone else in this world.

They would not be able to escape from this 'Story' until their dying
moments. Because this Story was already 'them' by now.

[Oldest Good has begun its storytelling!]

[Oldest Evil has…!]

[Shut up. Just how long will this stinking story continue its 'beginning'
crap?] Agares scowled after seeing the Stories rise up.

[Oldest Evil is quietly staring at the 'Ruler of East Hell'.]

[It's about time you stop, don't you think?]

Agares shoved his hand into his inner pocket and pulled out a rolled
cigarette. Accompanied by the 'chi-eeck' noise, the cigarette was lit on fire
and the smoke spread around in the air. The number of stars falling
continued to increase and the clones of the 'Indescribable Distance' began to
devour all the fallen Constellations. And from afar, the Apocalypse
Dragon's roar could be heard, too.

[What a spectacular scenery this is. It's the ideal stage to end this long,
dragged-out fight.]

The leaders of the 'Good' and the 'Evil' stared at this spectacle. The tragedy
taking place here all began with these two.

It was around then that they heard a bizarre noise coming from behind. A
clone had snuck closer without being detected and had its maw wide open
in Metatron's direction.

[Demon King, the 'Ruler of East Hell', is revealing his Status!] Ku-

dududu!

The clone rushing in to rip and devour the Archangel at any second faltered
and stopped moving. Agares's hands reached out and grabbed hold of the
clone's mouth trying to shut close.

He was none other than the Demon King ranked second in the hierarchy.
Out of the current crop of Demon Kings, he was the only one capable of
contending for supremacy against a Myth-grade Constellation.

Agares spoke while chewing on the cigarette. [What are you blankly
looking at? Were you planning to become a martyr or something?]

[Although it was only for a brief moment, I did think that maybe that's not
such a bad idea.]

[You should finish the things you've started first. I'm telling you to finish
the
'Great War of Saints and Demons' properly as befitting the high-and-mighty
'Scribe of Heaven'.]
[It's impossible. The power of the Apocalypse Dragon is far greater than I
expected.]

[Using the Wall's power should be sufficient.]

[Even resorting to that power isn't enough to seal the Apocalypse Dragon
away.]

[I figured as much. However, you'll still be able to save the ones here. After
all, the 'Wall' exists to protect something, doesn't it?]

Those words caused Metatron's eyes to tremble. […What are you talking
about?]

[You always needed to be told twice before you could understand.]

Agares was there, still pouring out the vicious Status towards the clones.
Metatron had fought against that Demon King for a very long time.

Even then, he had never seen that kind of an expression from the latter
before.

⸢At that moment, Good and Evil looked at each other.⸥

The Demon King's eyes looked at the other dying Demon Kings and
Archangels. [Wouldn't 'Good and Evil' be able to carry on to the next
generation only after these fools are saved from this mess?]

[That is a funny thing for a Demon King to say.]

[I'm only saying it now, but to me, you don't look much like an Archangel
yourself.]

Metatron heard Agares's sullen voice and couldn't help but feel strange.
Why did the demon he fought against for such a long time feel so, so close
today?
Were their current actions for the sake of Good or for Evil? Metatron
couldn't tell.

But, he was sure of one thing.

[Story of the Most Ancient 'Good and Evil' is looking at you.]

Even if they had become the Story itself, what they chose to do now wasn't
because Stories told them to do so.

[I can't do this alone.]

[I know.]

['Wall that Divides Good and Evil' is violently shaking!]

With one wall between them, the representatives of 'Good' and 'Evil'
extended their hands towards each other.

[Even if we save them here, we still can't stop the Apocalypse.]

[I also know that.] Agares placed his hand on top of the sealing tool
Metatron had created. [But then, that's not a problem we should worry
about.]

The Archangel and the Demon King held each other's hands. With that, the
sealing tool emitted blinding rays of light and began expanding at a rapid
pace.

And soon, it couldn't be called a tool anymore, but a large ship, instead.

Ku-gugugugu!

It was an ark that once upon a time protected all beings above ground from
the destruction of a world. A mythical vessel that descended to the world in
order to protect life itself against the Great Flood.

Metatron spoke. [Evacuate the Constellations.]
[Understood, Scribe.]

The 'Master of the Ark' standing among the Constellations heard Metatron's
call and took command of the vessel. The surviving Valkyries began
helping the Constellations and Incarnations in the near vicinity to board the
ark one by one.

However, Metatron and Agares had to support the Ark's Story and couldn't
board it themselves. It wasn't only those two who knew that fact,
unfortunately.

[You've done something quite foolish, oh Ruler of the East Hell.]

[Asmodeus.]

Not even giving him time to say something, Asmodeus's claws penetrated
deeply into Agares's heart. Even then, the latter's expression remained
unflustered as he stared at the face of impending death.

Looking displeased by that expression, Asmodeus spoke. [Why don't you
give up the 'Wall' to me now? You no longer have the qualifications to
represent 'Evil'.]

The claws sunk in even deeper and dug out Agares's innards. Pitch-black
Stories dripped out as the Demon King spoke. [What a persistent bastard
you are. Why do you desire the 'Wall' this badly anyway? Do you honestly
believe that you can become a god by possessing the 'Wall'?]

[I know very well that possessing it won't turn me into a god. However, at
the bare minimum, I'd become one of the cowards belonging to the 'Final
Scenario'.]

[I see. So, you knew about the 'Final Scenario', didn't you…]

Agares chuckled bitterly, but then, madness suddenly brushed past his eyes.

[Sorry, but you can't become the owner of that 'Wall'.]
[That's not for you to decide. Besides, when you die, your 'Wall' will…]

[You see, I've already handed my 'Wall' over to someone else.]

[That sort of a…]

It was then, Asmodeus's shoulders suddenly flinched. Through the instincts
of a Demon King, it realized that what Agares had said was true.

[…Just to who?]

[Well now, that's something for you to find out.]

Asmodeus roared out in anger and its claws pierced into Agares's neck. As
the fragments of Stories splattered around like real blood, the latter looked
up into the sky.

[Isn't this quite beautiful, Metatron? This is our end.]

The duet of 'Good and Evil' dimly continuing on was now flowing within
the night sky of the apocalypse.

He saw the cascading meteor shower and grinned brightly.




[Constellation, 'Demon King of Salvation', is currently activating
'Sacrificial Will Lv.9'!]

"That's really pissing me off. Seriously. I can't even switch that off, either."

Han Sooyoung panted angrily and shouted out loudly. Still stuck inside the
ever-expanding fog of darkness, the three of them were fighting against the
clones that seemed to increase in number with every passing second.

They knew that Kim Dokja was just beyond here.
But it was impossible to break past this fog of darkness with the remaining
magical power each of them had. So, the best thing they could do under the
circumstances was to concentrate their energy into one person right now.

Even though they knew that, the trio didn't want to yield.

If it was simply about Kim Dokja's sake, then it wouldn't have mattered
who went there. While looking at the distant star faintly flickering away, all
three of them were thinking the same thing.

The odds of the one heading towards that star dying were very high.

The fog of darkness was getting heavier and thicker, and the Apocalypse
Dragon's shockwave was also getting more violent as well.

Kim Dokja was still alive. However, the odds of saving him were low. And
even if he was rescued, they'd still die alongside him, anyway.

And so, this bickering wasn't about choosing who gets to save him, but to
find the person who'd die for someone else, instead.

"Both of you know this already, but I cannot die," said Yoo Joonghyuk
first.

Jung Heewon knew what he meant by 'Cannot die' and was about to get
angry, but then, Han Sooyoung was a step faster than her. "You need to
think about this carefully, Jung Heewon. You aren't going to die alone,
remember that."

Right then, Jung Heewon felt the weight of the cross on her back. She had
nothing to retort back with.

If she died here, then the person on her back would die as well.

"In that case, you take over Hyunsung-ssi for a…"

"Jung Heewon! Behind you!"
She reflexively looked behind her after hearing Han Sooyoung's yell.
However, there was nothing there. The moment she went, 'Ah!', someone
pushed her from behind, and while staggering ungainly, she fell back
towards the ground below.

By the time she unfurled the Archangel's wings to stop her fall, the figures
of both Yoo Joonghyuk and Han Sooyoung had grown so far away.

"Damn it! What's the mea… Stop, both of you!"

After seeing the two hurriedly grow distant without even bothering to
receive her magical energy, she instantly figured out what they were trying
to do here. And because she knew now, there was simply no way that she'd
suppress her emotions welling up.

Kim Dokja asked her to save him. However, in order to do that, she couldn't
chase after those two.

"Uriel."

She swallowed back her boiling emotions and extended her hand out. The
magical power of an Archangel reaching out from her hand pierced past the
darkness and formed blinding wings on the backs of the flying duo.

It was right then, she felt a powerful throb on her back, coming from a
certain someone's heart. It palpitated powerfully, as if he had something to
say.

Jung Heewon replied. "Me too, Hyunsung-ssi."

She watched the two arrows of light traverse through the space and get
further away, and then, at the faint, weak starlight waiting for them just
beyond their reach. She bit down on her lower lip as if she was enduring
against something.

"But, I think it's not our turn yet."
                    Chapter 413: Ep. 78 - Twist/轉, V


I remained within my crushed consciousness as Stories continued to send
whispers in my direction.

[Story, 'Demon King of Salvation', is continuing with its storytelling.]

Yes, I'm still listening.

I haven't fallen asleep.

[Story, 'King of a Kingless World', is sustaining you.]

I endured on while eating the Stories I lived through like a newborn chick
being fed. After every sensation from my skin and joints disappeared, it felt
as if time had stopped moving. It was like a clock tasked with maintaining
my inner balance was broken.

['Final Dragon of the Book of Revelation' is letting out a violent roar!]

[Indescribable Distance' is glaring at 'Final Dragon of the Book of
Revelation'.]
The contest of strength was still going on outside. A face-off, one calamity
against the other.

I could sense the vibration from the shockwave spreading from far away,
even inside this fog.

Although the Status remained strong, the size of the vibration was gradually
weakening. As I expected, it seemed that the 'Indescribable Distance' was in
a superior position.

The Apocalypse Dragon was so strong that it surpassed all possible
imaginations, but as a calamity, it had woken up from its seal not too long
ago. It'd not be quite enough to contend with the 'Indescribable Distance'
that had been drifting around in the <Star Stream> for a long, long time.

So, the balance of power would slowly tilt towards the latter. The problem
would be with its clones, though.

[Exclusive skill, 'Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint' 3rd stage is activating!]

I planned to not use this power on my companions. Unfortunately, I didn't
have any other choice in my current situation.

Tsu-chuchuchuchut!

Accompanied by the pain akin to my head being crushed, dim, indistinct
images floated up to my view. The white noise was pretty intense, perhaps
due to the worsening damage to the Stories, but I could still just about make
out the contents somehow.

⸢"Go and save Kim Dokja."⸥

The chaotic battlefield appeared before me. And then, I saw the Ruyi Bang
rocking the skies of that battlefield as well.

He did come.
Golden-coloured thin fur danced entrancingly in the air. Jang Hayoung,
ably enduring the advent of the Great Sage, was releasing her new-found
Status towards the sky. The Black Flame Dragon and Uriel were helping
her out, and behind them, I also saw Kyrgios and the Breaking the Sky
Sword Saint, too.

Hades and Persephone were protecting my companions from the clones.
The 'Mass Production Maker' was busy loading the collapsed Constellations
in his [X-grade Ferrarghini]…

And soon, a huge explosion noise resounded out from the center of the
battlefield, and a gigantic ship suddenly made its appearance.

⸢This is the sign of the covenant I am making between me and you and
every living creature with you, a covenant for all generations to come.⸥
The Story of the Ark as written by <Eden> began dyeing the battlefield. It
seemed to me that Metatron had come to a decision. Indeed, he must've
realized that sealing the Apocalypse Dragon away would be too difficult at
this point.

⸢"Ahjussi…"⸥

Shin Yoosung and Lee Jihye aboard the Ark were looking up at the sky.
The former was supporting Lee Gilyoung, who seemed to have blacked out.
It was her duty to stop the boy from going on a rampage, and thankfully,
my Incarnation seemed to be performing her duty admirably.

Constellations and Incarnations had evacuated onto the Ark, and then, I
heard the sound of the Island collapsing.

[Constellation, 'Mandala's Guardian', is looking at you.]

I thought that a faint outline of the Buddhist rosary had appeared before my
eyes, and that was when I heard his true voice.
[Oh, dear child. It has finally come to this.]

I could only smile weakly towards him.

'You knew this would happen already'.

The 108 rosary beads that appeared before my eyes began emitting
wondrous light.

Sakyamuni must've predicted this moment as soon as I appeared in his
radar.

To him, the flow of time wasn't in a straight line but actually, one giant
circle. He might not know of the detailed information on the future, but
through the events of the past, he was able to read the present.

[The history of this island comes to an end here. And things will get rather
busy from now on.]

I already knew why he'd get 'busy' thanks to the 'Ways of Survival'.

The rosary beads vibrated all at once as they became whiter and whiter.
Soon, this island would be closed. And just like what happened tens of
thousands of years ago, this island would seal the Apocalypse Dragon once
more.

This island would become a giant rosary that contains the Apocalypse
Dragon.

'Please, allow my companions on the Ark to escape from the island'.

The rosary before me emitted a faint trace of light. It was a sign of
agreement.

[However, you can't be saved, my

child.] I nodded my head. I thought as

much.
Well, I was stuck right in the middle of the Apocalypse Dragon and the
Nameless Mist, after all.

[Oh, dear child, I pray for story's…]

His true voice was swept up by the shockwave as well as the wave of the
fog of darkness and got erased.

My whole body began shuddering like a lone leaf in the wind. The rate of
my fragmented Stories disintegrating was speeding up. I curled up even
more.

I was almost there.

If I endure this part, then <Kim Dokja's Company> would acquire a
brandnew Giant Story.

We'd be able to meet the condition of 'Twist (轉)' that leads us towards the
Final Scenario.

[Story, 'King of a Kingless World', has stopped its storytelling.]

But then, Stories began cutting out one by one.

[Story, 'Returnee's Disciple', has stopped its storytelling.]

[Story, 'Gourmet Association's Heretic', has stopped its storytelling.]

It became harder to breathe and my vision grew dimmer.

[Story, 'One Who Is Loved By an Archangel', has stopped its

storytelling.] I knew that everything would be over if I lose my

consciousness here.

[Story, 'One Who Hunted the King of Calamity', is curling up.]

[Story, 'One Who Killed an Outer God', is resisting.]
That was why I desperately held on to my consciousness.

I filled my head trying to get away from me with intimately familiar words.

Right, let me recall the 'Ways of Survival'.

For some extraordinary reason, though, what appeared in my mind wasn't
the contents of the 'Ways of Survival', but my life during my middle school
years. Memories of me sneakily using the PC without the knowledge of my
cousins to read the 'Ways of Survival', or when I was doodling on the
corners of the school textbook. Memories, when I transcribed the contents
of the novel on a notebook, or when I drew up the chart of the power scale
of all the characters.

– Dokja, would you like to become a writer when you grow up?

A teacher asked me that after discovering my doodling. I replied that what I
wanted to become wasn't a writer, but a reader. The teacher formed a
strange expression after hearing that, but eventually smiled back at me.

– That's not such a bad idea. Because a book needs a reader to be complete.

That teacher-nim who said that to me passed away four days later due to a
car accident.

That was life.

I knew that. I knew that life was not some story.

[Story, 'Demon King of Salvation', has stopped its storytelling.]

However, even still…

[Story, 'Life and Death Companions', is continuing on with its

storytelling.] I would've liked this life to become a story.

'I want to live'.
I reached out, but there was no sense of anything.

From afar, something was breaking past the battlefield of the Apocalypse
Dragon and the Outer God to approach my location. Although it was an
incredibly faint general outline of a person, I recognised who it was right
away.

[<Star Stream> is acknowledging your stunning achievement.]

[You have acquired a new 'Giant Story'.]

Warm rays of light leaked in from somewhere and enveloped my body. Just
as I tried to say something, a voice came to me from somewhere.




I want to save him.

I definitely want to save him.

Han Sooyoung bit her lips hard enough to draw blood and thought to
herself over and over again.

[Constellation, 'Demon King of Salvation', is currently activating 'Will to
Live Lv.1'.]

Anyone who heard that message would think the same as her.

It wasn't from just anyone, but from that Kim Dokja.

"It's still not too late."

Han Sooyoung heard Yoo Joonghyuk's words and wiped the blood trickling
down her lip before forming a grin. "You know, I've never yielded to
anyone in my life before."

"I know that you've reached your limit."
"You talking about yourself?"

"I can endure longer than you."

Kim Dokja wasn't too far from them now. However, both time and their
situation didn't look good at all.

The forward momentum Jung Heewon added earlier could only take them
this far. With their remaining energy, they were unable to fight against the
clones nor break past that thick fog of darkness.

Ku-gugugugu…

From Han Sooyoung's bandages, now unwrapped, a mixture of blood and
Stories flooded out. Her complexion was now incredibly pale.

Yoo Joonghyuk spoke. "Are you planning to meet a dog's death here?"

"It's just that, I can't trust you 100%, that's all."

Something cold flitted in and out of Yoo Joonghyuk's eyes just then.

She still asked him, though. "You know that I possess [Lie Detection],
right?"

"Of course."

"Do you really consider Kim Dokja as your companion?"

"You're asking an unnecessary question."

"I know that the two of you went through all sorts of crappy scenarios and
built up some sort of a bond in the process. But, separate from all that, there
is something I still can't wrap my head around." Unlike what she said
earlier, she didn't activate [Lie Detection] during her speech. "You
originally didn't have any allies and stuff like that. But, you've changed so
much after entering this regression turn."

"…"
"That's why I can't trust you. You used to forsake your allies all for
your great cause, so why are you trying to rescue Kim Dokja now?"
Yoo Joonghyuk's gaze met Han Sooyoung's.

It had been such a long time since she last saw him in a pitch-black
darkness that for a moment there, she involuntarily ended up shuddering. It
was possible that she had touched something she shouldn't have. Because
she didn't know much about Yoo Joonghyuk's regression turns, to begin
with.

He replied to her. "Once these scenarios come to an end, there is something
I must confirm with Kim Dokja."

One couldn't read any emotions or thoughts from his face. That was like his
version of despair, maybe his rage, or even his hellish loneliness. Or, it was
possible that none of that belonged to Yoo Joonghyuk but to Han Sooyoung
herself, instead.

"And that is why, until then I…"

As things stood, there was only one truth she could glean from what he
said.
"Okay, so, you're planning to keep him alive, is that it?"

She looked to her right hand as she finished speaking. [Black Flame]
burning in darkness waited for her there. The very last drops of her magical
power were drawing on her hand.

"You better keep your promise. If you can't save him, then…"

Her burning gaze landed on Yoo Joonghyuk next. Her small palm touched
his back, and then, an intense storm of magical energy whipped up.

"…Just drop dead and go to the next turn!"

The Black Flame Dragon's grace extending out from her arm permeated
into
Yoo Joonghyuk for a moment; the magical energy from Jung Heewon and
Han Sooyoung combined in that instance to create wings of light and
darkness just beyond his black coat.

Kuwaaaaaah-!!

Yoo Joonghyuk grasped the [Black Heavenly Demon Sword] tightly as he
crossed the vast emptiness.

He was able to cross the fog of darkness he couldn't possibly traverse with
his own powers alone with the aid of Jung Heewon and Han Sooyoung.

[Grace of the Constellation, 'Demon-like Judge of Fire', is permeating into
you.]

[Grace of the Constellation, 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon', is permeating
into you.]

Even then, his magical power reserve continued to fall. The density of the
fog grew heavier and the starlight grew fainter in turn. Yoo Joonghyuk
gritted his teeth.

He needed a sharper, keener, more accurate story.

A Story that could pierce through that fog of Calamity somehow…

[Story, 'One who Opposes the Miracle', is continuing with its storytelling.]

There it was. Right there in the path of emptiness he was gazing at, the
history he lived alongside Kim Dokja lay scattered like the Milky Way.
Yoo Joonghyuk ran on that path.

[Story, 'One Who Killed an Outer God', is continuing with its storytelling.]

He ran on one of the Stories, and…

[Story, 'Giant's Liberator', is continuing with its storytelling.]
And, as he ran on yet another Story, his Incarnation Body began moving
faster and faster. Soon, gentle rays of golden light enveloped his entire
figure. Transcendence level two, then three… The moment he surpassed
level four, his body transformed temporarily.

Wu-dududuk.

Bones all over his body screamed, and as if it had been completely
overhauled, his appearance changed to become even more agile than before.

And eventually, into Transcendence level five.

[Story, 'Life and Death Companions', is continuing with its storytelling.]

He saw a star dying alone in the distance. But to him, that guy no longer
looked like a Constellation now.

Kim Dokja.

It was still not too late.

The Stories they remembered still remained, and the people who
remembered him were still alive. The story he so wanted to create, it was
still alive and kicking in this world.

[Story, 'Kim Dokja's Company', is continuing with its storytelling.]

You mustn't die in this place.

[Incarnation Body's durability has reached its limit!]

[The 'Ark' is calling out to you!]

Yoo Joonghyuk suddenly felt a powerful suction force pulling him from
behind. That power was preventing him from getting closer to Kim Dokja.

[Constellation, the 'Mandala's Guardian', is calling out to you.]

"Shut up!"
Yoo Joonghyuk resisted against all those forces and advanced forward. Kim
Dokja was right in front of his nose. Ten steps away, nine, eight… He
endured against sparks tearing into his body and continued to march on.

Five steps away, four…

He reached out.

He reached out towards the ends of Kim Dokja's clothes drifting aimlessly
in the emptiness. The moment his hand was about to touch the fabric…

Along with the sensation of his breathing coming to a stop, the
surroundings began shaking. It wasn't because he blacked out or had lost his
consciousness.

When he regained his wits, he realized that someone was grabbing his
wrist. A firm, strong hand was holding his wrist, not letting it go.

And it happened to be a very familiar hand.

[Incarnation Yoo Joonghyuk's Sponsor is greatly shaken up.]

The entire world was trembling; noises of the Apocalypse Dragon and the
Outer God clashing resounded out, and in the distance, the island and its
dimension disintegrating could be seen. But what Yoo Joonghyuk saw just
then was far, far more shocking than those sights of the apocalypse itself.

Past the 'chaos' that was endlessly ominous and impossible to determine
how far it extended, a white coat exactly the same as Kim Dokja's danced in
the space.

This being now carried the unconscious Kim Dokja under his arm.

From the pitch-black darkness, that abyss-like pair of eyes was looking at
Yoo Joonghyuk.

Slowly, agonisingly slowly, trembling spread up from the ends of his toes,
and his grabbed wrist shook like crazy. Because he knew who this being in
front of his eyes was. He knew this being so well and because of that, he
couldn't say anything at all.

– Are you 'Kim Dokja' from the future?

Some time ago, Yoo Joonghyuk had asked that question to a certain
someone.

He asked that because he initially thought that only Kim Dokja knew of the
story extending as far as to the 1863rd regression turn.

However, now he thought back to that moment, he realized how stupid that
question was.

A being who knew all the stories right up until the 1863rd turn.

A being who understood a story the best was not the 'reader' who had read
it, but the 'character' that actually lived through that very story.

[Go back. You can't save anyone.]
                   Chapter 414: Ep. 78 - Twist/轉, VI


The great battle between the Apocalypse Dragon and the 'Indescribable
Distance'.

Stars continued to fall as two calamities collided, and this spectacle of the
end times was being broadcast to all corners of <Star Stream>.

[The end of this island is approaching.]

The 'Mandala's Guardian', too, was watching it through a display panel. As
the 'Isle of Reincarnators' began to disintegrate, little bits of 'noise' started
to appear on his Incarnation Body.

Yoo Sangah still stuck inside the cistern spoke towards the Guardian.

– But, you knew this would happen, didn't you?

[What makes you say that?]

Her soul wordlessly emitted a soft light. Currently, her new Incarnation
Body hadn't woken up yet.
– Because… the 'you' I read about in the 'Library' was…

[Please, you shouldn't discuss that story yet. There are those who eavesdrop
on our conversation.]

The moment his words came to an end, the entirety of the temple was
rocked by a vicious tremor. Ominous, turbid air was pressing down on the
surroundings.

Beastly growlings could be heard next; something emerging from the
shadows cast by all four corners of the chamber wriggled noticeably.

Yoo Sangah's soul trembled in worry after sensing that foreboding aura. As
the bubbles inside the cistern increased in numbers, Sakyamuni finally
stepped forward.

[Oh, the Hounds of Tindalos, it seems that you've arrived for the wrong
prey today.]

He gently recited a Buddhist prayer, causing the shadows drifting around
them to vanish in an instant – as if they were hounds searching for another
prey to hunt.

Only after those shadows had completely disappeared did Yoo Sangah
begin speaking again in some difficulty.

– What were those…?

[Oh, dear child. The door to the Final Scenario draws near.]

Sakyamuni's voice had become graver, weightier.

Ku-gugugu…

The Buddhist rosary around his neck emitting heat rose up in the air
simultaneously. Already knowing what he was planning to do, Yoo Sangah
asked him a new question.
– Am I not going to reincarnate?

[Why do you think so?]

– If this island is finished, then you'd also die. And I won't be able
toreincarnate, then.

[Dear child, we have already made a deal. A deal where you'll answer my
favour, and this body will answer yours. And with that, establish this
world's balance.] Sakyamuni smiled benevolently and continued on. [And
that is why, my child, you will reincarnate as promised. Although you
haven't inherited the Incarnation Body and therefore can't make your mark
yet, remember that your role in the 'Final Scenario' will be critical. That is
why…]

She wanted to ask him what he meant by that. But before she could, her
consciousness began dimming.

[…For the time being, please, get some rest.]

After her soul fell into a slumber, Sakyamuni extracted her Incarnation
Body and started the procedure to transmit it to a certain place.

The temple was rocked once more as the 'Kugugugu' noise reverberated
throughout its interior. The display panel changed what it was showing as
well. It was a scene of two men possessing the exact same countenance
staring at each other, one wearing a black coat while the other, a white one.

[Finally, you've also made your move, oh the one who stands at the end of
the cycle.] Sakyamuni stood still and watched this scene for a while, before
raising his voice as if he was rueful about something. [In that case, I should
start making my preparations as well.]




But, how?
Yoo Joonghyuk hated that question. It was the most commonly asked
question while living as a Regressor. He even knew all the potential
changes in the repertoire, too – from "But, how did you know that?" to
"But, how did you do that, you bastard??"

He got so sick and tired of that question, in fact, that there were times
where he simply killed those who might throw that question in his way.

But now, he…

"…But, how?"

He ended up asking that very question himself. Even though he knew his
opponent would mock him for it.

Tsu-chuchuchuchu…

A face he knew intimately well looked back from within the storm of
Probability's aftermaths. It was a face that couldn't be here, something that
shouldn't even be here.

[Chaos Points in the applicable region are rising up rapidly!]

[Problem has occurred in the scenario's balance!]

Yoo Joonghyuk staggered unsteadily, but still, he did his absolute best to
figure out the current situation. Like the passage of time, delayed by a
broken clock, suddenly rushing forward again, countless hypotheses went
on a rampage inside his head.

…

⸢He should've been Kim Dokja.⸥

⸢But, he isn't Kim Dokja.⸥

⸢1863.⸥
⸢But, how? How could something like this…⸥

[You should know very well that I hate that question.]

As if his thoughts had been read, the person before his eyes replied to the
earlier question. Yoo Joonghyuk took another look at the face.

The white [Infinite Dimension Space Coat] glimmering within the bright
explosions of sparks; the eyesockets where a pair of empty darkness
should've been were now filled by irises of the exact same size as his. It
wasn't just the eyes, though – the nose, lips, jawline, and even the build,
too. A figure so exact that it was like he was looking in a mirror. The sole
difference being a large scar running across one of this being's cheeks.

Yoo Joonghyuk spoke, almost out of disbelief and anger.

"You are not me."

[Correct. I'm not you.]

The eyes containing pitch-black darkness now looked down on Kim Dokja
hanging on his waist.

[Constellation, 'Secretive Plotter', is looking at the Constellation, 'Demon
King of Salvation'.]

The message landed like a final shot to confirm the kill and Yoo Joonghyuk
shuddered involuntarily.

"The 'Secretive Plotter'…"

This being right before him was really none other than that 'Secretive
Plotter'??

The one who sent Kim Dokja to the 1863rd regression turn, the one who
told him Kim Dokja's secret and caused so much chaos, the one who sent
all those countless 'indirect messages' until now…
That 'Secretive Plotter' was himself who went past the 1863rd turn??

Yoo Joonghyuk bit his lower lip after hearing a distant explosion. He
should think about this at another date.

"Let go of Kim Dokja."

His opponent was the 'Secretive Plotter', an Outer God born from the Chaos
itself. Considering his unpredictable pattern up until now, it was eminently
possible that appearance was a fake…

[It's a miracle that you managed to survive this far with such a slow head.]

"Shut up, and let go of him. Or else…"

[Or else what?]

Yoo Joonghyuk felt his head become dizzy from the Status pouring out in
front of his nose.

He knew that his opponent was powerful. Even then, he didn't expect the
gap in strength to be this great. The current him could evenly fight against
Indra, an upper-level Narrative-grade Constellation, and not only that, he
was able to inflict the god with grievous injuries, too.

But, compared to the being right before his eyes…

[What exactly can you do to me?]

Just what on earth was this?

Yoo Joonghyuk breathed heavily while calming his legs shaking almost out
of control. He noticed that the clones of the 'Indescribable Distance'
surrounding him from all sides began to sneakily retreat ever since the
Plotter's entrance.

⸢Something like this cannot happen.⸥
He got angry at the scenario's irrationality, and he grew furious at the <Star
Stream> that permitted such a nonsensical Probability.

And when his thoughts reached that far, the inside of his head finally
cleared up.

⸢If I think about everything the 'Secretive Plotter' has done so far, then him
incarnating to this place right now should be impossible.⸥
The 'Secretive Plotter' was different from someone like the Great Sage
Heaven's Equal, Uriel, or even the Black Flame Dragon. No, he was an
Outer God, and would need an incredible amount of Probability just to
make his descent to this world.

Tsu-chuchuchut…!

For sure, the Plotter's entire body was getting swept up in the
progressivelyworsening storm of aftermaths with every passing second. No
matter who you were, you could never be free from the Probability's
aftermaths. Which meant that the odds of victory weren't zero.

⸢If I was Kim Dokja in this situation…⸥

As if he had become Kim Dokja, Yoo Joonghyuk began speaking in a calm
tone of voice. "I don't understand this. You've been staying below the radar
until now, so why did you suddenly intervene like this?"

[Because now is the right time.]

"…Right time, is it?"

As soon as that exchange came to an end, a bizarre roar resounded out from
the other side of the empty void. It seemed that the battle between the
Apocalypse Dragon and the 'Indescribable Distance' had reached its zenith.

The surrounding space distorted greatly after an incredible explosion swept
by. Yoo Joonghyuk witnessed the view of the cosmos seemingly being
crushed whole and it really dawned on him that the <Star Stream> was
indeed marching towards its destruction.

For sure, it'd not be strange for whatever crazy things to appear now with
that type of Probability running amok. And the 'Secretive Plotter' had been
waiting for this moment all along.

Ku-gugugugu!

The [Great Holes] were opening up far above his head. It'd be his first time
seeing that many [Great Holes] appear at the same time.

That was the hole of calamity that supposedly could destroy a world even if
only one opened up. And through those vast, distant holes, innumerable
tentacles began peeking themselves out.

[Ohhhhh!]

[■■■… ■■■■■■]

[Oh, the great Plotter!]

[The rise of the vanished islands will now commence…!]

…

Horrifying cries could be heard coming from everywhere. Those true voices
caused the bodies of the listeners to be stained by turbid energy.

As if he was reacting to those true voices, the 'Secretive Plotter', still
carrying Kim Dokja, began rising up slowly. More specifically, towards
one of the [Great Holes].

Yoo Joonghyuk's expression stiffened.

"Wait! Stop!"

Even though he had no concrete plan, he still stood in the path of the
'Secretive Plotter'. That's all he did, yet blood trickled down from his
nostrils. His vision grew dimmer and the hand holding his sword trembled.
Even then, he still spoke. "I can't allow you to leave."

The 'Secretive Plotter' looked at Yoo Joonghyuk in such a condition and
spoke. [Don't attempt anything foolish. Being able to regress does not
guarantee you an intact life in the next turn.]

Yoo Joonghyuk accurately figured out what those words implied. One life
didn't end with that life; all the previous lives would always remain as a
curse during the following turns.

He grasped his sword hard enough to break its grip and spoke. "I'm not
planning to go to the next turn."

[…Is that so?]

Right afterwards, he felt pain akin to his entire body being crushed. This
attack had no sound, no prior warning. Just the movement of the gaze, and
Yoo Joonghyuk's entire body was being squeezed tightly as if he was
thrown inside a compactor.

He vomited out blood before roaring out. "Don't look down on me!"

[Giant Story, 'Demon Realm's Spring', has begun its storytelling!]

[Giant Story, 'Torch that Swallowed the Myth', has begun its storytelling!]

The pressure from the Status suppressing him faltered momentarily when
the auras of the Giant Stories enveloped his body.

Since Kim Dokja was unconscious, Yoo Joonghyuk was now the holder of
the greatest share of the 'Giant Stories' the <Kim Dokja's Company>
possessed.

He didn't miss this opening and swung his [Black Heavenly Demon
Sword].
He poured all of his remaining magical energy into the weapon, and the
waves of Breaking the Sky rode along on its blade.

The sword that could shatter the heavens and had already cut down a star.
That very sword was now moving in order to cut down none other than
himself. It was a surprise attack with no pretence or tricks.

However, his sword came to a dead stop after a loud, sharp metallic clang
resounded out. Something made out of metal had blocked his attack. Yoo
Joonghyuk's eyes grew larger.

It was the [Splitting the Sky Sword].

The weapon that broke a long time ago in his 3rd turn life was being held
by the 'Secretive Plotter'.

[You can't win against me.]

The two blades collided again, causing the vicious winds of flaming sparks
to dance around. Blood poured out from Yoo Joonghyuk's nose and lips. It
felt as if his soul was crashing down to the far side of the cosmos just from
the clashing of their blades. Just one collision and his right arm were
smashed to bits and his ribs shattered.

Yoo Joonghyuk didn't display any hints of the horrifying pain and
continued to raise his Status.

At the bare minimum, he'd not die.

Which meant that it was still doable.

"You're also handicapped, just as me."

Indeed, the Plotter's Status was becoming unstable as seconds ticked by.
Sparks grew heavier and more vicious, while Stories maintaining the coat
and his Incarnation Body had begun scattering away. It was as if Stories
that couldn't be fused had been mixed together.
⸢Without a doubt, the bastard is pushing himself. I need to buy more time.⸥

On top of this, 'Secretive Plotter' seemed to be worried about something
else for a little while, as well. He didn't show it in his expression, but Yoo
Joonghyuk could sense it nevertheless.

Indeed, his Status was trying to avoid being noticed by something.
Meaning, this bastard wasn't in a situation where he could appear here with
complete disregard to everything.

[Trying to buy time, huh… it's a plan that doesn't suit you. Did you learn it
from Kim Dokja?]

Yoo Joonghyuk didn't reply. The fact that his opponent had become chatty
could only mean that the Plotter had become anxious as well.

[You're only at the 3rd turn. So, your end goal shouldn't have anything to
do with Kim Dokja. So, why are you so hung up on him?]

"That's what I want to ask you."

[In order to reach my objective, I require Kim Dokja's presence.]

"Then, that's my answer, too."

At that moment, a faint trace of emotions flickered within the Plotter's eyes.
As if he knew what Yoo Joonghyuk was thinking of.

[You won't succeed. Because even Kim Dokja wouldn't know what this
regression turn's Final Scenario looks like.]

"If it was only him, true."

[How amusing. The 3rd turn who doesn't even know anything…]

"I may only be the 3rd turn, but…" Stories flooded out from Yoo
Joonghyuk's entire figure. "At the bare minimum, I've lived the 3rd turn that
you don't know anything about."
New Stories he earned during this 3rd turn became a part of him and
continued to circulate within him. Some texts flowed by in sadness, while
some others moved about elegantly and beautifully. Stories that didn't exist
in the past lives – and those that he might not get to earn again in the future
lives.

The 'Secretive Plotter' quietly watched those Stories, before opening his lips
to speak.

[No, I do know of this life, oh the puppet of the Oldest Dream.]
                  Chapter 415: Ep. 78 - Twist/轉, VII


The puppet of the Oldest Dream.

Yoo Joonghyuk frowned deeply, although this wouldn't be his first time
hearing that term.

"It's that nonsense about a puppet again. What does it even mean?"

[You still haven't even figured that out yet, and that's why you're only the
3rd turn.]

"Don't speak as if you're so amazing yourself. What do you know about this
turn, anyway?"

[I know a lot more than you.]

A burst of anger took over Yoo Joonghyuk and the golden light suddenly
dyed his right eye.

[Exclusive skill, 'Sage's Eye Lv.???', is activating!]
The current Yoo Joonghyuk was a Transcendent, repeatedly experiencing
the rapid rise of his Status and now strong enough to fight against
Narrativegrade Constellations. When considering the fact that the
discernment level of the [Sage's Eye] depended on the user's Status, he
should be able to read the fragmented information on a Constellation now.

Tsu-chuchuchut!

Only two people managed to perfectly shut out his [Sage's Eye] until now.
One was the Prophet, Anna Croft, while the other, Kim Dokja.

However, if his thoughts were correct, then there should be one more being
that he couldn't read, as well.

[As befitting the 3rd turn, your judgement is also dull.]

The right eye of the 'Secretive Plotter' also glowed in the brilliant golden
hue, exactly the same as Yoo Joonghyuk.

The vision in his right eye was dyed crimson momentarily, and the trickling
blood wet Yoo Joonghyuk's cheek.

[Exclusive skill, 'Sage's Eye' has been perfectly defended against by another
'Sage's Eye'!]

[Constellation, 'Secretive Plotter', is looking at the Incarnation, 'Yoo
Joonghyuk'.]

"There's no way that a bastard like you are 'Yoo Joonghyuk'." He simply
couldn't accept it. "No matter which regression turn 'Yoo Joonghyuk' it
is, he'd never use the scenario of the others as his entertainment." He
was certain of this.

Even if he existed in other regression turns, regardless of how many lives
he'd go through, he was completely certain of never changing his creed.
The eyes of the 'Secretive Plotter' quietly gleamed. [You're correct. I'm
merely the 'Secretive Plotter' now.]

He was merely the 'Secretive Plotter' – something this being continued to
mention up until now.

He continued on. [The 'Yoo Joonghyuk' from the 3rd turn only existed to
destroy <Star Stream>.]

"…So, you knew that."

The 'Secretive Plotter' glanced at the [Black Heavenly Demon Sword]
crying out viciously and vigorously, and formed a faint smile. No, rather
than calling that a smile, it'd be more correct to describe that as a 'slightly
unsettling movement of lips', instead.

[When you destroy <Star Stream>, every Constellation within it will fall.
Which means this fool will die as well.]

The ends of the Plotter's gaze fell on the slumped figure of Kim Dokja. He
wavered as if his breathing would come to an end at any second, causing
Yoo Joonghyuk to dash forward.

Claaaang!

The [Splitting the Sky Sword] and the [Black Heavenly Demon Sword]
clashed and blue sparks danced everywhere. Blood trickled down from the
corner of Yoo Joonghyuk's lips.

[Giant Story, 'Torch That Swallowed the Myth', is roaring out!]

He didn't even bother to wipe that off and swung the sword once more. That
was an attack borne out of the need to get rid of all the unnecessary
thoughts from his mind. An act of one last-ditch effort, to focus on the
target right before eyes by simplifying his thought process. Unfortunately,
his opponent knew already what he was trying to do here.
The 'Secretive Plotter' evaded the [Black Heavenly Demon Sword] and
threw a question as if to make fun of him. [Why are you trying to rescue
Kim Dokja? At the end of the day, isn't he just another Constellation you
hate so much?]

The faintest hint of unrest briefly flickered on the attacking blade.

The Giant Story's Status emitted by Yoo Joonghyuk wavered ever so
slightly, but the 'Secretive Plotter' didn't miss that opening and took a stride
forward.

[According to your creed, this fool should've died already. After all, there
are no good Constellations in this world, are there?]

The Constellations. Beings that coveted the scenarios of <Star Stream>,
acted like voyeurs on the incarnations and their lives, and gluttonously
devoured everything in this world as the subjects of Stories. Technically
speaking, the 'Demon King of Salvation' was nothing more than a
Constellation, just like them.

And the current Yoo Joonghyuk's goal was to destroy all Constellations.
However, he didn't kill Kim Dokja after the latter had become one.

⸢But, why not?⸥

It was a question he couldn't readily answer. That was why, he also had
been delaying facing it, too.

⸢Why did Yoo Joonghyuk not kill Kim Dokja?⸥

All those human connections surrounding Kim Dokja briefly flitted in and
out of Yoo Joonghyuk's mind.

Shin Yoosung and Kim Dokja; Lee Gilyoung and Kim Dokja; Kim Dokja
fighting against other Constellations.

Kim Dokja, who sacrificed his life for his companions.
And Kim Dokja, dying in such a wretched state like this in the end…

"Kim Dokja, he…"

Fragments of Stories floated around Kim Dokja told his tale as he lived as
the 'Demon King of Salvation'. Yoo Joonghyuk knew of those Stories, too.

They were the ones he also lived through, as well.

[Baat…]

Biyoo's voice came from very far away; Yoo Joonghyuk heard that voice,
and slowly opened his lips. "He, the 'Demon King of Salvation', might be a
Constellation, but…"

There were no good Constellations in this world. That belief hadn't changed
in Yoo Joonghyuk's mind as he lived through the 0th turn all the way to the
current 3rd turn, a total of four lives.

The only good star was a fallen one, a good Dokkaebi was a dead one, and
there was no such thing as a 'good' scenario.

Even then, Yoo Joonghyuk was betraying his own creed right now.

"That 'Kim Dokja'… He isn't a Constellation. No, he's simply a

human." Even though he knew that made no sense.

Keu-reuk…

Something cried from within its hiding place in the darkness. Keu-reuk,
keureuk, keu-reuk… It almost sounded as if the darkness itself was crying.
No, it sounded perhaps more like laughter, instead.

Right in the middle of that darkness was the 'Secretive Plotter'.

[The puppet of the Oldest Dream. You don't know anything about 'Kim
Dokja'.]
The [Splitting the Sky Sword] gripped in the Plotter's hand let out a
lonesome howl. That was the 'Sword Song', possessed only by a being who
had endured a life no one could possibly understand. Yoo Joonghyuk raised
his own momentum, not wanting to be pushed back. "Do not speak as if
you know something that others don't."

Rather than a verbal answer, the 'Secretive Plotter' lightly tapped the
unconscious Kim Dokja. That caused Stories to tumble out of him like the
tears of a child trying and failing to hold himself back.

⸢"I'm Yoo Joonghyuk."⸥

The young Kim Dokja said those words repeatedly.

There he was, leaving the cousin's place to live alone and receiving wages
for part-time work that was well below that of the minimum hourly wage.

⸢"I'm Yoo Joonghyuk."⸥

It was a humble and rather common story – poverty seen pretty much
everywhere, a down-on-luck tale commonly found everywhere.

A story so common that it was not even worthy of a novelisation treatment.

And there he was, Kim Dokja, living such a story.

⸢"…I'm Yoo Joonghyuk."⸥

Here was the main character who moved through high school, university,
the army, and the company while repeating those words.

While reading the web-novel, while empathising with its lead character,
while being encouraged by the story, while being moved, enraged, and
saddened.

⸢"I am…"⸥
That's how Kim Dokja had lived.

While reading Yoo Joonghyuk's 'Story', he survived a common and
unremarkable life.

In place of his own misfortune, he substituted it for Yoo Joonghyuk's, and
rather than his own misfortune, he consumed Yoo Joonghyuk's deaths
instead; while writing comments, while meddling in with the story itself.
⸢"Dear author-nim, how about you do this in the next episode…?"⸥
[From his birth, Kim Dokja has been a Constellation.]

The Plotter's figure was getting more and more unstable. As if he was being
influenced by the deep darkness, the ends of his white coat were scattering
away into black pieces.

And just like that coat, Kim Dokja's life was crumbling away as well.

[He's a Constellation who consumed another being's life to extend his own.]

Yoo Joonghyuk got to peer into such a life of Kim Dokja. He had seen
those Stories some time ago – he remembered seeing the fragments of those
memories back when Yoo Sangah forcibly sucked him into that place called
the 'Library'.

[…The 3rd turn. You don't remember anyth…]

"I do not care how Kim Dokja of the past lived his life."

The golden aura flooded out from Yoo Joonghyuk's body, as if the only
reason why he kept listening to the Plotter's story was just for this moment.

He slowly opened his eyes, his entire body now dyed in the clear-as-day
golden light. Abundant Status flooded out from his core after he reached the
fifth stage of Transcendence.

"What matters now is that we need him to see the end of this world."
The Breaking the Sky Energy's flow on the [Black Heavenly Demon
Sword] was now going through a transformation.

"And if he needs to die, then I shall be the one to perform the deed."

Yoo Joonghyuk's [Air Step] crossed the space.

['The Ark' is calling out to the Incarnation 'Yoo Joonghyuk'!]

[Constellation, 'Mandala's Guardian', is summoning the Incarnation 'Yoo
Joonghyuk'!]

There truly wasn't much time left.

[Giant Story, 'Demon Realm's Spring', has begun its storytelling!]

[Giant Story, 'Torch that Swallowed the Myth', has begun its storytelling!]

The two Giant Stories now permeated into his blade. The familiar Statuses
of light and darkness were also combined into his attack, too. They were the
magical energy from Han Sooyoung and Jung Heewon.

[Constellation, 'Demon-like Judge of Fire', has graced the Incarnation 'Yoo
Joonghyuk' with her blessing.]

[Constellation, 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon', has graced the Incarnation
'Yoo Joonghyuk' with its blessing.]

Right in this moment, Yoo Joonghyuk was not alone.

The opposing Statuses permeated into the single blade, causing the [Black
Heavenly Demon Sword]'s clear light to spew out a destructive Story.

He ran on the path his blade was guiding him. Every situation the <Kim
Dokja's Company> had lived through was ingrained in all corners of that
path.

The Breaking the Sky Thunder Sword.
The intense-blue arcs of electricity enveloped and danced around Yoo
Joonghyuk's blade. It was the Breaking the Sky Swordsmanship's profound
technique he didn't dare to use even as the Apocalypse Dragon's electrical
shockwave rushed in earlier.

On top of this, he added the secret technique he had been training with all
of his heart and soul until now.

The Breaking the Sky Swordsmanship.

Secret Technique: Inner Mystery Transmission.

Shooting Star Slash.

The technique that even managed to thoroughly defeat Indra, one of the
lokapalas of that powerful <Vedas>.

The blade drew an arrestingly entrancing trajectory of destruction as it
moved to cut down yet another star.

This one single attack carried everything of the 3rd turn Yoo Joonghyuk.

[You can't be reasoned with at all, it seems.]

In the following instance, Yoo Joonghyuk saw it.

The surrounding space-time distorted and a certain Story began telling its
story next.

⸢"I shall definitely kill you all."⸥

That was an intimately familiar voice to him. A voice directed to the
heavens above, filled with hatred.

⸢"Over and over again."⸥

From the 0th turn all the way to the 1863rd – a Story created by the total of
1864 lives.
⸢"By reviving over and over again."⸥

That was the Hell of Eternity.

⸢"I will kill every single one of you."⸥

When the two swords collided, Yoo Joonghyuk felt as if his whole
existence was being erased. The difference in their Statuses went beyond
the realm of overwhelming him and into one of pure respect now.

He understood the despair, the regret, the sadness and the hatred engraved
into every facet of that Story. And at the same time, he couldn't understand
them at all.

He couldn't even bring himself to fathom the depths of those vast emotions.

That was why, just like the countless Yoo Joonghyuks within that Story, he
began despairing.

When facing that Story, he was indeed merely the '3rd turn' Yoo
Joonghyuk, as pointed out earlier by the 'Secretive Plotter'.

Just what did he need to do to understand that incredible vastness of time
itself?

When he regained his wits, Yoo Joonghyuk was flying backwards in space.
The wings Jung Heewon and Han Sooyoung had granted him were torn
now; his [Black Heavenly Demon Sword], now broken in two, spun and
fell alongside him, just like his life.

The seemingly-slow moving [Splitting the Sky Sword] was now closing in
on his heart next.

[Chaos Points are rising rapidly!]

[Someone is growing wary of the existence of the 'Secretive Plotter'!]
['Hound Chasing After the Abyss' has made its appearance!]

It was then that an unexpected event occurred.

Strange lifeforms, just as ominous and foreboding as 'Outer Gods' suddenly
popped out from the corners of the distorted space. They cried out like
perfectly-trained hounds and ignored the laws of space-time to pounce on
the 'Secretive Plotter' as if they were stuck in fast-forward.

Tsu-chuchuchut…!

[Annoying hounds…]

The [Splitting the Sky Sword] falling towards Yoo Joonghyuk's chest
changed its direction and began smacking away the hounds. However, it
still failed to block every single one of them.

Only then did Yoo Joonghyuk realize that those hounds were what the
'Secretive Plotter' had been trying to avoid until now. After getting bitten by
one of the hounds, the Plotter hurriedly flew towards the distant [Great
Hole].

Along with Kim Dokja still clutched in his arm.

Yoo Joonghyuk extended his hand without much energy, but by then, the
star had grown far too distant to reach.

He no longer possessed any strength to go to that star now.

The broken pair of wings crumbled like sand, and just like that, he crashed
towards the darkness of the ground below.




[We need to disembark now.]
"No, you wait! My master and ahjussi haven't come back yet!"

The cold sweat drops oozed out from the troubled 'Master of the Ark' as he
watched Lee Jihye make an unreasonable demand.

[The conclusion of the 89th scenario – 'Final Dragon of the Book of
Revelation' is impending.]

There were only 30 seconds remaining until the closure of the island; they
had to leave this place in the next 20 seconds at the latest. In the end, the
Master of the Ark made his decision and was about to start rowing the oar,
but then…

"There they come!"

Something was falling from the sky above.

"It's Yoo Joonghyuk!"

An unconscious man in a tattered coat, Yoo Joonghyuk, was falling towards
the ground.

"Master! What happened up there??"

Lee Jihye leapt up, caught him, and returned to the Ark. Both Han
Sooyoung and Jung Heewon quickly came in closer to shake him around.

"Hey, Yoo Joonghyuk! Why are you alone?! Where's Kim Dokja…?!"

"What happened to Dokja-ssi??"

Yoo Joonghyuk didn't reply. Realizing what that signified, both women
looked up towards the sky, but then, the Ark began moving.

"N-no, wait! Hang on for a sec! There's one more person still coming!"

"I said, stop! Goddammit!"
Unfortunately, the words of the companions were swept away by the
shockwave, as well as the fog of darkness belonging to the 'Indescribable
Distance', crashing in viciously.

[Location for the scenario is shutting down.]

[Warp is starting.]

Constellations screamed. And under the cascading meteor shower, the
closing curtains descended on a world.

A smaller apocalypse to prevent an even bigger one.

Inside this spectacle, the 'Isle of Reincarnators' was disappearing into the
'forever'.

"No! Stop!! I said, stop!!"

The Ark was disappearing into the clear, bright streak of light. And some
people aboard it were desperately reaching out with their hands.

Some plopped down. Some cried out.

And some watched all of this happen.

"Kim Dokja-!!"

[You have acquired the scenario's calculated reward payment.]

[Someone from <Star Stream> has completed his 'Twist/轉'.]

[Giant Story, 'Season of Light and Darkness', is born!]

And then, only a story nobody wanted to hear remained in that place.
           Chapter 416: Ep. 79 - The Secretive Plotter, I


Two days passed by since the end of the 'Great War of Saints and Demons'.

The nightmare-filled 'Isle of Reincarnators' could no longer be seen;
Constellations were gradually leaving the Ark for their rightful spots in the
night sky.

– This stop is for <Olympus>.

Constellations from <Olympus> stood up from their seats after the ship
made the announcement. Dionysus, standing as their representative, shifted
his gaze over to Jung Heewon and addressed her. [My apologies for leaving
first, even though this is a difficult period for you.]

"No, we'll be fine, thank you."

[Do not be overly worried, however. He's no ordinary Constellation, after
all.
Without a doubt, he's still alive.]

He lightly tapped her shoulder and soon, disappeared beyond the Dark
Dimension while leading other Constellations. She stood there and silently
waited until they were gone from her view before climbing down from the
bow of the Ark. When she got to the bottom of the stairs, she found a
person waiting for her – Han Sooyoung.

"Dionysus?"

"He left."

"Both Cheok Jungyeong and the <Underworld>, too?"

"I think they'll be leaving pretty soon."

"And Uriel?"

Han Sooyoung continued to ask, and Jung Heewon continued to answer.
Most of what they chatted about were trivial information, stuff like Hades
and Persephone, Uriel, Cheok Jungyeong's abode, etc. Some who would be
leaving, some who would be staying, some who would accompany them…
A part of the info was about the matters everyone knew already. The thing
was, though, it was not really important whether someone knew this or that.

"Hayoung-ie is still completely worn out and teacher-nims are helping her
out by performing 'Chu-gung-gwa-hyeol¹'."

"And Jihye?"

"At the back, fixing her battleship."

"What about Lee Hyunsung?"

One would ask, while the other would answer. They walked on the
corridors of the Ark and repeated this process. It was as if they wouldn't be
able to hold back even for a second by not doing it.

"What about the kids?"

"Well, they…"
Before Jung Heewon could finish her sentence, they heard the kids' voices
coming out from one of the cabins lining up the corridor.

– I knew it. I gotta sign the contract with the darkness right now so I can
getmy revenge for hyung…

– Revenge? What revenge? Ahjussi is definitely alive. I can feel it.

– …Well, uh, I also knew that. If it's Dokja hyung, he's definitely…!

– You need to wake up already. We need to come up with a sound plan
rightnow.

Jung Heewon's and Han Sooyoung's steps came to a halt at the same time
as if they had promised to do so. They listened to the kids' conversation.
Those two were bawling uncontrollably only the day before. However, the
two of them, as they appeared through the cabin's window, were… "…I
guess they will be fine, after all," said Jung Heewon.

Han Sooyoung waited for a beat before asking her. "What about you, then?"

The latter didn't reply. Instead, her gaze slowly faltered. The former
stopped looking at her conversation partner, and shifted her own gaze
lower, too.

Jung Heewon opened her lips eventually. "He asked me to save him."

"…"

"He pleaded with me to rescue him."

She tightly clenched her fist. They didn't need to stare at each other to feel
this emotion resonating between them.

It sounded as if dry rain was falling somewhere; Han Sooyoung listened to
that noise impassively, before speaking up. "We'll have a lot of things to do
when we get back."
"…Right. I know." Jung Heewon rubbed her face with her sleeves and
smiled weakly. "For the time being, we should go back to Seoul, right?"

"We should."

"There will definitely be some bastards aiming for Seoul now that Dokja-ssi
has disappeared. And we'll have to sort out the law and order back home,
too."

"Who'll tell Lee Sookyung, though?"

"That, well…"

The two women stopped talking and stared at the empty space for a while.
The first person to break the silence was Han Sooyoung. "I wish we still
had
Yoo Sangah with us in times like these."

"…I miss Sangah-ssi."

They had lost far too much getting here.

Their gazes shifted outside the window to see the passing view of the Dark
Dimension. They saw the stars on the faraway galaxies sparkle softly.

The universe wouldn't be destroyed just because a single star suddenly
vanished. There was a countless number of them, and their light would
continue to exist afterward, too.

But for those living on a certain planet, that particular star would be
everything they knew about the light itself.

Han Sooyoung did her best not to look at Jung Heewon's reflection on the
window. The latter muttered in the meantime. "Just what on earth has
happened to Dokja-ssi?"

The former didn't reply and began walking again. Not too long afterward,
they arrived at the last cabin in the corridor. They quietly opened the door
and entered to find Yoo Joonghyuk wrapped from head to toe in bandages
lying on a bed.

Han Sooyoung spoke as she rummaged through her inner pockets to find a
lemon candy. "…We should be able to find out once this idiot wakes up."




This happened back when I was still in the middle of reading the 'Ways of
Survival'.

I was scrolling down the chapter, fully satisfied knowing that I had
completed the day's work, only to discover something written on the
[Author's words] corner at the bottom.

– Dokja-nim, what do you think?

I've already forgotten what that question related to. It might have been
about the plot development, or he might be implying something about the
novel itself. Now, how did I answer him back then?

– Mm. Well, such a simple twist is a bit…

– You thought so, too?

I was startled anew by this portion of my memories. Did something like this
really happen? I remembered so well about the 'Ways of Survival' itself, so
why have I completely forgotten about this part of the memories? I couldn't
understand it at all.

Right, now that I looked back, the author did chat with me every once in a
while, didn't he?

As for me, I wrote comments to engage the author; most of the time, it was
to cheer him on, or to ask questions regarding the next regression turn, but
sometimes, I did try to tackle him over the novel, too.
I think it was around when Yoo Joonghyuk had just gone past the 600th
turn.

I just couldn't understand something about the novel no matter how hard I
thought about it, so I end up arguing with the author through the comment
section.

– Author-nim. Was that a typo? How can Joonghyuk-ie smile brightly?

'tls123' replied back.

– Anyone would change like that after regressing over 600 times.

I thought that the answer kind of made sense after hearing it. And that
must've been the first time that I began thinking earnestly about the number
of times Yoo Joonghyuk had regressed.

Regressing over 600 times, was it. What did life even mean to a being that
had to repeat such a life over and over again?

⸢Kim Dok ja, wa ke up.⸥

Dull pain pulsed inside my head and my consciousness returned gradually.
My body felt lethargic, and terrible pain buzzed from all corners of my
Incarnation flesh. I barely managed to tear my eyes open, and the faint rays
of light pierced into my eyes.

And then, a familiar voice came flying in my ear.

"Looks like he's finally woken up."

Yup, he just couldn't be nice about it, now could he.

I smirked a little and shifted my head in the direction of the voice.

However, something… seemed off.

"So, this fool is that Kim Dokja?"
By the time I fully opened my eyes, I discovered myself surrounded by
countless Yoo Joonghyuks.




I needed another ten minutes or so to regain my consciousness again.

I had blacked out once more, and after waking up, kept my eyes closed and
tried really hard to figure out what the heck was going on here. At least, I
needed to get a bead on the current situation.

Firstly, the 'Great War of Saints and Demons' was over.

I was certain of that; messages waiting in the log proved that fact, at least.

[You have acquired the Giant Story, 'Season of Light and Darkness'!]

[Your third Giant Story has completed its 'Twist/轉'!]

[Third condition for the hidden scenario – the 'One Single Story', has been
met!]

[Final Story is waiting for you.]

[The entirety of <Star Stream> is set abuzz over your achievement!]

[Majority of <Star Stream>'s Constellations are now paying attention to
your Nebula!]

[Regarding your Story, the absolute majority of the Constellations are…]

I had finally completed the 'One Single Story's Twist/轉. The energy
belonging to an unimaginably enormous Story was now roiling powerfully
inside me.

The Giant Story, the ⸢Season of Light and Darkness.⸥
It was my first time hearing about such a Giant Story. But that made sense
– the collision of the Nameless Mist and the Apocalypse Dragon didn't
occur in the original story, after all… With that as the starting point, the
entire world-line should begin experiencing sudden and violent change.

The march towards the apocalypse had sped up, so it was only obvious that
the rate of the entire scenario's progress would speed up as well.

Secondly, someone did rescue me.

My problem began from this point on. Just who did save me?

"It's no use pretending to be unconscious."

As an aside, the very last face I saw was that of Yoo Joonghyuk's, coming
to save me. So, maybe it was obvious that I'd end up seeing his face now.

But, uh, the problem was…

"Not just his dumb looks, but it seems that even his head is dumb."

"Just like what I've heard."

…Why were there so, so many 'Yoo Joonghyuks' in this place??

Not only that…

In complete stupefaction, I gazed at the five, six 'kkoma² Yoo Joonghyuks'
currently standing around on top of the bed. Without a doubt, they were
Yoo Joonghyuks, but all of them were… big-headed chibis with short limbs
and about the same size as Kyrgios.

…Am I still dreaming??

Right, this had to be a dream. Right, the stress he put me under every single
day had piled up and must've caused this horrifying delusion. That had to
be it. I hurriedly slapped my cheeks, prompting the kkoma Yoo Joonghyuks
to speak one after the other.
"He must think this is a dream. Like a fool."

"He may need some time to figure out his current situation first."

"What an annoying bastard. Do we need to wait for him, then?"

I cleanly ignored them and scanned the room I was in. It was a huge
circularshaped room; everything, including the table, the chairs, the other
smaller knick-knacks, and even the bed I was sitting on, was circular-
shaped.

…Where the hell was I?

I thought hard and long, but nothing came up. A room with such peculiar
furnishing would be more than memorable enough, but I couldn't remember
ever reading about it in the 'Ways of Survival'.

Wondering if I stumbled into an area for a new scenario accidentally, I
summoned the scenario window, only to be smacked in the head with the
following message.

[Currently, <Star Stream> is in the middle of scenario system
maintenance.]

Meaning, there was pretty much nothing I could learn in my current
situation.

"Looks like he's almost done with analysing his situation."

"I shall ask again. Are you the one called Kim Dokja?"

The kkoma Yoo Joonghyuk with a hot-tempered facial expression asked
me. Now that I took a closer look, there were different numbered cards
stuck to the chest of each kkoma Yoo Joonghyuk, and the one who asked
me just now had [999] written on his.

I decided to answer them for the time being. "Correct. I'm Kim Dokja."
The kkoma Yoo Joonghyuks looked at each other and nodded their heads
simultaneously. These little guys, even though they were much smaller
than the original, they acted exactly the same as Yoo Joonghyuk. "Looks
like the correct one has been brought over, then."

Even the voice was the same, too…

I didn't know what was going on here, but by this time, I had to accept it. I
was not stuck in a dream. And thanks to some unknown crazy whims of the
Probability, I somehow ended up in a strange, fantastical kingdom where
kkoma Yoo Joonghyuks lived.

"Who are you guys?"

I decided to ask them first. I knew that they wouldn't answer me
straightforward if they were anything like the original Yoo Joonghyuk, but
still. One of the kkomas began muttering out. "How pathetic. Can't you tell
by looking?"

Yup, thought as much. If I was to be stuck in a world like this, then I'd have
preferred to be surrounded by the kind, gentle kkoma version of Yoo
Sangah, instead. I was wondering how should I retort back in order to hear
a proper answer from these guys, but then, the 'Yoo Joonghyuk' with [888]
written on his card spoke some rather unexpected words. "With your dull
head, you'd never arrive at the correct answer no matter how long you
agonise over it. So, I shall tell you. We are a part of the 'great Plotter'."
…Great Plotter? Could it be?

A chilly sensation flitted in and out of my head just then.

The 'Yoo Joonghyuk' with [777] on his chest must've interpreted my silence
on his own way and spoke in a mocking tone. "Your pathetic intelligence
shouldn't be enough to understand it now."

Right, these guys, they were definitely Yoo Joonghyuk. There was
absolutely no doubt about that now.
"If you're fully awake, then get up. Someone is waiting for you."

"Who's waiting for me?"

"You'll see when you get there."

I got up unsteadily and followed after that kkoma. The round door opened
up and a huge corridor appeared before me. The one to take the lead was
the kkoma Yoo Joonghyuk number [999]. I followed him. The rest of the
kkomas trotted after us, too.

I asked one of them. "What is this place?"

That prompted one of the Yoo Joonghyuks following me to speak up. "Eun
gui ei soup."

"What was that?"

"It means, the N'Gai's Forest. You're supposed to be a prophet, yet you can't
even tell that?"

What the hell. Why did you say that in English, then?

The kkoma Yoo Joonghyuk number [666] glared at me as if he was
disappointed and turned his head away, obviously unhappy.

It was around then I began thinking that maybe, those numbers represented
the regression turns each Yoo Joonghyuk had lived through.

…What did Yoo Joonghyuk do around the 666th turn? Was that when he
partnered up with the Abyssal Black Flame Dragon?

I spotted the view of a silver forest outside the windows lining up the
corridor. N'Gai's Forest, was it? Sounded familiar, as if I had heard about it
somewhere. However, I wasn't sure whether this place ever appeared within
the 'Ways of Survival'…
It was then when our group encountered another one walking towards from
the other side of the corridor.

[So, is he the one the Plotter had brought along?]

No, could I even describe their movements as 'walking'?

Overcome with the sensation of all the hair on my body standing up, I
subconsciously gripped the hilt of my Unbroken Faith tighter.

Because 'Outer Gods' were walking towards us from the opposite side.

Existences that emitted auras incomparably more unstable and ominous
than any Constellations. One of them sported a horse's head, while others
were monstrous creatures covered in disgusting-looking tentacles. Those
tentacles extending up to the air seemed to tilt their 'heads' for a bit, before
shuffling closer to my direction. No matter who looked at that, they
wouldn't be able to describe their intentions as friendly at all.

Unexpectedly, the one to step in their paths was none other than the kkoma
Yoo Joonghyuk number [999].

"He's our guest. Don't even think about harassing him."

[But, it should not be a problem just to have a little chat?]

"I shan't permit it."

The kkoma Yoo Joonghyuk number [999] declared as thus, and unsheathed
the miniature version of [Splitting the Sky Sword] from his back.

Following that, the kkomas numbers [888], [777], and even the number
[666], they all unsheathed their weapons mounted on their backs and hips.

…These guys, could they even really fight? I mean, they all kind of looked
like action figures, so…
Maybe the other party thought the same as me, because they began emitting
stubbornly persistent hostile aura towards us.

[How dare you… Just because you're the dependents of the 'great
Plotter'…]

As the stand-off quickly became even more volatile and the tentacles and
the kkomas were about to start fighting, a loud 'Thud' resounded out from
somewhere. Outer Gods busy wiggling their tentacles about suddenly all
knelt down.

The only one among them still standing was the horse-head that showed
animosity towards me.

[■■■…!!]

Another 'Thud' resounded out. Finally, even the horse-head had to slam its
head on the floor. Those tremors couldn't have been a simple shockwaves
of an earthquake.

No, someone was intimidating these Outer Gods with incredible Status
right now.

[Wu, wuwu…]

Outer Gods groaned in pain and moved out of the way. At the end of the
corridor, there was an entrance leading to a huge hall. It was an open-type,
with the massive circular ceiling decorated by the tumbling, roiling
branches of trees. I walked into this hall accompanied by the kkoma Yoo
Joonghyuks.

Thin rays of sunlight permeating in between the branches illuminated an
ancient, worn-out throne right in the middle of that great hall.

No one needed to tell me, but I knew it right away. The being sitting on that
throne, he was the king of this forest.

Not only that, I knew who he was already, too.
The scar on his face, revealed under the faint rays of the sun, and the exact
same white coat as mine.

The being I thought I'd not get to meet again was sitting right on that
throne.

[It's been a while, Kim Dokja.]

           Chapter 417: Ep. 79 - The Secretive Plotter, II


I took my time studying the person before my eyes. My heart rate sped up
greatly, and my breathing became ragged, as well. Something touched a
box of memories that shouldn't be touched, and words began leaking out
from this box buried deep within the recess of the darkness.

⸢"Where is the Arondight? Are you the one hiding it?"⸥

That was the first time I encountered that dude. While firmly holding me by
my collars, he asked me that question.

⸢"If you're not planning to answer me, then I shall use force to find out."⸥

The golden [Sage's Eye] gleaming brightly just like back then was right
there, waiting.

A migraine assaulted me, and my view distorted like that of an abstract
painting. The voice from the memories continued on in the meantime.

⸢"That 'world' you've shown me, does it really exist?"⸥
…

…

…

⸢Applicable individual isn't a 'Character'.⸥

There existed certain memories that should never be forgotten even if one
wanted to, and perhaps the memories of that regression turn were precisely
'that' for me.

I failed to save Yoo Joonghyuk of that turn. He left for the next turn, still
wearing the white coat.

I had never forgotten the sight of his back, surrounded by bright light and
leaving me and Han Sooyoung of the 1863rd turn behind in complete
freedom.

"You are…"

For the longest time, I lost myself and stared at the 'Yoo Joonghyuk' sitting
on the throne. The scar on his sunken cheeks, those dark, deeply withdrawn
eyes – everything belonged to the 1863rd turn Yoo Joonghyuk that I
remembered.

However, my shock didn't end there.

[Constellation, 'Secretive Plotter', is looking at you.]

…The Secretive Plotter??

Only then did I finally discover the ominous, evil aura rising up from that
Yoo Joonghyuk's entire figure. This 'evil' was different from that of the
Demon Kings. No, this was Chaos that the <Star Stream> didn't recognise
as either 'Good' or 'Evil'.
I was about to say something, but then, something emitted bright light from
within my inner pocket.

[Exclusive Attribute, 'Scenario Interpreter', is activating!]

[Giant Story, 'Season of Light and Darkness', is reacting to your Attribute.]

As if it was waiting for this moment, the Story began telling its story. Two
Yoo Joonghyuks were in a certain place.

⸢[Go back. You can't save anyone.]⸥

⸢"…The Secretive Plotter?"⸥

As if they were stuck in fast-forward, scenes sped along in my mind. They
were fragmented information, sure, but still, they were also plenty enough
for me to figure out the current situation.

…So, that's what happened.

I began to gradually understand what was going on here.

Next up was the sight of Yoo Joonghyuk crashing, Lee Jihye catching him,
and finally, the Ark leaving the Isle. It seemed that the <Kim Dokja's
Company> had safely escaped from the 'Isle of Reincarnators'.

[Giant Story, 'Season of Light and Darkness', has stopped its storytelling.]

I sighed softly under the breath and shifted my gaze over to the existence
atop the throne. The 'Secretive Plotter' looked down at me from his spot at
the same time.

['The Fourth Wall' is strongly activating!]

My heart calmed down and my reasoning returned to me bit by bit. I sucked
in a couple of quick but deep breaths and opened my lips to speak. "If you
were planning to make me panic using that appearance, then well,
congratulations, you succeeded splendidly."
[Have you not used polite speech towards me earlier?]

"I'm merely treating you the way that fits with your choice to appear as Yoo
Joonghyuk."

I appeared completely unflustered by his aura, and as if he was amused by
it, the Plotter's lips twitched slightly. Not caring whether he did or not, I
simply continued on. "The 'Secretive Plotter'. I suggest we do the 'Three
Divine Questions and Answers'."

[And why would I agree to do that?]

"There's no way that you're the 1863rd turn Yoo Joonghyuk. It's impossible,
actually."

[What makes you think that?]

"You wish to know? As an aside, there are three reasons."

A faint flash of light flickered in the 'Secretive Plotter's eyes.

"So, are you interested or not?"

[Although tempting, it's not a fair trade, is it.]

The 'Secretive Plotter' stared at me with a pair of quiet, contemplative eyes.
He seemed to be thinking about something, and also, maybe a bit angry, as
well.

Just how long passed by like this? His left eyebrow quivered rather greatly.
I suddenly recalled a certain passage from the 'Ways of Survival' just then.

⸢Whenever Yoo Joonghyuk makes a serious decision, his left eyebrow
would quiver.⸥
The Secretive Plotter spoke. [I'll put forth a condition.]

"What kind?"
[I'm sure you're curious as to why I brought you here.]

I nodded my head. Of course I was curious.

[However, you can't ask me about that. Because I can't tell you. Some
answers can only be resolved by you actively searching for the right
question
first.]

"What kind of a Buddha-like utterance is that??"

[I shall agree to the 'Three Divine Questions and Answers' now. You can
ask me about three things, but you can't ask me a question related to 'why
you've been brought to here'.]

"Is that your condition?"

[One other thing. When you're done with the Three Questions, you must
figure out the 'reason you had to be brought' here.]

Now that was something I didn't expect at all and I momentarily panicked.
"What if I fail to do that?"

The 'Secretive Plotter' didn't reply. Instead, he raised his lengthy finger and
rested it on the armrest of his throne.

Just that simple action alone sent a chill down my spine.

⸢Can I defeat him in my current condition?⸥

I began inspecting all the Stories I possessed, from the legendary grade one
all the way to the Giant Stories…

"It'll be better for you to stop doing something foolish."

It was none other than the kkoma Yoo Joonghyuk number [999] standing
next to me who said that. I smirked and looked down at him. "Are you
worried about me?"
"It's annoying to remove a corpse, that's all."

"…What are you exactly, anyway?"

[Are you using your allotted questions, then? Good.]

"No, hang on a minu…"

Before I could finish my sentence, though, messages began floating up.

– Three Divine Questions and Answers has begun.

– Both sides can exchange three questions and three answers.

– Both sides can refuse to answer one question each.

– Questions and Answers will not end until both sides have asked a
questionand answered it properly.

– You are now using your right to ask the first question.

I caught the kkoma Yoo Joonghyuk number [666] grinning slyly on the
side. Sons of bitches.

Still, now that things had ended up like this, I figured it'd not be so bad to
hear their story now.

[They are my dependents.]

"I hope you aren't planning to end your answer like that. I'd prefer for you
to be a bit more in-depth now that you're planning to tell me things anyway.
I'd be eternally grateful if you so graciously explain yourself properly on
what your definition of dependents are, whether it's something like [Avatar]
or if it's something similar to the dependents Demon Kings have."

I spoke as cautiously as possible to make sure that what I said didn't sound
like the second question. That prompted the kkoma Yoo Joonghyuk number
[777] to sigh in admiration and speak up. "He sure talks a lot, doesn't he."
"I wasn't talking to you."

[They are beings that have received my memories.]

– You have acquired the first answer.

"So, it's similar to the [Avatar] skill, then."

[It's my turn. Tell me the first reason why I can't be the '1863rd turn Yoo
Joonghyuk'.]

"If you were really Yoo Joonghyuk from the 1863rd turn, then there's no
way you'd be wearing that white coat."

[…Why not?]

"The Stigma 'Regression' only sends back one's soul. It doesn't send back
the items in your possession. The coat I gave to the 1863rd turn's Yoo
Joonghyuk was destroyed as he regressed. So, if you're really from the
1863rd turn, you shouldn't be wearing that coat."

[Interesting. However, this is merely an item I personally purchased.]

"Yoo Joonghyuk doesn't wear the colour white often."

[…Ask your second question.]

– You are now using your right to ask the second question.

I didn't hesitate and spoke up. "My second question. Are you the '1863rd
turn Yoo Joonghyuk'?"

My question caused the Secretive Plotter's complexion to waver ever so
slightly. […Are you trying to mess with me?]

"No, I'm being dead serious."

[I am Yoo Joonghyuk who had experienced the 1863rd turn.]
"In the past tense, is it."

[I'm merely the 'Secretive Plotter' now, that's why.]

– You have acquired the second answer.


Unless one placed a special condition, one had to speak only the truth
during the 'Three Divine Questions and Answers'. If one didn't, then one
would be swept up in the storm of Probability's aftermaths immediately.

However, I didn't spot any signs of the storm around the 'Secretive Plotter'.

[Now, speak the second reason why I can't be the '1863rd turn's Yoo
Joonghyuk'.]

"There are just too many inconsistencies for you to be the Yoo Joonghyuk
from the 1863rd turn."

[What kind of inconsistencies?]

"If you're really him from the 1863rd, then why did you send me over there
to kill yourself? Logically speaking, it doesn't make sense, does it?"

[That's because that action would create me. It's a simple time paradox. I
was Yoo Joonghyuk from the 1863rd turn, and only by you killing me there
would I be reborn as the 'Secretive Plotter'.]

"Sounds like you've been rehearsing that answer for a while there. It sounds
so natural, too. Even if I assume that you're being truthful, quite
unfortunately for you, you seemed less than satisfied after I succeeded in
my mission. Also, you looked quite surprised, too."

[…Ask your next question.]

"No, you go ahead first. I'll ask mine last."
The 'Secretive Plotter' stared at me for a little while before eventually
opening his lips. [Fine. What is the final reason why I can't be 'Yoo
Joonghyuk from the 1863rd turn'?]

"I have a special method to find that out. I possess a skill that allows me to
read the inner thoughts of the other party."

[So?]

"But then, the 1863rd turn's Yoo Joonghyuk became an existence that I
can't read anymore."

I clearly remembered the moment that Yoo Joonghyuk left for the next turn.
The moment when he broke free from being a 'Character', and even my
exclusive skill, 'Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint' could no longer read him.

[Does that mean you can read my private thoughts?]

"No, I can't read yours also."

[Then, what?]

"However, the reason why I can't is different."

[Activation of the skill 'Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint' has been
cancelled!]

[Your degree of understanding on the applicable individual is simply far too
inadequate!]

[Your degree of understanding simply can't catch up to the Status of the
applicable individual!]

I quietly looked up at the messages floating up in the air.

The 'Secretive Plotter' frowned deeply. [I can't accept that as your reason.
You are…]
"I'll ask my last question," said I, not giving him any chance to speak.
"Back in the planet where I used to live, there happened to be a novel called
'Three Ways to Survive a Ruined World'."

Almost instantly, the surrounding atmosphere changed. The expression on
the Secretive Plotter's face sunk to its coldest yet. His eyes had become
coldblooded, as if he'd murder me at any given second.

I desperately resisted that aura and continued on. This was one question that
I wanted to ask all along. "'Secretive Plotter'. Are you someone who knows
the epilogue of that novel?"




Yoo Joonghyuk had a dream.

It was a really old and worn-out dream.

For some reason, he was wearing a white coat inside it.

He held the [Splitting the Sky Sword] that fit him like a glove. While
gripping that weighty weapon, he was fighting against someone. When he
took a closer look, he realized that the person in front of his eyes possessed
the exact same countenance as he did.

It was another Yoo Joonghyuk, but wearing a black coat, instead.

He wasn't sure of why he had to experience such a dream.

'The 1863rd turn'.

Maybe, it was because he ended up running into that guy. That was
probably why he had to dream about something like this.

Yoo Joonghyuk gritted his teeth. The gap he felt between his and the
'Secretive Plotter's overwhelming Status the moment they clashed remained
so vividly etched in his mind even now.
Utterly disregarding his sentiments, though, the memories continued to
slowly seep into him. He had become the Yoo Joonghyuk from the 1863rd
turn and was swinging his sword around.

⸢I'll die.⸥

⸢I'll regress.⸥

Every time the swords collided, Yoo Joonghyuk felt the despair and
loneliness of the 1863rd turn. Strangely enough, everything felt so natural
to him.

As if those emotions were his all along, since from a long time ago.

Stab!

Finally, the two swords stabbed deeply into the two stomachs.

⸢This story will come to an end here.⸥

⸢Even then, everything will start from the beginning once more.⸥

Yoo Joonghyuk wearing the black coat scattered away first, and soon, even
himself began scattering as well. The memories dissipated, and the
emotions he barely managed to comprehend began abandoning him. He
summoned up the last of his remaining energy and looked behind.

His vision blurred and he couldn't see clearly what was there.

However, it felt as if he had seen a bright and pure star.

⸢"I had grown curious of that world's ■■."⸥

⸢"For the next regression…"⸥

Yoo Joonghyuk's eyes shot open along with the loud noise of 'Beeeeep!'
He panted heavily and spotted the white ceiling of the hospital room. And
then, also heard someone's voice, too.

"Finally, our slumbering prince of the forest has woken up."

He turned his head to the side to find Han Sooyoung and Jung Heewon. The
former bit and broke the lollipop before spitting out the stick and began
growling at him. "Time to tell us just what happened back there, Dear Good
Regressor, sir."
          Chapter 418: Ep. 79 - The Secretive Plotter, III


Han Sooyoung's demanding tone prompted Yoo Joonghyuk to start with his
story. However, his tale sounded incoherent and he repeated himself over
and over again. Ten minutes passed by like that – she eventually stopped
listening quietly and spoke up.

"Okay, that's enough. I think you're not in the right frame of mind here, so
let me organise everything you said for you. You just indicate to me if I got
it right."

Now normally, such a one-sided declaration would've elicited a strong
reaction from him, but Yoo Joonghyuk simply chose to nod his head, his
expression dark, gloomy.

Han Sooyoung immediately began her job. "You went to rescue Kim
Dokja. But then, someone else showed up first to snatch him up. And that
someone was whom we all know, the 'Secretive Plotter'." Yoo Joonghyuk
nodded again.
"However, that guy had the exact same face as you and was wearing a
white coat."

"Correct."

"What are the odds of that being a fake? I mean, that guy's so hard to
believe, right? It's possible that the 'Secretive Plotter' disguised himself to
look like you."

"No, it couldn't have been a fake."

"How come?"

"He used the Story that the me from the 1863rd regression turn possessed."

"…You mean, that Immortal whatever chuuni-sounding Story?"

Han Sooyoung went "Thought as much," and nodded her head. Her irises
expanded ever so slightly as her Story kicked into gear once more.

[Story, 'Predictive Plagiarism', has begun its storytelling!]

The only one left out of the loop, Jung Heewon, tried to say something, her
voice sounding confused. "What are you two talking about? Are you saying
that the 'Secretive Plotter' looks like Joonghyuk-ssi?"

Han Sooyoung glanced at her for a bit, before replying with a long sigh.
"Simply put, there are two Yoo Joonghyuks in this world-line."

"…Is that even possible?"

"No reason why it can't be, if Yoo Joonghyuk from another world-line has
crossed over to this one."

"You can do that?"

"Well, Kim Dokja went to another world-line through a similar method,
didn't he? Now, the problem here is, just how powerful a being is he, when
he's capable of doing something like this…?"
Even the highest-ranked Constellations from either <Eden> or <Papyrus>
couldn't cross to another world-line with their own powers. However, this
'Secretive Plotter' was powerful enough to deal with the requisite
Probability all by himself.

Jung Heewon's jaw dropped slightly as she muttered. "Just from which
world-line could he…"

"There is only one with the highest possibility, actually. The one Kim
Dokja went to, the 1863rd world-line."

The 1863rd regression turn. The final world-line for Yoo Joonghyuk as it
was written in the 'Three Ways to Survive a Ruined World'.

Yoo Joonghyuk looked at Han Sooyoung and asked a question. "How much
do you know about that world-line?"

"A bit."

"At the end of that world, the me of the 1863rd turn divided into two and
fought against each other. One of them died, and the other regressed."

"I know. I saw it in my dreams several times already."

"…Your dream?"

As if she was sick and tired of the whole thing, she vigorously waved her
hands about. "We don't have the time to get into the details. In any case,
you think the current 'Secretive Plotter' is you from the 1863rd regression
turn. Am I right?"

Yoo Joonghyuk spoke up, his face full of dissatisfaction. "It's not a definite
thing. There are a few points that don't add up."

"Such as?"

"The strength of the 'Secretive Plotter' far exceeded that of 'me from the
1863rd turn' that I read about."
"And then?"

"Then…" Yoo Joonghyuk chewed on his lips for a while. "…I also got the
feeling that he was hiding something from me. Such as, his white coat."

"The white coat?"

"My Stigma, 'Regression', doesn't send the items I possess alongside me
when I regress. Meaning, there's no reason for him to be wearing that coat."

"Maybe, he likes the white colour?"

"I detest the colour white."

"Isn't it possible that your taste might change?"

"This matter can't be answered as easily as that. This…"

"Are you saying that it's an issue with your gut feeling?"

Yoo Joonghyuk nodded his head. "It was as if that bastard was mocking
me."

"Mocking you?"

"It was as if he deliberately wore that coat."

He massaged his forehead and the words left behind by the 'Secretive
Plotter' flitted in and out of his mind.

[…The 3rd turn. You don't remember anyth…]

A weighty silence descended in the room.

Han Sooyoung was deeply immersed in her thoughts as she rubbed her
chin, while Jung Heewon could only smack her lips, not fully getting what
was going on.
A while later, the former opened her lips to speak. "Alright, fine. Let's sum
it all up. Logically speaking, the 'Secretive Plotter' must be the 'Yoo

Joonghyuk from the 1863rd turn', but your gut feeling says otherwise.
That's it, right?"

"…"

"In that case, let's begin with this assumption first. 'The Yoo Joonghyuk
from the 1863rd turn is not the Secretive Plotter'. Meaning, the Plotter is
lying to you."

Yoo Joonghyuk's eyes trembled. "…It's just my feeling, yet you are willing
to believe it?"

"It's not just anyone's gut but yours. Isn't it supposed to be, you know
yourself the best?"

Han Sooyoung grinned refreshingly. He then addressed her with a
suspicionfilled expression. "Speak your hypothesis, Han Sooyoung."

"Mm? What do you mean?"

"You already suspect who the 'Secretive Plotter' might be. Am I wrong?"

This time, it was Han Sooyoung's eyes to narrow to a slit. "Hmm, since
when did you become this quick on the uptake?"

"…It's impossible for you to believe what I say, that's why."

For a short moment there, their glares collided in mid-air. And through that
exchange, both of them came to realize just what kind of images were
floating up in the heads of the other.

Not too long ago, they had discussed the possible identity of the 'Secretive
Plotter'. Back then, Yoo Joonghyuk opined that the Plotter was 'Kim Dokja
from the future', while Han Sooyoung, she…
"Argh, just how long are you two going to talk among yourselves?! Just
who is this 'Secretive Plotter'??"

Jung Heewon's pressing words prompted Han Sooyoung to cautiously open
her lips. "What I'm about to say is just a hypothesis, nothing more."

"I don't care whether it's a hypothesis or not. I just want to know!"

"I have been curious about something for a really long time, you know?"

"Curious about what?"

"What if, the novel 'Ways of Survival' didn't become reality?"

"…What are you talking about out of the blue?"

"So, like, what if, somewhere out there in the universe, there is a world of
'Ways of Survival', as pure as intended and not been affected by either me
or Kim Dokja?" Han Sooyoung continued on with her explanation. "In that
world where neither <Han Sooyoung Corporation> nor <Kim Dokja's
Company> exist, let's say there is this dumbass 'Yoo Joonghyuk' who
repeatedly goes through countless regressions while losing his companions
over and over again."

"…Wait, you bastard…"

"What if that Yoo Joonghyuk managed to reach the Conclusion (結)
through innumerable losses… What if a version of Yoo Joonghyuk that saw
the end of <Star Stream> through his own powers alone existed somewhere
in the universe?"

Han Sooyoung waited for a beat before shifting her gaze over to Yoo
Joonghyuk.

In his violently-rocking eyes, her reflection could be seen.

"And what would a guy like that be thinking about when he's looking at the
current '3rd turn'?"
The 'Secretive Plotter'.

The Constellation that didn't appear within the original 'Ways of Survival'.
Even then, a being that possessed more power than any other Constellations
I've met so far.

– 'Secretive Plotter'. Are you someone who knows the epilogue of
thatnovel?

That was the reason why I decided to ask this question. I was sure of
guessing the Plotter's true identity correctly as long as he provided me with
the 'right' answer.

Eventually, the Secretive Plotter opened his lips. [I am refusing to answer
that question.]

"What? No, hang on…"

– Constellation, 'Secretive Plotter', has used the 'right to refuse' on the
thirdquestion.

God damn it, I forgot about that. Both sides could exercise the 'right to
refuse' once during this 'Three Divine Questions and Answers'.

The Plotter was looking down at me with a pair of eyes that couldn't be
read. For a brief moment there, I witnessed the Probability's sparks envelop
his coat.

[I feel tired. Enough. Now, go back.]

"Hang on! The Q&A isn't ove…"

Before I could finish, I was overcome with the sensation of space folding
around me, and soon, found myself standing outside the hall.
The sense of dejection rushed in as I stared at the firmly-shut door to the
hall.

– 'Three Divine Questions and Answers' has been temporarily suspended.

– You still have one more right to ask a question remaining.

Normally, the 'Three Divine Questions and Answers' wasn't a ceremony
that one side could wilfully delay like this. However, this 'Secretive Plotter'
managed to do exactly that. I couldn't even estimate how powerful a Status
he must've possessed in order to make something this unbelievable happen.

I pounded on the hall's door and shouted out. "Open the door! This is not
what we agreed upon! I need to get back to my companions!"

In that instant, a powerful Status rocked the door and my Incarnation Body
was flung away. I staggered back up to my feet and got ready to unleash my
own Status.

Unexpectedly, it was the kkoma Yoo Joonghyuk number [999] who
dissuaded me from doing that. "It'll be better if you don't."

I sensed the ominous flow of air beyond the doorway and urgently
withdrew my Status. Indeed, this kkoma Yoo Joonghyuk was right. My
Incarnation Body was still gravely injured, and the other party was a being
so strong that the current me couldn't even guess his actual power level.

"You'll have another chance, Kim Dokja."

"…And when will that be?"

Kkoma Yoo Joonghyuks began looking at me with eyes reserved for when
looking at a dumb fool, before one of them spoke up. "Follow us. We're
going back to your lodging."

I felt hopelessly lost by the prospect of returning to that circular room
again, but as I was now, I didn't have much of a choice.
I could sense the multiple presences of 'Outer Gods' looking at this way
from all corners of the corridor. Thankfully, I was a guest of the 'Secretive
Plotter'.

It was all too clear to see what would happen if I try to escape and become
an 'uninvited guest' in the process.

Go-ooooh…

…Yup, not making a rash decision would be for the best, after all.

Also, it wasn't as if I walked away with nothing from the current situation,
anyway.

['The Fourth Wall' is faintly vibrating.]

⸢(There are quite a few faces I haven't seen in awhile. Looks like a group of
Shantaks.)⸥
I was startled by the sudden voice coming from my inside. It was coming
through the [The Fourth Wall]'s messaging system.

Judging from the way it spoke…

'…The Devourer of Dreamss?'

⸢(It is indeed I.)⸥

Now that I thought about it, I had an 'Outer God' residing inside me, didn't
I? I completely forgot about it somehow. I began thinking that maybe I
could ask for his help in my current predicament.

⸢(Looks like they are being friendly towards you.)⸥

'Being friendly? You mean, that?!'
I stared at the 'Outer Gods' raising their tentacles up threateningly in my
direction. The moment our gazes met, the end of one of the tentacles
suddenly bloomed open to resemble a horrifying-looking flower.

⸢(They are curious about you. Now that is a rather uncommon event among
Outer Gods.)⸥
I looked at that 'flower' bud swaying this way and that as if to win me over
and shook my head in helplessness.

'…It'll be hard to become friends with those guys'.

⸢(Hard? Why?)⸥

'You must know why by now after reading this and that in the Library'.

I walked past the Outer Gods emitting gloomy, foreboding aura and began
recalling the final episode of the 'Ways of Survival'.

⸢(The final battle of the <Star Stream> is related to those 'Outer Gods'.)⸥

In the original story, Yoo Joonghyuk lost everything still remaining with
him by that point. Every single Incarnation that helped him up until then all
died in that war. Died, because of those monsters of Chaos that brought the
destruction of the world.

But then, the 'Devourer of Dreamss' said something rather unexpected to
me.
⸢(Do you know why Outer Gods have become the Calamities?)⸥

'That is…'

I seriously pondered it for a moment, only to fall into this strange,
inexplicable chain of thoughts.
Indeed, it sure was a strange thing; even a novel as brimming-full of
detailed explanations as the 'Ways of Survival' failed to mention the origins
of the Outer Gods.

It was at that moment a certain theory popped up in my head.

The true identity of the 'Secretive Plotter' and the origins of the 'Outer
Gods'. Could there be some kind of a connection between the two?

Before I could throw out a question regarding that theory, someone engaged
me for a chat first.

"I heard that you like reading novels."

It was the kkoma Yoo Joonghyuk number [999].

I nodded my head. "Sure, I do. What about it?"

"If you want, I can tell you a short story."

"A story?"

It was then the kkoma Yoo Joonghyuks number [666], [777], and [888] all
looked at [999] with baffled expressions. It seemed that this wasn't a part of
the plan.

Not even waiting for my reply, the kkoma Yoo Joonghyuk number [999]
began telling his story. "There was a wolf that continued to fight a lonely
battle for a very long time. He had a goal he was chasing after, and there
was a question he wanted to ask. For the answer to that question, he
continued to fight."

"Is it an allegory?"

"The wolf kept fighting. Hundreds of years, thousands, and maybe even for
tens of thousands of years."
I wanted to say that a wolf couldn't possibly live for that long, but
regardless, the story continued on.

"The wolf eventually reached the end of the battle and became the 'wolf
king'. And he managed to find the answer in his own way. He had to pay
the price of losing his entire pack in the process, but in the end, he came to
accept that answer. Because it was the best possible answer that the world
could provide him with. Now with that answer, the king began roaming the
world."

This was a rather vaguely abstract story, yet…

"But then, one day, the king learned that there was yet another 'pack'
existing somewhere."

…Even then, this story sounded undoubtedly familiar, too.

"In that pack, he found the exact same wolf as himself. That wolf possessed
the exact same goal as him, and was surviving for the same purpose as him,
as well."

I listened to the tale as if I had been entranced by it.

"But then, something was different. The 'wolf' of this pack hadn't lost
anything."

Right now, this guy was telling me the story that the 'Secretive Plotter'
didn't want to tell me earlier.

"Finding his prey, protecting his pack, the distant goals he longed for – this
wolf was achieving all those with the minimal amount of pain. Without
losing anything in the process. The king watched this spectacle, and
suddenly thought to himself."

Slowly, so very slowly, a chill crept down on my back.

"If this story is brought to its conclusion as it was, then what was the
purpose of the life I've lived so far?"
Yoo Joonghyuk was now asking straight at me.

"Kim Dokja. Have you ever thought about a life like that before?"
          Chapter 419: Ep. 79 - The Secretive Plotter, IV


All sorts of complicated thoughts rushed past my head.

"I…"

It felt as if someone was ringing a gong right next to my ear. I covered my
mouth from the sudden rush of the sick feeling from my stomach. The
kkoma Yoo Joonghyuks kept looking up at me as I began wobbling about
unsteadily.

⸢Kim Dokja knew who these beings were.⸥

The final revision of the 'Ways of Survival' spat out bright texts from inside
my pocket.

⸢He knew, but at the same time, he didn't want to know.⸥

"Kim Dokja?"
The kkoma Yoo Joonghyuks realized that something was wrong with me
and called out.

I needed to stop thinking.

['The Fourth Wall' is

shaking.] Stop thinking.

['The Fourth Wall' is shaking intensely.]

However, I couldn't.

Pages were flipping over inside my head. As if there was a storm raging
about in there, all those pages swirled up and flew at the same time to
completely blanket my consciousness.

"…Hey, you?"

And eventually, my vision was dyed in pitch-black darkness.




"Looks like he's learned of it now."

The kkoma Yoo Joonghyuk number [41] spoke as if it was in passing. Next
to him was the 'Secretive Plotter', sitting on the ancient, worn-down throne.

"By any chance, did you deliberately give out that hint?"

[That wasn't my intention.]

"I don't see any reward for you after you even prepared props to put up a
show like this."
The kkoma Yoo Joonghyuk number [41] spoke as he stared at the Plotter's
white coat. It was the same coat as the one Yoo Joonghyuk from the 1863rd
turn wore.

The Plotter felt that stare. While taking the coat off, he spoke up. [I wasn't
putting on a show. That guy from the 1863rd should've been a part of me
originally. Just like all of you.]

"However, he opened the door and left without warning, didn't he. While
leaving behind that coat, too."

The kkoma Yoo Joonghyuk number [41] took over the white coat. As if the
two had been talking about something forbidden up until now, a short
silence descended between them.

The 'Secretive Plotter' wordlessly extended his hand towards the empty air.
A circular table suddenly materialised next to the old throne. There was a
wine glass filled with red wine on top of it. He lightly picked the glass up.

[It seems that the scenario is progressing far quicker than expected.
Its ripening degree is nothing to write home about.] "It's all because
of that fool, Kim Dokja."

[Has the Dokkaebi King made his move yet?]

The kkoma Yoo Joonghyuk number [41] flipped through the message log in
the empty air. "No, not yet. However, Great Dokkaebis are now moving
behind the scenes. The Wennys have contacted us, as well."

[It'll soon start, then.]

"I guess so."

Two Yoo Joonghyuks stopped talking for a little while. Ominous howls
could be heard coming through the cracked walls of this palace built to
resemble a circle. Those were the cries of the Outer World's hounds
searching for them.
The 'Secretive Plotter' opened his lips. [41st. You are the most similar 'Yoo
Joonghyuk' when compared to me.]

"What an honour that is."

[You'll soon die.]

"Have we not come this far for that exact purpose?"

They stopped talking again. Pale-white light suddenly glowed in the empty
air, and soon, <Star Stream>'s broadcast screen appeared there. The
'Secretive Plotter' flipped through the screens as if he was bored and spoke
up.

[There isn't much left till the end of this long story, then.]




When I opened my eyes, I found myself inside the Library.

⸢Kim Dok ja, so an noy ing.⸥

I heard the Wall's faint voice and shook my head to regain my wits.

'Sorry about that'.

The lights from the lanterns brightened up the dim darkness. It seemed that
I was sucked into [the Fourth Wall]'s interior once more. The Wall had
protected my mind from breaking down, in other words.

I massaged my pulsing head and took quick, short breaths. I needed a bit
more time before my mind cleared up sufficiently enough. How long did it
pass by like that?

Eventually, only one line remained etched inside my once-chaotic mind.
⸢The 'Secretive Plotter' is Yoo Joonghyuk from the original 'Ways of
Survival'.⸥
He was not the Yoo Joonghyuk I met in the 1863rd turn, nor the guy I
experienced the 3rd turn with.

No, he was someone I had never met before.

Indeed, he was Yoo Joonghyuk who witnessed the conclusion of the <Star
Stream> before the '3rd turn' even had the chance to begin.

– Hang on, author-nim! What will happen to Joonghyuk-ie now? When it's
like this…

I recalled the last comment I made on the final chapter of the 'Ways of
Survival'. That novel came to an end and left everything up to the epilogue.
The answer to the question I was dying to know…

I slowly got up from the spot and took a look at the bookshelves around me.

[Yoo Joonghyuk, records from the 4th turn, eighth volume]

I stood there dazed after looking at the book's spine, revealed under the
gentle light.

The stories that I grew up reading were here.

I slowly reached out towards that book's spine. My fingertip touching the
end of the spine trembled faintly. This was the story that I read over and
over again. Each of those phrases was my life, my blood, and my flesh. But
now, why did such a story feel so… …Alien to me now?

I forced myself to grab that book, hoping to get rid of this feeling. This was
a story that I could enjoy reading regardless of what time it was and which
page it was, anyway.

This story wouldn't betray me. If I read it, I should feel better. Just like how
it always did.
Rather coincidentally, the page I flipped to was the scene of Anna Croft and
Yoo Joonghyuk in a face-off.

The novel's Yoo Joonghyuk spoke his line.

⸢"This is because of you."⸥

My hands trembled as I flipped the page. I couldn't work up the courage to
read what was on the next page. Maybe, I didn't have the qualification to do
so, too.

I was happy reading this story?

My entire life amounted to nothing but me reading about someone else's
sorrow and pain? In that case, how was I any different from those damn
Constellations up in the sky?

⸢(What will you do?)⸥

I looked behind to find Nirvana there.

⸢(There are two 'Yoo Joonghyuks' in this world.)⸥

The librarians had gathered around me. Three pairs of eyes were now
looking at me, pitying me. Nirvana, Simulation, and then, the Devourer of
Dreamss.

I met each of their gazes and asked. '…What do you guys think?'

⸢(Do you wish to acquire the opinion of this one?)⸥ Nirvana stepped forward
to reply. He sounded confident as if he knew the right answer already. ⸢(No
need to fall into a dilemma. Every creature started as one in the beginning,
after all.)⸥

"You're going on about that 'one' again?"
⸢Everything was one, to begin with, so what does it matter if there are two
or more Yoo Joonghyuks? Becoming one with all the Yoo Joonghyuks is
the utmost important providence of the cosmos…!⸥

Yup, it was my fault to ask this idiot in the first place.

I shifted my gaze and discovered that the master of the theatre dungeon,
Simulation, looking back at me.

⸢(It seems that you're suffering under the weight of the guilty conscience.)⸥

Guilty conscience – was it alright to bluntly label what I feel into that sort
of emotion? My hand holding the book trembled, causing the pages
themselves to tremble as well.

⸢(Why do you feel guilt? Are you tormented by the misfortune he had
suffered?)⸥

"I'm not too sure."

⸢(Regardless of what, you can't save him. He has already lived a life like
that, and you simply read about his story. That is the summary of your
reality.)⸥

His voice, tinged with a certain logical sense, contained the wisdom of an
ancient being who had read many stories for the longest time.

The last one to speak was the 'Devourer of Dreamss'. It pushed up its
glasses with its tentacles and spoke as if to mock me. ⸢(Oh, dear
Constellation. Do you honestly believe that the great Plotter is asking for
your sympathy?)⸥

The moment I heard those words, my emotions cooled down as if they were
bathed in icy-cold water.

It was correct. This emotion I've been feeling was the same thing as me
insulting every story I had read.
Besides, now wasn't the time to swim in these trivial emotional mires.
Nirvana glibly continued on. ⸢(Looks like you've finally regained some of
your lost senses.)⸥

Right now, I need to worry about much more realistic problems first.

'I need to return to my companions, but I don't have any methods of getting
out of here'.

The 'Devourer of Dreamss' nodded its head. ⸢(I'm sure that's the case.
Within the N'Gai's Forest, he's basically the god, after all.)⸥

'Do you know something, by any chance?'

⸢(I do know, but there's not much meaning even if I explain. Because you'd
get only further away from their origins the more you try to explain
anything related to the 'Outer Gods'. Just like what the 'Recorders of Fear'
have done.⸥ 'Recorders of Fear'… I seemed to have heard a similar story
once before.

Meanwhile, the 'Devourer of Dreamss' continued on. ⸢(The entrance and the
exit lay in the same place. In most cases, a door with 'Pull me' written on it
would open when you push at it. You must figure out why you're here.
When you do, you will naturally discover the exit yourself.)⸥

I heard what the 'Secretive Plotter' said earlier after hearing those words.

– When you're done with the Three Questions, you must figure out the
'reason you had to be brought' here.

The reason why I had to come here.

When I thought about it, maybe the 'Three Divine Questions and Answers'
being suspended was a fortunate thing for myself.

I might have been able to guess the identity of the 'Secretive Plotter', but I
hadn't been able to figure out the reason why he brought me to this place.
That guy, why did he bring me here?

⸢(He's a being who witnessed the end of one world.)⸥ The 'Devourer of
Dreamss' spoke as if it already knew what my question was. ⸢(What can
compel a being who already knows of ■■ to throw himself back into the
great cycle once more…?)⸥

In that moment, I recalled a certain moment in my life. It was a piece of my
memory from a very long time ago. I was a young boy, sitting opposite my
mother and reading a book resting on my lap.

– Dokja-yah, please read it again.

What would be the reason for an existence that knew the story inside out to
read it again?

⸢Yo u go ou t now Kim Dok ja.⸥

In the following moments, my view broke up and I was swept up in a
whirlpool. The sight of the Library scattered away like smoke. Everything
spun around until my consciousness returned to where it belonged. Still
suffering from the slight case of migraine and dizziness, I slowly opened
my eyes along with a soft groan.

[Current Incarnation Body recovery rate: 34%]

Drips of Story fell one at a time from the IV pack filled with Stories,
currently attached to my arm. And there was information on my Incarnation
Body floating up on the display in the air.

[Currently, the injection of healing medicine cannot be administered due to
the extensive damage to your foundational Story.]

[Natural recovery is recommended.]

[You currently possess high resistance against elixirs.]
[You can consume a new type of elixir to boost the rate of recovery.]

I struggled to push myself up. Every corner of my body still ached like
crazy, but still, movements in my joints felt a lot smoother than before.

"Biyoo."

As expected, Biyoo didn't reply. However, I was greeted by another
message, instead.

[You're currently connected to a temporary channel.]

A temporary channel – meaning, this place was not an official scenario
location of the <Star Stream>.

"Total numbers of connections."

[Number of Constellations currently connected to the temporary channel: 2]

It was saying '2', which was as clear as you could get, as much as the
number of clicks the 'Ways of Survival' got.

I began thinking. If I wanted to escape from this place, there was little
choice but to have another face-to-face with the 'Secretive Plotter'.

But, I wasn't sure if he'd meet me again that easily.

In that case, there was only one other method left.

[Constellation, 'Demon King of Salvation', is calling the Constellation,
'Secretive Plotter'.]

If the bastard didn't want to meet me, then…

[Constellation, 'Demon King of Salvation', is looking at the Constellation,
'Secretive Plotter'.]

Then, until he looked at me again.
[Constellation, 'Demon King of Salvation', is throwing a temper tantrum
in the Constellation, 'Secretive Plotter's' direction.] Yup, I just needed to
annoy him.

[Constellation, 'Demon King of Salvation', is…]

[Constellation, 'Secretive Plotter', is glaring at you.]

As expected, a response came. Just before I could send back another
message, though, the door to my room flung open with some force.

"You insane fool. Why are you making a ruckus like this?"

"Oh, so you came."

The kkoma Yoo Joonghyuk number [666] was glaring at me. "If you want
something, you can simply call for me. So, stop with the barrage of noisy
indirect messages."

Since these kkoma Yoo Joonghyuks were all dependents of the 'Secretive
Plotter', they must've been able to hear my indirect messages, too.

In any case, that [666] seemed to be tasked with caring for my well-being.
What surprised me there, though, was that he held what looked to be some
kind of a smartphone-like device. Unfitting for a mini kkoma, the phone
itself was the regular 'big' size.

"Why are you looking at that thing? Were you playing a mobile game?"

I got up from the bed and quickly snatched the phone away from the
unguarded hands of this idiot.

Yoo Joonghyuk's original profession was the 'Pro Gamer', so it wouldn't be
all that strange for him to play a game of some ki…

…Eh?

"Give it back to me this instant!!"
[666] leaped up and smacked me in the waist while roaring out in anger. I
simply stared at the display in pure stupefaction, though.

…Hey, this isn't a game, now is it??

[You're currently connected to two channels.]

[You're currently in the area outside the scenario's control. You are now
connected to the official channel via a proxy channel.]

The smartphone's screen was displaying a rather familiar background.

⸢"Dokja ahjussi is alright. He's definitely alive. I can tell."⸥

Just below the [LIVE] icon, indirect messages from Constellations I was
familiar with were cascading down as if it was some kind of a chatroom.

[Constellation, 'Bald General of Justice', is nodding his head energetically.]

[Constellation, 'Maritime War God', is consoling the members of <Kim
Dokja's Company>.]

[Constellation, 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon', is…]

What shocked me even more could be found at the bottom of the chatroom
display.

[Constellation name: Secretive Plotter]

[You're currently a VIP subscriber.]

[Due to one of the VIP membership perks, you are exempt from the cost of
indirect messaging.]

– Please select the expression you wish to convey.

[Currently, you have selected (Stay Strong).]

– Please enter the amount of coins to be sponsored. (You can sponsor from
50 Coins upwards in the applicable channel.)

[(No amount has been entered) C]

– Please enter the message you with to convey through indirect messaging.
[Forgetaboutfoolslikehimandchooseanewleader (You have exceeded the
word length input limit.)]

I stopped reading there and looked down at the kkoma Yoo Joonghyuk
number [666] in sheer dumbfoundedness. "Hey, I'm asking you just in
case…"

"…"

"By any chance, the one who sent all those indirect messages was…"

"It's merely my turn today! Give up the device immediately or I'll kill you,
Kim Dokja!!"

The deeply-blushing kkoma Yoo Joonghyuk number [666] held the
[Splitting the Sky Sword] tightly and panted angrily. Only then did I finally
figure out something that I failed to understand until now.

So, I had these kkoma idiots to thank for all those countless indirect
messages the 'Secretive Plotter' allegedly sent my way.

⸢"When he comes back this time, let's just throw him inside a coffin and
bury him somewhere. It'll be better to let him out only after the scenarios
are over."⸥

Lee Jihye said something hair-raisingly scary just then. I watched the kids
sitting together on the screen and my heart began aching as if I had been
sneak attacked just now.

It hadn't been that long since we parted ways, yet I missed them already.

Whatever the cost, I had to return to them.
Because the 'Apocalypse Dragon' scenario was already over, so if I
didn't hurry back to where they were, then… Tsu-chuchuchut!

That was when the Probability's sparks went on a wild dance; one by one,
Dokkaebis began appearing in the skies of Seoul. I spotted Bihyung among
them as well.

⸢[New main scenario has arrived!]⸥

God damn it… So soon? Bihyung inside the screen began speaking up.

⸢[<Kim Dokja's Company>.

It's now time to leave for the Final Scenario.]⸥
           Chapter 420: Ep. 79 - The Secretive Plotter, V


"…Final Scenario?"

Jung Heewon frowned deeply while staring at the blinking message in the
air.

The 'Final Scenario' was already starting?

The Apocalypse Dragon scenario was supposed to be 89th. So, did this
mean that the 90th scenario was the last?

It wasn't just her who was confused by this, though. Every Constellation
still riding on the Ark exchanged glances and began murmuring among
themselves.

[…What does that even mean?]

[Wait, did the 99th scenario start already?]
Some of them even began lodging complaints to Dokkaebi Bihyung, too.
[What kind of an underhanded scheme is this? It's not the time for the Final
Scenario to start…]

[Are you planning to take <Kim Dokja's Company> away separately?]

Bihyung studied the reactions of these Constellations before shaking his
head. [The invitations to the Final Scenario are being issued since from a
while ago. More correctly, ever since all of you decided to wake the
'Apocalypse Dragon', that is.]

His declaration caused the Constellations to become noisy among
themselves. A few of them seemed to have realized something, and while
looking around the vicinity in worried eyes, began shouting out loudly.

[I-in that case, send us to the Final Scenario, too!]

[T-that's right! We also possess the qualifications!]

Bihyung spoke as if to pacify them. [I'm sorry, but I'm not in charge of
you, everyone. But, if you possess the requisite qualifications, then the
assigned Dokkaebis will arrive soon to guide you, so please rest easy.]
However, his tone of voice was definitely not a friendly one.

[That is, as long as you are qualified, of course.]

Complexions of the Constellations paled visibly. And soon afterwards, the
Ark made another announcement.

– Next stop is the 8612th planetary system.

The 8612th planetary system. Where the planet Earth was, the home to
<Kim Dokja's Company>.

Bihyung shifted his gaze over the members of <Kim Dokja's Company> as
if he could no longer delay the matter.
[Well, now. Everyone from <Kim Dokja's Company>, please gather
around.] That prompted Han Sooyoung to step forward. "No, hang on a
minute. We finished the last scenario only a few days ago, you know?"

"Please let us head over to Earth first. We haven't completed our
preparation for the next scenario yet."

Jung Heewon also pitched in. One by one, the companions gathered around
– Shin Yoosung, Lee Gilyoung, and Lee Jihye, too… They all carried
confused, unsettled expressions.

Bihyung sighed softly under his breath. [As I thought, it's really
inconvenient without Kim Dokja around, isn't it. If only he was here, he'd
have understood it already.]

"Just what's the reason for hurrying us up like this? If you can't give us a
proper explana…"

Bihyung's lips quietly moved.

– There aren't that many entry tickets remaining. You gotta go there as soon
as possible to secure yours.

Those words were conveyed through the 'Dokkaebi Communication'.

The members of the <Kim Dokja's Company> looked at each other at the
same time. If this Dokkaebi was sending a covert message like this, it could
only mean that he didn't want other Constellations to hear him.

However, what was with this 'entry ticket' thing? Did they need such a thing
for the next scenario?

Yoo Joonghyuk suddenly made his entrance from behind the hesitating
group. "Let's get going."

"But, hang on!"
Yoo Joonghyuk remained adamant even when Jung Heewon tried to stop
him. "The Final Scenario won't start just because we enter its location. It's
the right decision to heed his recommendation."

"But, what about Hyunsung-ssi…"

"Entrust him to my master."

Jung Heewon hurriedly looked at Han Sooyoung. The latter seemed to be
thinking about something for a bit and then, grabbed the former's shoulder.
"…For the time being, let's go there. There must be a reason if he's being so
insistent like this. Maybe, Kim Dokja might have gone ahead of us and is
waiting there. It's worth checking it out."

The words 'Kim Dokja' brought about resolute determination on
the members' expressions. "I agree."

"Me too! Me too!"

Shin Yoosung, Lee Gilyoung, and even Lee Jihye all quickly made up their
minds. Jung Heewon seemed to be worried about Lee Hyunsung until the
end, but eventually nodded her head after listening to Yoo Joonghyuk's
words.

"We might be able to find a way to revive the 'Emperor of Steelsword'
sooner by going to the Final Scenario's location."

"…In that case, I don't have a reason to hesitate anymore."

[Well, let's get going, then.]

Along with Bihyung's voice, <Kim Dokja's Company>'s surroundings were
dyed in bright light in an instant.

[Scenario transmission is starting!]

Perhaps due to the higher-ranking Dokkaebi's authority being invoked, the
time it took to move through the portal was short and comfortable.
In the blink of an eye, the group found themselves transported to the middle
of pitch-black outer space. More specifically, on top of a semi-transparent
disk that allowed them to look down on the universe itself.

"Where…"

The disk was protected by a dome-shaped barrier with only one
entrance/exit, while there were several Dokkaebis standing in front of this
very doorway.

Yoo Joonghyuk took a look at the Dokkaebis once, and then at the
doorway, before muttering to himself. "It's the <Gate of Star Stream>."

"You know where this is?"

He nodded his head at Han Sooyoung's question. "It's where the Bureau's
headquarters is. You have to pass through here in order to enter the Final
Scenario's location."

"Sounds like you've been here before? Were you caught by the ⸢Probability
Appropriateness Evaluation⸥ or something?"

"No, it's my first time here."

"Then how did you know? Did the records from the 1863rd turn mention
this place?"

"That is…"

Suddenly, he grabbed his temples and staggered unsteadily.

He knew of the records from the 1863rd turn, thanks to the 'Secretive
Plotter'. However, those records didn't contain any information regarding
this scenario. Kim Dokja hadn't said anything in particular, either.

In that case, how did he know of this information already?

Tsu-chuchut…
Sparks faintly danced just above his coat. Lee Jihye sensed that something
was wrong and as she reached out to him, rays of bright light exploded
from the Gate's vicinity. Another batch of Constellations, as well as
Dokkaebis, warped into this place.

[Constellation-nims, please, it's this way.]

Constellations and Incarnations brushed past their group in perfect order
under the guidance of Great Dokkaebis. And among them walking past
<Kim Dokja's Company>, was 'Heoche', the very same Dokkaebi who
showed up to offer them a choice earlier.

[Didn't I say it before? That you'll all regret your decision.]

Han Sooyoung and Yoo Joonghyuk glanced at each other after hearing that
Great Dokkaebi's passing voice.

Something was off about this whole thing.

Quite unlike this Great Dokkaebi's group that went past the Gate rather
easily, <Kim Dokja's Company> wasn't even able to approach its vicinity at
all.

Bihyung was standing by the entrance, and the group could hear him
arguing with the gatekeepers there.

[What is the meaning of this? We've already gone through all the
procedures.
These Incarnations possess the right qualifications to enter the Final
Scenario. So, please step aside.]

As the Gate emitting pure light swallowed up the Great Dokkaebi's group, it
stopped first and whispered something to the captain of the gatekeepers.

Unable to wait any longer, Bihyung stepped forward, only for this captain
to open its lips. [Higher-ranking Dokkaebi Bihyung, you and <Kim Dokja's
Company> can't enter the Final Scenario.]
When I was young, I often had dreams where I became Yoo Joonghyuk.
Well, he occupied the places inside me that should've been filled by the
likes of Superman or Batman, that was why.

Not only that, I often acted as him even when I was wide awake. I got
beaten up because of that, and also experienced some pretty horrible
ordeals, too.

Even then, I managed to survive until now because I became such a 'Yoo
Joonghyuk'.

⸢"Captain, let's hurry and head over to the next scenario!"⸥

Of course, it wasn't only Yoo Joonghyuk who made an appearance in my
dreams. Indeed, the brave Lee Jihye was there, too. And…

⸢"Maintenance of the equipment is complete, Joonghyuk-ssi."⸥

…The dependable Lee Hyunsung was also there, and finally…

⸢"Captain, are you alright? Your complexion isn't so good…"⸥

…The thoughtful Shin Yoosung was there, too.

In a way, they were like my family. If Yoo Joonghyuk was my parent, then
Lee Hyunsung was my hyung, Jihye was my older sister, and Yoosung was
my friend.

I loved their stories. I cheered them on during their fights, and took a peek
at their misfortunes. And I…

…I wasn't really sure if this could serve as an excuse, but I truly wished for
them to be happy.
What had happened to them by now, I wonder?

The last thing I saw was Yoo Joonghyuk's face.

⸢"It's all because of you."⸥

Suddenly, my view spun around. I spat out a pained groan and opened my
eyes.

"Your complexion isn't so good. Are you alright?"

I was wondering why my chest felt heavy, but as it turned out, the kkoma
Yoo Joonghyuk number [999] was standing on it. He used his mini
[Splitting the Sky Sword] to pick up a cup resting on the nearby table and
handed it over to me. "Drink."

"…Thanks."

My mind gradually woke up after drinking some cold water.

[Current Incarnation Body recovery rate: 36%]

Although negligent, my Incarnation Body was slowly recovering. Of
course, it wasn't enough to make me feel satisfied.

– <Kim Dokja's Company>. It's now time to leave for the Final Scenario.

The sight I saw in [666]'s smartphone last night didn't want to leave my
head. My companions were already facing the offer of the Final Scenario. I
no longer had time to waste here.

"You can leave whenever you want. As long as you can figure out the
answer yourself, that is."

"It's that thing again?"
I grumbled unhappily and sat up, but then, the kkoma Yoo Joonghyuk
number [999] threw an unexpected question in my way. "Name the type of
food you hate."

"Why, all of a sudden?"

"Shut up and answer the question."

I was momentarily overwhelmed by the little guy's force. "…It's tomato."

He pulled out a small memo pad from his inner pocket and jotted down
'tomato' in neat handwriting.

Why was he writing that down, anyway?

"What about your favourite food?"

"…Murim dumplings with chicken broth."

My answer prompted a change of expressions in [999]'s face. "Looks like
your tongue knows its stuff."

Well, sure, my three-inch tongue helped me live this far, that's true.

"81st turn is in charge of cooking. His swordsmanship might be lacking, but
he's quite talented when it comes to making food. Look forward to it."

Now that I thought about it, 81st turn Yoo Joonghyuk learned quite a lot of
cooking skills for some reason, didn't he? It seemed that he was in charge of
meals in this place, then.

[999] finished jotting down on the memo, jumped off from the bed and
glanced back at me. "If you're uncomfortable about something, tell me.
Even a dumb guest is a guest nonetheless."

"There is something I want to ask, actually."

"As long as it's not an unnecessary one."
"Why did Yoo Joonghyuk become an 'Outer God'?"

The kkoma Yoo Joonghyuk's expression hardened ever so slightly. I
continued with my questioning. "Not only that, he even acts as a
Constellation with a moniker of 'Secretive Plotter', too… The 'Yoo
Joonghyuk' that I know of would've never done something like this.
He's…" One of the things I realized after coming here was that almost all
the kkoma Yoo Joonghyuks didn't really like me. Quite often, they would
try to pick a fight with me for no reason, and rarely did they provide a
proper answer whenever I asked them about something.

However, this [999] was different. There was that story about the wolf, too.
It was as if he wanted to tell me something here.

Thankfully, my gut feeling wasn't wrong.

"Just what is the 'Yoo Joonghyuk' you think you know?"

His voice contained faint traces of scorn. I didn't know what to say.

"Do you still believe that you can understand someone through just a
few lines of text in a couple of chapters?" I couldn't reply.

I wasn't sure why. It could be because I thought that I had no right to
answer him, or maybe I couldn't find the correct words to say.

[999] quietly studied the indecisive me, before shooting me a criticising
glare. He then pulled some things out from a drawer attached to the table to
throw them at me. "I heard that you like to read. Maybe, reading that might
help you. That book is written for the purpose of understanding the fear of
the unknown by foolish humans like you."

What [999] threw at me were several books. I picked one of them up to take
a look.

[A Brief Overview of Outer Gods – regarding the 'Secretive Plotter' and the
'Oldest Dream']
           Chapter 421: Ep. 79 - The Secretive Plotter, VI


This was a book written by the 'Recorder of Fear'.

The 'Recorders of Fear' – the very first humans to encounter the Outer
Gods, and the writers who also spread the word on their existences.
[Exclusive skill, 'Reading Comprehension', is activating!]

[Exclusive Attribute, 'Scenario Interpreter', is activating!]

I couldn't help but feel my anticipation grow after seeing the book's title. To
think, this would be a story regarding the 'Secretive Plotter' and the 'Oldest
Dream'.

The Plotter often brought up this 'Oldest Dream', so I hoped that this could
be an important opportunity to learn more about that 'thing'.

I didn't even notice that [999] had disappeared by then, all my being
focused on reading this book.
Exactly eight hours later, I closed the book's cover, my face one of pure
stupefaction.

"This…"

I knew of a perfect expression to describe this sort of book.

"It's even more boring than 'Ways of Survival'…"

I had no idea who wrote it, but if this book got published in the various
platforms of the 21st century, then I was sure of it tanking as badly as the
'Ways of Survival'.

Not only was it boring, it was also quite a hard read, too.

"…Just what on earth was it even talking about?"

However, there was this one thing that I did understand. Which was, there
were five great 'Outer Gods' in the expansive [Great Hole].

⸢The 'Living Flame' that rises up from the east.⸥

⸢The 'Master of the Sunken Island', the calamity of the world in the west.⸥

⸢The 'Monarch of the Great Abyss', the ruler of the northern universe.⸥

⸢The 'King of Silver Heart', the ruler of the interstellar space in the south.⸥

⸢And finally, the 'Great Plotter' that crawls from the place of nothing.⸥

"…This set-up is even cooler than the Ways of Survival."

In the context of the things so far, this 'Great Plotter' moniker seemed to
signify the 'Secretive Plotter'. Actually, there were several interesting parts
among the texts related to the Plotter himself.
A few Recorders of Fear who had encountered the 'Great Plotter' came to
learn that he was searching for the 'Oldest Dream'… (Omitted)… Those
lucky Recorders were able to ask the Great Plotter about the identity of the
'Oldest Dream'.⸥

⸢[It is the beginning of this universe and the master of the gigantic
cogwheel. My oldest mortal enemy and my parent. And the one who
decides the end of everything.]⸥

⸢The few Recorders of Fear managed to see the Great Plotter's expression
the moment those words were spoken, and they fainted right away. After
waking up, they could no longer remember who they were anymore.⸥

…Records written by a bunch of people who couldn't even remember
themselves? Was that why the author of this book was simply stated as a
'Recorder of Fear', instead?

I wanted to read more about either the 'Great Plotter' or the 'Oldest Dream',
but the majority of the book didn't contain records of those two, but rather,
a collection of boring anecdotes related to the general overview of the
'Outer Gods', instead.

Even the plot development was all over the place.

Quite often, a story would end abruptly without warning just as it was
getting interesting, or the sequence of events would be jumbled up even
within the anecdote itself and made it utterly impossible to make heads or
tails of it.

I wasn't just talking about one story here, but every single one of them, so I
just couldn't get immersed within the book at all.

⸢(What an interesting story.)⸥

It was none other than Simulation who decided to butt in.
'…Which part was interesting to you?'

(This book has been deliberately engineered this way.)⸥

'Are you saying that it was written deliberately to be boring?'

⸢(The message this story wishes to convey is quite clear.)⸥

'If the author wanted to convey a message, then he should've written it in a
way that others could understand'.

⸢It's written with the idea that 'Those who can't understand it, will not'.)⸥

'Pardon?'

I thought I heard a light sigh, and then tiny sparks danced in front of my
eyes. The power leaking out from [The Fourth Wall] flipped through the
pages of the book and began extracting several paragraphs.

And once those seemingly disparate paragraphs, taken from different short
stories, were connected, they formed the following lines of texts.

⸢Emotions, passed down from the distant, remote universe. That is the flow
of the ancient times that this writer could never follow after. We were
terrified.⸥

⸢They were like monsters from a universe we couldn't recognise.⸥

⸢This 'Fear' didn't stem from what we could predict. This was pure 'Terror'
emanating from those that we could never understand.⸥

⸢With great difficulty, we assigned names to each of those Terrors. We
wanted to pretend that, by assigning names to the creatures of the unknown,
we'd be able to understand them.⸥
Only now did it feel like the message this book wished to convey was
revealing itself.

Of course, whether our attempt has any meaning or not, only they can
decide.⸥
After reading that resignation-filled paragraph, I thought I could see why
the 'Outer Gods' ridiculed these 'Recorders of Fear' so much. All those
Modifiers attached to them, strictly speaking, didn't reflect their original
essence.

⸢If you, the reader, meet them someday, remember this. The one who stares
into the abyss will have no choice but to either go mad, or become the abyss
itself.⸥

Having finished my second read-through, I closed the book while feeling
despondent.

"…I've gained pretty much nothing here."

In the end, there was only one thing I got to figure out from this book.

⸢'Outer Gods' are unfathomable creatures.⸥

Those were some pretty irresponsible words, that's for sure.

Such words could be applied to just about anybody, not only to the 'Outer
Gods', now couldn't they?

⸢'Yoo Joonghyuk' is an unfathomable creature.⸥

⸢'Han Sooyoung' is an unfathomable creature.⸥

You could say something like that and it'd still fit the context.
Even if it was not an 'Outer God', it was true that we couldn't fully
understand each other. We might feel like we could, but that was nothing
more than a momentary delusion on our part.

Some time ago, I had a conversation with Jang Hayoung regarding this
topic.

The 'Devourer of Dreamss' silently listening to my thoughts began cackling
away. ⸢(You're correct. That's the message this book wishes to convey. In
the end, we are all simply 'Outer Gods' to each other.)⸥
I put the book down and looked outside the window. It was circular-shaped,
just like the circular room it was in.

Sunlight poured in faintly. I spotted the 'Outer Gods' enjoying the sunbath
in between the forest's dense foliage. Some of them discovered me and
waved their tentacles about. As if I was looking at a scary scene from a
fairy tale or something, I continued to stare at those tentacles. It could very
well be that their outer appearance didn't reflect their true nature.

Now that I took a closer look, their movements seemed to be rather
graceful, too.

⸢(Only those who reach out can discover the truth.)⸥

Maybe, there was no need for me to read that book from the get-go. Well,
'Outer Gods' were everywhere in this place, weren't they.

I sneakily observed my surroundings for a bit, before activating
[Miniaturisation] to slip outside the window.

I floated up and approached one of the 'Outer Gods'. It also extended its
tentacle towards me. I didn't sense hostility behind that action.

⸢I d on't car e if yo u reg ret it.⸥
Even after [The Fourth Wall] warned me, I still reached out towards that
tentacle.

I always regretted about something in my life. However, my regret over the
things I hadn't done was way bigger than for those that I did do.

[Exclusive skill, 'Reading Comprehension', is activating!]

The very last scenario of this <Star Stream> was a great war against the
'Outer Gods'. And through that war, the 'Outer Gods' would disappear from
this world.

They were the only creatures in the 'Ways of Survival' without any detailed
explanation.

I wanted to ask them. Ask them just where they came from.

Ask them for what purpose they were fighting against the <Star Stream>.

Not even once during the original story did the 'Outer Gods' reply to those
questions. They only roared on, or spat out incomprehensible utterances and
fought against the Constellations. That was all.

Tsu-chuchuchuchu…

['The Fourth Wall' is warning you!]

I grasped the Outer God's tentacle. As if it was responding to my touch, the
tentacle wrapped around my hand like a tree's vine.

The 'Recorder of Fear' said this.

They said that the 'Outer Gods' were unfathomable, unexplainable
existences. They said that no one knew where they came from or what their
real identity was.

They could be right. My current actions might be completely meaningless.
We might end up fighting each other later, like how it was in the original
storyline, and bring forth the wretched destruction and ruination to all.

Suddenly, my surroundings seemed to be blanketed by a slow-moving
melody. Under the brilliant sunlight, 'Outer Gods' were, one by one, bowing
their heads in my direction.

[Story, 'One Who Is Loved by All', has begun its storytelling.]

Tiny flowers began blooming on the vines created by the Outer Gods, as if
they were giving me their precious hidden something. Fragrance wafted out
from those flowers, soon becoming lyrics to a song. And afterwards, it
formed a story.

⸢"Captain."⸥

It was a fragment of a very old memory.

⸢"Yoo Joonghyuk-ssi."⸥

I listened to those voices like an entranced man. They belonged to different
people, but I could accurately guess the owners of those voices with my
eyes closed.

I had been thinking about this for a long while.

If the 'Secretive Plotter' was Yoo Joonghyuk from the original story, and
just like what he had shown me, if the countless world-lines of the 'Ways of
Survival' existed out there, then…

The innumerable failed stories within those regression turns, just where
would they have ended up in?

⸢"In the next life, without a doubt."⸥

⸢"Even if you regress many more times, I'll always accompany you,
captain…"⸥
The surging waves of memories swept me up in an instant.

These memories lacked any obvious starting point, and they were not
consistently linked to each other, either. However, I was able to follow
them. As if I was connecting the constellations that couldn't be connected
previously.

Perhaps only I was able to connect them in this world.

And in that moment, I understood.

I understood what the 'Outer God' was, why Yoo Joonghyuk from the
original story had to become one willingly.

…And, why he had no choice but to become the 'Secretive Plotter'.

The story of pain that went on for tens of thousands, hundreds, maybe even
for millions of years. Stories discarded by the world-line and couldn't be
acknowledged as 'Stories'. And the fragments of Stories that became the
subconsciousness of the worlds, drifting around in the universe and
ruminating on the ancient memories. Finally, the voices of those that were
not saved.

[Oooooooohhhh…]

Branches of the 'Outer God' enveloping my surroundings like a garden
began expanding. I couldn't take my eyes off these memories, even though
it felt as if I'd asphyxiate from the crashing waves of them.

⸢"Please, remember us."⸥

I grabbed hold of the Stories crumbling away at my touch and began
sobbing. These were simply far too precious. And I felt uncontrollable
sorrow now that no one remembered them.

I could neither understand or change this.

All I could do, whether it was back then or now, was to simply 'read' them.
'Outer Gods' began screeching out all at the same time.

[YouknowusYouknowusYouknowusYouknowus]

[WhoareyouWhoareyouWhoareyouWhoareyou]

The vines began tightening around me. I heard sobbing noises coming from
the Outer Gods. It sounded like they were happy. Or maybe, sad.

It was the ancient cry resonating from the distant other side of the universe.

⸢Tol d y ou not to do it.⸥

Outer Gods rushing towards me soon formed a dense, impenetrable forest.
Vines grew and grew, choking me harder and tighter as if to swallow me
whole. As if, they wanted to accept me as one of them. As if, they wanted
me to join them and stay forever.

I somehow managed to regain my wits and struggled hard to get out of
there while pushing the vines away. Unfortunately, the more I did that, the
tighter their restrictions became.

[DON'T GO]

[HOW COME]

I couldn't afford to get devoured here.

If I really wanted what's best for them, then I must not faint here.

[CAN'T GO]

Even before I could unsheathe the Unbroken Faith, both of my arms were
sealed off. Just as I was about to get helplessly dragged into the darkness of
the vines, blinding rays of light split them apart.
It was a mini [Splitting the Sky Sword], visible under the faint sunlight. I
raised my head to find the kkoma Yoo Joonghyuk number [999] glaring at
me.

"You bastard, what have you done?"
          Chapter 422: Ep. 79 - The Secretive Plotter, VII


"Just what the hell happened back there?"

Bihyung hung his head low after hearing Han Sooyoung's words.

"You were busy talking a big game, but then, we got refused entry at the
door… Oii, Dokkaebi, will you say something already?"

[Well, that is… Fuu…]

In the end, the <Kim Dokja's Company> couldn't go to the 'Final Scenario'
and had to return to Earth. The reason? Their 'qualification is insufficient'.

[It seems that the Great Dokkaebis were behind this.]

"You think everything'll be fine after saying that? How're you gonna make
up for wasting our time?"
[…I'll compensate you with suitable rewards so please, stop grilling me.]
While the grumbling Bihyung was rummaging through his pockets, Han
Sooyoung sighed deeply and took a look at her companions.

They had somehow returned to Earth after going through all sorts of crazy
ups and downs. Predictably, none of them were themselves at the moment.

"He might have died for real this time… I'm sorry, hyung… I… I wasn't
qualified… Because I didn't do the contract…"

Lee Gilyoung had been muttering some indescribable things to himself
while crouching over there, while Shin Yoosung had her eyes closed and
both of her index fingers were pressed to her temples as if she was
meditating or some such. Meanwhile, Lee Jihye and Jung Heewon had
taken Lee Hyunsung to Aileen at the [Industrial Complex] and had vacated
the premises for the time being.

"…This place hasn't changed at all. That ahjumma didn't even bother to
clean the house, did she?"

Han Sooyoung muttered to herself as she patted away the dust on the aged
couch.

Once upon a time, she, Yoo Sangah, and Lee Sookyung stayed together in
this very house. A place where they lived together for three years during
Kim Dokja's absence…

Her brief reminiscence was cut short by the doorbell.

She utilised the [Black Flame] to remotely open the door and smirked to
herself. "…I guess the ⸢Devil showing up when you talk about her⸥ could be
a Story as well."
"It's been a while, Sooyoung-ah," said Lee Sookyung as she scanned the
messy state of the house. She eventually shook her head. "You're still the
same as before. You should at least ventilate the place."

"I'll have you know, I've returned only just now. And it's already been so
many yea…"

Han Sooyoung flinched when she got that far. She might have spent dozens
of years in the 'Isle of Reincarnators', but that was time spent within the
island itself. She couldn't really tell exactly how long it had been on the
outside.

Lee Sookyung opened all the windows in the house with a simple flick of
her hand and sent away all the stuffy dust outside. Her eyes remained fixed
on the group sagging on the floor in the meantime.

Han Sooyoung sneakily blocked the older woman's view towards them and
coughed to clear her throat, before asking a question. "By any chance, did
Jung Heewon tell you already?"

"Tell me what?"

Han Sooyoung lightly bit her lip. She wasn't sure how to explain this
situation.

"Well, you can see that Kim Dokja isn't here."

"Hmm, that's true. I learned of it just now, too."

She thought that maybe, she shouldn't have brought it up, but it was spilt
milk already. Han Sooyoung squeezed her eyes shut and spoke. "The reason
why he's not here, it's… Me, Yoo Joonghyuk and Jung Heewon, we all
wanted to save your son and tried to go with the soul's one big hit, but…"

"Please get to the main point."
"Huh. Actually, ahjumma, your son's gone to some place with someone.
But that place is…"

"Are you perchance speaking of that?"

Han Sooyoung followed Lee Sookyung's pointing finger and turned her
head. The TV mounted on the wall was playing a news footage.

The scene on the screen showed a man wearing a white coat floating in the
jet-black sky, with Kim Dokja dangling off that man's arm.

– Breaking news! <Kim Dokja's Company>'s president kidnapped!

Han Sooyoung's jaw dropped to the floor as she muttered softly. "…What
the heck is that?"

For some unfathomable reason, the Earth's media had found out about that
event. Lee Sookyung and her rather relaxed expression stared at the screen
for a little while, then she nodded her head. "That boy. He's still so
popular."

"Ahjumma?! Don't you get that it's a pretty serious problem??"

"But, he looks like Yoo Joonghyuk-gun¹. So, what can be a serious
problem?"

"Because that's not the 'Yoo Joonghyuk'. That's the problem."

Han Sooyoung spat out a groan. But then, the TV's screen suddenly
rewound itself back and the exact same footage played out again.

– Breaking news! <Kim Dokja's Company>'s president kidnapped!

She looked around wondering what was going on here, only to discover the
stupefied Yoo Joonghyuk continually poking the TV remote. He rewound
the footage several times and repeated it over and over again.
Han Sooyoung asked him. "…Hey, are you alright?"

"…"

"You won't regress even if your rewind that, you know? Did you even
forget how to go back now?"

He didn't even pretend to hear her. His eyes burned scarily as if he wanted
to engrave the appearance of the 'Secretive Plotter' in them. The Status of
the Regressor who refused to accept his defeat oozed out from him and
made the air in the living room rather stuffy and hot.

Han Sooyoung spat out an even greater groan. "Dammit. Just who the heck
distributed that footage…"

[Hum, hum.]

She turned her head yet again to find Bihyung this time, coughing to clear
his throat.

"…You haven't left yet?"

[Here's your reward.]

Now that she thought about it, she had forgotten all about the reward
payout. She extended her hand out, and the Dokkaebi's small hand placed
500 Coins on her palm.

"Are you messing with me??"

[Well, the thing is, the financial state of the Bureau's Seoul branch is a bit
strained lately, you see… And what with all these many things that require
our attention, it's like…]

Bihyung whistled while glancing at the other side of the sky.
The Seoul's sky that should've been clear was now dyed in the ominous
colours of crimson and yellow. There were Probability's sparks lashing
down like lightning bolts, as well as the pitch-black [Great Hole] swirling
around viciously.

Han Sooyoung frowned deeply and asked. "Did something happen to
Seoul?"

"The skies have been like that for a while now."

This city was no longer the location for the main scenario. But, if the
apocalyptic phenomena were still persisting like that, it…

[It's because of the Apocalypse Dragon.]

Bihyung looked at the sky with a bitter expression, pulled out a lengthy
smoking pipe from his inner pocket and mouthed it.

Perhaps she found that sight unacceptable, Han Sooyoung snatched the pipe
away and yelled at the Dokkaebi. "What are you talking about?! Why does
the Apocalypse Dragon's effect reach this far?"

[You don't know? I thought Kim Dokja would have told you already.]

"That idiot never tells us the most important information."

Bihyung pulled out a second smoking pipe looking rather unperturbed and
spoke while lighting it up. [The revival of the Apocalypse Dragon is the
first button of the great annihilation for all of us. You can think of it as the
worldline now rushing towards its end with that thing wide awake… This
was why I told you that we need to hurry to the 'Final Scenario'.] "…What
will happen if we don't get to the Final Scenario?"

[As the word implies, it's the apocalypse. You, me, this world.]
That composed declaration prompted the dumbfounded Han Sooyoung to
sharply shoot back. "What the heck, what is even… What's the point of this
'Final Scenario' when the whole world is about to be destroyed? Why did
you people even create such a scenario in the first place?!"

[The great annihilation is not a scenario planned out by the Dokkaebis. It's
simply meant to be. And because the annihilation is real, the 'Final
Scenario' has gained its purpose at last.]

Bihyung looked up at the distant skies with an expression of remorse. He
saw the movements of a group of stars, hurriedly trying to get to some
place. Stars of the heavens were getting further away like shooting stars.




[Oh-oooooooh!]

[Ah-aaaaaah!]

The 'Outer Gods' unleashed their jet-black Statuses, dyeing the entirety of
the N'Gai's Forest in pure darkness.

The kkoma Yoo Joonghyuks managed to extract me from the vines and
quickly stood all around me. The kkoma number [999] spoke up first.
"Protect Kim Dokja."

"I told all of you this before, didn't I? I knew he would cause a problem."

"Indeed, we should've killed him the first time we saw him."

Even though they spat out some seriously scary words, all of the mini Yoo
Joonghyuks continued to hold their [Heaven Shaking Swords] firmly and
didn't lower their guards. They sliced and cut the approaching tentacles and
advanced forward little by little.
Maybe because it was directly after witnessing something truly shocking,
my entire body seemed to be wrapped in this cold air. The kkoma number
[999] took off his black coat and placed it over my shoulders.

"I only remember telling you to read a book, so why did you have to
provoke them?"

I wasn't sure what I could say back to him here. [999]'s eyes trembled.

"…You fool."

[Oh-ooooooh!]

The howling Outer Gods' true voice reverberated heavily in the sky. Insects
within the forest vomited out their bodily fluids and died, while some of the
Gods even began fighting among themselves, too.

[999] spoke in a grave tone of voice. "These beings have not been
understood for a very long time. And you just had to get involved."
'Outer Gods' were flooding into where we were.

[GivetomeGivetomeGivetomeGivetome]
[KimdokjaKimdokjaKimdokjaKimdokja]

What was even more concerning, though, was the fact that not all Outer
Gods carried the same sentiments as their peers. A few of the higher-ranked
ones, after sensing my presence, began to exude unfiltered animosity in my
way.

[Stin ki ng Cons tel ation has lo oked down on us.]

[Ki ll him get r id of h im.]

[No fo rgiving e ven if y ou are Plo tter's gue st.]
"Step aside, members of the Shantak!"

"We will cut you down if you come closer."

The kkoma Yoo Joonghyuks all unleashed their Statuses and resisted, but
the 'Outer Gods' didn't back down at all. They approached closer one step at
a time, and while emitting dizzying Statuses themselves, cried out in a loud
roar.

[Oh, Pl otter! We can no lo nger wa it!]

[F or ho w long do we n eed to wa it? The wo rld-l ine's end is ap pro
aching!]

I knew very well what they were talking about.

The world-line's end.

Even these guys, as expected, were fully conscious of the 'Final Scenario'.

[Th is wo rld mu st unde rstand us]

"Step aside!!"

The tentacles closing in grew even more ferocious. Eventually, their
Statuses became simply too much for the kkoma Yoo Joonghyuks to deal
with, but then…

The forest parted ways, and 'he' made his entrance.

He walked forward while crossing the tentacles that none of us could block.
Each of his steps contained the solitude of indescribable eternity as well as
the entirety of the 1863rd lives he had experienced.

Once upon a time, his name was Yoo Joonghyuk, but now, he was the
'Secretive Plotter'. A man who knew of every world-line's sorrow.
Outer Gods knelt down in front of that absolute, overwhelming nobleness.

[Oh, the gr eat Pl otter.]

However, not all of them did. There were some 'Gods' who didn't want to
bend their opinions even when subjected to the intense pain of their
existences turning into nothingness.

[Oh, the gr eat Pl otter, we can no lo nger wa it.]

The ones no one could ever understand were wailing in sorrow. They raged
on, and they mourned. Even then, their rage and sorrow were not
understood. They didn't belong to this this world-line, and they couldn't be
understood through the existing 'Stories'.

One needed to work really hard to understand their rage, their sorrow and
their grief.

[We wan t to be un ders tood.]

[We w ant to bec ome sto ries.]

Stories that needed one to work hard to understand could never be Stories.
Stories that needed one to throw oneself deeply in first couldn't be
consumed.

The 'Secretive Plotter' opened his lips. [You will not be understood.]

He looked at each and every one of them with subtle gazes, studied them,
and gifted them with the cruel reality.

[That is because this <Star Stream> has labelled all of you 'Terrors'.
Because this world has described you all as 'Chaos' that destroys the order,
as calamities that could never be understood. That is why.]
It was then I finally understood why the 'Secretive Plotter' has chosen to
side with these creatures.

⸢Why would a person who knows the end of everything repeat the same
story over again?⸥
When I thought about it, the answer was a rather simple one.

⸢That's because he didn't like the end he witnessed.⸥

In the original story, Yoo Joonghyuk and Constellations defeated the 'Outer
Gods' together. That's how he got to the end of the scenarios, and destroyed
the <Star Stream>.

[You will never shine in the sky like the Constellations, nor can you
become the main actors of this world. As long as the <Star Stream> exists,
you will all remain forever as 'Outer Gods'.]

However, he didn't find what he wanted. And now, after becoming the
'Secretive Plotter', Yoo Joonghyuk was stepping up to the battlefield once
more.

[Soon, the war of annihilation will commence. The end of everything will
soon begin, where stars will fall, worlds will collapse, and all Stories will
be extinguished.]

I spotted the eyes of the 'Secretive Plotter' looking at me from afar. The
[Sage's Eye] spun around within his pitch-black iris.

[Oh, the great Plotter…!]

[Oh, ooooooh!]

According to the plot of the original story, these creatures would meet with
defeat.
⸢For the sake of the conclusion Kim Dokja wishes for, these beings simply
had to be defeated.⸥
<Star Stream> would be destroyed, while the stars of the heavens and the
solitary gods would die with no one to remember them. The defeated would
die extremely sorrowful deaths, while the victors would not get to bask in
their victory.

I began walking towards the 'Secretive Plotter'.

"…Kim Dokja?"

I heard [999] call out to me, but I didn't look back. I undid the
[Miniaturisation], and my eye level changed rapidly. The black coat [999]
placed on my shoulders wavered along with every step I took.

[<Star Stream>'s Probability is now shifting!]

[Stream of the great main scenario is now dwelling in you.]

Past the canopy of the vine-covered forest, the sea of stars of the <Star
Stream> could be seen. On one side of the sky, stars were emitting bright
light, while on the other side, ominous-looking galaxies alongside the
[Great Hole] were quietly flowing about.

Half of it, light, while the other half, darkness.

Soon, the final war would begin. And most likely, I would have to stand on
one of the sides to witness the end of the world.

[Your second Modifier has been decided.]

A small star flickered on the far side of the sky. I stared at it for the longest
time, before slowly reverting my gaze back to the ground. The 'Outer Gods'
were now looking at me.
I returned their gazes and finally chose the side I'd stand.

[Your second Modifier is the 'Watcher of Light and Darkness'.]

[Kill him.]

[KimdokjaKimdokjaKimdokjaKimdokja!]

I began walking towards the 'Outer Gods'.

The 'Secretive Plotter' didn't try to stop me. It was as if he was telling me to
try anything I want.

I took another step forward. The movements of the vines grew even more
vicious. They extended out in an instant, and grabbed both of my arms.

[HeknowsusHeknowsusHeknowsusHeknowsus]

"Right, I do know you."
I nodded my head towards them.

[ButhowButhowButhowButhowButhow]

'But how'.

I didn't know how to answer that question. When I failed to provide an
answer, the animosity directed at me by the vines grew even heavier.
Eventually, one of the tentacles wavering around flew in and pierced my
shoulder. It hurt like crazy, but the true pain didn't come from the injured
body part.

I could hear someone's voice coming from the end of that tentacle.

⸢"I don't want to die."⸥

Was it an illusion?

For a moment there, the tentacle piercing my shoulder looked like a sword.

…Not just any, but the Twin Dragon Sword. And I knew the owner of this
sword well.

⸢"I don't want it to end like this."⸥

Lee Jihye was crying. I belatedly reached out, but her crying face had
disappeared by then. Her face slowly vanished, crumbling into debris and
only the short, aimless voice fragments lingered on.

'The Nameless Ones'.

"…I know."

I suppressed the pain and spoke up. And then, yet another tentacle flew in
towards me. The kkoma Yoo Joonghyuk number [999] shouted out. As the
bloody noise of my flesh being pierced resounded out, another voice
entered my head.

⸢"Yoo Joonghyuk-ssi, which number Lee Hyunsung am I?"⸥

The Incarnation of steel, sturdier than anyone in this world. Just like before,
Lee Hyunsung's figure scattered like bubbles as I reached out. My hand
wandered the empty air, and his voice came to me from beyond the void.
⸢"Truly, is there an end to these scenarios?"⸥
"Yes, there is."

I bit my lip and continued to walk forward.

One step, and then, another one.

Every time I did, fragments of the forgotten world-line talked to me.

⸢"I believed we could carry on for a little while longer."⸥

Lee Seolhwa, dying with her heart penetrated.

⸢"I don't resent you. Still, there is one thing I do regret…"⸥

Shin Yoosung, smiling faintly as she scattered away.

⸢"You're so dumb. Captain, I'm Kim Namwoon. You think I'll kick the
bucket here? I won't die. I will definitely not die. I'll survive, and survive
again to see the next scenario. For sure, the next scenario…"⸥

Kim Namwoon, passing on with his eyes still open.

Memories from the regression turns that I couldn't even begin to guess.
These were simply by-products of the failed world-lines, a collection of
memories with no meaning to them anymore. The precious something that
Yoo Joonghyuk had been protecting even at the cost of becoming the
'Secretive Plotter'.

⸢"I ain't going to be your ally in the next turn. So, don't come looking for
me."⸥
Gong Pildu.

⸢"Looks like you'll be left alone again, Yoo Joonghyuk."⸥

Anna Croft.

⸢"It's been an honour to fight alongside you, Supreme King."⸥

Selena Kim.

Even the memories of those who used to be Constellations fleeted past me.

Goryeo's First Sword, Cheok Jungyeong.

The god of wine and ecstasy, Dionysus…

I stopped walking because of the sensation of the fierce flames from my
right side. The tentacle holding onto my arm burned as it spoke to me.

⸢"I can still burn them some more."⸥

…Uriel.

I nodded my head and replied. "I know."
['Outer Gods' are now looking at you.]

I knew. But I couldn't understand.

Because I wasn't them.

And that was why all I could say to them were these words.

"This story isn't over yet."

['Outer Gods' are paying attention to your words.]

"There are still some things left to be told, right?"

I looked up at the 'Outer Gods'.

These beings, portrayed always as either cephalopods or tentacled
monsters.
Creatures cursed with the most disgusting appearances by the world-line,
because they were not needed by it.

I spoke to them. "I'll tell your story."

Right away, the surroundings were swept up in the frenzied storm winds.

[Reallyreallyreallyreallyreally]

[WhatdoyoumeanWhatdoyoumeanWhatdoyoumean]

And from the other side, vicious animosity rained down on me.

[Lies!]

[Y ou th ink we wi ll fall for it the se cond ti me?]

Upper-grade Gods began emitting their auras at me.
I swallowed back the blood rising up in my throat and stared at them. I
knew why they were reacting so violently like this. Because they had been
continually used by the 'scenario' until now.

[Do kkae bis sa id the sa me th ing.]

It was the 'Bureau' that learned of their existences first and had used them –
the storytellers who, under the pretext of incorporating them into the
scenarios, exploited their powers and Probability, and turned them into the
'Evil' of this world.

I spoke up with my true voice. [I'm not a Dokkaebi.]

[Y ou are a Con stell ation.]

[I'm not affiliated with the Bureau, nor am I a collaborator of Dokkaebis.]

[All Con stell ations are the sa me.]

Those words stabbed and dug into my chest like a dagger.

They were right. I was also just another Constellation who craved after
Stories and leered on at their stories. However, because I was a
Constellation, I got to know about something important, as well.

[You will all definitely be destroyed when the 'final war' commences.
Doesn't matter how you fight, you will still end up losing.]

[How in sol ent, y ou ca n't tell th at wi thout fi ght ing fi rst…!]

[No need. I already know. I've already seen all the world-lines where
you fight. I do not wish to see you die like that this time around.] The
branches of the 'Outer Gods' trembled from my words.

[What do y ou me an]
[You say that you wish to be understood. In that case, I'll make you into a
Story.]

Right at that moment, the surrounding space-time distorted. Tentacles were
trembling ever so imperceptibly.

I sensed that vibration and continued on. [I'll ensure that you can stand on
equal terms with the stars in the sky. What I'm saying is that, I'll create a
Story where no one will misunderstand you or despise you.]

The unrest slowly spread out. A large current of air swept across the
'N'Gai's Forest' as if it was the sign of an incoming storm.

I didn't miss this opening and spoke again. [There is no reason for the 'final
war' to start. There is no need for you to remain as <Star Stream>'s evil…]

[Sh ut up]

[The lik es of y ou da res to!]

In the end, I did vomit out some blood. Upper-grade ostracised gods
capable of destroying my body and killing my consciousness completely
were descending down on me.

[KimdokjadangerKimdokjadanger]

[DontattackDontattackDontattack]

Vines wrapped tightly around me.

The 'Nameless Ones' were protecting me from the auras of the powerful
historical-grade Outer Gods.

[Pa the tic ones that don t e ven po sse ss egos.] Ku-

gugugugu!
Just one true voice, and the dozens of branches were torn off. Even though
they emitted painful screams, the smaller 'Outer Gods' protected me. And
then, the kkoma Yoo Joonghyuks stepped in front of me as well.

The 'Secretive Plotter' didn't try to stop them or dissuade them. He simply
watched on as if he was not allowed to interfere with the decision making
process this time.

Just as the Statuses of the historical-grade Gods reached the critical point…

[You speak of some amusing things.]

Someone suddenly spoke up. A creature was walking out from a portal
spinning around ominously.

[Oh, pitiful illegitimate children of the world-line, he speaks of the truth.]

[And y ou, a re?]

[You shall become a Story once more and be a part of the story within the
stream of stars. That is, as long as that unfortunate Constellation is willing
to sacrifice himself for your sakes.]

It was an old man with a very small stature, yet the shadow he cast was
unimaginably large.

There were two lumps shaking about on the cheeks of the giant shadow.

[De vil of ho ri zon…]

I too knew of the race that old man belonged to. Indeed, I had a deal with
one of them when I went to the Demon Realm for the first time.

However, this creature right before my eyes was on another dimension
compared to the 'Wenny' I met back then.
There were countless Wennys in this world, but there could only be one
with two lumps among them.

[Oh, the master of the ancient library.]

I raised my head to find the Wenny King staring at me with eyes filled with
malicious interest.

[Are you truly planning to become the <Star Stream>'s enemy for the sake
of these discarded waste?]




I could see the circular-shaped exit open up in the distant forest. And
behind me, many Outer Gods had come to see me off. Their tentacles
danced side to side like a forest of gigantic reeds.

[KimdokjaKimdokjaKimdokja]

[GoodbyeGoodbyeGoodbye]

Most of them possessed similar outer appearances, but even then, I could
just about tell them apart.

That guy over to the left side was the kind-hearted one possessing a tiny
little bit of Shin Yoosung's memories from the 12th turn. The one on the far
right, meanwhile, was blessed with a fair amount of 44th Kim
Namwoon's… Hang on, didn't that guy stab me in the thigh earlier?

"There is no need to go this far," said the kkoma Yoo Joonghyuk number
[999] riding on my shoulder. "The deal with the Wenny King is as absolute
as they come. If you do this, then you will definitely…"
"I won't die, so don't worry. By the way, are you planning to come with
me?"

[999] formed an unhappy expression after hearing my question. "As per our
agreement, I'm tasked with monitoring you. It'd become troublesome for us
if you get in touch with the members of<Kim Dokja's Company> and come
up with an underhanded scheme."

"But, I even did the existence pledge, saying that I won't contact them…
Seriously, you Yoo Joonghyuks can be too much sometimes."

The first agreement I made with the Wenny King, as well as the Outer
Gods, was that I'd not contact the <Kim Dokja's Company> nor reveal my
identity to them.

And the second agreement was…

[Your actions have triggered a new scenario to be created in the <Star
Stream>!]

[Hidden scenario has been generated!]

I chuckled hollowly as I read the scenario messages.

Even things like this became a scenario… As expected of the <Star
Stream>, then. But then again, this world wanted to create a story out of its
own destruction, so it shouldn't that surprising, really.
  <Hidden Scenario – Verifying Agreement>

  Type: Hidden

  Difficulty: ???

  Clear condition: Introduce 'Outer Gods' to the <Star Stream>'s main
  Giant Story. However, they must not be introduced in the existing role
  of 'Outer Gods' as before.

  Time limit: 100 days

  Reward: Outer Gods' trust, ???

  Failure: You will lose all of your memories and transform into an Outer
  God.



Give Outer Gods a role that wasn't about being 'Outer Gods'…

Such a scenario didn't exist anywhere in the original story.

A scenario acquired after persuading the Outer Gods and making a deal
with the Wenny King. If I failed it, then I'd be transformed into an Outer
God like them.

This was the second condition of the agreement I made with the 'Wenny
King'.

⸢However, succeeding in this scenario will ensure that Outer Gods wouldn't
be destroyed.⸥
I looked at the exit of the N'Gai's Forest and did a light stretching exercise.
[999] asked me, perhaps finding me rather untrustworthy. "Where are you
planning to go now? There shouldn't be any scenario with a 'Giant Story'
remaining by now."

He was right. Most of the Giant Stories existing in <Star Stream> had come
to their conclusions by now. However, if my memory served me correctly,
then one powerful 'Giant Story' should still remain.

I pretended to ask [999] in passing. "By the way, do you also know about
the stories from the 1863rd turn?"

"I've heard about it from the Great Plotter."

"If you guys enter the 'final war' like this, then you'll definitely lose. And
even if you somehow miraculously win, not many of you will end up
surviving."

"Are you trying to curse us?"

"No, I'm only stating the truth."

No matter how powerful the faction of the 'Secretive Plotter' and the 'Outer
Gods' was, they still couldn't fight against the entire <Star Stream>.
Whatever the case might have been, the current rulers of this universe were
the <Star Stream>'s Nebulas and the stinking 'Bureau'.

"The best way to avoid war is to inform the other side that they would lose
a lot by starting one in the first place."

"What are you implying?"

"Do you know which Constellation slaughtered the most number of Outer
Gods in the 'final war'?"
[999] carefully combed through his memories after hearing my question
and made his reply. Although, his expression indicated that his pride had
been wounded just a little bit.

"No, I do not."

"The Status he possesses is so strong that normally, he has to divide himself
into several pieces. Well, if I'm to describe him, he'd be pretty similar to the
'Secretive Plotter'."

"…Similar to the Great Plotter?"

"That's right. If only that guy didn't stand on the side of the <Star Stream>,
if only he didn't perform the suicidal attack on the tens of thousands of
ostracised gods… the course of the 1863rd turn would've changed by a lot."

My words caused [999]'s eyes to tremble for the first time. It seemed that he
had finally realized the identity of the Constellation I was talking about.

"…Could it be?"

The Constellation who sacrificed himself to take out countless other gods
during the 'Ways of Survival's final war.

There was only one being capable of doing that. I grinned and spoke.
"You're right. We're going to go where he is and make him our ally."
             Chapter 424: Ep. 80 - Our greatest ally, II


A white figure of a person rose up in the pitch-black darkness.

Yoo Joonghyuk swung his sword several times at this figure. From the
Breaking the Sky Thunder Sword, even to the Shooting Star Slash.
However, not one of his sword skills managed to even touch the enemy's
shadow.

Right after that, Stories collided. Jolted awake now, he opened his eyes
while gasping out a pained moan.

He was sitting inside the darkened training dojo, the sun having set already.
A lengthy shadow was looking down on him.

It was the Breaking the Sky Sword Saint.

"Was he really strong?"
His master bent her back to settle down, her eyes filled with concern
towards her disciple. Yoo Joonghyuk bit his lip and replied. "…He was."

"By how much?"

"Even after unlocking the Transcendence level 5, I couldn't win against
him."

The fifth level of Transcendence was the absolute limit that the current Yoo
Joonghyuk had reached.

The Breaking the Sky Saint quietly observed him for a little while, before
opening her lips. "When you break past the Transcendence's sixth level,
you'll no longer be bound by the [Breaking the Sky Swordsmanship]'s
gender requirements."

Originally, the [Breaking the Sky Swordsmanship] was a martial technique
designed for women. But, as was the case with every martial technique out
there, once one stepped past a certain level, they would reach the stage of
'Breaking Beyond Boundaries'.

The process of endlessly exceeding many boundaries was the part of a
Transcendent's training regime.

"There is no guarantee of defeating him even if I reach the sixth level."

"Why do you think that?"

"He is me."

For the first time ever, Yoo Joonghyuk's always-confident voice contained
a faint trace of fear. "That man, he's none other than me who has regressed
over 1863rd times. How can I defeat someone like that?" It was a clear
sign of despair.
The moment he stood face to face with the 'Secretive Plotter', he witnessed
a wall he couldn't overcome no matter what he tried. There was the gap of
time between them that could never be bridged by the mere 3rd turn
regression. His enemy had already surpassed that lengthy period of time to
enter this world-line.

The Sword Saint spoke. "He is not you."

"…He is also Yoo Joonghyuk."

"He has not tread on the same path as you have. And he'll not do so in the
future, either."

As if she wanted to wipe away the despair rooted in her disciple's eyes, her
large hand gently stroked his cheek.

She spoke again. "It's not the level of Transcendence you have reached, but
which Stories you have acquired that's the most important part. You may be
only a little chick who has regressed three times, but you know of Stories
that he doesn't."

Yoo Joonghyuk heard those words and looked down at his fist. It was a fist
that failed to reach the 'Secretive Plotter'. He slowly unfurled his hand and
Stories leaked out from there.

Stories that he had acquired himself. Stories that the 'Secretive Plotter'
didn't
know. And…

"The path of Transcendence is different for everyone. So, do not try to
chase after him, and search for the path only you can tread."

He wordlessly clenched his fist tightly. As if he didn't want to permit any of
the Stories to leave him.
"…Have you heard any new information, Master?"

The Breaking the Sky Saint shook her head.

It had been over a week since Kim Dokja's disappearance.

Unfortunately, neither his whereabouts nor the location of the 'Secretive
Plotter' had been discovered until now.

"You say that he crossed over from another world-line."

"That's correct."

"I do not know what his aim is, but if he bothered to enter this world-line at
this point in time, then it's possible that his goal is somehow related to the
'Final Scenario'."

Yoo Joonghyuk agreed with her opinion. In other words, there was a good
chance that he'd encounter the 'Secretive Plotter' again by going to the
location of the Final Scenario.

"However, the current situation is that the <Kim Dokja's Company>
can't enter the 'Final Scenario'." He nodded his head.

– Stories you have acquired are insufficient to approve your participation
inthe 'Final Scenario'.

On that day they failed to enter the 'Final Scenario', the <Bureau>
onesidedly sent that communique in their direction. However, he thought
that made some sense. Because not only were they a newly-created Nebula,
the number of Stories they managed to acquire was also rather small, as
well.

However, one couldn't strictly argue that when taking into consideration the
grade of the Stories they had acquired. Especially so with the ⸢Season of
Light and Darkness⸥, the Giant Story they earned the last time that would be
extremely hard to find its equal anywhere in the <Star Stream>.

– Where is the representative of your Nebula?

In the end, everything boiled down to Kim Dokja's absence.

After the person possessing the highest percentage of the Nebula's Story
shares left the group, the aggregate amount of Stories for the whole Nebula
had become simply too inadequate.

It was unknown what Yoo Joonghyuk was thinking to himself as he
maintained his silence. And how long went by like that? He slowly raised
himself up off the floor, sheathed the [Black Heavenly Demon Sword] and
although still unsteady on his feet, got ready to leave.

"Where are you planning to go?"

"I'm leaving to acquire a new Giant Story, Master."

He needed to acquire the qualification to get to the 'Final Scenario' even
without Kim Dokja's shares. <Kim Dokja's Company> was neither that
fool's private army nor his underlings. This group needed to be able to
protect themselves without him around, and even if they end up losing him
somehow…

…They needed to be capable enough to clear the 'Final Scenario'.

[Baat…]

Biyoo murmured in despondency from somewhere in the empty air. Yoo
Joonghyuk silently stared at her for a little while, before activating the
[Sage's Eye] to sift through the information he possessed in his head.
There weren't that many locations left at this point in time where he could
acquire a 'Giant Story'. When flipping that statement around, it also meant
that the remaining Stories would be that much more powerful than others.

He had already acquired one powerful Giant Story called the ⸢Season of
Light and Darkness⸥. If he managed to earn 'that Story' on top of this, then it
might be possible to fight against the 'Secretive Plotter' once more.

The Breaking the Sky Sword Saint watched Yoo Joonghyuk walk away and
asked him. "Are you planning to go alone?"

"I've always been alone, Master."

"But, that path is the one already tread by the other party."

His Master's words caused Yoo Joonghyuk's figure to flinch.

In the next moment, a voice came out from beyond the walls of the training
hall.

"Hey Yoo Joonghyuk, where are you?? We gotta get going, now!"

With the blinding light behind them, the members of <Kim Dokja's
Company> opened the door and rushed inside the dojo.

Shin Yoosung, Lee Gilyoung, Lee Jihye, and Han Sooyoung…

It was unknown since when they got ready to leave, but regardless,
everyone from the Nebula was here.

The Breaking the Sky Sword Saint spoke again. "They are precisely your
Story now, Joonghyuk-ah."

Something that the 'Secretive Plotter' did not possess.
Yoo Joonghyuk dazedly looked back at his Master, and she addressed him
again.

"You don't have to fight alone in this regression turn."




The location of the new 'Giant Story' was four days away. It would've been
so much quicker to get there by borrowing the powers of the Dokkaebis,
but the current situation didn't permit that.

– You cannot borrow the powers of Dokkaebis you are friendly with.

– You must never reveal the truth that you're 'Kim Dokja'.

All thanks to the stinking agreement I had with the 'Wenny King'.

Because of it, I couldn't enter Biyoo's channel or send word of my
wellbeing to the <Kim Dokja's Company>.

In the end, I had no choice but to personally drive the [X-grade Ferrarghini]
I purchased from the 'Mass Production Maker' to the destination.

The kkoma Yoo Joonghyuk number [999] polishing his [Splitting the Sky
Sword] atop my shoulder grumbled softly. "Your driving sucks."

"Then, why don't you drive? By the way, you're not planning to stick to that
appearance now, are you?"

Without a doubt, we'd run into Constellations that will recognise us once
we entered the scenario location. The existence of the kkoma Yoo
Joonghyuk was just too eye-catching.

Well, Yoo Joonghyuk himself was just too famous by now, so…
"Indeed, I am too inconspicuous like this."

[999] seemed to be pondering something. His body suddenly jolted a bit,
before a 'Pow!' noise resounded out and he transformed into a Murim
dumpling.

I was shocked silly by this event. But [999] sounded utterly disinterested as
he addressed me.

– This should be fine.

"…Hey, you. Carrying a dumpling around on my shoulder will be even
more eye-catching, you know?"

– Why don't you change your pathetic appearance as well?

Just as the kkoma Yoo Joonghyuk couldn't maintain his original
appearance, I too needed to make sure that my identity as 'Kim Dokja'
wasn't discovered.

The now-dumpling-fied Yoo Joonghyuk roughly rubbed the dumpling skin
all over my face as if he was trying to paint a wall. I sensed the Story on my
face change as creaking noises resounded out. How long passed by like
that? By the time I opened my eyes, I ended up freaking out by what I saw.

[999] spoke to me as I stared dumbfoundedly at the mirror, my eyes
blinking non-stop.

– It's done.

Holy moly. This might not be enough to slap Yoo Joonghyuk's cheek silly,
but still… It should be enough to make me ponder whether I should slap
him or not, at least.
I rubbed my new statuesque face and muttered to myself. "…Can't I keep
this face forever?"

– If you do, you'll be struck by the storm of Probability's aftermath.

As if he had touched something dirty, [999] diligently patted down his
dumpling body. Completely disregarding whether he was doing that or not,
I continued to stare at the mirror.

A long time ago, I absorbed the Story fragment of the 'Casanova Who Died
During Sexual Acts' and became pretty good looking for a while, but this
was on another scale compared to that.

I spoke in an admiring tone of voice. "It's true that the 999th regression
turn is amazing. The 3rd turn doesn't have skills like this one, you know."
– …3rd turn?

"Oh, you didn't know? Yoo Joonghyuk in this place is the 3rd turn. And this
is the 3rd turn world-line, too."

The kkoma Yoo Joonghyuk number [999] stared deeply at me for a while
after hearing those words, and asked me a question.

– Why do you think that?"

"What do you mean why…?"

I was about to reply with "Because the 'Ways of Survival' starts off with the
3rd turn, that's why" but stopped. I decided to refine my answer just a bit.

"…Because the beginning was the 3rd turn, that's why."

– But, why does it start from the 3rd turn? Don't you know how numbers
work? The beginning is the 0th turn.
He was right.

The first chapter of the 'Ways of Survival' started off from Yoo Joonghyuk's
third turn, but if you get technical about it, then you could say that the story
began with his 0th turn.

I felt a bit weirded out after thinking like that.

…Why did I come to Yoo Joonghyuk's 'third turn', anyway?

I wasn't going to follow the 3rd turn's story as it was in the original, so there
wouldn't have been a reason for me to start in this particular turn even if
that's where the novel began.

…I don't know. It's not as if I can figure this out right now, anyway.

"Yoo Joonghyuk in this world-line said that he was the 'third turn'. So, this
place is the third regression turn."

And the information I confirmed through the [Character List] said so, too.

But then, [999] spoke in a mocking tone.

– Trusting such information at its face value. How naïve.

"What?"

– Never mind. We've seemed to have arrived.

Along with the blinding light, the lengthy dimension tunnel finally came to
an end. What appeared next was a giant Gate leading to the new scenario's
location.

I spotted a group of beings waiting to enter in front of the Gate. I collected
the [X-grade Ferrarghini] and joined the group.
A Constellation was manning the entrance to the scenario location, rather
than the usual Dokkaebis. But that made sense, since the host for this 'Giant
Story' scenario was a Nebula.

Although it was one of the largest Nebulas out there, it had almost no point
of contact with me until now.

[Next.]

It was a Constellation holding a massive three-pronged spear on one hand,
while wearing a combination of aged crimson crown and armour set.

The domineering Status exuding from his entire body attested to the fact
that he was a Narrative-grade Constellation possessing a pretty hefty Status.

The Guardian of Buddhist Laws, Virudhaka.

He was one of the Four Heavenly Kings that protected the entrance of the
<Heavenly Palace>, the headquarters of the Nebula <Emperor>.

[Next.]

Not too long afterwards, my turn came around.

Virudhaka glared at my face intently as if he wanted to discover anything
suspicious on it and eventually, threw out his first question.

[Your purpose for visiting?]

[I came to participate in the Giant Story.]

[Your Modifier.]

Obviously, I couldn't use the 'Demon King of Salvation' here. Fortunately, I
did have a brand new Modifier I received not too long ago.

[It's the 'Watcher of Light and Darkness'.]
             Chapter 425: Ep. 80 - Our greatest ally, III


My words caused a handful of Constellations standing behind me to
murmur among themselves.

I wondered if others had heard of my new Modifier already, but fortunately,
that didn't seem to be the case.

[I'm sure the Bureau's naming division was behind that title? Do they still
do that nowadays?]

[I thought there wouldn't be any other Modifiers that could exceed the
'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon', but…]

[Tsk, why do young ones these days prefer such Modifiers anyway?]

…Well, I guess I can tell what they are complaining about, then.

Virudhaka completed the simple entry procedure and then, stared at my
shoulder.
[What is that dumpling?]

[It's my lunch.]

[…How peculiar. A fool showed up with cotton candy yesterday, and now
we have you.]

Cotton candy?

[Next.]

Much to my relief, Virudhaka let me through without much hassle.

[You have entered the channel that directs the scenario's location.]

Right after I went past the Gate, I was greeted by the rainbow-coloured
aura swirling around, followed by the guide message as well as an
accompanying video.

[We welcome you to the world of the Nebula <Emperor>!]

…Yeah, even the entry video was on another scale.

When I blinked, I found myself standing atop a white cloud.

It was flying at a fairly decent knock with me as its sole passenger. I looked
around and found a handsome golden-coloured monkey flying alongside
side me.

⸢"Let's go, friend."⸥

The monkey winked at me playfully and performed a somersault in the air
while swinging his Ruyi Bang around. The image in the sky changed and
now showed countless Yogoe¹ creatures rushing towards us.

I knew this was all fake but still, couldn't help but get absorbed by it.
[The world's most beautiful epic.]

Because well, this was the most famous Giant Story that the Nebula
<Emperor> possessed, that was why.

The scene now showed the Great Sage, Heaven's Equal Sun Wukong
fighting against all those Yogoe creatures. And right behind him, a great
army of thousands following in his footsteps.

[We invite you to experience this grand adventure.]

The footage came to an end, and I found myself standing on a plaza before
I even noticed it.

The dumpling on my shoulder spoke up.

– What a showy salesmanship that was.

"Stop yapping. You're supposed to be a dumpling, remember?"

I complained for no reason from the embarrassment I felt after getting all
worked up a bit just now. I then slowly took in the surrounding sights and
observed the panoramic view of the <Heavenly Palace>.

The plaza was filled with elegant ancient palaces. The vestige of
civilisation gleamed brilliantly in the golden hue. Stars among stars had
gathered here, and the world created by Stories acquired by those stars was
now laid out before my eyes.

I had been to the bases of other Nebulas before, but this would be my first
time in a worldview with this many people in it.

For the time being, I decided to investigate my surroundings a bit more.

It was around then that I saw a hologram appearing on one of the electronic
boards installed in the plaza.
– Whereabouts of Nebula <Kim Dokja's Company>'s members unknown!–
They are understood to be participating in a new Giant Story scenario…

['The Fourth Wall' is strongly activating!]
– What is the next destination of <Kim Dokja's Company>?

It was playing the scene of Yoo Joonghyuk and my companions entering a
Gate emitting blinding light. I stopped walking for a little while and
watched them disappear through that light.

['The Fourth Wall' is activating even stronger than before!]

…Brand new 'Giant Story', was it?

I could more or less guess what happened there.

My companions must be wandering around here and there, searching for a
way to acquire a new Giant Story. Well, after I left the <Kim Dokja's
Company>, their share of Stories wouldn't have been sufficient enough to
let them into the 'Final Scenario'.

I shifted my head to find [999] looking straight at me.

– I advise you not to make any unwise decisions.

"…I know already. Don't you worry."

Sure, I desperately wanted to return to my companions right away, but right
now, my situation didn't allow me to contact any one of them.

– It's not for you, but for the sake of your companions.

"I know."

Even if I forget about the agreement for a second here, the road I'm about to
tread was lined with dangerous thorns with no guarantee of walking away
alive. If I carelessly contacted them, every one of my companions might
fall into life-threatening danger.

[Will you travel to the Giant Story scenario location?]

I nodded my head.

[Automatic guidance to the scenario progress location will now
commence.] As expected of a Nebula that pursued convenience above all
else – my legs actually began running all by themselves.

I noticed a few Incarnations around me who also started their automatic
running thing, sporting the same body posture as me. We all became rather
embarrassed and avoided meeting each other's gazes.

[Automatic guide will now end.]

The place I arrived at was in front of a giant holographic panel installed to
the west of the plaza.

There were many Constellations and Incarnations present here already. I
could see golden-coloured bronze statues rising up above right next to the
sea of crowds.

The one taking the center-most spot was a Constellation that I knew pretty
well. The 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband', sporting a head full of golden
hair and wielding a gigantic Ruyi Jingu Bang.

These were the statues of protagonists of the Journey to the West, including
the Great Sage, Heaven's Equal Sun Wukong.

Not surprisingly, <Emperor> seemed to be well aware of which story out of
their worldview was the most famous of them all.

[New main scenario is available!]
And the upcoming scenario was related to that 'famous story'.
I accessed the scenario window.
<Main scenario #94 - Journey to the West Remake

Type: Main

Difficulty: ???

Clear condition: Work together with other Constellations and/or
Incarnations to create 'Story chamber' and remake the Journey to the
West. The remade Journey will be evaluated in real-time by judges as
well as audience members. Through the judging criteria which may
include 'Popularity', 'Degree of Faithfulness to the original', and
"Originality', overall points will be assigned at the end. The Story that
manages to acquire the highest number of votes will be judged the
winner of the scenario.

Time Limit: -

Reward: Giant Story related to the 'Journey to the West', goodwill from
the Nebula <Emperor>, 3,000,000 Coins, ???
  Failure: -

  The copyright to the reconstituted Stories will be shared between the
  Nebula <Emperor> and the participants.

  Depending on the judges' votes, you may acquire either a 'legendary'or
  "historical'-grade story.

     * A participant may only take on one role. (Excluding extras)

     * Additional Coins will be rewarded according to the rankings.

     * Additional Coins will be rewarded according to the rankings.



Indeed, <Emperor>'s scale was on another realm altogether.

Putting up a scenario where you were supposed to dramatise their Giant
Story…

If this explanation was correct, then even if one failed to clear the scenario,
simply participating in it would let you acquire either a legendary or
historical-grade Story.

Strangely, though, the kkoma dumpling Yoo Joonghyuk spoke in a
confused voice as if he couldn't understand something.

– Remake the Journey to the West??

"…Ah. You didn't come here during your turn, did you? But, the turns
before yours should've come here before."

– It's not as if I retain all the memories of my past regressions.
"Well, it's as the explanation says. If I were to summarise it, then the
participants are supposed to pick a role from the Journey to the West and
act out the story itself."

– In that case, wouldn't everyone try to pick the role with the
mostimportance?

"You're right. That's why we have that thing called the 'Story chambers'."

– Story chambers?

Rather than a verbal answer, I simply pointed to the advertisement boards
the Constellations had put up here and there.

[Looking for anyone willing to open a Story chamber with us!]

[All the roles are still available, with the exception of Sun Wukong, Tang
Sanzang, Sha Wujing, or Zhu Bajie! We even have a scenario writer ready!
Let us create a truly enjoyable Story together!]

The Story chamber. Every participant was forced to create one before being
allowed to enter the scenario.

– I see. You're supposed to form a team like that and compete against
oneanother.

"That's right. Only by doing so will you ensure the diversity of the Story."

– Diversity?

"In the end, the real goal of this event is to enhance the impact of 'Journey
to the West'. By increasing the number of varied and entertaining versions
of the 'Journey' in circulation, the strength of the original will grow even
greater, and that would, in turn, serve to advertise the position of
<Emperor>, too."
– You're surprisingly smarter than you look. I thought you were a fool.

I grinned sheepishly.

To be honest, what I uttered just now was nothing more than me quoting
what Yoo Joonghyuk from the 1287th turn had said.

That's when we got to hear the complaints coming from ancient-looking
Constellations.

[I simply can't fathom what <Emperor> is thinking lately. Is this what they
mean by the water in the rear of the Yangtze washing away those in the
front? Huh…]

[Even if they are trying to go along with the changing times… Isn't this
tantamount to insulting the original work?]

It kind of made sense for the ancient Constellations to think like that. But,
what could anyone do about the ever-changing taste of the times?

In all honesty, most of the Constellations had already adopted to the
alreadychanged times, anyway.

[Currently, 5412 'chambers' are remaking the Journey to the West.]

…There were already 5412 of them??

Only then did it really hit home that an incredible number of Constellations
and Incarnations had rushed over to this particular 'Giant Story'. But then
again, many Constellations must've been feeling the heat after the Final
Scenario had opened up. The Giant Story related to the 'Journey to the
West' could very well prove to be their golden ticket, after all.

"So, the problem here is that I can't enter the scenario alone…"
Meaning, I'd have to create 'Story chamber' like other Constellations and
join the scenario. I took a look around my vicinity and spotted an
occasional few that had newly opened up their chambers and were
recruiting members to fill their quotas.

[Recruiting a Constellation willing to play the 'Hong Hai Er' (The Red
Boy). An Incarnation of a Narrative-grade Constellation is also OK.]

[Recruiting the 'Golden Horned King'. Accepting only Historical-grade or
higher.]

Those indicated that the casting for the main characters had been filled
already.

As I expected, chambers recruiting villains far outnumbered those looking
for the main characters. It was all because of the distribution of the Giant
Story's shares when they did acquire it later.

Well, you'd get a greater share by playing a main character, rather than a
villain, so it couldn't really be helped.

[Recruiting the actor for the 'Yellow Robe Demon'. Coin split is 7 to 3. No
Story shares. We don't care about your Status.]

By the way, it might be just my gut talking here, but this…

[Recruiting an extra for multiple roles. We don't judge your Status. No
Story shares. Every appearance is a guaranteed 1000 Coins.]

[Oiii, hyung-ssi over there! Come this side! We'll treat you right!]

…I looked everywhere, but it felt as if there were only con men around this
place.

I was hoping against hoping, but well, I failed to spot any familiar
Constellations, either. Maybe that was an obvious result, seeing that famous
Constellations would've already joined Story chambers by now…

For the time being, I approached the panel and decided to look at the list of
'Story chambers' first.

The list was automatically organised by the rankings. Surprisingly, the
highest-ranked chamber belonged to someone even I knew of.


  [The Real Journey to the West ]

  – Current number of votes: 8651

  – Introduction: The previously-unknown secrets of the authentic
  Journey to the West will be revealed.

  – There are no more open spots available.

  – [Cider] [Regression], [System]…

  – Current ranking: First


If my memory served me correctly, then this Story chamber should belong
to the Nebula <Emperor>'s 'Fei Hu'.

Out of many regression turns, this Fei Hu's Story was always picked as
the winning one for the current 'Giant Story' scenario. It was to such an
extent that even before the competition was over, the saying "Victory
already belongs to Fei Hu anyway" routinely made rounds… – Hurry up
and decide already.

"Just hold on."

I might look like this, but this great I possessed over ten years' worth of
experience as the reader of genre novels.
Just by looking at the titles, I… No, well, I only had to read the
introductions to easily figure out what kind of Stories we might get here.

I reorganised the list by 'Newest' and began scrolling through the Story
chambers.

"Right now, it's a bit of a trend to change the protagonist."

– Change the protagonist? How?

"For instance, the majority of people think that the MC of the Journey to
the West is Sun Wukong, right? But when you actually get down to it…
Ohh, it really appeared."


  [I've reincarnated as the last disciple in the Journey to the West?!]

  – Current number of votes: 3313

  – Introduction: Just for how long will Sun Wukong remain as the hero?
  It's time for Pigsy to show his stuff!

  – Recruiting extras at all times.

  – [Reincarnation], [Possession], [Healing]…

  – Current ranking: Eighth


– It's already underway.

"Dammit."

I scrolled down once more. Not too long afterwards, I discovered a couple
more excellent-sounding chambers.
[Disciples that I managed to rear]

– Current number of votes: 3310

– Introduction: Here comes Tang Sanzang, after training the strongest
disciples!

– [Possession], [Rearing], [Healing]…

– Current ranking: Ninth

[The Journey's Extra]

– Current number of votes: 3221

– Introduction: I've somehow ended up inside the Journey to the West.
But I… seemed to have become Tang Sanzang's horse.

– [Extra], [System], [Animal]…

– Current ranking: Eleventh



…Dammit, all the Story chambers with potential for great popularity were
already full.

– You've been dilly-dallying too long and now, it seems you're already
done for.

I didn't want to acknowledge it, but he might be right on this one.

Many high-ranked chambers had finished casting their main characters and
not only that, their Stories were already well underway, making a bit hard
for me to butt in now.
I couldn't help but wonder whether I should just apply to become an extra
or not, but then, I'd not be able to acquire what I want through a role with
such little importance.

[The 4th Story chamber list will close soon!]

[After closing, it'll become impossible to register additional roles with the
exception of extras!]

It was literally one thing after another. Now, the chamber closing time was
approaching, too. I had to make a decision here.

How long passed by like that?

Out of all the classifieds that I scrolled through in a hurry, I ended up
spotting something rather suspicious.

– (Urgently recruiting) Searching for a Sun Wukong who will ride on
thebus. All the other roles have been cast already. Just show up and you're
hired.

…Still recruiting Sun Wukong, was it?

Hang on. Not just any other role, but the 'Sun Wukong'?

[I've become the retired SSSSS-grade Son Wukong!!]

Haven't I seen that many 'S' letters somewhere before?

Even though I knew I was being taken for a ride here, I still tapped on the
info tab of this chamber.

And that's when I saw its introduction.

– Introduction: Only I know the end of the Journey to the West.
[1] Yogoe is a Korean supernatural entity, a type of spirit or ghost. [2]
Korean use of [Cider] as a story tag refers to something refreshing or
gratifying.
             Chapter 426: Ep. 80 - Our greatest ally, IV


Only I know the end of the Journey to the West?

Where have I heard of that introduction before?

I decided to enter and confirm the situation of this chamber first.

['Player 8' -nim has entered the 6731st Story chamber's waiting area.]

Thankfully, it seemed that their Story hadn't started yet. But then again,
they shouldn't be able to start without the role for Sun Wukong filled up, so
there was that, too.

After I entered the chamber, the surroundings changed and a large round
desk suddenly materialised.

Square chat windows were floating above the desk's chairs, rather than
actual people. They signified the participants playing the other roles.
[Player 1 has currently selected the role of 'Zhu Bajie'.]

[Player 2 has currently selected the role of 'Sha Wujing'.]

[Player 6 has currently selected the role of 'Tang Sanzang's White Horse'.]

The faces of the players were all obscured by question marks. It seemed
that this was done in order to protect the personal information of the actual
players.

Okay, but never mind that for now… There were so many players here, yet
no one had selected the role of 'Sun Wukong' yet?

– Player 8: Hello, everyone.

Maybe they had all logged off or something, because no one bothered to
write a message in the chat room even after I made an appearance. But
then…

– Scenario Master: sup?

– Scenario Master: Which role you wanna?

I quickly inputted my reply in the chatroom in the middle.

– Player 8: Is the role for Sun Wukong still vacant?

– Scenario Master: yup vacant.

– Player 8: That's so strange.

– Scenario Master: Had someone we want, but got delayed… Wanna do
SunWukong?

This guy, he seems to have a habit of not typing proper sentences.
Just as I was getting worried about if it'd be okay to have someone like this
guy as the scenario's master, a message popped up with a suspiciously good
timing as if its sender had read my mind.

– Scenario Master: me know that genre inside out. No worries 'bout
scenario'qual'.

Yup, it was just so hard to trust anyone with that type of grammar. Still, I
decided to test a couple of things out anyway.

– Player 8: I'd like ask you about the chamber's title. That [I've become
theretired SSSSS-grade Sun Wukong].

– Scenario Master: yup me responsible.

 – Player 8: Why are there five 'S' letters?

 – Scenario Master: need that many to attract aggro.

…Hmm, maybe he does know something after all?

It got on my nerves a bit that he didn't bother to use any polite speech,
though.

I continued on with my questioning.

– Player 8: Sun Wukong really is the protagonist, yes?

– Scenario Master: yup yup yup

– Player 8: Wouldn't the audience feel fed up with leaving the
originalwork's MC as is? I thought it was a trend for the side characters or
extras to become protagonist lately.

I thought I had accurately picked on his weak spot, but the master's
response was surprisingly calm.
– Scenario Master: Oh, looks like you did some market research.

– Player 8: It was a mere simple browse-through.

– Scenario Master: True about nim's words regarding extra-turned-
herostories doing good business. But, Sun Wukong has to be MC if we
wanna be numero uno. Think from POV of a judge.

– Player 8: Hmm…

– Scenario Master: important bit not who's MC and whatnot, but how
much'unfamiliar character' he is. And too many extra-turned-hero stories
out there.

…Would you look at this guy?

At a glance, he might seem to be yapping on whatever came up into his
mind, but well, what he said just now was not wrong.

More often than not, the ones to take the top spot at times like this would be
stories featuring the traditional heroes.

For instance, Fei Hu's [The Real Journey to the West] featured Sun
Wukong as its main protagonist.

– Player 8: Is that why you went with 'retired Sun Wukong'?

– Scenario Master: yup yup

– Player 8: What will the retired Sun Wukong be doing?

– Scenario Master: nothing.

– Player 8:??

– Scenario Master: ah, it's a spoiler so no talking. So, you in or not?
I was in a dilemma.

– Scenario Master: If you're not, hurry and leave. We don't have much time.
No answer in next 5 sec, and I eject you.

I was kind of curious about how would a retired Sun Wukong work as a
protagonist, too…

[The 4th Story chamber list will close in five minutes!]

I'd be cutting it too fine if I were to search for another chamber now.

Dammit, I don't have a choice here.

Regardless of what kind of scenario it was, as long as I do my best, it'd be
fine, right?

– Player 8: I'm in.

– Scenario Master: Hmm. Then my turn to ask questions

– Player 8: Regarding?

[Scenario Master wishes to confirm your details.]

[Please select the information you wish to reveal.]

He wants to view my information?

– Player 8: Is it really necessary?

– Scenario Master: Just wanna know your name.

…My name, was it?

I decided to reveal some of my info.
[Player 8-nim is a 'Constellation'.]

[Player 8-nim's Modifier is the 'Watcher of Light and Darkness'.]

[The applicable information is made available only to the 'Scenario

Master'.] The Scenario Master didn't respond for a while.

Heh, he must've been shocked by what he saw.

– Scenario Master: Ehng? You were a Constellation-nim? But, why here in
a low-rent chamber?

I replied quickly.

– Player 8: I may come across that way, but I know how to fight a bit.
Idearly wish to become the retired Sun Wukong!

– Scenario Master: Something smells fishy, tho?

– Player 8: The real fun is in raising an unpopular Story from ground-
up,wouldn't you agree?

– Scenario Master: BTW, what's up with the dumpling?

…Dumpling?

[You're currently accompanied by your pet 'Murim dumpling'.]

Dammit, I forgot that this guy was here with me.

– Scenario Master: But, we ain't got no roles for pets, tho?

– Player 8: It's just a dumpling. It's not even strictly a pet per se.

– Scenario Master: Hmm, it's a bit awkward, innit. Your opinions, pls?
Surprisingly enough, the Scenario Master actually went and asked for the
opinions of other players.

[Player 1-nim says that 'It's fine if it's a Murim dumpling'.]

[Player 4-nim says that 'Master should do whatever takes their fancy'.]

[Player 3-nim says that 'I want to play this game right now'.]

Thankfully, other players didn't object.

–Scenario Master: ok we doing it so might as well ask for Murim-type ppl

– Player 8: Thank you.

– Scenario Master: see ya

A short while later, the countdown began.

5, 4, 3, 2, 1…

[Story chamber, 'I've become the retired SSSSS-grade Sun Wukong' has
begun its storytelling!]

[This Story chamber's plot will follow the one set out by the Scenario
Master.]

[The main plotline of the Story Chamber can be interfered with by the
judges or the audience.]

['The Journey to the West Remake' will commence!]

Bright light dyed my vision ash-grey next.

⸨I've become the retired SSSSS-grade Sun Wukong⸩

Letters appeared in a stylish manner from the darkness.
And so, I had become this story's main character, 'Sun Wukong', and would
participate in this play from now on. Honestly speaking, my heart was
palpitating just a bit.

To think, I'd really become the protagonist of an actual story…

⸢Kim Dok ja cou nting chi ckens alr eady.⸥

Along with [The Fourth Wall]'s voice entering my head, messages floated
up before my eyes.

[Prologue is starting.]

[Prologue will be told through a flashback sequence.]

[During the applicable section, players can only speak the assigned
dialogue.]

[Scenario Master's narration is now commencing.]

Finally, a voice came from beyond the darkness next.

(At the end of the lengthy travel alongside Sanzang's company, Sun
Wukong had eventually arrived in the Western Regions and succeeded in
obtaining the sacred Buddhist texts.) Oh, so it's begun.

The scene actually changed as well, and before I even realized it, my body
had morphed to that of Sun Wukong's. Folks that could be my companions
were around me, but maybe because this was a flashback sequence, their
faces were blurred out. And my lips began moving all on their own.

"Finally, retirement, is it… It sure was a long itinerary."

At the same time, Sun Wukong's memories fleeted past my eyes.
Getting chased away by Tang Sanzang, getting stabbed in the back by Zhu
Bajie, and even abandoned by Sha Wujing. Memories of dragging around a
ragtag bunch of utterly useless morons as his companions, fighting against
countless Yogoe creatures until I became a bloody mess…

Now that I saw those things, it did seem somewhat saddening and bitter.
So, this was how the Journey to the West looked like from Sun Wukong's
perspective, then.

But it was then when I heard a strange voice.

[Are you planning to end it like this?]

I looked down to find the scared texts suddenly talking to me.

[Are you really satisfied by this sort of a story?]

I was somewhat impressed by this. So, our story's plot would start in this
manner, now was it?

Words continued to rise above the sacred Buddhist texts.

[Do you not resent the unfairness of it? You've experienced expulsion by
Sanzang because of illogical reasons and had to suffer oppression many
times over.]

[Was that all? You've been tortured by the Constrictive Headband because
of crimes you were not guilty of.]

[Nothing more than the reason of walking on the path of Buddhism, you
had to protect Tang Sanzang and stick to a gruelling itinerary, even though
you'd have arrived in your destination in the blink of an eye by riding on
your Somersault Cloud.]

For sure, the Journey to the West did have cruel aspects when it came to
treating Sun Wukong.
[And the result of such an arduous journey is for you to ascend to
'Paradise'? Are you not truly incensed by this conclusion?]

Now that I heard it, this did sound like a great injustice somehow.

[You can restart from the beginning.]

"…Restart from the beginning?"

[You can start this journey from the beginning once more.]

It was around then when I got this ominous chill creep down my backside.

Goddammit, this was a regression story?

My lips began moving all on their own again. "What the hell? I got here
after going through so much rubbish, yet you want me to go through that
crap again from the beginning?"

[No, you won't suffer this time.]

"What?"

[Exploit your companions to the fullest, and become an existence that does
not save anyone. Indeed, you shall become a 'Demon King' that only lives
for himself.]

Right then, blinding rays of light exploded out from the sacred texts.

[Flashback sequence has concluded.]

[The play will begin in earnest!]

It seemed that the story up until here was all a part of the prologue. Which
meant that the real episode would start from now. As if it was waiting for
this moment, the words 'Episode 1' floated up to the view.
And I grandly freaked out next.

~Episode 1. The Demon King of Salvation~

…Wha??

As if it had read my mind, the narration started again.

(It was not a well-known tale, but once upon a time, Sun Wukong used to
be called the 'Demon King of Salvation'.)

I wondered what kind of dogshit crap this was, but for the time being,
decided to hear it out till the end.

(This small stone monkey had a nasty habit of sacrificing himself to save
other people, and many of those who received his unwanted rescue attempts
ended up with psychological scars.)

(Gods and Buddhas of the heavens all criticised him for it, yet that dumb
rock-for-brains continued to throw his life away to save other people over
and over again.)

N-no, hang on a minute here.

(The heaven's Great Jade Emperor and Buddha felt that they could no
longer accept such actions from Sun Wukong anymore and imprisoned the
Monkey King inside the stone crate under the Marble Mountain.)

(And our story starts from there.)

[Judge, 'King of Stone Monkeys', likes this particular backstory.]

[Portion of judges have awarded points for the plot that mirrors the current
trend.]

[2 points have been awarded.]
My attention was drawn to the 'mirroring the current trend' message. Ahh,
so could this be the reason?

[First episode has begun.]

[Unrestricted speech section has begun.]

[Do your best to create an interesting and enjoyable Story by acting
according to your role.]

I shuddered greatly and regained my wits. Chills crept up from various
parts of my body, and my back hurt like crazy as well. I heard the noises of
pitchblack soil fall around me. My current situation was that only my head
was peeking out from beneath the mountain.

[Currently, you're sealed under the Five Elements Mountain.]

Well, it seemed that I was currently being squashed flat by the Five
Elements Mountain.

[Audiences are curious about what your reaction will be.]

(Scenario Master is urging you to say something fitting your role.)

This was the very first scene after the MC had just finished regressing.

Since I saw this situation appearing frequently in genre novels, I figured
that I'd be rather familiar with what to say here, but after finding myself in
those characters' shoes, I couldn't even imagine what to say anymore.

Still, I decided to say something regardless.

"Where am I? Wasn't I returning with the sacred texts just now?"

Obviously, no normal, sane-minded person would be talking to himself like
this.
"…Five Elements Mountain?! Holy cow, did I really regress?"

So, I couldn't help but get shocked at myself capable of muttering out such
lines with ease.

[Audiences now understand your current situation.]

(Scenario Master is nodding their head in approval of your instincts for
dialogue.)

(Scenario Master has acknowledged you.)

Goddammit. I wanted to hide in a hole so bad right now.

[Portion of the audience is waiting in anticipation for the next scene.]

I recalled the Journey to the West's plot points.

According to the original, Sun Wukong was supposed to wait for 500 years
below the Five Element Mountain. And so, five minutes passed by, then ten
after that.

…E-eiii, there's no way, right?

(Sun Wukong's ears perked up after hearing noisy voices coming from
afar.)

I breathed a sigh of relief. Now according to the original, the first person
Sun Wukong met was Tang Sanzang.

(As he looked at the familiar people approaching him, Sun Wukong began
reminiscing about the ancient past.)

Two children were walking closer to my location. Two kids that wore
cutelooking Buddhist robes and sporting toy-like crowns on their heads.

(The memories of that day, when he first met Tang Sanzang.)
(Sun Wukong was lost within the rose-tinted reminiscence.)

Chills slowly crept down my back now.

That faintest sense of deja vu I felt earlier was now gradually becoming
reality. [The Fourth Wall], buzzing noisily, then asked me.

⸢Y ou re ally d idn't kn ow?⸥

I couldn't answer back.

That suspicion I had when I saw those five 'S' letters; even though I
believed it couldn't be possible, a part of my heart still hoped against hope.

I gritted my teeth and did my best to hold onto my consciousness trying to
slip away.

"Ah, he's over there. I think it's that ahjussi."

"Let me go ask him."

They were perhaps the world's smallest pair of 'Sanzang'.

Lee Gilyoung grabbed my head to lift it up and asked me next.

"You bastard, are you the 'Demon King of Salvation', Sun Wukong?"
             Chapter 427: Ep. 80 - Our greatest ally, V


Not knowing whether to laugh or cry, all I could do was to look at the kids
and reply. "I am."

And then, I heard the warning message next.

[Warning! You have come in contact with some of <Kim Dokja's
Company>'s members!]

[Chaos residing somewhere deep inside you have begun wiggling.]




[Judge, 'King of Stone Monkeys', has revealed his displeasure!]

[The contest this time doesn't have anything interesting to watch.]
A young monkey covered entirely in a coat of rather beautiful golden fur
roughly scratched his mane and, while looking at the screens displayed on
holographic panels, yawned over and over again.

Another monkey wearing a cowboy get-up watched that from the sidelines
before making a retort.

[Judge, 'Manager of Heaven's Stables', is chastising the 'King of Stone
Monkeys'.]

[Meihouwang (Handsome Monkey King), you truly are an impatient one. If
you took your time perusing, then you'd have found one or two interesting
stories by now.]

[Hng, Bimawen (Keeper of Heavenly Horses), so was it your lofty patience
that allowed you to clean up horse shit for over two weeks straight?]

[…I'd like to talk about only the refined matters in this place, if we could.]

[I can already tell what you're going to do with my eyes closed. I mean,
you'll just slap high scores to any story that doesn't feature stables in it,
anyway.]

[But, don't you also lose your mind in excitement whenever a story features
Mountain of Flowers and Fruit?]

[Oiii, Great Sage! What do you think? Have you found something
interesting to watch yet?]

That question was directed to a certain pure-blonde haired man yawning
loudly with his chin supported by the Ruyi Bang. He lazily opened his lips.
[This year doesn't seem to have anything fresh, that's for sure.]

[Thought so.]
[We had quite a few people running around with wild imaginations in the
past, hadn't we? Like, how we were portrayed as members of a battle-
maniac species that grew stronger by overcoming deadly hurdles…]

[Hmm, yeah. That was really fun back in the day. But I didn't like the way
they portrayed us as humans.]

Bimawen's words elicited a smirk from the Great Sage. [Oi, looky here.
You guys might be monkeys, but I'm almost human, you know?]

[…But you changed only because of that Story's influence, didn't you?]

Meihouwang, Bimawen, and the Great Sage.

They were different Story Bodies of the one that enjoyed the true name of
'Sun Wukong'. At first, they were all one being, but after each of the Stories
developed separately, the various personalities split apart from one another
as well.

[This kid, Fei Hu's rate of growth is no joke… At this rate, we might have
ourselves a brand new 'Sun Wukong'.]

[Yeaaah, sure. Something that hasn't happened in the last few thousand
years will suddenly happen now. Sure thing.]

Three separate Sun Wukongs had gathered inside this large judge's office to
take a gander at the various Stories of the 'Journey to the West Remake'
being played out on the holographic panels. Some of them were boring,
while a few seemed to be promising enough. They even pressed the 'Like'
button on a couple of unfamiliar but interesting ones, too. They also didn't
forget to assign scores as the three of them constantly bickered among
themselves.

Meihouwang asked. [Hey, Great Sage. I forgot to ask you. What happened
to those guys the last time?]
[Which guys?]

[You know, back when you asked us for help so Bimawen and I lent you
our powers.]

[Ahh, you mean the 'Great War of Saints and Demons'? It worked out
alright. But their representative went missing.]

That prompted a retort from Bimawen. [Are you talking about that fool
whom you kept chasing after but never chose you as his sponsor?] […Hey,
I never chased him around, got that? I only responded once or twice at his
ardent pleas, that's all.]

[Oh, but for that once or twice, I remember you willingly sacrificing some
of your scant hair, though?]

[Shut up.] The Great Sage roughly dug his ear with the Ruyi Bang and
changed the topic. [By the way, why hasn't Douzhanshengfo (Victorious
Fighting Buddha) arrived yet? All the Sun Wukongs have gathered in one
place, so how come he's missing from this occasion?]

[You know that nerd's always late.]

[What about Bajie and Wujing?]

[They went to speak to the Heavenly Palace people.]

[…That Jade Emperor dude, is he thinking of butting in during the judging
again?]

[As long as our opinions don't clash, it doesn't matter if that side wishes to
interfere.]

[But, our opinions have never matched before, so there's our problem.]
As if they were waiting for this very moment, the door to the judge's office
was pushed open, and Zhu Bajie and Sha Wujing made their entrance.

[Excuse me, hyung-nims. The higher-ups say that it's about time we
announce this year's best candidates…]

[Shut it. Can't you see we're still busy?]

Both Zhu Bajie and Sha Wujing flinched from Meihouwang's threatening
voice and took hurried steps back.

The Great Sage asked them. [By the way, who's the lady behind you?]

[Ah, apologies for the late introduction. She's this year's new judge. I heard
that she's also Sakyamuni's successor.]

[…Sakyamuni had a successor?]

Someone entered the office in a calm, composed gait.

However, the moment the Great Sage saw the woman wearing a fine,
elegant Buddhist robe and a slender crown, his eyes trembled from shock.

Bimawen sensed that and asked him. [Someone you know?]

The Great Sage didn't reply and simply stared at her face for a while. The
woman didn't reciprocate that gaze, instead choosing to cross the table and
head towards the panel displaying the Stories.

Bimawen used his chin to point and speak. [This is actually good news. It
might not be a bad idea to hear the newbie's opinion. Hey, Miss
Sakyamuni's successor, which Story takes your fancy?]

The woman's robe, busy swaying about, came to a stop in a certain spot.
Sakyamuni's successor stared at a certain story with a pair of still eyes. Her
hand slowly reached out and touched the display, causing ripples to spread
out like the emotions of longing itself.

[I seem to like this Story the most.]




⸢Y ou kn ew al re ady Kim Dok ja.⸥

[The Fourth Wall] was right. In a way, you could say that I knew something
like this would happen. I kind of suspected that the folks in this Story
chamber might be the <Kim Dokja's Company>'s members.

[The agreement with the Wenny King is in danger!]

And also, I thought that it'd give rise to such a result, too. Even then, I
couldn't not make this choice.

– You've been warned not to get in contact with them.

[999] sitting on my shoulder whispered to me. Just by meeting the kids, a
change was already taking place within my Incarnation body.

[The transformation to the Outer God is accelerating due to the risk to the
agreement condition.]

'I haven't gone against the agreement itself. Technically speaking, the
content of the deal was to [never reveal my identity to Kim Dokja's
Company], wasn't it?'

– The moment they find out, everything will be over.

'I know that already, so stop worrying'.
[Outer God transformation progress percentage: 3%]

Most likely, I'd end up as an Outer God like the 'Secretive Plotter' when that
percentage maxes out. I was thinking that honestly, it shouldn't matter as
long as I fulfil our agreement before that. For now, I was happy to see the
kids walking in front of me in such great harmony.

[A small number of audience members complain that Sanzang can't be two
people.]

While listening to the messages streaming in, I continued to walk behind
the kids leading in the front. I heard that children grow remarkably fast
every day; that statement really hit home, after realizing that they indeed
had grown so much taller already.

Now that I thought about it, it sure had been a while since I spent some time
with them like this.

I had no idea what either Lee Gilyoung or Shin Yoosung were thinking
about most of the time. It was what the Scenario Master had said. I 'saved'
them on my whim, and abandoned them behind with no thoughts of taking
any responsibility.

Just like how it was like for me in the past, these two kids had been left
alone and neglected by me.

"Oii, Demon King of Salvation."

"Yes?"

…So, this was more or less the punishment that I deserve.

Shin Yoosung watching on from the side spoke up. "You shouldn't be so
rude to someone you don't know."

"But, Sooyoung noona said I should act like this, you know?"
"Even then, you should still stick to basic etiquette."

As expected of my Incarnation.

She studied me with pitying eyes, before whispering to Lee Gilyoung via
[Nebula Chat]. Of course, since I was also a member of the same Nebula, I
could hear her words just fine.

– This way, he'll trust us more, you dummy. What will you do if he decides
to wreak havoc later?

I felt goosebumps break out on my skin.

– …You're actually scared of him? Look at his current state, will ya?

For sure, I didn't buy the [Great Sage, Heaven's Equal Avatar Set] sold by
<Emperor> so my current attire consisted of nothing more than the 500-
year old "standard" ragged clothing.

Shin Yoosung patted the dirt away on my clothes and politely greeted me.
"It's a pleasure to make your acquaintance, Constellation-nim. We'll be in
your care."

"I'll be in yours as well. Ah, also. How should I call you both?"

Lee Gilyoung replied as if he was waiting for that. "I'm the monk Xuan
(玄). And she's the monk Zang (奘). Call us that from now on."

His voice was full of mischievousness as if he was playing a game.

So, then. Lee Gilyoung was the monk 'Xuan', while Shin Yoosung was the
monk 'Zang', was it? To think, they'd split the name of the monk Xuanzang
and give it to the kids. It was indeed a rather adorable idea.

[A portion of audience members think that the two monks are quite
adorable.]
[Portion of judges find the setting of 'Two Monks' interesting.]

[4 points have been acquired.]

Lee Gilyoung, still drunk on all these new settings, continued to yap about
himself. Meanwhile, Shin Yoosung whispered in my ear. "I'm sure you're a
little bit confused by all these strange set-ups, yes? I'm really sorry. Our
Scenario Master is a bit of an eccentric, so…"

"No, it's fine."

I could guess who the Scenario Master was already. Well, there could ever
be only one person capable of coming up with such an out-there story in
<Kim Dokja's Company>, after all.

"Still, you don't have to worry about anything. We'll definitely look after
you well. All you have to do is to ride the bus well and just quietly follow
us."

Tears almost broke out from my eyes after being subjected to all this
friendly treatment. It would've hardly been enough for me to console the
kids first, yet they were worried about me, instead?

What a shameful thing this was.

(At that moment, Sun Wukong swore to protect Sanzang in this life, as
well.) That's right. I'd definitely protect these kids.

I might not have been able to do my role properly in the past but at least,
from now on I…

"Kugugugugugu!"

Noises of explosions came from somewhere. I reflexively scanned my
vicinity.
"Ku-dudududu!"

It did sound like explosions, sure, but something also felt a bit off about
them. Something must've exploded, but why did it sound as if the noise was
made by someone's mouth??

Shin Yoosung hurriedly approached my side and whispered again. "Please
don't panic. We're simply mirroring the original's setting."

"…Pardon?"

"I heard that in the original story, all onomatopoeia were written in between
quotation marks."

[A portion of the judges are impressed by the unexpected mirroring of the
original work!]

[10 additional points have been acquired!]

What the hell? I thought such a thing was a mistake solely reserved to
massmarket fantasy genre novels…

I wasn't even given enough time to get flustered by the unexpected level of
observation by the Scenario Master on the original work. The kids pushed
me behind them and took large steps forward.

Having a look again, I realized that the so-called explosion noises seemed
to have originated from a large canyon in front of us.

(Sun Wukong stared deeply at the Shepan Mountain's Yingchou Stream
Canyon. Since this was his second stab at life, he knew what would pop out
from that canyon.)

If my memory was right, then the second being the group encountered in
the
Journey to the West was…
(The third son of the Dragon King of West Sea, Jade Dragon.)

…Right, it's him. And he would become…

(He was the existence that would be reborn as Tang Sanzang's White
Dragon Horse.)

Well, since the narration took care of everything, I didn't have much else to
say here.

I stepped forward and spoke up. "Both of you, please hide somewhere. I
shall handle this."

If my memory was working fine, then one of the players took on the role of
the 'Tang Sanzang's White Dragon Horse'. I was pretty sure that he was the
one behind the current event.

Seeing that the kids were participating in this Story chamber, the rest of the
players should also be from <Kim Dokja's Company>, but if someone with
ill intention had somehow butted in here…

"…We told you, you just stay on the bus."

A small but pretty darn strong hand grabbed my shoulder. I looked back to
find Shin Yoosung forming a rather scary smile.

"A guy who can't even afford proper clothes wants to show off? Step back!"

Lee Gilyoung cracked his knuckles and took a step forward, as well.

I tried to urgently chase after the kids, but they had already ran ahead to the
canyon and started fighting a blue-hued Dragon that flew out from there.
"Ku-kwakwakwakwakwa!!"
Lee Gilyoung shouted out the onomatopoeia and rushed forward, and the
blue Dragon jumping out from the canyon also roared out in response. I
immediately recognised who that Dragon was.

…It's the Chimera Dragon??

Kids fought with the blue Dragon as if they were having a dance-off in the
air, and through [Taming], subjugated the creature in no time at all.

[Audience members are impressed by the kid Sanzangs' martial prowess!]

[A small number of audience members are lodging a protest, complaining
that Sanzangs are too powerful.]

[A portion of judges are surprised by this unexpected turn of events!]

And a short while later.

['Player 6' -nim has joined the group.]

The Chimera Dragon was transformed into Xuanzang's white horse, and
was dragged over here by the two children.

While trying to understand this situation, which was resolved without me
needing to do anything, I recalled the conversation I had with the Scenario
Master earlier.

– What will the retired Sun Wukong be doing?

– Nothing.

Only now did I understand just a little bit. This story seemed to be created
for this from the word go. And right in the next instant, a message from a
familiar Constellation landed in my ear.
[Judge, 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband', finds the current Story's plot
quite interesting.]

[10 additional points have been acquired.]




A day passed by like that, then another day went by. I was gradually
waking up to the 'identity' of this Story chamber.

"It's a grasshopper. Eat."

"Demon King of Salvation-nim. Do your legs hurt?"

⸢This Story is 'one for Sun Wukong's benefit'.⸥

(Sun Wukong was really comfortable.)

This would be my first time to be all relaxed and leisurely ever since the
scenarios began. My brain had almost seized up after it got submerged in
the sea of comfort for too long.

[New Story is germinating in you!]

[Story, 'Sneezing Without Hands', has begun its storytelling.]

I could just about make a guess as to why Han Sooyoung came up with a
scenario like this one.

[Judge, 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband', likes this plot development very
much.]

The Journey to the West was a story built around Sun Wukong's sacrifice.
Even the later variations had similar themes, too.
So, what would happen if a 'Story specifically for Sun Wukong' made its
appearance?

[Judge, 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband', is envious of you.]

[Judge, 'Manager of Heaven's Stables', is envious of you.]

[Score: 312]

It seemed that Han Sooyoung's claim of being a popular author was true.
The Story's total votes had already surpassed 300 and we were enjoying
smooth sailing so far.

And well, such a plot wasn't necessarily bad for my companions, either.

Nominally, the MC of the story was Sun Wukong, but as every battle was
handled by my companions instead, all the shares of the Story at the end of
the scenario would naturally belong to <Kim Dokja's Company> alone.
What a well-thought-out scheme this was – get a nice score tally, and also
ensure you'd walk away with Story shares, too.

"Argh, I wanna play some games on my phone."

"But you played so much before coming here."

Even though the kids adorably bickered with each other, they didn't forget
to feed me, helped me fall asleep, and hell, even groomed the fur on my
head, too.

Lee Gilyoung asked me with a pout. "So, like, what do you do originally?"

"It's bad manners to ask about his private life, you dummy."

Shin Yoosung pulling out premature grey hair on my head tackled the boy
immediately.
I was slightly worried whether such a meta conversation was allowed or
not, but for the time being, I decided to answer him. I thought about it and
realized that I hadn't had a chat like this with the kids up until now.

"I just enjoy reading novels."

"Novels? Ohhh, I like reading them, too."

Lee Gilyoung liked reading novels? Really? That was an unexpected piece
of info.

He was now really amped up as he continued on. "Can I recommend you a
novel?"

He dared to make a recommendation to me, a veteran of over ten years in
reading genre novels? Fine, let's hear him, then.

"It's [SSSSS-grade Infinite Regressor]. It's a super-duper awesome novel,
so make sure to read it later, okay?"

Before I noticed it, my second ego jumped out to the fore. "But, as I
understand, that novel was a resounding failure."

"Failure? I heard it was really popular, though? I guess you don't have a
discerning eye~."

Han Sooyoung, that moron. Did she boast her novel to these young, gullible
kids?

Shin Yoosung listening on quickly joined in, as well. "I also really like
reading novels!"

"Oh, really? May I ask what kind of novels?"

I kind of was looking forward to her answer. Indeed, if it was Yoosung-ie…
"Yes, you may! Raymond Carver, Murakami Haruki…!"

…Now that was a line-up of authors I had heard of before.

I was able to figure out who was in charge of the children's education
during my absence.

Yoo Sangah-ssi. She should have reincarnated safely by now.

Shin Yoosung looked at the dumpling on my shoulder and asked me a
question. "By the way, you must really like Murim dumplings?"

"Yes, I do."

"…An ahjussi I know also really likes them, too."

I knew well who she was talking about there.

Lee Gilyoung rubbed his stomach and muttered to himself. "Aah, I wish I
could eat some dumplings right about now."

I thought I could sense the 'Murim dumpling' on my shoulder suddenly
flinch a little. Indeed, it had been way too long since I had a proper meal.

(But suddenly, the aroma of dumplings began wafting out from
somewhere.)

The majority of events taking place within the Journey to the West all
began with 'suddenly', just like this.

We exchanged glances and tracked down the origin of that fantastic smell.

And so, who long did we walk on the mountain trail? A huge factory now
stood before us.

"…Can a thing like that even exist in this era?"
Just as I began wondering if Han Sooyoung's version of the Journey was set
in the steampunk universe, several humanoids began running outside the
factory and headed this way.

"Euh, euh! Everyone, run away!"

However, the escapees were caught by some kind of an invisible force and
were dragged back to the factory.

"Nooooo!"

Wondering what on earth was going on here, we quickly sneaked our way
inside the factory.

Not too long afterwards, we got to witness the spectacle of thousands of
slaves busy kneading and manufacturing something while sticking very
close to the moving conveyor belts.

"Could that be…?"

The dumpling [999] on my shoulder whispered.

– They are making [Murim dumplings].

Thousands upon thousands of Murim dumplings were being carried away
by the conveyor belts to a destination unknown.

I stared at the unending 'river' of dumplings and began wondering about the
person we were about to meet this time.

(There was only one creature in the whole of the Journey to the West that
lusted after food this badly.)

As if he was waiting for us, a man suddenly began speaking to us.
        Chapter 428: Ep. 81 - A dumpling's reminiscence, I


"Hello there! Are you all out-of-towners?"

The one who spoke to us was a man on the wrong side of middle-age.

The well-mannered Shin Yoosung stepped forward first and offered up a
greeting. "We were on our way to the Western Regions to visit Buddha-
nim."

"Hoh, Buddha, is it? Unlike how you look, I see that you are high priests of
Buddhism!"

Lee Gilyoung saw how the middle-aged man was impressed by the
revelation and began standing tall with his hands behind his back while
going "Ahem!"

The older man studied both children with unreadable eyes before finally
shifting his gaze in my direction.
"In that case, the gentleman next to you is… Hiiieeek?!"

His complexion paled instantly as he stared at the [Murim dumpling] on my
shoulder.

"T-that, that's a [Murim dumpling]…!!"

"Ah, this guy's just a doll. I like dumplings, that's why."

"…I-is that so? You really surprised me there."

The middle-aged man patted his chest down, still looking somewhat
freaked out. Judging from the armband slung across his upper arm like that,
he must've been the supervisor of this factory.

Thinking that this was a fortunate turn of events, we decided to ask this
man some questions.

"What is this factory, exactly? Why are you making lots of dumplings like
that?"

"…Could it be that you came here without knowing anything?" The
middleaged man studied us with a troubled look on his face, before carrying
on as a lengthy sigh escaped from his lips. "This is all the fault of that scary
Yogoe."

"A Yogoe, you say?"

"Indeed. Originally, this place wasn't a factory."

According to the middle-aged man, this place used to be a peaceful little
rural village.

But on a certain day, a tall, hulking swine-type Yogoe with jet-black skin
suddenly made his appearance, kidnapped every female in the village,
enslaved all the men, and created this very factory.
"That bastard took my daughter and wife as his concubines and locked us
up in this place! I'm sure you can tell that there's a strange supernatural
power swirling around here and it prevents us slaves from leaving this
factory. Not only that, that Yogoe devours so much, too… We're forced to
make dumplings all day long, but it seems to never be enough."

[The factory's manufacturing system is searching for the 'Supervisor'!]

"D-damn it! I have to get going now."

The middle-aged man hurriedly put on a pair of sanitary gloves and a face
mask before rushing towards the conveyor belts.

Before I could step up and say something, Shin Yoosung reached out
and grabbed the middle-aged man first. "It's unfair for you ahjussis to
perform slave labour like this. Not only that, you said that Yogoe even
kidnapped females of the village too. We can't overlook this." As
expected of my Incarnation.

Sure, we had to do this in order to advance the plot, but still…

"We shall help you. Where can we find that Yogoe?"

"Even if it's you monk-nims, that Yogoe is… Will you really help us?"

"Of course we will."

The middle-aged man kept rolling his eyes around for a bit but eventually
told us the direction where we could find this Yogoe.

"We leave it all up to you! Please, defeat that Yogoe!"

We nodded our heads and walked in the direction pointed out to us.

(The Dumpling Yogoe was waiting at the end of this ⸢Dumpling Road.⸥)
We walked alongside the so-called Dumpling Road, created out of the
conveyor belts.

As if he couldn't hold it any longer, Lee Gilyoung began picking up and
chowing down dumplings every couple of steps. "…Hey, this is really
tasty!"

Of course they were. These were none other than [Murim dumplings], after
all. However, it seemed that the foremost expert on all things [Murim
dumpling] was thinking a bit differently than us.

– The aroma is a little off.

'What?'

– Hand me a dumpling.

While walking behind the two kids, I cautiously picked up a dumpling and
handed it over to, uh, the dumpling on my shoulder. And sure enough,
watching one dumpling eat another one proved to be a rather grotesque
sight.

– The combination of ingredients is wrong. It seems that he has not
masteredthe art of [Murim dumplings].

Murim dumpling number [999] formed a somewhat dissatisfied expression
and began ordering me around out of the blue.

– Take half a spoon of the substance inside the green container and add
thatin.

Since we still had a long way to go anyway, I decided to follow this little
guy's orders and began adding the ingredients inside the dumpling skins.
– You must familiarise yourself with the flames of True Samadhi Fire.
Placethe steamer so that the yellow flames are touching it in the middle and
then, heat it.

This had to be some kind of a dream.

To think, I was learning how to make dumplings from a dumpling while
walking on the Dumpling Road.

And so, how long did I walk on this dreamlike road?

At the end of this 'road', I was rewarded with a packet of appetising [Murim
dumplings].

While looking at [999] nodding his head triumphantly, I began wondering
what the hell I just did here.

"Looks like that's our destination."

I looked in the direction Shin Yoosung was pointing at.

There was a pathway at the end of the conveyor belt leading to large stone
walls and a newly-built residential area. A handful of workers were
delivering the packaged dumplings over there.

It seemed that we had arrived at where the dumplings' consumer was.

We walked closer, prompting the security guard to approach us.

"Who are you people?"

Shin Yoosung grinned brightly and replied. "We are but humble monks on
our way to the west to seek an audience with Buddha-nim and acquire the
sacred texts. We coincidentally stumbled across this place during our
journey. Will it be fine for us to enter?"
"Ah, are you by any chance the 'party of the Tang Dynasty's monks'?"

"That's correct."

I was dumbfounded by that conversation. It had been only a few days since
this journey had begun, so there was no freaking way that the rumours of us
would've arrived here already.

[You've learned of the Story, 'Words Swifter Than Feet'!]

Shin Yoosung whispered in my ear. "I heard that this is how it's like in the
original."

…Ah, so that's how it was?

[A portion of the judges are impressed by the Scenario Master's high level
of research.]

[10 additional points are awarded for the excellent reflection of the original
work!]

To think that they would judge us imitating the improbable timing as seen
in the original as research… How shocking.

The gatekeeper spoke. "My apologies, but our village doesn't permit entry
to any outsiders. I'm sorry that you had to walk this far to get here, but I
implore you to turn ba… Kek?!"

Lee Gilyoung must've found the gatekeeper's explanation long-winded,
because the boy punched the poor man in the belly and knocked him out
flat. As if he was making an excuse, he quickly spoke. "Let's just rush
inside and beat up that dumb Yogoe. Sooyoung noona said that the
audience members like speedy plot development."

Han Sooyoung, that idiot. She seemed to have taught these kids something
reaaaally nice.
[A portion of the audience is satisfied by Tang Sanzang's decision.]

[One additional point has been acquired!]

I looked at Shin Yoosung and Lee Gilyoung and spoke to them. "In that
case, let's go in."

"Nope. Ahjussi, you stay here and relax."

"Excuse me?"

"We told you, Sun Wukong is supposed to ride the bus and that's it."

"But…"

"Hah-ah… I really didn't want to do this but seriously now."

Shin Yoosung held the rosary beads and began reciting something.
"Prajnaparamita-hrdaya-KimDokja. Don't-try-anything-unnecessary-and-
stay-putsutra…"

…Wha?

[Tang Sanzang has recited the 'Constrictive Sutra (緊箍咒)'!]

[Item, 'Constrictive Headband (緊箍兒)' is reacting to it!]

I was immediately overcome with pain akin to my head shattering into
pieces and blacked out on the spot.




…So, that must've been the 'Constrictive Sutra' that I had read about.
By the time I woke up, both Shin Yoosung and Lee Gilyoung had
disappeared into the village. I looked to my side to discover a damn
dumpling staring at me with a mocking leer.

– What will you do now?

'…Go after them, obviously'.

Now normally, it should be fine to let those two kids be. They had become
strong Incarnations that didn't require my help, after all.

However, something felt off to me here.

(If Sun Wukong's gut feeling was right, then it was pretty obvious which
creature they would encounter here.)

I could think of someone when it came to all things Murim
dumplingsrelated. But to think that idiot would use slaves to operate a
factory, and even become a villain that kidnaps women… I couldn't wrap
my head around it.

(It was then, someone discovered Sun Wukong.)

"Kyahk! It's a Yogoe!"

I turned my head to find several women standing over yonder.

(Ladies who saw Sun Wukong's appearance were greatly shocked.)

They pointed to my pointy monkey-like ears peeking out from the golden
hair and began backing away. But then, they spotted the dumpling on my
shoulder and became rather chatty all of a sudden.

"He must like Murim dumplings…"

"…Does that mean he's a good Yogoe?"
I wasn't sure how these ladies got to that illogical-sounding conclusion, but
I figured that, what with things developing like this, I might as well exploit
the situation a bit.

"By any chance, are you the kidnapped villagers?"

My question caused the ladies to stare at each other, evidently confused
about something.

"…Kidnap? We've never been kidnapped, though?"

"But, I heard that a pitch-black-coloured swine-like Yogoe has kidnapped
you all?"

"A swine…? No way… Are you perhaps talking about Zhu Bajie-nim?"

…Zhu Bajie "-nim"??

"Sure, our Bajie-nim's skin is somewhat tan, but it's not to the point of
calling it pitch black…"

"But, he does resemble a swine in some aspect, doesn't he? Like, his thick
biceps, or those tough, strong thighs. But, that's not the same as being a
swine…"

Something was definitely going down the wrong direction here.

With an excellent timing, a huge commotion broke out in the middle of the
village so I quickly ran over there. It was pretty obvious who was behind
that disturbance.

"Stop right there!"

A boy's voice loudly resounded out. I pushed my way past the wall of
women until I came face to face with the village's large plaza, a large litter
in its middle, and the two children standing in front of it.
There was no need to mention that they were Lee Gilyoung and Shin
Yoosung, of course.

The boy stepped forward like a kid general and shouted out. "You're the
Yogoe that kidnapped many of the village's women and constructed a
dumpling factory to satisfy your selfish interests and desires, aren't you!"

[A portion of the audience is singing praises of Tang Sanzang's
adorableness!]

[Judge, 'Successor of Sakyamuni' has added 5 additional points.]

…Right, he was really adorable.

Didn't matter who was inside that litter, there was no way anyone would be
able to fight this kid after hearing… No, hang on, if it was that bastard,
yeah, he might actually.

And like clockwork, an incredible level of Status whipped up into a frenzy
from inside litter currently covered in screens.

"Lower the litter."

A heavy-sounding tone of voice came out from inside the carrier. It seemed
to contain this surprising power to change the mood of the surrounding
atmosphere with just a single word.

I swallowed my saliva and walked up to the kids.

"…We told you to stay back because it might get dangerous!"

"Leaving me behind like that is actually even more dangerous."

Soon, the screen of the litter slowly rose up, and the problematic Yogoe
finally made its appearance.
(Sun Wukong knew who that was.)

(Marshal Canopy/天蓬元帥, Zhu Bajie.)

Shin Yoosung's jaw dropped in dumbfoundedness. "That's… the Pigsy?"

(Sun Wukong thought that something was definitely wrong here.)

(Because what he saw was not the 'Zhu Bajie' he remembered.)

For a moment there, I had this feeling that this world's balance of beauty
had tilted to one side. A nonsensical amount of cheering erupted out all
around us next.

"Oh, ooooh! Dear Zhu Bajie-nim!"

For sure, calling a face like that 'Yogoe' didn't seem all that out of place.
Because well, it was inconceivable that a normal human would be blessed
with such looks, after all.

Eyebrows seemingly drawn by a single, uninterrupted stroke of a famed
artist's brush; a nose and a chin shaped in perfect angles that defied attempts
to measure them through mere devices of men; a pair of deep eyes
seemingly carved out of a beautiful jewel containing all the misfortunes
found in this world.

If someone saw those features and not get immediately drawn in by them,
then there must be something wrong with that person.

And sure enough, the villagers, regardless of gender or age, were pouring
out their praises towards this 'Zhu Bajie'.

"Zhu Bajie-nim, hooray!"

"The creator of [Murim dumplings], hooray!"
The so-called 'Pigsy', half of his black-coloured vest unbuttoned and
wearing a pair of black jeans, climbed down from the litter.

"Finally, the day we decide the victor has arrived! You sooty bastard!"

Lee Gilyoung triumphantly roared out as if he was expecting this. He began
swinging his small fists around as if he was playing 'Jwibulnori' and dashed
towards Zhu Bajie. Of course, there was no way such a thing was going to
work.

"Let me go! You pig!!"

Zhu Bajie easily picked the boy up by the scruff of his neck, glanced at
Shin Yoosung briefly, and strode over to where we were.

"…You bastard must be Sun Wukong."
       Chapter 429: Ep. 81 - A dumpling's reminiscence, II


Right, I had a feeling that he'd be 'Zhu Bajie' from the beginning.
However… Just in which aspect was he anywhere remotely 'Pigsy'?

[A small portion of the audience cannot comprehend the outer appearance
of Zhu Bajie.]

[A small portion of audience members are complaining that this is an insult
to the original work!]

[Judge, 'Meihouwang', argues that this doesn't even make sense!]

It seemed that there were some members of the audience with a similar
train of thought as me. And then, in the next moment…

[The majority of the audience welcome the choice of the current Zhu
Bajie.]

…Huh?
[Number of votes obtained is increasing greatly!]

[Story chamber's ranking has increased greatly!]

…Could it be?

[Judge, 'Cleanser of Altars', is satisfied with his outer appearance.]

Those in the know should already be aware of it – this 'Cleanser of Altars'
was Zhu Bajie's Modifier.

[Judge, 'Cleanser of Altars', is deeply satisfied by the casting of his role.]

[150 additional points have been awarded!]

As Yoo Joonghyuk glared at me with his trademark piercing eyes, large
letters slowly floated up before my eyes.

~ Episode 2. The Supreme King, Zhu Bajie ~




[Congratulations! Your Story chamber's ranking has broken into the top
100.]

Han Sooyoung looked at the message floating up before her eyes and
scrolled to the next page with a wry grin on her face.

The folks inside the panel screen were acting according to the plot she had
cooked up. She pushed up the horn-rimmed glasses on her nose that didn't
have any lenses and muttered to herself.

"…These kids' sucky acting might cause me a heart attack at this rate."
Fortunately, though, her Story chamber broke past the 1000 voting points
mark and had entered the upper ranks. There was a knock coming from the
door behind her, and Lee Sookyung stepped into the room.

"I've brought some fruits."

"If you bothered to even knock, you should at least wait for an answer. Or
don't knock at all."

"How is everything going?"

"…About as I expected. That Fei Hu's rank is way too high and it's not as
easy as I thought to catch up."

Lee Sookyung confirmed Han Sooyoung's Story chamber ranking over the
latter's shoulder and spoke. "It's only been a couple of days, but you're
already so high up. Amazing."

"Compared to my heyday, this sort of achievement is nothing, you know.
Besides, we don't know what'll happen next."

Han Sooyoung bit into the apple as she fiercely burned the torch of
determination. She could see the dumbfounded face of Sun Wukong within
the panel screen. "…From here onwards, it'll depend on how well that Sun
Wukong does his job."




"You're right. I'm Sun Wukong."

Yoo Joonghyuk heard my reply and glared at me with questioning eyes.
Right afterwards, his right eye glowed in the golden light.
[The usage of 'appraisal skills' isn't allowed within the applicable scenario
location.]

Due to the worldview's restriction, his [Sage's Eye] didn't activate. Since I
had already expected that to happen, I wasn't even remotely surprised by it.

"Looks like you wanted to shoot lasers from your eye," said I with a
refreshing grin on my face.

Whatever the case might have been, Zhu Bajie was fated to become my
underling, according to the original story.

"Shin Yoosung! What are standing around dazed for?! Quickly defeat this
guy!!"

Lee Gilyoung, still dangling in the air, began to thrash about frantically.

She glanced at him as if it was none of her business, and asked Zhu Bajie,
instead. "Even if you like dumplings that much, how could you build a
factory and use people like slaves? And why did you kidnap women in the
first place?"

While listening to her yell, I studied our surroundings.

⸢Zhu Bajie was a demon king of lust and gluttony in the original 'Journey to
the West'.⸥
If you thought about the original's storyline, then the episode we were
currently experiencing wasn't a complete impossibility.

However, even if she detested Yoo Joonghyuk, Han Sooyoung wouldn't
have stuck this closely to the original. She even changed the 'Ways of
Survival' to that minute degree, didn't she?
Besides, even if she wrote such a scenario, Yoo Joonghyuk wouldn't have
agreed to…

"I didn't kidnap these women."

His words quickly prompted the surrounding ladies to yell out.

"That's right! We weren't kidnapped at all!"

I studied their expressions. Not one of them looked to be under the
mindcontrol spell.

Meanwhile, Lee Gilyoung yelled out in response. "So what?! Didn't you
enslave people to make lots of dumplings so you can eat them all??" Right,
that's what the slave in the factory told us. However, there was one thing
that I couldn't understand.

Yoo Joonghyuk really liked [Murim dumplings]. It was verging on
obsession, even. But, would someone like him ever touch dumplings
massproduced in a factory?

⸢"I do not eat what others have made."⸥

Yoo Joonghyuk even declared as thus, so it didn't make sense for him to use
slaves just for the purpose of eating mass-produced dumplings.

And as if to prove me right, Yoo Joonghyuk spoke in a slightly sorrowful
tone of voice. "I haven't eaten these [Murim dumplings]."

"What are you talking about?! You dumpling psycho! Shin Yoosung! Do
something already!"

Rather than answering the boy, Yoo Joonghyuk stared past the crowd
around us. Dozens of houses were lined up along the alleyway. The
delivered dumplings were placed before each house's entrance. I could see
the village's young kids flocking around them to happily eat them.
"…Could it be?"

It was at this point that a warning message suddenly appeared over the
whole village.

[A revolt has occurred in the 'Dumpling factory'!]

The village's entrance once guarded by the gatekeeper crumbled and the
factory's slaves rushed in.

"We will no longer labour for you!"

"Dumplings over here, dumplings over there, dumplings freaking
everywhere!!"

"Kill him! Kill that pig bastard!!"

The eyes of the slaves gleamed viciously as they wielded hoes and rakes.

Women were greatly astonished and began shouting out.

"Those Yogoes still haven't learned their lessons!"

"Yogoes?? But, this guy here is the real Yogoe, isn't he?"

Lee Gilyoung shouted out, still oblivious to the situation.

Yoo Joonghyuk put the boy down as his expression hardened. "…Indeed, I
should've killed them from the get-go."

In that moment, I figured out what was going on here.

Currently, I was the 'Sun Wukong', so it'd be possible for me to borrow
some of his powers. I stared at the waves of Yogoes rushing over here and
strengthened my vision.

[Stigma, 'Fiery Golden Eyes Lv. ???' is activating!]
The 'Fiery Golden Eyes'. The Great Sage's unique Stigma that allowed him
to discern Yogoes and demons.

The colour of the world gradually changed, and the appearance of the
humans rushing over here transformed. Twisted figured emerged, their eyes
filled to the brim with murderous intentions. As expected, they were not
human beings.

"Zhu Bajie is not our enemy."

Lee Gilyoung's eyes went extra-round after he heard me. He even looked
disappointed for some reason. "Whaaat? Dang it…"

"Rather than ruling the village, Zhu Bajie has liberated it, instead. It's those
creatures that had been tormenting this village as they are not humans, but
Yogoes that previously ruled this place."

The slave Yogoes finally revealed their true colours and unleashed their
Status to destroy the village. Lee Gilyoung and Shin Yoosung only then
realized what had happened and began directing the crowd.

"Everyone, step behind us!"

…The revolt of the factory's slaves, was it?

This situation was the complete opposite of the [Demon Realm Revolution]
in the past. What we had to do now was not liberation, but suppression.

Yoo Joonghyuk stepped forward first and unsheathed his [Black Heavenly
Demon Sword] from… No, hang on a second??

[A portion of the audience members are puzzled by Zhu Bajie's choice of
weapon.]

[Several judges are curious as to why Zhu Bajie is suddenly using a 'blade'
instead.]
[Judge, 'Cleanser of Altars', is complaining about the whereabouts of his
'Nine-Tooth Spike Rake'!]

According to the original story, Zhu Bajie didn't use a bladed weapon, but a
rake called [Nine-Tooth Spike-Rake].

[Many audience members are overwhelmed by the 'Supreme King Zhu
Bajie's' fighting spirit!]

[A portion of audience members are deeply arrested by the handsome Zhu
Bajie's charms!]

[A portion of judges are accepting the change in weapons that reflect the
current trend.]

[Judge, 'Cleanser of Altars', coughs awkwardly and says that he'll overlook
it this time as it looks cool.]

[5 additional points have been awarded!]

Dammit, were you implying that one's face could even serve as Probability?

Yoo Joonghyuk stepped forward and suddenly brandished the [Black
Heavenly Demon Sword] in my direction, then drew a very tiny circle on
the ground around my feet.

"You do not step beyond this line."

"Eh?"

"Move one step, and I'll kill you."

And then, Yogoes' necks began flying away next.

His sword technique on display was beautiful enough to entrance the
viewers. His swordsmanship had taken yet another major leap forward
when compared to before, making it impossible to imagine just how far he
had to push himself to reach such a realm.

"You're doing okay, Pigsy!"

"Go get them!"

Even before I noticed it, both Lee Gilyoung and Shin Yoosung were
standing next to me and cheering on. We stood there and spectated on Yoo
Joonghyuk soloing the great army of Yogoes.

[Judge, 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband', feels happy about this pleasing
and relaxing progression of the story.]

Only now did I finally understand the deeper meaning of Han Sooyoung
author-nim's firm resolution. Indeed, the story of the retired Sun Wukong
was a pretty good one.

[Judge, 'Cleanser of Altars', is drunk on the coolness of himself.]

[Judge, 'Meihouwang', is slightly dissatisfied by the cool-looking Zhu
Bajie.]

[30 additional points have been acquired.]

It was around this point in time that I heard a rather numinous voice
resounding out from the skies above.

[Wait! Stop your actions!]

The half-dead Yogoes screamed loudly and began prostrating on the
ground. The skies above the village opened up, and a Constellation kitted
out in a Taoist robe made his entrance.

Judging from his attire, I was pretty sure that he was Taishang Laojun (the
Grand Supreme Elderly Lord).
[Oh, Supreme King Zhu Bajie, those Yogoes you have slain are pigs that I
reared back in my palace in Tushita. They escaped after fearing their fate
of being served up on the heaven's dining table, so show them sympathy
and allow me to take the surviving ones away.] Yup, that pattern had
finally shown up.

The entirety of the Journey to the West's plot unfolded in such a fashion.
An event would occur, the culprit would be revealed as a Yogoe, and when
it was about to be vanquished, some weird Taoist dude would suddenly pop
up and say "Actually, that Yogoe is XX that I'd been rearing" before taking
it away with him.

[A portion of judges are awarding extra points for the development that
reflect the original work.]

[30 additional points have been added!]

Of course, there was no way I'd let such a development slide without saying
something, what with my twisted disposition and all. "If you were planning
to take them away anyway, why didn't you come and help the villagers
from the beginning?"

[My apologies. I was somewhat occupied earlier…]

Nope, actually, you couldn't be bothered earlier.


Even in reality, countless Constellations of <Emperor> rarely tried to aid
their Incarnations, just like now, when they had prior knowledge on what
was going on in the scenarios.

"Take them away."

[Thank you.]
Yoo Joonghyuk gave his permission, and Taishang Laojun ascended up to
the sky along with his 'pigs'.

(Once Taishang Laojun took his pigs away, peace finally visited this rural
village.)

A normal story would've come to an end here.

But then, my [Fiery Golden Eyes] suddenly stung and the outer
appearances of the Yogoes leaving alongside with Taishang Laojun
wavered about greatly.

[…Don't want… go]

[…For how long…]

I heard the Yogoes' voices, their tone sounding eerily familiar. Even though
they luckily avoided getting killed, none of them looked happy about it.
How should I put this?

It was as if they wanted to die in this place, instead.




"This village is now yours. Although you'll have to operate the factory
by yourselves, you won't go empty-bellied like in the past." With that,
Yoo Joonghyuk joined our little group.

The villagers held a tearful farewell party for us before we left. Or more
specifically, they seemed to be disappointed not of us leaving, but due to
Yoo Joonghyuk going with us…

"Chet. I wanted to beat him up and then drag him away."
Once the party ended, Lee Gilyoung and Shin Yoosung set off on the road
again, and I followed after them as well. Meanwhile, Yoo Joonghyuk was
keeping a few steps of distance away from us.

What an awkward atmosphere this was.

Now that I thought about it, I had no clue what Yoo Joonghyuk was like
around my other companions when I wasn't around.

I ended up worrying about him and so, I had to say something. "Excuse me,
Junior Brother. Why don't you walk closer to us?"

"…And who's your 'junior' now?"

That idiot glared back at me with incredibly intimidating eyes and I couldn't
say anything else.

Meanwhile, the kids sidled up to my side and began chatting away in
happiness.

"Hey, Demon King of Salvation, you did alright back there."

"If you haven't discovered the truth about those Yogoes back then, we
might have ended up in a big disaster, disciple-nim."

To be honest, I hadn't done anything of note. Yoo Joonghyuk killed
Yogoes, and the one who saved the village was also him. All I did was
spectate from the sidelines and say a couple of lines. Even then, kids were
busy praising me, not him.

I glanced at him. As if he hadn't heard anything, he concentrated on
polishing his [Black Heavenly Demon Sword].

⸢In that moment, Kim Dokja began wondering for the first time ever. 'How
did my companions see Yoo Joonghyuk while I'm not around?⸥
Not too long afterwards, it became evening.

Gathered firewood burned brightly and we formed a small circle around the
campfire to bathe in its warmth. It felt almost as if we were out camping.

It was Yoo Joonghyuk who oh-so-suddenly decided to act like a wet
blanket in this pleasant atmosphere.

"I shall act on my own from now on."

His voice sounded utterly disinterested, as if he was still polishing his damn
sword, prompting me to respond unconsciously. "What do you mean by
that?"

"Going to India and fetching the 'sacred texts' will end this journey, is it
not?
I alone will be sufficient for this task. I shall go there and…"

"You must not do that!"

Indeed, Zhu Bajie using his Cloud Riding technique, or even me utilising
the
Somersault Cloud, would reach India in the blink of an eye. For sure, Sun
Wukong mentioned this fact back in the original story too, and when I was
much younger, I also questioned the logic behind it as well.

⸢Why didn't Sun Wukong go and get the texts by himself?⸥

I now had a better understanding of why he didn't.

"If you do that, then there will be no meaning to this story."

Taking over fourteen years of slow crawling to cross the distance short
enough to traverse in one night – that time existed for the sole purpose of
completing the story that was the 'Journey to the West'.
However, Yoo Joonghyuk's thoughts were different. "I don't have the time
to waste here."

"This trip should not be that long. It'll definitely not take over 14 years for
us, so please be patient. Progressing according to the itinerary while
meeting the rest of our companions should prove to be a good experience
for you."

He must've found it unexpected that I said those words, because he began
staring at me while speaking up. "You are not one of my companions."
Yup, of course.

There was no way that this deeply-suspicious-of-everyone Yoo Joonghyuk
would believe me.

"I know that."

Silence descended among the group.

Lee Gilyoung wordlessly tossed a pebble inside the campfire, while Shin
Yoosung nervously studied Yoo Joonghyuk's and my current moods, her
fingers fidgeting around with the soil on the ground.

It was then we heard the sound of a stomach growling loudly. Lee Gilyoung
frowned tearfully and rubbed his belly.

"I'm starving…"

I grinned slightly and pulled something out from my inner pocket. "Would
you like some dumplings?"

It was my secret stash of dumplings that I made while walking on that
'Dumpling Road'.
Lee Gilyoung warily eyed me but still received a dumpling anyway. He
eventually bit into it. His eyes opened up real wide, his irises trembling
powerfully.

"What the heck?! This is so much tastier than what I ate back in the

factory!" Of course, it was tastier. It simply had to.


[A portion of the audience members are getting really curious about the
taste of 'Murim dumplings'.]

I sensed Yoo Joonghyuk [999] flinch ever so slightly on my shoulder.

In the meantime, I handed the dumplings over to Shin Yoosung and Yoo
Joonghyuk as well.

The latter frowned and shook his head. "I don't eat food made by other
people."

"Other people didn't make this."

He seemed deeply puzzled by that. Most likely, he had no idea what I was
talking about. He then glared at the [Murim dumpling] resting before his
eyes with some suspicion, but eventually made up his mind and cautiously
reached out to it.

And very slowly, so very slowly, as if he was studying his new enemy,
brought the dumpling near his nose.

"…This aroma??"

That's right, eat that damn dumpling, you bastard.

Yoo Joonghyuk continued his pained deliberation over and over again, and
in the end, brought the dumpling towards his lips very slowly. As if he was
tearing into the neck of the enemy commander, he took a small bite out of
it.

Lee Gil-Yeoung, Shin Yoosung, and I tensely observed the sight of him
chewing the dumpling. Even the chef [999] on my shoulder had stopped
moving and waited for the dude's reaction.

Gulp.

Yoo Joonghyuk finally finished swallowing his initial mouthful, then
proceeded to take another bite. Very, very slowly, the frown on his
forehead disappeared. His lips bobbed up and down in great haste.

The speed at which he consumed the dumpling increased. Second bite, third
bite…

Eventually, his hand reached out to the second dumpling. But then, he
flinched and stopped, and began glaring at me instead.

"What are you looking at?"

I sneakily averted my gaze and began chowing the dumplings as well.

…If I used the [Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint] here, I might have heard
something much more entertaining just now, but well, I swore not to use
that anymore, so…

"…It's not that bad, I suppose."

I heard Yoo Joonghyuk's nearly-inaudible muttering and quietly looked up
at the sky. The stars of the night sky sparkled as they looked down at us, as
if the destruction of the world was a story belonging to a distant realm.

While chewing the dumpling, I began thinking this for the first time. That I
wouldn't have minded this story going on for a little while longer.
[Deep night has arrived.]

['Journey to the West Remake' System will enter one hour of maintenance.]

The darkness descending was pitch-black. Everyone had fallen asleep.

Sun Wukong used his arm as his pillow and began snoring away, and as for
the pair of Tang Sanzangs, they used each of the Monkey King's legs as
their own pillows to sleep as well. They must've been fatigued by the
journey.

However, a shadow quietly stood up, utilising this dead of night where the
messages from the audience members and the judges had disappeared
temporarily.

It was Yoo Joonghyuk.

He silently unsheathed [Black Heavenly Demon Sword] and approached
the sleeping Sun Wukong.

And very slowly, he pointed the tip of his blade against the sleeping figure.
      Chapter 430: Ep. 81 - A dumpling's reminiscence, III


Yoo Joonghyuk pointed the tip of his blade at Sun Wukong and slowly
opened his lips.

– How did you expect me to respond when you were emitting that
muchdemonic energy?

The [Voice Projection] was meant to send one's voice to a designated
target. However, Sun Wukong didn't reply. Instead, it was the [Murim
dumpling] on his shoulder that did.

– [Black Heavenly Demon Sword] is a good weapon.

That voice was thick with an untold length of time it had lived through,
prompting Yoo Joonghyuk to strengthen the sword aura permeating on his
blade.

The dumpling spoke while opening its eyes to stare at the [Black Heavenly
Demon Sword] buzzing with the transcendental power.
– However, will you be able to cut me down with a broken weapon?

Indeed, there was a faint crack running in the middle of the sword.

By using the repair tools sold in the [Dokkaebi Bundle], it had been patched
up somewhat, but as that statement implied, it was nothing more than a
temporary measure. After it broke once, [Black Heavenly Demon Sword]
couldn't even display half of its original might.

Yoo Joonghyuk spoke.

– We can find out, right now.

– And that's precisely why you couldn't win against the 'Secretive Plotter'.

Yoo Joonghyuk's dark brows quivered noticeably at the mention of the
'Secretive Plotter'.

The outer appearance of the Murim dumpling seemed to slowly morph in
the darkness, and the kkoma Yoo Joonghyuk number [999] regained his
former look. Indeed, it was the miniaturised version of Yoo Joonghyuk.

The regular-sized Yoo Joonghyuk's eyes trembled faintly.

– Are you an underling of that bastard? What is your goal here?

– The current you will never defeat the 'Secretive Plotter'.

– If you came here to pass on such a meaningless message, then…

– It'll be the same story even if you try your luck hundreds of times.
Exactlythe same as your pathetic repeated regressions. Surely, you must be
aware of this by now.

The tip of the [Black Heavenly Demon Sword] trembled faintly as well.
Perhaps, that was true. Even after he borrowed Han Sooyoung and Jung
Heewon's powers, he still failed to defeat that enemy. It was obvious that
he'd not be a match even if they met again.

The kkoma Yoo Joonghyuk [999] spoke in the tone of voice indicating that
he understood that feeling.

– Yoo Joonghyuk of the 3rd turn. How much do you know about
the'Secretive Plotter'?




An ancient slumber.

This dream was from the days when he was still called Yoo Joonghyuk
(Hanja: 劉衆赫).

From 0th turn all the way up to 1863rd.

The story of when he was still the puppet of the Oldest Dream, repeating
countless lives and fighting over and over again.

[…Oh, you foolish puppet. You, can't, save, anything.]

Yoo Joonghyuk finally reached the 1863rd turn, only to lose every single
one of his companions.

The Maritime War God, Lee Jihye.

The Beast Lord, Shin Yoosung.

The Emperor of Steelsword, Lee Hyunsung.

The God of Medicine, Lee Seolhwa.
The Delusion Demon, Kim Namwoon.

The Hermit King of Shadows, Han Donghoon.

The Breaking the Sky Sword Saint, Namgung Minyoung.

…His little sister, Yoo Mia.

Just like how he had many companions, he also had as many enemies to
contend with.

Such as, Gong Pildu of the 'Ten Evils', Anna Croft, Ranveer Khan, Fei
Hu…

"I told you, I won't become your ally. However…"

Some enemies remained hostile until the end.

"Maybe, this regression turn will be your last."

Some enemies realized he had succeeded and congratulated him.

And then, the final war began.

[Oh, the 'Iron Blood Supreme King'.]

Fighting alongside him as his sworn friend, the 'Prisoner of the Golden
Headband', the Great Sage, Heaven's Equal.

[I'm helping you because the <Star Stream> is an even greater evil.]

Working as his ally at the final hurdle, 'Demon-like Judge of Fire', Uriel.

[…This one is simply avenging the death of his Incarnation, that is all.]

Standing on his side for the sake of avenging Kim Namwoon, the 'Abyssal
Black Flame Dragon'.
[Y ou fool ish Con stell ations…]

They advanced forward while breaking past the waves of the Outer Gods.
They cut down countless packs of tentacles rushing at them, and faced off
against the enormous Statuses emitted by these gods from the other world.

Stars in the sky fell non-stop.

Lights from the great Nebulas continued to disappear. <Olympus>,
<Vedas>,
<Asgard>…

Along with the noises of one era coming to an end, the skies of the <Star
Stream> were covered by the falling rain of shooting stars.

The Korean Peninsula's Constellations also died. Goryeo's First Sword and
the Maritime War God fought bitterly right till the end, but they still
couldn't avoid their deaths.

It was the same story for Yoo Joonghyuk's companion in arms.

[What an amusing life it was.]

The first one to lose his head was the 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon'.

[…Gabriel… I'm sorry.]

Not too long after, the wings of the 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' were broken.

By that time, however, even the majority of 'Outer Gods' had perished as
well.

The one to land the final, deciding blow was the Great Sage.

[That's the end of all stories, it seems.]
His Ruyi Bang grew to an enormous height. He then dispersed into tens of
thousands of clones and utilised every single Story he possessed to open up
a path. As he scattered away in a golden-coloured Story, the Great Sage
spoke up.

[Complete your story, Supreme King Yoo Joonghyuk.]

Yoo Joonghyuk could never forget the moment he ran on that path.

It was the moment that his life, continued on breathlessly from the 0th turn
up until now, was about to be completed.

Slice.

The head of a god from another world fell in vain.

[Reg ret will be the on ly th ing that ke eps you al ive.]

And that curse completed Yoo Joonghyuk's 'Conclusion'.

[You have acquired a new Giant Story!]

[Giant Story, 'Pilgrim of the Lonesome Apocalypse', has completed its
meaning!]

[The 'Conclusion(結)' for your final Giant Story has been completed!]

[Hidden Scenario – 'A Single Story's' final condition has been met!]

The only one remaining on the battlefield where everything had perished
was Yoo Joonghyuk.

The Conclusion he finally reached by using the deaths of everyone as its
fertiliser. What he wished for at the end of this lengthy fight was just this
one thing.

'To see the end of this damn regression'.
For that sole purpose, he persisted and got himself here.

Unfortunately, a wall prevented him from 'going beyond'.

⸢There are three ways to survive in a ruined world. Now, I have forgotten a
few, but one thing is certain. The fact that you who are reading these words
will survive for sure.⸥

Incomprehensible texts were written on that wall.

That was where Yoo Joonghyuk met the 'Dokkaebi King'.

[Oh hear ye, the poor, tragic puppet. You have come far too quickly. I'm
sorry, but past here 'doesn't exist' yet.]

Yoo Joonghyuk couldn't understand what that meant. To figure it out, he
threatened the 'Dokkaebi King'. But the damn guy didn't reveal its true
meaning even as it died.

[You can't complete this universe.]

It was a gigantic wall that Yoo Joonghyuk couldn't go past with his power.
But he still instinctively understood it.

'Past this wall is where I'll find the answer I've been looking for'.

Unfortunately, his [Breaking the Sky Swordsmanship] that shattered the
heavens and destroyed stars failed to break this wall. It was as if this wall
didn't possess the nature of 'breaking' in the first place.

Yoo Joonghyuk despaired.

He came this far while losing everything, yet he couldn't go past this one
wall?
[Your 'Conclusion' is guiding you towards a brand new existence.]

He needed to become stronger.

He needed many more Stories.

He needed the force capable enough to break past this 'Wall' and go beyond
it.

[You have become an 'Outer God'.]

And that was why Yoo Joonghyuk had become an Outer God.

He now could drift along the countless world-lines he had lived through,
and eventually, he was no longer 'Yoo Joonghyuk'.

Other gods respected him who wandered among the universe of stories, and
Dokkaebis from other world-lines feared him.

The Wennys liked him, though. One of the Recorders of Fear even created
a title for him, too.

– The great schemer who dreams of journeying past the Wall… The
'Secretive Plotter'.

0th regression turn, 1st, 2nd… 1863rd.

He aimlessly floated around all these numerous world-lines and memorised
the stories of his life once more.

He had earned many Stories along the way, but his overall power remained
the same after paying for the Probability of traversing through different
world-lines. However, he got to learn many new pieces of information that
he failed to notice when he used to rely on regression only.

Such as, the origin of all of his regressions, his sponsor.
The 'Oldest Dream'.

The 'Secretive Plotter' wandered around again and again for the sole
purpose of finding this being.

Once, he discovered its traces in <Eden>, and he also discovered the
records of it within <Vedas> as well.

But he couldn't find its actual, real body anywhere.

And that was why the 'Secretive Plotter' became even more convinced. He
was sure that the answer to everything was beyond the 'Final Wall' he
encountered at the 'Final Scenario'.

Sadly, though, he failed to discover the method to breach that wall even
after searching through all of the world-lines.

His hope slowly withered. His will that not even regressing for 1863 times
could break was slowly becoming dimmer. He dreamed many times of
falling into an endless slumber. If only he really could.

If only he could find… the eternal rest he'd been searching for.

It was at this point that he discovered a single planet shining so brightly.
The 'Secretive Plotter' was quite familiar with it.

The 8612th solar system, Earth. The location where the tragedies of all
scenarios began.

However, something was wrong. An unfamiliar sensation wrapped around
this world-line stabbed into his memories.

'…Was there a regression turn like this one?'

And it was here that the 'Secretive Plotter' witnessed an existence he had
never encountered before.
…

…

…

The 'Secretive Plotter' slowly opened his eyes.

He saw the N'Gai's Forest above the cold darkness. His jet-black exhaled
air dispersed within the now-chilly air.

It was unknown for how long he was there, but nonetheless, the kkoma Yoo
Joonghyuk number [41] was next to him.

"You had a nightmare. Someone like you who had witnessed the
Conclusion still can't escape from dreaming, it seems."

【…Well, I too am nothing more than a mere 'puppet', that's why.】

Tsu-chut, chuchuchut…

Perhaps as the after-effects of spending an exorbitant amount of
Probability, thin layers of sparks danced around the entire figure of the
'Secretive Plotter'. [41] quietly observed that phenomenon for a while
before opening his lips.
"I see that the effects from the 1863rd's story changing is rather
considerable."

【…Your business here?】

"All contact from [999] has been cut off."

The irises of the 'Secretive Plotter' drew in deeper after hearing those
words. Dark and deep light flitted in and out of his eyes as if he was reading
something, before he opened his lips again.
【…[999] hasn't died.】

"Then, the meaning of his contact being cut off is…"

The 'Secretive Plotter' didn't reply.

[41] spoke with a voice containing a faint trace of rage. "It was a mistake to
send him. Send me, instead. [999] is too soft."

【He is not as soft as you think.】 Faint vestiges of a Story brushed past
the eyes of the Secretive Plotter as if he was re-reading the events of the
999th regression turn. 【Even if it was through sheer luck, [999] is the only
one besides myself to reach the edge of the 'Conclusion'. Because of his
experience, I too was able to witness my 'Conclusion', as well.】

That reply prompted [41]'s expression to crumple. "However, he's also the
one who willingly gave up on the 'Conclusion'. Think about this. He can
mess up our goal."

【It doesn't matter. He is also a 'Yoo Joonghyuk', after all.】 The Plotter's
unfathomable eyes now stared at the skies of the N'Gai's Forest. No one
could tell what exactly he was thinking about. 【He too, has the right to
pursue the end he wishes to see.】

[41] quietly observed the Plotter's eyes before lowering his head slowly.

The 'Secretive Plotter'. Yoo Joonghyuk who had lived the longest time in
all of the universes out there. No one in the <Star Stream> could understand
the depths of his sorrow.

"…If that's what you want."

Even if it was another Yoo Joonghyuk.
[Scenario maintenance will conclude in five minutes.]

[The channel will re-open soon.]

As the message reverberated throughout the empty air, two Yoo
Joonghyuks were still standing face to face. [999] was the first one to form
a wry grin.

– It seems that you don't know anything. But then again, I guess it's only
obvious.

"Don't know anything" – those words really got under Yoo Joonghyuk's
skin. This bastard or that other one, they were all saying the same damn
thing.

'Yoo Joonghyuk who doesn't know anything'.

Just what the hell didn't he know?

The blade of the [Black Heavenly Demon Sword] faintly shifted over to
Sun Wukong as if he had managed to swallow back his anger.

– Just spit out what you're plotting here. Why did you come? Is this
SunWukong one of your collaborators?

[999] glanced at Sun Wukong after hearing that threat, and replied.

– He isn't an Outer God. We're simply using each other.

– In that case, it'll be fine to kill you both.

[999] then stepped up slightly as if to defend Sun Wukong and spoke.

– If you wish to give up on this regression turn, then go ahead.

– What rubbish are you talking about?
– Complete this 'Journey to the West Remake' with this guy. If you do, I
shall teach you a way to defeat the 'Secretive Plotter'.

– Why should I believe…

Almost at the same time, blue sparks danced around [999]'s body.

The [Existence Pledge].

Yoo Joonghyuk's eyes trembled from unrest.

– You said that I'll never defeat him even if I regress hundreds of times.

– And I merely meant that you can't defeat him by 'regressing' hundreds
oftimes.

[999] lightly leaped up and landed on the blade of the [Black Heavenly
Demon Sword]. Yoo Joonghyuk reflexively took a step back, but his mini
version approached him regardless.

– You always thought that your life so far has been a living hell. Because
you've been dealing with everything all on your own.

A chaotic Story instantly spread all around. Yoo Joonghyuk flinched and
stared at it.

It was of an eternal nightmare that a certain someone had lived through.

[Story, 'Hell of Eternity', has begun its storytelling.]

As if it was reacting to this Story, the [Black Heavenly Demon Sword]
permeating with shining light shuddered greatly.

Yoo Joonghyuk who experienced the 999th regression turn spoke again.

– How many such hells do you think exist in this world?
       Chapter 431: Ep. 81 - A dumpling's reminiscence, IV


The ensuing scenario afterwards proved to be plain sailing. Zhu Bajie had a
big role to play in that.

[Current rate of Journey to the West's progress: 24%]

The Journey to the West had the storyline of overcoming a total of 81
different adversities in the 14-year period. But, as the original work used
the stories passed down orally as its foundation, this level of changes didn't
seem to matter one jot.

Even then, I couldn't help but wonder if the story was progressing a bit too
fast when we hadn't even met Sha Wujing yet. And I also kind of wondered
who'd play that role, too.

"Ku-waaahk!"
Currently, Yoo Joonghyuk's [Black Heavenly Demon Sword] was busy
cutting the heads off the unlucky bandits that showed up as a sort of
intermission event.

[A portion of judges are dissatisfied by the viciousness of 'Zhu Bajie'!]

[Audience members are satisfied with the taste of the Journey to the West's
cider!]

[10 additional points have been acquired.]

Even back in the original story, Zhu Bajie and Sun Wukong often killed all
human-type villains they came across. That resulted in 'Tang Sanzang'
lecturing them, or when the matter became too serious, they even suffered
expulsion, too.

There were quite a few readers who felt turned-off by the stuffy uptightness
of Tang Sanzang, though.

"Joonghyuk ahjussi, how about sparing those people…?"

[A portion of judges are satisfied by the reflection of the original work.]

[Many audience members are arrested by Tang Sanzang's adorableness.]

[20 additional points have been acquired.]

For sure, the question of who was playing the role seemed to make a big
difference overall.

The leader of the bandits, beaten up to within an inch of his life by Yoo
Joonghyuk, yelled out as if he was furious about his treatment. "Keu-
euheuk! Who would've thought that a mere Zhu Bajie was that strong!"
Surprisingly, he was someone that I knew.
Kids next to me whispered to each other.

"Poor Myungoh ahjussi."

The department chief Han Myungoh activated [One-legged Swift Horse]
and while running away as if his butt was on fire, sent us a knowing wink.

To think that Han Myungoh was one of the players participating here, too.

It seemed that he was hired to perform multiple roles, specifically as leaders
of various bandit troupes. Shin Yoosung softly muttered as we watched his
distancing back. "Heewon unni said that it was okay."

Yoo Joonghyuk returned to our side while lightly polishing the [Black
Heavenly Demon Sword]. He especially paid more attention to the center of
the blade. When I took a closer look, a minute crack could be spotted there.

His sword was broken on the battlefield of the 'Great War of Saints and
Demons'.

This would be his second sword to be broken after the [Splitting the Sky
Sword]. Even if he didn't show it, he must've been hurting over this whole
thing.

It'd be good if he could get himself a new weapon from this 'Journey to the
West'…

But, I couldn't recall any weapons that might suit him. Sun Wukong's Ruyi
Jingu Bang wasn't the type of weapon that Yoo Joonghyuk was familiar
with, and Zhu Bajie's Nine-Tooth Spike Rake didn't match his taste. No
need to even mention Sha Wujing's Demon Slaying Staff, either…

Maybe he found me, deeply submerged in my thoughts, suspicious, as he
suddenly addressed me off-handedly. "Thankfully, you behaved yourself."
(Interpretation: Senior brother! Are you injured anywhere?)

I couldn't help but glare at the narration floating up in the

air.

What the heck was that now?

"Behave yourself even in the future. Then I won't kill you."

(Interpretation: Fufufu, Senior Brother, do not worry. Even if I have to
sacrifice my life, I shall definitely protect you.)

I became slightly dismayed and glared at the sky.

Hey, there's just no way he'd be thinking like that. Besides, Yoo Joonghyuk
would never laugh "Fufufu" in his life.

Han Sooyoung, you dumbass…

[A fair number of audience members are greatly moved by Zhu Bajie's
inner thoughts!]

[A fair number of audience members have fallen deeply for Zhu Bajie's
magnetism!]

[One of the audience members wish to sponsor Coins.]

[Judge, 'Cleanser of Altars', is greatly satisfied!]

[50 additional points have been acquired!]

…What an outstanding author she was.

(The journey proved to be rather uneventful. Sun Wukong began thinking.
Is this what it means to lead a 'retired life'?)
In any case, the trip was indeed quite stress-free, as long as I excluded the
constant war of nerves with Yoo Joonghyuk, that was.

As for Yogoes or bandits that periodically appeared, either the kids or Yoo
Joonghyuk took care of them even before I could spot them.

"Oii, Mister Demon King of Salvation. You must be really comfortable,
aren't you?"

"Yes. It's all thanks to you the Masters."

I should also thank Han Sooyoung for me getting referred to as the 'Demon
King of Salvation' even though my identity hadn't been revealed yet.

This [I've become the retired SSSSS-rank Sun Wukong] had a strange
backstory of Sun Wukong being nicknamed the 'Demon King of Salvation'
in his past. I couldn't really figure out why she'd use such a nickname
here…

[A portion of audience members like the story where the 'Demon King of
Salvation' is treated poorly.]

[10 additional points have been acquired.]

…Nope, I think I know now.

"Stop picking a fight with someone you're not familiar with, you dummy."

"No, that's not it. I mean, he should earn his keep, right? Dokja hyung told
me that even if your body's relaxing, your head should still be working
overtime."

I definitely never said that. When you were relaxing, you should relax your
mind, too.
Lee Gilyoung narrowed his eyes to a slit and stared at me while adding a
few more words on top. "That's why you should give up some tasty info
already. I mean, you're supposed to be a second-turn Sun Wukong
according to the backstory, right? Don't you know where we can find some
hidden elixirs or something?"

"…Mm. Sure, I know of a few."

Indeed, the 'Journey to the West' did feature quite a few useful elixirs. Such
as, the [Peach of Immortality] that Sun Wukong ate, or the [Ginseng Fruit]
the group finds during the journey itself.

"One of the best elixirs can be found nearby."

"Really? Where?"

I didn't reply and simply stared at Lee Gilyoung.

"Where is it? Hurry up and spit it out!"

Before I could explain, the narration began first.

(In the original Journey to the West, Tang Sanzang was kidnapped by
Yogoes dozens of times because of the legend that any creature devouring
the monk would ascend to the heavenly world. But that made sense,
considering that Tang Sanzang was the reincarnation of Golden Cicada, the
disciple of Buddha who had gone through ten cycles of rebirth.)

While watching the jaws of the two kids drop gradually, I added an extra
explanation on top. "Most likely, you Masters are the best-known elixirs
found within the entirety of the 'Journey to the West'."

Lee Gilyoung and Shin Yoosung flinched before taking quick steps away
from one another, and glared fiercely at each other.

"Hey, Shin Yoosung, you don't need a finger or two, now do you…?"
"You probably don't need anything above your neck, though?"

Watching the kids growl at each other like that, I couldn't help but snicker
on the side. The dumpling on my shoulder didn't seem to be happy with my
current actions and whispered to me.

  –        This is no time to snicker like a fool. It's you who needs an elixir
  or two,not them.

Along with his rebuke, a window popped up in my view.

[Outer God transformation progress percentage: 48%]

…The rate of assimilation was chill-inducingly fast. I didn't expect this one
to be quicker than the Journey to the West's progress.

  –        It's because your Incarnation Body's rate of recovery is too slow.

'…This was not a part of the deal'.

  –        And you sneakily cooperating with <Kim Dokja's Company>
  was not apart of the plan, either.

I bit my lip.

As expected, the Wenny King was a scary guy. But then again, he had been
fighting the Dokkaebi King for his entire life, hadn't he? It was highly
likely that he even foresaw the current situation.

[999] spoke as he studied my Incarnation Body.

–         You only have around four days. You need to fulfil the
agreement beforethen.

'That's impossible. I need to finish this scenario first in order to do that, but
I don't have enough time'.
The deal with the Wenny King was to create a Giant Story that contained
an 'Outer God'. I was planning to fulfil that agreement through this Giant
Story, but four days simply was too short.

At the bare minimum, I needed over a week.

–         In that case, there is only one method remaining. We need to
strengthenyour frail Incarnation Body.

I nodded my head and checked out my body's condition.

[Current Incarnation Body recovery rate: 45%]

[Damage to your foundational Story is critical.]

[You can consume a new type of elixir to boost the rate of recovery.]

The reason for the rate of transforming into an Outer God speeding up was
simply because my Incarnation Body hadn't recovered fully from the
damage I suffered during the 'Great War of Saints and Demons'.

[Story fragment, 'Young Gold Dragon's Broken Heart', is unable to function
properly.]

Now that I thought about it, I was too focused on gathering Stories and
neglected on enhancing my Incarnation Body's durability. Well, I half gave
up on the idea after I kept dying and stuff, so… As for the 'Young Gold
Dragon's Broken Heart', now that was a Story fragment I acquired a really
long time ago.

Just like what the 'One Invincible Fist' Yoo Hoseong told me, though, I
needed to train my Incarnation Body if I wanted to bring out the full might
of the Stories.

Because if Stories were 'words', then one's Incarnation Body was the 'paper'
those words could be written on.
– Every elixir that can be found in here should all be replicas. Still, it'll be
better than not consuming one.

[Score: 2963]

[Currently, five judges are watching the applicable Story chamber.]

[Currently, many audience members are interested in the upward trajectory
of the Story chamber.]

[Current ranking of the applicable Story chamber is 31st.]

In a fairly short period of time, the scenario created by Han Sooyoung
managed to earn the support from many people out there. And a story
where many were sharing the cost of 'Probability' could exhibit pretty
strong power as a result.

[As the Story chamber's ranking rises higher, the grades of Star Relics
found within the applicable chamber will also rise up.]

As the chamber's ranking climbed up, every item that showed up here
would get closer and closer to the grade of their original counterparts, and if
we manage to win, then they would become originals outright.

In other words, everything we find in this Story chamber would become
'real' things.

If our chamber's ranking continues to climb as smoothly as it had done so
far, and if I manage to successfully gather the elixirs, then…

[Giant Story, 'Season of Light and Darkness', is currently asleep.]

[You don't have the qualification to use the applicable Story.]

…Then maybe, I might get to utilise the power of this 'Giant Story' that I
earned but hadn't been able to unleash until now.
[Giant Story, 'Torch that Swallowed the Myth', is afraid of 'Season of Light
and Darkness'.]

Even the [Torch that Swallowed the Myth] was scared of this Story. Right
now, I couldn't even begin to imagine how incredible the power of this
Story was.

"Stop."

It was at that moment when Yoo Joonghyuk walking out in front came to a
stop.

The sky that used to be clear and blue was now dyed in a yellowish hue. I
took a closer look to find that the yellowish fog had blanketed the
surrounding landscape as well as the sky above.

[You have arrived in Yellow Wind Cave at Yellow Wind Ridge.]

Yellow Wind Ridge, was it?

This was the residence of one of the Journey's villains, 'Yellow Wind'
Demon King. If my thoughts were correct, then one of the elixirs I need
should be found nearby.

It was here that we heard an incoming message.

[A large number of Players are joining this 'Story chamber'!]

The original number of Players for this chamber was eight. However, there
was a sudden influx of additional Players.

Lee Gilyoung muttered as if he was dumbfounded by it. "…But, why
now?"

It was logically difficult to explain. The newly-entering Players to a Story
chamber that no longer recruited roles could only become 'extras' and not
much else. And these extras would not get any proper rewards even after
the chamber was concluded successfully.

That was the situation for the top-ten ranked Story chambers, so there was
no need to even mention participating in this 31st… No, hang on, there
was.

[A small number of audience members are wary of the 6731st Story
chamber's rise in the rankings.]

[A portion of audience members are looking forward to your destruction.]

[Many audience members are paying attention to the Story chamber's
sudden upheaval!]

The current situation was this: our Story chamber had shot up from the
bottom of the ranking all the way up near the top in a proverbial blink of an
eye.

Yoo Joonghyuk spoke, his expression hardening. "Bastards are trying to
ruin our scenario."

It was unknown who might be the instigator in this case, but I could think
of something.

Most likely, these guys were 'spies' sent in from the great Nebulas
participating in the 'Journey to the West Remake', as well as from other
topranked Story chambers.

They must've been fearing what might happen in the <Star Stream> if
<Kim Dokja's Company> managed to snatch away yet another 'Giant Story'
here.

Ku-gugugugu!

The fog rushed forward in an instant and swallowed us up.
The first one to disappear under the fog was Yoo Joonghyuk's figure,
looking back at us and issuing a warning; and then, the surprised voices of
Shin Yoosung and Lee Gilyoung resounded out next.

"Disciple-nim! Hurry and hide behind us!"

"Stay behind and don't step forward! Got th…"

Even before I could make my reply, the kids disappeared as well. And the
fog came to a stop right before my nose. Soon, I heard the sharp noises of
weapons clashing coming from here and there. The dumpling on my
shoulder asked in a quiet voice.

– Aren't you going in?

"I want to, but…" said I, as I felt the presence approaching me from behind.
"…I think their aim is me this time."

I looked back and saw the 'extras' hurrying over here on the Yellow Wind
Ridge's pathway. Constellations disguised as the underlings of the 'Yellow
Wind' Demon King were walking closer while emitting unfriendly auras in
my direction.

"So, that's the 'Sun Wukong'?"

"He must be a weakling, judging from his Status."

"Did they really think we'd be scared by them attaching the 'Demon King of
Salvation' moniker onto a weakling like him?"

Only then did I figure out what their real goal was. No matter what, the
main protagonist of the [Journey to the West] was 'Sun Wukong'. If he dies,
the Journey would end, too.

[A portion of judges are worried about your safety.]
[A portion of audience members are worried about your safety.]

I watched the Constellations come closer and felt really conflicted about
this whole thing.

(Retired Sun Wukong didn't want to fight. Why? Because it was annoying.)

['Retirement penalty' has steeply decreased your will to fight.]

Yup, it was all because of that damn 'retired' setting.

[Judge, 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband', is digging his ear as if he can't
be bothered.]

[Judge, 'Bimawen', is opening a book to read with a refined expression.]

[Judge, 'Meihouwang', is yawning out in boredom.]

Those 'Sun Wukongs', feeling sick and tired of hard-carrying the [Journey
to the West] by themselves originally, wouldn't enjoy this type of
development at all. Utterly not caring about that, the 'extra' Constellations
wielding scarylooking weapons finally arrived in my near vicinity.

"Kill him!"

(Interpretation: Haha, kill that baldy monkey.)

"Kill him!"

(Interpretation: Fuc■! It's the bastar■ that cleans up the poo of the heavens.)

"Kill him!"

(Interpretation: A roc■-for-brains monkey.)
I was about to throw a tackle, arguing about the validity of such
interpretations, but then, the channel was suddenly flooded with an
explosion of messages.

[Judge, 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband', is enraged while holding onto
his hair!]

[Judge, 'Bimawen', is shuddering angrily at the filthiness of this story.]

[Judge, Meihouwang', wishes for the heads of those fools to roll.]

[A portion of judges are providing a great amount of Probability towards
the progression of the applicable Story chamber!]

[If this story's direction is changed, then a large amount of additional points
will be acquired.]

…Ehng?

[A private message has arrived from the Scenario Master.]

["Hey, you said you can fight a bit, right?"]

The narration began even before I had time to reply.

(There was one thing that all these Yogoes rushing in didn't know. Without
a doubt, he was the 'retired Sun Wunkong'. However…)

(…He was also Sun Wukong that didn't hide his own strength, either.)

Along with all the messages clogging up my view, the title card for the new
episode floated up as well.

~ Episode 3. The Demon King of Salvation isn't hiding his powers ~
                  Chapter 432: Ep. 82 - Outer God, I


The Constellations rushing in flinched after checking out the title card
floating in the air.

"…What's up with this episode? He's 'not hiding his powers'? What?"

"Never mind that and just kill him!"

I sighed out grandly while looking at all those weapons brandished at me.

…That damn Han Sooyoung.

I began wondering if this was how every character felt inside.

Characters that had to follow along with the plot that the author had cooked
up, and had no choice but to overcome the obstacles set before them. Yoo
Joonghyuk had overcome such trials and tribulations for tens of thousands
of years.
If I had one advantage over him, then that would be me knowing who the
author of this particular scenario was.

Swiiiiiish!

Two strands of sword auras tore apart right before my eyes. I easily avoided
the attacks with airy footsteps and thought to myself.

I had a chat with Han Sooyoung in the past about a certain something.

 –        There are two types of writers in the world. One, a diligent type
 of writerwho plots everything out in advance. And then, the genius
 beautiful girl writer who entrusts herself to the feelings of the moment
 without relying on prior planning.

 –            Oh? And which one are you?"

 –            Hey you dumbass. You asking me because you really can't tell?

So, then. That genius author-nim had written this very scenario, did she?

[Judge, 'Meihouwang', is readying some beer.]

[Judge, 'Bimawen', is readying some drip coffee.]

So, you want to abuse me a bit for the sake of satisfying the tastes of the
main 'readership', was that it? I stared at the sky and muttered out. "Hey,
listen. You know that this is a trade, don't you?"

[Scenario Master is tilting her head after hearing your words.]

Even if that was her 'reaction', Han Sooyoung should've realized what I was
talking about here. In the meantime, the Constellations had me surrounded.
"You came riding on a bus this far, so it's time that you make your exit."
Making an exit… Now, where would these idiots learn such a scary phrase
from? "We'll have to wait and see who will make their exit first, now don't
we?"

I couldn't activate either the [Electrification] or [Way of the Wind]. Not
only that, I couldn't use my usual Unbroken Faith, either.

After all, it'd be troublesome to let others know that I was 'Kim Dokja'.
Still, there was no need to utilise my main attack options when dealing with
these low-levelled mobs right now.

Tsu-chuchuchuchut…

Because I was none other than 'Sun Wukong'.

[Judge, 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband', is nodding his head.]

[You've been permitted to use a portion of 'Prisoner of the Golden
Headband's' Stigmas.]

If I was a regular Constellation, dealing with such a Stigma would've been a
tall order. However, I was a 'Narrative-grade Constellation', and possessed
three different 'Giant Stories', to boot.

Ku-gugugugu!!

This time, the onomatopoeia was not made by someone's mouth but from
actual thunders cracking in the sky for real. As the lightning bolts flashed in
the air, I yanked out a handful of hair and blew them into the air.

[Stigma, 'Body Outside Body Magic', is activating!]

The 'Body Outside Body' technique.

Simply put, it was Sun Wukong's version of the skill [Avatar].
"W-what is this?!"

"Kuwaaahk!"

The clone Sun Wukongs proliferated in the blink of an eye and began
pummelling the enemy Constellations to pulps. Suddenly, narration speech
bubbles floated up above the heads of the clones rushing forward.

("The Demon King of Salvation!")

("Isn't hiding!")

("His powers!")

It seemed that she had momentarily forgotten that she was the narrator here.

Tsu-chuchuchuchuchu…

I only borrowed the power of a single magic skill, yet the condition of my
body worsened noticeably. It was exacerbated by the fact that I was gravely
injured already.

…Goddammit, why hasn't Yoo Joonghyuk come out of the fog yet?

[Your Incarnation Body's recovery is being delayed!]

[Condition of your Incarnation Body is worsening!]

I gazed at the murky interior of the fog and pretended to be unconcerned.
The retired Sun Wukong needed to look strong, no questions asked. And I
must never go all out, no matter what.

⸢Kim Dokja thought to himself. 'I'm Yoo Joonghyuk'.⸥

I bit my lips and formed the expression similar to the coolest person that I
knew.
"Screw this… We're retreating!"

It seemed that my ploy worked, as the Constellations began retreating from
the perceived threats to their lives.

[A great number of Players are exiting the scenario!]

In the blink of an eye, the only things remaining around me were the empty
husks that the Constellations left behind.

"Euh, euh…"

However, even these husks possessed egos. They were creatures tasked
with acting as Yogoe 'extras' in this world.

Suddenly, my heart began beating irregularly.

[Chaos is writhing within in your heart.]

[Rate of Outer God transformation is accelerating.]

[Stigma, 'Fiery Golden Eyes Lv.???', has been forcibly activated!]

As my vision burned in the crimson hue, the collapsed Yogoes revealed
their true appearances.

[WhereisthisWhereisthisWhereisthis]

[AhAhAhAhAhAh]

[AgainAgainAgainAgainAgain]

Yogoes carrying suffering expressions had their heads shoved against the
ground while screaming out. It wasn't that difficult to understand why. I had
witnessed similar existences to them on the 'Isle of Reincarnators' already.
They were creatures mobilised to fill up the 'lacking Probability' in the
Story chambers of this [Journey to the West Remake]. Expendables, cursed
to eternally repeat the life of being used as extras of other stories.

The problem here was, what was the 'real identity' of those creatures?

[Power of Chaos is writhing within your heart!]

Pain welled up in my chest like vomit.

I staggered unsteadily and approached one of the Yogoes. The moment my
hand touched its slick body, its appearance changed.

To that of a tentacled cephalopod-type monster.

Pages of the 'Ways of Survival' flipped open in my head.

⸢Some Nebulas deliberately nurture the cast-off skins of the lower-ranked
'Old Beings'.⸥

⸢They use these beings as sacrifices to fill up the necessary Probability of
the scenarios.⸥
My heart was beating much louder than before. Indeed, such sections did
appear in the 'Ways of Survival'. However, it never revealed which
'Nebulas' did such things even until the end… It can't be, it was the
<Emperor>?

[Pilgrim Sun, stop right there!]

I looked up into the sky and sure enough, one of the Constellations in
charge of the heavenly worlds was busy making his descent. I wasn't sure
of his name. Probably some loser like Metal Lord of the West or Lingji
Bodhisattva or something. Well, there were literally hundreds of
Constellations with similar names like that in the <Emperor>, after all.
[Those Yogoes are beasts that used to cultivate at the foot of Yeongchi
Mountain! However, they stole and drank the sacred oils from the Great
Leiyin Temple where Buddha was residing and became Yogoes as a result.
Please, show them mercy and graciously pardon them of their sins and hand
them over to…]

After realizing the truth, I finally understood why <Emperor> folks wanted
to retrieve these so-called Yogoes. From their perspective, these creatures
must be like their resources.

A must-have resource in order to operate the scenarios.

[A portion of judges are satisfied by the story's reflection of the original
work.]

[5 additional points have been awarded.]

[Judge, 'Meihouwang', is yawning in boredom.]

The defeated Yogoes either dying or reverting back to the property of the
deities. That development, without a doubt, truly reflected what happened
in the original work, something that hadn't changed in the past thousands of
years.

However, if that was the correct flow of events and the correct rules of the
[Journey to the West], then…

[WhoamIWhoamIWhoamIWhoamI]

…Then, what meaning was there to the lives of these Yogoes?

[Judge, 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband', is looking at you in
puzzlement.]
When I didn't say anything for a while, the Lingji Bodhisattva opened his
mouth once more. [Hmm, hmm. In any case… It is fine for me to take the
Yogoes away, yes?]

In the end, the narration decided to step in first.

(Sun Wukong nodded his head and towards the Lingji Bodhisattva…)

"I can't let you do that."

(…Said that he can't allow that.)

I sensed the angry gaze of the Scenario Master bearing down on me from
the sky. It was a reproachful gaze, seemingly asking me what I was
thinking of when making such a reply.

The Lingji Bodhisattva was stunned just as much as she was, it seemed. […
What did you say?]

"Whatever the case may be, you people don't look after these guys properly
anyway."

[W-what are you talking about?]

"You'll just mobilise these Yogoes as extras in other Story chambers."
[Judge, 'Meihouwang', is looking at you with deeply intrigued eyes.]

[Judge, 'Bimawen', has closed the book he was reading and is now looking
at you.]

[Judge, 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband', is paying attention to your
words.]

The panicking Lingji Bodhisattva yelled out loudly. [They are nothing more
than simple Yogoes. You're chasing after a greater purpose in this journey,
so why are you minding the fate of these worthless creatures?]
"They are folks who also carry out the 'scenarios' as well. You're supposed
to pursue Buddha's teachings or discuss the true meaning of the universe
and be on the righteous path, so how come you're so disinterested in the
lives of those that are not human?"

While saying such things, I began thinking about Han Sooyoung. Did she
already plan out the 'conclusion' of this scenario?

[Many audience members are intrigued by your argument.]

Just like what Han Sooyoung said earlier with her own mouth, she was the
so-called 'genius-type' writer who relied on the feelings of the moments to
create the overall narrative. But that also meant she'd suffer the torture of
creation, always wary of the potential responses the readers might display.

[Scenario Master is waiting for your next declaration.]

She probably had to participate in this scenario in a hurry and didn't enjoy
the luxury of time to come up with a satisfying conclusion nor to establish
an overarching theme.

Indeed, it'd be already pretty tough to create storylines that would
constantly excite the audience members.

But, what if I aided her in her quest?

I slowly got up and, while standing in front of the Yogoes, raised my voice.
"I shall take these guys with me."

As the Lingji Bodhisattva's expression was filling up with pure
astonishment, I could also see the Yogoes falling into confusion as well.

There were some things that could only be seen from the perspectives of a
writer or the reader, and some that could only be understood by being one
of the main characters.
[Judge, 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband', likes your unwillingness to
concede defeat.]

[Judge, 'Bimawen', likes your unwillingness to concede defeat.]

[Judge, 'Meihouwang', likes your unwillingness to concede defeat.]

[150 additional points have been acquired!]

[The theme of the applicable Story chamber is beginning to change

greatly!] Yogoes were now looking up at me.

[A possibility of a new 'Giant Story' is germinating!]

[Shares for 'Outer God' has been generated for the new 'Giant Story'!]

…As I expected. However, the messages didn't end there.

[The agreement with the Wenny King is activating!]

[In order to fulfil the agreement, you need to increase the shares of 'Outer
God' for the applicable Story to over 30%.]

[Currently, shares of 'Outer God' for the applicable scenario is 0.0003%.]

…0.0003%???

As I began despairing at that nonsensical percentage, the Lingji Bodhisattva
began yelling again in mid-air. [You fool! You're truly boundlessly
arrogant, aren't you! Do you think you're the real Pilgrim Sun or some
such??]

This Bodhisattva must've forgotten about his role for a second there,
because he began pouring out powerful Status at me. It was right after I had
finished dealing with the Great Sage's Probability, so I no longer possessed
enough energy to contend with that.
But, just before the waves of Status, fired like lightning bolts, could stab
into
me…

"Hey, you. Did you know that you sound exactly like Dokja ahjussi?"

…Along with that voice, the lightning bolts split apart in the air.

I looked around and saw that the sandy fog had died down already. My
companions were approaching me from the distance. And then, Yoo
Joonghyuk was standing before me as if to shield me. He glared at the sky,
and pointed the [Black Heavenly Demon Sword] scattering electrical
energy at the opponent.

"I won't say this twice. Scram."

[Y-you bastards… This insult, I will definitely…]

The Lingji Bodhisattva sweated buckets out of sheer fright and quickly
disappeared, leaving Yoo Joonghyuk to look at me with an icy expression.
His [Black Heavenly Demon Sword] was pointing at me next.

"Didn't I say I'll kill you if you don't behave yourself?"

"Uh… My apologies."

"I've defeated the 'Yellow Wind' Demon King."

"…Congratulations."

I began aiding the Yogoes still collapsed on the ground.

[WhoareyouWhoareyouWhoareyou]

They stared at me in fear, but eventually came closer and sniffed my hands.
However, they still scampered away in a hurry. Like some sort of
abandoned puppies, they hid behind distant trees and began peeking around
the corners at me from their hiding spots.

[A portion of abandoned Yogoes are now following you.]

Yoo Joonghyuk addressed me. "You know that this is a meaningless action,
right?"

"…"

"The <Emperor> Nebula will retrieve them once this Story chamber is
complete."

"I'm aware of that."

"Something like that has happened thousands of times to them. Your
kindness means nothing to them."

"I'm also aware of that."

"They will perform the exact same roles in the exact same scenario in the
future, and forget all about you. They won't be able to remember anything
about you."

"Do the ones that can't remember anything…" I stared straight at Yoo
Joonghyuk and replied. "…also forget about their sorrow, too?"

His eyes staring back at me trembled powerfully. I remained still as he
continued to shiver. Was it because we had already reached the 94th
scenario? His face was covered with quite a few scars now.

"You…"

Before he could form a proper sentence, the kids arrived first. When I took
a closer look, though, our companions had ballooned up by one.
"As expected of my Mast… N-no, hang on. You're the Senior Brother in
this place, right? In any case, you were so cool! What was that technique
earlier? Please teach me that!"

Her energetic voice caused my heart to ache even before I noticed it.

Ah, I see. So, you were our 'Sha Wujing', then.

['Player 2' -nim has joined the group!]

"Hi~ Sun Wukong. Hey, you sure know how to run your mouth, don't
you?"

Lee Jihye, wearing a T-shirt with a large butterfly printed on it and chewing
on bubblegum, lightly slapped me on the shoulder and extended her hand to
me.

(And so, all the main actors of the [Journey to the West] have finally
gathered.)

I smiled faintly and extended my hand towards her. But then, my body
suddenly collapsed as if the ground beneath my feet had disappeared.

"Uh? What's wrong with him?"

Lee Jihye hurriedly supported my collapsing frame. As the faintest trace of
demonic aura leaked out from my body, my vision grew dim at the rate of
knots.

[Your Incarnation Body has currently sustained great damage!]

[Rate of Outer God transformation is accelerating!]

[Outer God transformation progress percentage: 71%]
It seemed that there weren't that many days remaining in my happiness-
filled journey.



⸢"I shall take these guys with me."⸥

Han Sooyoung heard the words coming out of the display panel and her jaw
dropped to the floor. Her lemon candy rolled around on the floor.

Lee Sookyung happened to be tidying up the vicinity just then; she
cautiously came closer and asked. "Did something happen?"

Han Sooyoung remained utterly stupefied until then, but her lips finally
began bobbing up and down a little. "N-no, wait. That guy…"

She looked at the list of characters on the holographic display.

[Player 1, 'Yoo Joonghyuk' -nim, is playing the role of 'Zhu Bajie'.]

[Player 2, 'Lee Jihye' -nim, is playing the role of 'Sha Wujing'.]

[Player 3, 'Lee Gilyoung' -nim, is playing the role of 'Tang Sanzang'.]

…

…

[Player 8, 'Watcher of Light and Darkness' -nim, is playing the role of 'Sun
Wukong'.]

She stared at that list for a very long time, then suddenly rubbed her eyes
while tilting her head back.

How long passed by like that?
Han Sooyoung let out "Ah, aaaah" noise, and started cackling away.

Lee Sookyung cautiously asked her again. "…Are you Black Flame Dragon
right now?"

"No, no. I'm Han Sooyoung. Han Sooyoung the moron, actually."

Han Sooyoung opened her eyes, her cheeks flushed ever so slightly.

Holographic messages began rising up one after the other.

[The declaration made by the applicable individual is welcomed by many
audience members.]

[A portion of judges are awarding additional points for 'twisting cliches'.]

[Current ranking of the applicable Story chamber is 25th.]

"You arrogant schmuck. Who asked you for your help?"

Her fingertips pressing on the key panel for some reason looked more
cheerful than before.

"Being number one is what I do best, you idiot."
                 Chapter 433: Ep. 82 - Outer God, II


The bitterness akin to the broth you'd get by boiling red ginseng spread
inside my mouth. I ended up unknowingly smacking my lips, prompting a
familiar voice to enter my ears.

"Uh? Looks like he's coming around. Put this in, too."

Someone forcibly pried my eyelids open and dropped a substance similar to
eye drops on my eyeballs, causing a really cold sensation to spread out and
help me regain my wits in an instant.

[Due to consuming new types of elixirs, your Incarnation Body's recovery
has accelerated.]

My vision was restored, and I found myself lying against the belly of a
horse. The White Dragon Horse – Chimera Dragon – of Tang Sanzang
neighed unhappily and glared at me.

"Oh, he's awake!"
I saw Lee Gilyoung's and Shin Yoosung's worry-filled faces brighten up.
Lee Jihye forcing my eyelids open was grinning as well.

"Hey, what will we do with you when you're too frail to ride on a bus?"

"Hmm, hmm. You're supposed to serve your Master, so it's no good for you
to be this feeble, you know?"

The boy put his hands on his waists and fake coughed. I grinned bitterly
and tried to prop my upper body up, and Shin Yoosung lent me a hand.

"Are you really alright? You fainted all of a sudden…"

"I'm feeling better, thanks to all of you. By the way, these elixirs…"

I looked at all the remnants of various elixirs around me. A few of them
were unfamiliar, but there was also one that I did recognise.

It was the eye drops contained in a reddish bottle, called 'Three Flowers and
Nine Fruits Sap' (三花九子膏), and was one of the treasures found within
the Journey to the West that could be earned by defeating the Yellow Wind
Demon King.

I was somewhat flustered by this and asked the kids. "…Did you use that
on me?"

For a moment there, I thought I could see Yoo Sangah's face in Shin
Yoosung's bright smile.

The 'Three Flowers and Nine Fruits Sap'. Just by putting some in your eye,
it restored energy in your body and expanded your eyesight.

[A portion of judges are satisfied by this attempt at reflecting the original
work!]

[10 additional points have been awarded!]
Actually, it was Sun Wukong who ended up using the 'Three Flowers and
Nine Fruits Sap' in the original storyline, too. However… to think, they
willingly spent an item on me that they could've used on themselves. For
some reason, I felt guilty about it.

I felt my right wrist getting numb so I took a look, only to see something
rather horrifying happening there.

"You're just as weak as that bastard. What's the matter with your
Incarnation Body?"

Yoo Joonghyuk was holding my right wrist with enough force to pop it like
a balloon while feeling for my pulse. Now that I thought about it, this guy
possessed the next best medical skills after Lee Seolhwa in our group.

He scowled deeply as he continued to observe my condition. "Not a single
blood vessel in your internal organs is intact. It's a miracle that you even
managed to participate in this scenario."

"…Is that so."

"It's rare to see a Constellation ending up in such a situation. Are you being
chased by someone?"

I looked at him with a bit of surprise.

There was no way he'd ask me that out of concern, so… Seeing how he was
firmly grasping the [Black Heavenly Demon Sword] with his free hand
from a while ago, I could more or less figure out what he was planning to
do here.

"No, it's not like that. I was just in an urgent need for this 'Giant Story' so I
didn't have enough time to recover my Incarnation Body."
"I shall end you right away if you prove to be a burden to this group even
for a second." Yoo Joonghyuk discarded my wrist like trash and stood up
from the spot. "…We've wasted precious elixirs."

Yoo Joonghyuk strode away and settled down on a nearby boulder to polish
the [Black Heavenly Demon Sword] again. It had been broken once before,
so its durability must've fallen by a quite lot now.

Lee Jihye, watching that, spoke to me. "My Master, no wait, my Senior
Brother is really cool, isn't he? Even though he's saying that, he was the
first person to recommend using elixirs on you." …That Yoo Joonghyuk
did?

I couldn't understand no matter how hard I thought about it. Even if I was
'Kim Dokja' and not the 'Watcher of Light and Darkness', he wouldn't
have…

– He's not as cold-blooded as you think.

I heard the dumpling [999]'s voice quietly enter my ear.

⸢"Do you still believe that you can understand someone through just a few
lines of text in a couple of chapters?"⸥
[999] told me that not too long ago.

He was right. Even though I knew his words were correct, I kept forgetting
them over and over again.

One's life would always be greater than a story written about him.

⸢Yoo Joonghyuk was always behind his companions.⸥
There were countless paragraphs in the 'Ways of Survival', but they couldn't
fully explain the time lived by Yoo Joonghyuk.

3rd turn, 4th, 5th… He always was looking at his companions from a
certain distance. He stood there and protected them, and faced off against
their enemies.

⸢"Yoo Joonghyuk, were you able to protect everything you wanted to
protect?"⸥
Always, he failed to protect those he had to protect.

Even then, he remained in the same spot.

It was quite likely that I'd never get to fully understand the depths of his
determination even if I died and woke up again.

Shin Yoosung walked over to Yoo Joonghyuk polishing his blade.

"Joonghyuk-ahjussi."

He looked back at her with his trademark disinterested eyes, and her small
hand pressed against his cheek. Upon closer inspection, a cream-type
ointment was applied there.

"…What are you doing?"

"Be still or it'll get infected, you know. Ah, don't turn your head!"

"Even without applying things like this…"

As if he was some kind of a vicious wild beast currently being tickled, Yoo
Joonghyuk's expression became rather complicated.

It took a single person's name to stop him from shooting up from his spot
and leave.
"Seolhwa unni asked me to do it. She said that ahjussi wouldn't care about
stuff like this so someone has to mind it for his sake."

Lee Seolhwa's name caused his shoulders to flinch rather grandly. He
seemed to be torn over his decision for a very long time, but then, settled
back down on the boulder awkwardly. He loudly declared in a charismatic
voice next. "Finish it in ten seconds or less."

Shin Yoosung giggled and nodded her head, and began rubbing the
ointment all over him energetically. His lips continued to twitch but he
didn't try to stop her.

The wounds on his body healed at a visible pace after her hands brushed
past them.

As expected, Lee Seolhwa's remarkable ointment was something else,
indeed. Back in the original story, the [Mass Production Maker] even
imported her ointment and sold them as a cosmetic product, too. What was
its name again? Was it 'Purest White Story Cream' or something?

"Bubble, hiss…"

My ears caught the sounds of onomatopoeia for the first time in a while, so
I looked to my side to see what was what, only to find Lee Gilyoung and
his figuratively-blazing eyes there.

As if he suddenly developed cross-eyes, the boy began alternating his gaze
between Yoo Joonghyuk and Shin Yoosung rapidly.

…Oh-ho?

Eventually, he began striding towards where the duo was in a vigorous
fashion as if he had made up his mind about something.

"Hey, Shin Yoosung!"
His calling prompted Yoo Joonghyuk and Shin Yoosung to look back at
him simultaneously. Lee Jihye sidled up next to me and nodded her head,
her expression one of contentment. "Finally, Gilyoung-ah. You have woken
up." [Judge, 'Sakyamuni's Successor', likes these young Tang Sanzangs.]

[A portion of audience members enjoy watching the adorable antics of
Tang Sanzangs.]

[20 additional points have been awarded.]

Lee Gilyoung hesitated greatly where he stood, unable to do anything under
the outpouring of attention other than bobbing his lips up and down. He had
started this whole thing, but his expression clearly showed that he had no
idea what to do next.

In the end, he resorted to shouting out, his face flushed beet red. "I'm gonna
apply Dokja hyung's ointment from now on!"

As if he had finally realized what needed to be said here, he spoke in a
triumphant voice next. "Got that? You'll be in charge of that sooty bastard
from here on!"

Lee Jihye dashed forward before I even realized it and smacked the back of
Lee Gilyoung's head. Unsurprisingly, the boy grandly faceplanted nose-first
into the ground.

"Why did you mention Kim Dokja there, you dumbass?!"

She pinched his ear and pulled him up to lecture him properly.

Meanwhile, Shin Yoosung watched the proceedings and shook her head,
before returning to her job of applying the ointment.

Yoo Joonghyuk was stroking his cheek in awkwardness as if he couldn't
really get used to the cream on his skin…
⸢Kim Dokja watched all these happen with a quiet smile.⸥

['The Fourth Wall' is gradually getting thicker.]

⸢As if, he was looking at a spectacle happening in the distance.⸥

The smartphone inside my inner pocket was busy creating paragraphs on its
own. As the texts floated up, I looked at my companions and thought to
myself.

Right, maybe I…

⸢Maybe in that moment, Kim Dokja made up his mind up over a certain
something for the first time ever.⸥



The transformation into the Outer God gradually sped up. What was once
71% soon became 75%, and it only took a proverbial blink to shoot past
80%.

But when it got around to 85%, it suddenly came to a dead stop.

It was all thanks to my companions looking after me.

"Here, eat this. Oh, and this, too."

As if it was inversely proportional to my 'infection' rate, the scenario clear
speed of my companions actually accelerated gradually. As expected, the
combination of the 94th scenario's Yoo Joonghyuk and Lee Jihye was
incredible to behold.

"Senior brother, over there!"

"Below us."
As befitting the disciples of the [Breaking the Sky Swordsmanship], they
were in perfect sync with one another.

The majority of the enemies were taken care of even before they could
approach us or come up with dastardly schemes against us. On top of that,
they even resorted to using power levels that surpassed the scope of the
original to suppress our enemies.

[Current rate of Journey to the West's progress: 43%]

[Story chamber ranking has improved!]

[Current ranking of the applicable Story chamber is 21st.]

[Judge, 'Golden-bodied Arhat', is happy with his current appearance as a
pretty young girl swordswoman.]

Shin Yoosung, now finding herself with nothing to do just like me,
muttered to no one in particular. "It'd been nice if Heewon unni and
Hyunsung ahjussi could come along, too."

It seemed that those two couldn't participate this time.

Lee Hyunsung wouldn't have woken up just yet. He had entered the final
phase of [Steel Transformation], so I figured that he'd be sleeping for a long
while. However, there should be no problem in regards to his life.

The real problem would be with after he had woken up, actually.

Whatever the case might have been, I thought that this scenario could come
to an end in less than ten days at our current pace.

And so, yet another day came to a close, and then another one, and
eventually, four days went by.

[Current rate of Journey to the West's progress: 64%]
[Current ranking of the applicable Story chamber is 15th.]

[A large number of competitors are keeping a hostile eye on the applicable
Story chamber.]

All I did during those four days was ride on the bus, sleep to my heart's
content, chat with my companions about nothing important, and consume a
ton of elixirs.

[Your Incarnation Body has recovered to a noticeable degree!]

[Energy is returning gradually to your Incarnation body.]

…It felt like my cheeks had become fatter by a bit, too.

As I enjoyed this abundant, easy-going life, Lee Jihye, Shin Yoosung and
Lee Gilyoung all observed me with satisfied expressions on their faces.

…As if they were farmers feeling happy about a pig growing all fat and
juicy and the like.

"Here! Eat this one, too!"

"Please, take this."

…Why were they so happy about me consuming these things, anyway?

Lee Jihye to my side complained a little while chuckling out. "They say that
if you can't get a pheasant, then get a chicken instead. I mean, it's nice to
see you eat well and be healthy, you know. If only we fed that guy as
diligently as we're doing now."

Time continued to tick by.

"Keu-heuk! This isn't over, Zhu Bajie!"

We encountered Han Myungoh playing different roles many times, and…
…We even ran into a potential helper of ambiguous identity, sporting a
wild beard as if 'he' was some sort of a Taoist deity or something.

[Hmm, hmm. I'm this mountain's deity spirit. I've learnt a long time ago that
you are on a noble journey to India. I have been waiting for you to reach
here so that I can provide you with a little bit of help…]

The kids cried out at the so-called 'deity spirit' blessed with a head full of
bright blonde hair and the obviously-fake beard.

"Hayoung unni!"

"Hayoung hyung!"
                Chapter 434: Ep. 82 - Outer God, III


[Uh-hum. I'm not this Hayoung-or-rather, but someone simply passing b…
Damn it, hey, Disciple Sun. Get over here and fetch this elixir already.]

The blondie mountain deity spirit promptly gave up on her acting and
called out to me.

Such a thing happened often back in the Journey to the West.

[A portion of judges are complaining that such events didn't need to be
imitated.]

[One additional point has been awarded.]

A spirit would suddenly pop out of nowhere and help out the group, saying
that it was the will of the Buddha-nim or something similar. Such blatant
acts of ignoring probability and deus ex machina ran rampant in the original
Journey to the West; so much so that I had to wonder whether it was the
very first 'lump all lucky coincidences to one person' type novel or not.
I courteously bowed a little and spoke. "Thank you for helping us out
always."

[…Only doing it because I've been told to.] Perhaps reminded of someone
right now, Jang Hayoung looked up at the sky with a resentful expression
and muttered to no one in particular. [Count yourself lucky… If I hadn't
been late, the role of the 'Demon King of Salvation' would've been mine…]

That came out so naturally, didn't it. It seemed that this role was supposed
to be Jang Hayoung's.

"…Why did you want to perform this role?"

She looked at me with distant eyes before shaking her head with a smirk.

[Well, yeah, you wouldn't know anything about how awesome the 'Demon
King of Salvation' actually is.]

I thought about it for a little while, before speaking up with a voice
overflowing with affection towards, uh, myself. "I also like the 'Demon
King of Salvation' very much."

[Oh, really? Have you heard some kind of Stories about him, then?]

"For instance, the 'Liberator of the Industrial Complex' he earned in the
Demon Realm."

[Oh-oh?]

That must've flipped a switch in her somewhere, because Jang Hayoung
suddenly started telling me a long-winded tale of her adventure. If I were to
simplify the contents somewhat, it went something like this.

[So like back then, I managed to rescue the dying 'Demon King of
Salvation', you see? So when you get right down to it, I actually saved the
'Demon King of Salvation'. So? It was fun, right? It wasn't…? In any case,
we came to a mutual understanding right below the Root of Darkness and
made a pledge of brotherhood. We worked together to liberate the
'Industrial
Complex' from the grips of a dastardly Demon Duke, and…!]

…The story was more or less accurate, but I couldn't be sure why it felt like
I was stuck listening to a novel being read here.

[And then, the 'Demon King of Salvation' looked at me with gloom-filled
eyes and said, "My dear friend, become my warrior that will fight for my
sake."]

I began wondering if it was alright to let a baseless story such as this one to
float around, but messages suddenly floated up in the air en masse before I
could do anything about it.

[Judge, 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband', is criticising the deity spirit's
nonsense!]

[Judge, 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband', is arguing that it was him who
performed the most heroics back in the Demon Realm!]

[Judge, 'Meihouwang', is ridiculing the 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband'.]

[Many audience members are getting interested in the Nebula <Kim
Dokja's Company>'s Story.]

As things stood, I couldn't really tell apart whether we were in the [Journey
to the West] or [Kim Dokja's Company's Disorganised Great Adventure
GetTogether].

Maybe, that was what Han Sooyoung was aiming for.

As the <Kim Dokja's Company>'s Story grew stronger, the potential 'Giant
Story' we'd earn through this [Journey to the West Remake] would also
become stronger, too.
[Stories of the <Kim Dokja's Company> are spreading throughout the <Star
Stream> via word of mouth.]

Well, we'd have to wait and see if that was ultimately a good decision or
not.

How long passed by like this? Lee Jihye yawned out of pure boredom and
spoke up. "Argh, just finish up and hand over the elixir, will you?"
[…Here.]




Another week went by.

We defeated countless Yogoes and also faced off against the Constellations
from <Emperor> that showed up to retrieve those creatures afterwards.

[Those Yogoes that you subjugated earlier were creatures that I raised in
my backya…]

"Scram."

Yoo Joonghyuk kicked them away instead of me. Seemingly wanting to
avoid fighting the 'Supreme King' Zhu Bajie, <Emperor>'s Constellations
went away willingly even though they expressed their dissatisfaction over
the matter.

[Outer God transformation progress percentage: 95%]

[Rate of your Outer God transformation has been slowed down.]

The rate of becoming an Outer God hadn't progressed all that much during
that time. On the other hand, our group's rate of advancing through the
Journey to the West was shockingly fast.
[Current rate of Journey to the West's progress: 94%]

We had finally broken past the 90% mark.

Lee Jihye spoke while panting breathlessly. "Wow, now that was really
tough."

"It seems that way, especially for today."

"What are you even talking about? You are just riding a bus, aren't you?"

I ignored her retort and confirmed the Story chamber ranking, instead.

[Current ranking of the applicable Story chamber is 4th.]

[Score: 21912]

[Many audience members are marvelling at the applicable Story chamber's
stunning rate of growth.]

It hadn't even been ten days, yet we had already brushed aside all the other,
starrier chambers and climbed up to the 4th rank. I couldn't help but respect
Han Sooyoung's talent, even if I didn't want to.

[Current number one in the rankings is the 'Real Journey to the West'.]

[Score: 30408]

With our current speed, I thought that it'd not be impossible to catch up to
Fei Hu, currently the undisputed number one in the rankings.

Of course, it was still too early to celebrate. The competition wouldn't end
even if we managed to surpass Fei Hu's chamber and claim the top spot.

Because the overall victor would be determined only after collating the total
voted points and the judges' opinions.
I looked up at the stars blinking high up in the night sky – at the
Constellations, currently listed as mere anonymous audience members.

[A portion of audience members are holding animosity towards you.]

Without a doubt, <Emperor> must be watching the rise of our ranking right
now.

⸢The pride <Emperor> feels about their 'Giant Story' is enormous.⸥

They would never accept their 'Giant Story' being inherited by a weak little
Nebula. Besides, there was a good reason for them to feel dissatisfied with
us, too.

Such as…

"There are a lot of them now, aren't they."

…The group of 'Yogoes' currently following us.

The ranks of 'Yogoes' filling up the footpath of the mountain were so
humongous that I couldn't even see their end anymore.

Every single one of them were creatures we had spared.

[The agreement with the Wenny King is underway.]

[In order to fulfil the agreement, you need to increase the shares of 'Outer
God' for the applicable Story to over 30%.]

[Currently, shares of 'Outer God' for the applicable scenario is 15.772%.]

The Journey to the West was marching closer to its end, yet the shares for
the 'Outer Gods' remained depressingly low. I had saved that many Yogoes,
but the percentage was only over 15…
But then again, it was pretty obvious why. Sure, there were a lot of them,
but they didn't impact our story all that much. Meaning, the core of the
'Journey to the West' hadn't changed. They had been participating as mere
'extras' on this stage and not as its main actors.

The only reason why their shares had risen past 15% was simply because
many in the audience ended up paying attention to this rather abnormal
situation, that was all.

[Many audience members are looking at the 'Pilgrimage' in awe.]

[A portion of judges are focusing on the possibility of a new 'Journey to the
West'.]

[A small number of judges are worried about the perversion of the
original…]

This march of the Yogoes even earned a nickname, to boot: the Pilgrimage.

Countless Yogoes, journeying to India so that they could become
enlightened on their existence.

[A portion of audience members are entering the applicable scenario in
order to view the 'Pilgrimage'.]

Heck, recommendations for our Story chamber even showed up in the
'Journey to the West' recommendation bulletin board, too.

[Cool Zhu Bajie and Sha Wujing, adorable Tang Sanzang, and the soft Sun
Wukong.]

 –         Review: Zhu Bajie is so cool, and Tang Sanzangs are super cute,
 too.
['I've become the retired SSSSS-rank', a masterpiece that initially sounds
like a mass-produced Story.]

Author: Non-Mass Production Maker

 –        Review: In all honesty, the real protagonists of the 'Journey to
 the West' are'Yogoes'. Sun Wukong, Zhu Bajie, Sha Wujing, they are all
 'Yogoes'. Yet the Journey to the West's theme is infinitely closer to
 'humanism'. It's because all the Yogoes appearing in the original had been
 humanised extensively from a human's perspective. Meaning, Yogoes
 from the Journey to the West had to live as 'humans' after their status as
 Yogoes had been stolen from them…

…It felt as if the names of the authors were kind of familiar, but that must
be a mistake on my part. Surely.

Whatever the case might have been, we were getting quite a few puzzling
recommendations.

"They are still following us…"

Shin Yoosung walking at the rear of the group next to me kept glancing
behind her as if something was bothering her. She seemed to hesitate
slightly, but then, extended her hand out to a Yogoe acting like a puppy by
her feet.

"…Hi?"

I was slightly nervous about the Yogoe suddenly attacking her, but
thankfully, what I feared didn't happen.

Yogoe crouched like an obedient puppy and rubbed its nose against the tip
of her fingers. This guy was no longer the terrifying 'Outer God' that I knew
of.

[SowarmSowarmSowarmSowarm]
They were not the 'demonic beasts' that Shin Yoosung could tame. Well,
'Outer Gods' weren't designated as one of those friendly lifeforms, after all.
They were simply 'things' that lost their usefulness, wandering around on
the outside of scenarios.

Even then, Shin Yoosung carefully paid attention to them with a serious
expression on her face.

[YoosungYoosungYoosungYoosungYoosung]

[NamemeNamemeNamemeNamemeNameme]

Did she actually understand them?

Could she understand their words and see what their real appearance was?

I hesitated a little before asking her. "Aren't you afraid?"

"Not at all. It's like, when I keep looking at them, I find them kind of cute,
in a way. And…"

Small tentacles resembling those of an octopus tickled the back of her hand
like a stoke of foxtail.

"…A person I like appeared like this once before."

Suddenly, a short bout of migraine and dizziness rushed in along with a
zing in my head.

[Exclusive skill, 'Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint' level 2, is forcibly
activating!]

⸢Maybe, he could be here with us this time, too.⸥

I saw her determined eyes scanning the ranks of Yogoes and bit down hard
on my lip.
[Notice to all Constellation-nims currently participating in the scenario.]

An unannounced broadcast suddenly came from somewhere.

The surrounding atmosphere trembled and Yogoes all looked up at the sky
with worried expressions.

[TheycomingTheycomingTheycomingTheycoming]

[DontlikeDontlikeDontlikeDontlikeDontlike]

Cries of the 'Outer Gods' rose up from here and there.

A Great Dokkaebi appearing as a semi-transparent figure was being
transmitted in the sky above.

[The 'Journey to the West Remake' scenario is gradually inching towards its
conclusion. I heard that recently, due to the point gap between the upper
ranks and the middle being too great, many Constellation-nims are half-way
giving up on the scenario itself.]

What an ominous-sounding opening remark that was.

[<Star Stream> is fair with its opportunities. An eel that struggles can
become a Dragon, and inversely, a Dragon ruling the sky can also fall to the
ground, as well.]

For a moment there, the Great Dokkaebi seemed to have glanced in our
direction.

[So, ending things here would leave behind a bit of a sour taste, wouldn't
you say?]

"Uh? What's going on?!"
Along with Lee Jihye's loud yell, our surroundings began transforming. As
the rays of bright light exploded, our group as well as the Yogoes had been
transferred to the bank of a massive river.

[Story chambers are being consolidated!]

[The 'I've become the retired SSSSS-rank Sun Wukong' has been
incorporated into the 'Giant Story'.]

(Sun Wukong knew which river this was.)

(They were now in the western riverbank of Tongtian River. This was the
final hurdle before reaching India.)

The Great Dokkaebi laughed. [Deciding the first spot through just the score
alone is not amusing. However, isn't 'finding out which 'Story' is stronger'
the natural law of <Star Stream>?]

[Many audience members are cheering on and agreeing with that
declaration!]

[A small number of audience members are smacking their lips!]

[A portion of judges are frowning at the interference of a Great Dokkaebi.]

As the messages streamed in, large pillars of light began flashing in various
spots of the riverside.

[421st Story chamber has been consolidated!]

[The 'My Sun Wukong is broken from a certain point on' has been
incorporated into the 'Giant Story'.]

We found another group exactly like ours over there.

The stunned-silly Lee Gilyoung shouted out. "Who are those people?!"
That group also featured Sun Wukong, Tang Sanzang, Zhu Bajie, Sha
Wujing, and the White Dragon Horse.

Indeed, they were a 'Journey to the West' expedition team from another
Story chamber.

[7133rd Story chamber has been consolidated!]

[The 'I thought I was Sun Wukong but I was just a regular monkey' has
been incorporated into the 'Giant Story'.]

[6523rd Story chamber has been consolidated!]

[The 'Omniscient Sun Wukong Ruyi Bang's Viewpoint' has been
incorporated into the 'Giant Story'.]

As the pillars of light continued to descend, many 'Sun Wukongs' revealed
themselves on the riverbanks. Some possessed weak Status, while some
others possessed mighty ones. And then…

[1st Story chamber has been consolidated!]

[The 'Real Journey to the West' has been incorporated into the 'Giant

Story'.] …Some even possessed an overwhelming Status, too.

Every single one making up that particular Story chamber was among the
top elite of elite Constellations.

The 'Sun Wukong' currently ranked number one was looking over in our
direction, his eyes burning in the pale-blue ghostly flames.

…As expected, it had come down to this.
I had been anticipating that something like this might happen. Because at
the rate the things were going, Fei Hu's side would've lost to us in the points
tally.

[A portion of judges are worried about your safety.]

[Judge, 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband', is furious at this development!]

[Judge, 'Bimawen', is getting curious about the conclusion of this scenario.]

[Judge, 'Meihouwang', orders you to sweep every one of these people

away!]

Not only that, the main judges were already siding with us to boot, too.
Indeed, that side probably had no choice but to do something before the
situation worsened even further for them.

[Details of the main scenario have been updated!]

The voice of the Great Dokkaebi resounded out next.

[And so, the final event of the 'Journey to the West Remake' will start now.]
                Chapter 435: Ep. 82 - Outer God, IV


[The final event of the 'Journey to the West Remake' will start now.]

Jung Heewon bit her lip as she listened to the voice coming out of the panel
in the air. She wanted to be there as well. She wanted to fight alongside her
companions.

"…Hyunsung-ssi."

However, she couldn't go because of the man lying in slumber on the
hospital bed. It was Lee Hyunsung, currently covered from head to toe in
steel, with no signs of a heartbeat.

He hadn't recovered from the damage he suffered during the 'Great War of
Saints and Demons'.

The mirror next to the bed reflected Jung Heewon's hair, now half-covered
in a silver colour. Another after-effect from the aforementioned Great War.
– You take a breather for a bit. I don't have any roles to give you, anyway.

She understood very well that this was Han Sooyoung's, and her
companions', way of showing their concern towards her.

She had been inflicted with simply too heavy a wound. Both her body and
mind were in a mess. She failed to rescue Kim Dokja again, and the man
trying to protect her had fallen into a coma. That was how the sharpest
blade in the <Kim Dokja's Company> had lost her edge.

Her [Sword of Judgement] resting against a corner of the bed trembled
noticeably.

This weapon would vibrate only when 'evil' was nearby. A weapon that
Kim Dokja had gifted her. Its tip was pointing straight at the display panel.
Perhaps it also knew that the place she should be right now wasn't here.

Jung Heewon cautiously reached out and as if to pacify the blade, embraced
its hilt.

[Constellation, 'Demon-like Judge of Fire', is looking at her Incarnation
with a helpless expression.]

As a result of the Great War of Saints and Demons, both <Eden> and the
Demon Realm had collapsed. Countless Archangels and Demon Kings
died, and the 'justice' Jung Heewon believed in couldn't be found there.

Even then, she had to wield this sword.

It was then that she felt a subtle movement on the bed.

"Hyunsung-ssi!"

How long ago did it happen? Lee Hyunsung had opened his eyes and was
staring at the display panel. His lips bobbed up and down, trying to say
something.
"…Excuse me?"

She pressed her head closer, but still couldn't hear his voice. His lips moved
slowly. She began recognising the shapes of his lips.

Can't.

Lose.

Again.

Her fists clenched tightly once more. Her fury began rising up. Why was he
being like this? Even when his body had ended up in this state.

Jung Heewon couldn't suppress her emotions any longer and was about to
grasp his hand, but then, his entire body suddenly began transforming.

He emitted blinding rays of silvery light, before shrinking down and
becoming a single sword.

"What is this…?!"

She was so stunned that she inadvertently let go of this new version of Lee
Hyunsung.

Now lying on the bed, the blade Lee Hyunsung began sobbing. As if that
was the only thing he could right now.

She vacantly fell on her butt, lowered her head and muttered softly. "Just
what are you trying to…"

It was then when the hospital room's door flung open.

She looked back to find Han Sooyoung there, even though she should've
been working as the 'Scenario Master'.

"Jung Heewon."
The moment she heard that voice, Jung Heewon's heart began beating even
faster.

And just like her, the sword of steel shuddered on top of the bed. She knew
very well what the heart of that weapon was thinking about.

Everyone had their own ways of enduring against the world.

She slowly reached out to the Steelsword and while tightly grasping its hilt,
raised her voice. "You have a role available for me, yes?"




As the Great Dokkaebi's voice resounded out, a new scenario window
popped up in the air.
[Linked Main Scenario is starting!]


  <Main Scenario #95 – Owner of the [Journey to the West]>

  Type: Main

  Difficulty: Indeterminable

  Clear condition: Break past the horde of Yogoes and acquire the⸢Sacred
  Texts⸥ on the other side of the Tongtian River.

  Time limit: 2 hours

  Reward: Giant Story related to the 'Journey to the West', 5,000,000
  Coins, ???

  Failure: -

  * The applicable scenario contains a hidden 'piece'.


Almost at the same time, the water level of the Tongtian River swelled up
rapidly. Walls of water rushed in like tsunami waves and instantly filled up
the surroundings.

Right afterwards, the screeches and howls of the Yogoes blanketed the sky.

[KillthemKillthemKillthemKillthemKillthem]

[AhAhAhAhAhAhAh]

The horde boasted far greater numbers than the Yogoes following us
currently.

[Current shares of 'Outer God' for the applicable scenario is 15.872%.]
The remaining 'Outer God' shares to fulfil the agreement with the Wenny
King were 14.128%.

Meaning, I had to reach the rest of the amount during this event.

[WuWuWuWuWu…]

I looked back to see the Yogoes making up the 'Pilgrimage' with us were
howling out towards the sky.

[Well, then, I shall be anticipating a wonderful finale to this scenario.]

The Great Dokkaebi vanished, and as more pillars of light descended, the
'protagonists' from other Journey to the West began making their entrance.

"Let's go!"

"The sacred texts are ours!"

The crowd from all the consolidated Story chambers were scything past the
Tongtian's waters to advance forward.

"I'm the real Sun Wukong!"

Some rode on the Somersault Cloud, while others resorted to magic spells
to fly over the river's tumbling water. It seemed that they were planning to
cross this river by gliding over it.

Unfortunately, that was a really bad decision to make, if my knowledge on
the 'Journey to the West' was correct.

[All skills and Stigmas related to 'Flight' are restricted from use in the
applicable scenario.]

Powerful sparks danced in the sky and everyone flying in the air crashed
into the river below along with their screams.
"What's the meaning of this?!"

After falling into the river water, the members of other Story chambers
began shouting in anger at the Great Dokkaebi up in the air. However, it
simply shrugged its shoulders nonchalantly.

I looked at this spectacle and spoke up. "This journey wouldn't have any
meaning to it if we were allowed to fly from the beginning."

Yoo Joonghyuk next to me muttered out as if he was chewing on his words.
"…Everything happening here is also destined to become a Story, is it."

"That's correct."

In the end, the 'Journey to the West' was a story of travelling on a tough
road in great adversity.

Even if you were travelling on the same road, choosing how to travel
changed the story greatly. Traversing the distance that could be bridged in
one day by riding on the Somersault Cloud, for over 14 years while
surviving and enduring against all sorts of trials and tribulations – because
such a 'Story' existed, the sacred texts at the end of the journey now had
meaning to its existence, too.

(And so, the final hurdle to this very story was waiting for the travelling
group.)

Lee Gilyoung heard the narration and softly grumbled to himself. "…I'm
not very good at swimming, though."

The Tongtian River was truly wide.

Since not everyone could ride on the back of Tang Sanzang's White Dragon
Horse, we had to swim across the river to get to the other side.
For sure, several teams had already jumped into the water and started
swimming vigorously. It was unknown where those things had been
acquired, but well, some teams were busy paddling their boats forward,
while some others were riding on logs, propelling themselves forward by
using wind magic.

Lee Jihye watched that unfolding spectacle and lightly slapped the boy's
shoulder before stepping forward. "Hey, don't worry about it. We aren't
going to do that."

Along with her confident voice, a new message came from the sky above.

[An audience member is revealing himself.]

[Constellation, 'Maritime War God', is nodding his head.]

…I had completely forgotten about him.

"Come, Geobukseon!"

[Giant Story, 'Next City', has begun its storytelling!]

Lee Jihye raised her Twin Dragon Sword up high into the sky.

The river water before us parted in the middle and the hull of a massive
battleship rose up to the surface accompanied by a magnificent light show.

Several Incarnations getting swept up by the waves screamed out.

"What the hell?! What's this??"

The battleship sporting a turtle-like back and the head of a dragon – the
[Turtle Dragon]. The Star Relic Lee Jihye and the kids earned by clearing
the 'Next City' scenario revealed itself before our very eyes.
However, I couldn't help but wonder if it was okay for us to ride that.
Because in the 'Journey to the West'…

[Star Relic, 'Turtle Dragon', corresponds with the ⸢Journey to the West
Remake⸥!]
(As the group fell into danger and struggled to move forward, a gigantic
white turtle Yogoe appeared to give them a ride.)

[A portion of judges are satisfied by the minutely-detailed reflection of the
original story.]

[20 additional points have been awarded!]

…To think that such an event happened in the 'Journey to the West'. What
an excellent development that was.

We quickly climbed aboard the battleship.

"Set sail!"

Along with Lee Jihye's loud yell, the battleship rapidly advanced forward
while splitting the river water.

The teams crossing the water before us all looked at the battleship with
dazed, forlorn faces. Although unfortunate, we didn't have the leeway to
worry about them at the moment.

"Uhm… Unni, please do your best not to harm the Yogoes."

"Don't worry."

I couldn't tell where she learned to drive, but well, Lee Jihye utilised her
preternatural driving skill to evade the horde of Yogoes rushing at us. Not
only that, the Yogoes trying to attack us with animosity flinched and
stopped after spotting all the other Yogoes riding on our ship.
[Who ar e y ou gu ys?]

A portion of the Yogoes that joined the 'Pilgrimage' were hanging on the
battleship, while the rest was crossing the river right behind the vessel.

Perhaps these creatures interfered with their own journeys, the Sun
Wukongs from other Story chambers began wielding their Ruyi Bangs.

"Those sons of bitches…!"

The enraged Lee Jihye clenched her fists tightly, but it was not possible to
save everyone. The deaths of Yogoes were unfolding all over the Tongtian
River, after all.

[Gu-waaaaahk!]

The members of other Story chambers advanced forward while slaughtering
Yogoes blocking their paths. Yogoe's flesh and blood rained down from
everywhere.

[A large number of audience members are cheering on this spectacle of
slaughter!]

Yogoes continued to die. The monsters that didn't earn their meanings
because they failed to create their Stories. They were sacrifices offered up
to complete this 'Journey to the West'.

The novel, 'Journey to the West'. A lengthy journey for the goal of
transcending one's humanity.

To let the audience watching the Story reach enlightenment of their own,
Yogoes had to be buried under this Tongtian River's waters.

"Kill them! Kill them all!"
These protagonists of the 'Journey to the West' supposedly walking on the
road of enlightenment used the dead Yogoes as their bridge and tried to
cross the Tongtian River. Innumerable Yogoes became their footholds, and
those unfortunate protagonists from some Story chambers who got killed
off also became another foothold for someone else.

Sadly, no one would remember the names of the footholds.

[Our st ories are]

[I wa nted to con ti nue but]

If only they could live.

And if only they could become the main characters of this 'Giant Story'…

"Myungoh ahjussi, just stay still, will ya! I'm telling you, it's safe here."

"Safe, my ass! You think I'll fall for that again?!"

[Stigma, 'One-legged Swift Horse Lv.???' is ready to activate.]

Whether one's leg was cut off or its arm was lost… That creature would be
remembered by this world.

[7133rd Story chamber's entire roster has been annihilated.]

[487th Story chamber's entire roster has been annihilated.]

With every passing second, the number of Story chambers being ejected
continued to increase. And as if to proportionally match that figure, the
number of Yogoes crashing down also increased exponentially.

[AhAhAhAhAhAh]

[SavemSavemSavemeSavemeSaveme]
[Currently, shares of 'Outer God' for the applicable scenario is 15.773%.]

The 'Outer God' shares that I worked so hard to increase began dropping
little by little. Even though so many Yogoes still remained…

[Currently, shares of 'Outer God' for the applicable scenario is 14.973%.]

And then, the shares began tumbling down at an alarming rate next.

[Currently, shares of 'Outer God' for the applicable scenario is 14.473%.]

But then again, maybe it was an obvious result.

Because they were villains to be defeated in this world, not its main
characters.

[AhAhAhAhAhAhAh]

Perhaps he noticed the direction of my gaze, Yoo Joonghyuk suddenly
began talking to me. "…Surely, you fool must've realized this. You can't
save everyone."

Those words hurt especially more so because they came from Yoo
Joonghyuk himself.

"Like what you said earlier, it's because this is a 'Story'."

His eyes were now looking at the dead Yogoes beneath the surface of the
water.

Because this was a Story, not everyone could be saved. I knew exactly what
those words meant.

"Not everything in this world can become its protagonist."

<Episode 82. Outer God, IV
                 Chapter 436: Ep. 82 - Outer God, V


An extra couldn't become a main character.

And the 'Outer Gods' couldn't even serve as the extras, so they were being
forced out of the 'Story'.

The dying Yogoes were looking up at us.

[IcouldalsodoitIcouldalsodoit]

[CaptainCaptainCaptainCaptain]

[WhoamIWhoamIWhoamIWhoamI]

Yoo Joonghyuk couldn't hear those voices.

I thought that might be a good thing.
"All you can do right now is to let everyone know that they exist here." He
stared past the fog-covered Tongtian River and spoke. "With that… You
have done everything you set out to do."

What I set out to do.

As if to respond to our conversation, the narration suddenly began yapping
on.

(The best they could do was to let the world know that Yogoes were in this
place.)

Perhaps Han Sooyoung was feeling as much indignation and grief as I had.

The Tongtian's water rained down, corpses of Yogoes floating away on the
river's surface.

[Many audience members are resonating with the theme of ⸢I've become the
retired SSSSS-Grade Sun Wukong⸥.]
[A portion of judges are currently feeling melancholic.]

Extras were just that, extras, while the main character would be the main
character.

A story where everyone could become its protagonist didn't exist.

I knew that.

[Judge, 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband', is repeatedly grabbing and
letting go of his hair.]

[Judge, 'Bimawen', is contemplating on the lives of the Yogoes.]

[Judge, 'Meihouwang', is asking, although he isn't sure, if they could all be
saved.]
However, even if that was true…

[Shares of 'Outer God' are tumbling lower at an alarming rate.]

[Current shares of 'Outer God' for the applicable scenario is 13.473%.]

I just couldn't be satisfied with this result and end it here.

[Scenario Master is now looking at you.]

It seemed that perhaps Han Sooyoung was thinking along the same line.

"It's the turtle! Steal it!"

Several uninvited guests clambered up on the side of the [Turtle Dragon]
and shouted out. They were from other Story chambers, feeling envious of
our ship.

"Get rid of them! As soon as we kill…"

Unfortunately for them, they picked the wrong opponents today.

Slice!

Lee Jihye's [Twin Dragon Sword] sliced off the head of a hapless Sun
Wukong that landed on the deck.

[Judge, 'Meihouwang', is rubbing his neck with a spooked expression.]

The Sun Wukong who lost his head fell back into the river water, unable to
even mouth a scream. Sha Wujing and Zhu Bajie freaked out from that
sight, roared out loudly, and landed on the deck next.

"You insolent…!"

"Seeing that you're still sticking to the script, you guys aren't going to win."
Lee Jihye's [Kendo] mercilessly slashed out and split the air apart, while
Lee Gilyoung and Shin Yoosung also ran to her sides to use their
experienced fists and kicks to punt other Incarnations off the deck. Chimera
Dragon had morphed into a full-on Dragon Horse and flapped its wings to
create a powerful gust of wind. "You measly little…!"

Yoo Joonghyuk had already climbed up to the highest point in the ship by
then. He unsheathed his weapon with an icy-cold expression. Sparks
danced violently on the blade of his [Black Heavenly Demon Sword].

Breaking the Sky Thunder Blade.

His sword attack, capable of even shattering the heavens, slammed into the
waters of the Tongtian like a thunderclap.

"Kuwaaaahk!!"

Incarnations were roasted black by the azure-blue lightning and exploded
like fireworks. Only then the surviving ones realize the severity of their
current situation and yelled out to each other.

"How the hell can a Zhu Bajie be that strong?!"

"C-could it be, that Pigsy is…??"

"It's them!! They are the main characters from [I've become the retired
SSSSS-Grade Sun Wukong]!!"

…It seemed that our identity had been exposed now.

[Hidden information of the scenario is now open to the public.]

[Your Story chamber ranking will rise up by defeating the main characters
from another Story chamber with a higher ranking.]
"Even if we don't get our hands on the sacred texts, our ranking will rise if
we just kill them!"

After reaching the higher rankings, even if they didn't win the event, they
could still enjoy quite the amount of rewards.

"Kill him!! Hunt down that Zhu Bajie first!"

Dozens of actors rushed in towards the battleship while stepping on the
corpses of the Yogoes. Some of them happened to be quite powerful
Incarnations as well as Constellations.

I urgently looked back at my companions, but they didn't seem to be
flustered at all.

"I guess it might get a little more entertaining now."

"Sun Wukong, be still and stay back."

Lee Jihye grinned and unleashed her Status.

[Giant Story, 'Next City', has begun its storytelling!]

[Constellation, 'Maritime War God', is revealing his Status!]

Under Lee Gilyoung's and Shin Yoosung's control, the Dragon Horse
regained its former appearance of the Jade Dragon.

Ku-ohhhh!!

At the same time, energy from powerful Stories exploded out of my
companions' Incarnation Bodies.

[Giant Story, 'Demon Realm's Spring', has begun its storytelling!]

[Giant Story, 'Torch that Swallowed the Myth', has begun its storytelling!]
The Chimera Dragon breathed out fire from the sky and dissipated the
Tongtian's waters, and Yoo Joonghyuk dashed in and out among the rising
screen of vapour.

Slice! Slice!!

Every time jet-black light flashed, Sun Wukongs and Zhu Bajies with
unknown names died in droves.

I shuddered from that sight. I knew that my companions were powerful, but
I still didn't expect them to be this strong. This was the result of them
surviving many nonsensical scenarios up to this point.

"Kuwaaaahk!"

Participating in the 95th scenario together didn't mean that everyone's level
was the same.

It was rather similar to the 'Journey to the West' itself.

People's methods of reaching its end destination were all different. Some
wanted to fly in comfort, while some would only select the easiest roads to
walk on.

However, the members of the <Kim Dokja's Company> were different.

(They arrived at this point in time through the hardest method there was.)

They couldn't fly nor could they choose to tread the easiest paths. They
walked on their own two legs again and again.

They beat back many unfair trials and tribulations, endured against
misfortunes, and while holding back their grief, they reached this far with
their own strengths.

(And the result of that was this.)
This story's true protagonists were them, receiving the blinding light of
grace belonging to the 'Giant Stories'. As I bore witness to this spectacle, I
began recalling a certain old memory.

(That place back in the 1863rd turn was also the 95th scenario.)

I wanted to show this to Han Sooyoung of the 1863rd turn. I wanted to tell
her. Just like how you had proved it to me, there were people here who also
had survived, as well.

(This is the story of the 3rd turn that you don't know.)

Yoo Joonghyuk number [999] sitting on my shoulder was also watching
this unfolding spectacle.

What would the one who lost his own regression turn and entered this
worldline, think about after taking in this sight?

[Story chamber ranking has risen up!]

[Many audience members and judges are awarding additional points!]

Our Story chamber's ranking climbed really quickly.

It seemed there were a few actors from higher-ranked Story chambers than
ours mixed in among all the assailants coming after us.

[Story chamber ranking has risen up!]

[Score: 26412]
[Current ranking of the applicable Story chamber is 2nd.]

Finally, second place.

We had brushed aside thousands of other chambers and finally reached the
cusp of victory. That only served to make me more anxious, however.

[Current shares of 'Outer God' for the applicable scenario is 13.142%.]

Even as the real protagonists were leaving their mark, the deaths of those
relegated to the role of extras continued on unabated. So, the shares of the
'Outer Gods' continued to plummet.

In order to fulfil the agreement of the Wenny King, the shares had to
exceed 30%. Even if our chamber won this 'Giant Story' event, everything
would go back to square one if I failed to uphold that agreement.

Booooom!!

The hull of the battleship was rocked to the side just then.

Powerful magical cannon shells were raining down from beyond the fog of
the battlefield.

"What the hell?! Which arseholes…?"

Lee Jihye quickly regained her balance and activated her Stigma.

[Character, 'Lee Jihye', has activated the 'Ghost Fleet Lv.10'!]

A dozen phantom ships rose up on either side of the [Turtle Dragon] and
commenced firing at once. Caught between the exchange of a vast number
of cannon shells, the Incarnations and Yogoes in the surroundings were
vaporised without a chance to even scream in pain.
Soon, the shelling stopped and dozens of battleships revealed themselves
from the murky fog of the cannon smoke.

[Constellation, 'Maritime War God', is gasping out.] Ku-

gugugugu.

Those ships had surrounded ours in a crane wing-like formation.

Even if the 'Maritime War God' was an excellent Constellation when it
came to naval warfare, there simply were way too many enemies this time.
Not only that…

"…Fei Hu."

As I listened to Yoo Joonghyuk's heavy voice, I spotted a certain someone
standing on the gunwhale of the opposing ship.

The protagonist of the Story chamber ranked number 1, the [Real Journey
to the West], was there.

It seemed that they had prepared the battleships in advance. And their
numbers vastly outstripped ours.

"Aren't they Narrative-grade Constellations?"

We also spotted other members of the [Real Journey to the West]. As
expected, the roles of Zhu Bajie and Sha Wujing were played by
<Emperor>'s Constellations.

Zhu Bajie was played by the Master of the Three-Pointed Double-Edged
Spear, Erlang Shen.

Meanwhile, it seemed that the actor for Sha Wujing was the third son of
Vaisravana, Prince Nezha.
They were actual characters from the original 'Journey to the West', and
Sun Wukong's old foes as well.

It was not for nothing that the saying of 'Victory is already Fei Hu's' did the
rounds back in the original 'Ways of Survival'. The actual Constellations
from the 'Journey to the West' made their appearance as Fei Hu's team
members, so it was only obvious that the Constellations from other
chambers didn't even stand a chance against them.

[A portion of audience members have revealed their identities.]

[Constellations of the Nebula, <Emperor>, are looking at Fei Hu's
battlefield.]

Not only that, even the lights from the constellations of the '28 Mansions'
were glittering behind them, too.

Those gazes, implying that they'd enter the battlefield at any given moment,
presented us with incredible pressure just by being there.

Yoo Joonghyuk scanned the battlefield and spoke. "I don't see their Tang
Sanzang."

Now that he mentioned it, I couldn't see their Tang Sanzang, either.

The one to receive the sacred texts in the original story was Tang Sanzang.
So, they wouldn't have stashed him somewhere safe under the current
situ… No, hang on. If the person tasked with retrieving the sacred texts was
supposed to be Tang Sanzang, then…

"I think something is busy running away over there?"

At the place Lee Gilyoung pointed at, we could see battleships hurriedly
distancing themselves away from here.
It seemed that a portion would remain behind and block us, while the rest
would set sail towards the 'sacred texts'.

Which meant that Fei Hu's Tang Sanzang was somewhere among those
fleeing ships.

"They are planning to secure the 'sacred texts' while wasting our time here."

Lee Jihye loudly yelled out. "Dammit! I'll take care of this place, so go
ahead!"

One of the ships from the [Ghost Fleet] came to our side and Yoo
Joonghyuk, Lee Gilyoung, Shin Yoosung and I climbed onboard it. The
phantom ship then also began rushing forward in great haste.

Kuwaaaaah!!

I wasn't worried about Lee Jihye. She was now a respectable admiral. As
long as the battle was fought on water and not anywhere else, she'd not lose
even if she failed to eke out a victory.

The real problem was with this side.

One of the enemy battleships accurately blocked our route and stuck close
to our side.

And it was the ship containing Fei Hu and his companions.

"So, you are the <Kim Dokja's Company>."

This particular Sun Wukong had piercing blue eyes. He stared at us as if he
had just discovered strange lifeforms.

Yoo Joonghyuk unsheathed his [Black Heavenly Demon Sword] once more
and stood in front of us, wary of his new opponent.
[Constellation, 'Master of Three-Pointed Double Edged Spear', is
unleashing his Status!]

[Constellation, 'Third Son of Vaisravana', is unleashing his Status!]

They must've decided to give up on their roles at this point. Both Erlang
Shen and Prince Nezha began sending warning signals in our direction from
the get-go. That wasn't all.

[Constellations of the 28 Mansions of the Nebula, <Emperor>, are
preparing to descend.]

[Lords of the Nine Stars of the Nebula, <Emperor>, are preparing to
descend!]

…Goddammit.

I spoke sarcastically. "I guess you can't do anything without your Nebula's
help?"

"<Emperor> is me, and I'm <Emperor>. It's even more foolish not to utilise
what's yours already."

Even the current Yoo Joonghyuk wouldn't be able to deal with the situation
if both the '28 Mansions' and the permanent fixture of the sky, 'Nine Stars',
decided to descend here.

Besides, they were the original characters from 'Journey to the West', so
they didn't even need to spend all that much Probability to enter, either.

Goddammit, we were basically trapped in the playground set in
<Emperor>'s backyard.

"There is one thing I wish to confirm, however."

Fei Hu pulled out his Ruyi Bang and began unleashing his real Status.
The candidate for the strongest Incarnation back in the original 'Ways of
Survival', Fei Hu.

I had seen his face several times before today, but never did we get into a
conflict with him until now.

But that made sense, considering that he was the gold-spoon Incarnation
greatly coddled and protected by <Emperor>.

[Giant Story, 'Inheritor of the Heavenly Palace', has begun its storytelling!]

[Giant Story, 'Survivor of Great War of Righteous and Evil', has begun its
storytelling!]

Fei Hu had diligently earned his own Giant Stories in places we weren't
aware of. While receiving support that was on another scale compared to
ours.

[Giant Story, 'Successor of Chiyou', has begun…]

Shin Yoosung watched those Stories appear and muttered out as if she was
puzzled by something. "…Isn't 'Chiyou' a Korean Story?"

Perhaps that got under his skin, Fei Hu scowled deeply and flung a sword
aura in our direction.

Yoo Joonghyuk blocked that. Accompanied by the loud "Clang!", the crack
in the [Black Heavenly Demon Sword] grew even more noticeable.

Fei Hu's eyes flickered as if he was amused by something. "Not bad. So,
you're that Zhu Bajie."

Fei Hu was strong. However, the current Yoo Joonghyuk was more than
enough to defeat him, no matter how strong he was now.
The actual problem laid with the [Black Heavenly Demon Sword]. With his
main weapon damaged, Yoo Joonghyuk wouldn't even be able to exert 70%
of his overall strength.

"I heard that Korea's greatest Incarnation is with <Kim Dokja's Company>.
That must be you, then."

As if he was waiting for this moment, Yoo Joonghyuk stepped forward.

Yoo Joonghyuk versus Fei Hu.

The battle of the century was about to get underway.

However, I couldn't continue riding the bus and spectate anymore. Because
that side still had Erlang Shen and Prince Nezha as well.

[Current Incarnation Body recovery rate: 71%]

[Outer God transformation rate: 96%]

[Rate of Outer God transformation currently is in a slowed-down state.]

Unfortunately, there was no way I could fight against those two in my
current condition.

Shuruerueng…

The first one to make their move was Fei Hu's camp.

Prince Nezha's divine weapons emitted gloriously brilliant rays of light,
while a stunning level of Status exploded out from Fei Hu's body.

At the same time, a clump of light suddenly wavered in the air.

[Player 9-nim has joined the ⸢I've become the retired SSSSS-Grade Sun
Wukong⸥ as an 'Extra'!]
…A new actor at such a late stage?

Kugugugu!

As the lightning crashed down, a person appeared on top of the phantom
ship's cabin. The light from the lightning cracking in the dark, gloomy skies
drew a lengthy shadow. A slender figure stood there.

A pair of giant horns rose above this person's head.

[Player 9-nim's role is 'Bull Demon King'.]

…The Bull Demon King.

Now that I thought about it, I had forgotten that such a role existed.

He was a sworn brother and a companion-in-arms of the Great Sage
Heaven's Equal, Sun Wukong.

They did fight each other in the original story, but in our Story chamber
[I've become the retired SSSSS-Grade Sun Wukong], he had not made his
appearance yet.

In that case, just who would take on that role…?

[Voting rights are being distributed to the members of <Kim Dokja's
Company>.]

[A portion of members are unable to participate in the voting.]

[Only those able to vote will participate.]

The moment I heard those words, the inside of my head blanked out.

[Incarnation, 'Lee Jihye', is agreeing with the judgement.]

[Incarnation, 'Shin Yoosung', is agreeing with the judgement.]
[Incarnation, 'Lee Gilyoung', is agreeing with the judgement.]

[Incarnation, 'Jung Heewon', is agreeing with the judgement.]

[Incarnation, 'Han Sooyoung', is agreeing with the judgement.]

[Incarnation, 'Yoo Joonghyuk', is agreeing with the judgement.]

I didn't know whether to laugh or cry as I watched the windows containing
messages continue to pop up.

[Will you use your voting right for the 'Hour of Judgement'?] I saw

the faces of my companions under the cascading shower of light.

I wanted to speak to them so badly.

However, I simply couldn't.

Instead, this was all I could do for them right now.

[Constellation, 'Demon King of Salvation', is agreeing with the judgement.]

For a moment there, unreadable expressions floated up onto the faces of my
companions. A heavy silence descended on the flowing waters of Tongtian
River.

Another bolt of lightning crashed down, and Jung Heewon lightly jumped
off from the top of the ship's cabin.

I thought that her shoulders trembled imperceptibly as her feet landed on
deck, but they regained their calmness soon after.

[Everyone able to participate in the voting has agreed with the judgement.]

['Hour of Judgement' is activating!]
Jung Heewon slowly raised her head and opened her lips to speak.

"We can still fight."
                  Chapter 437: Ep. 82 - Outer God, VI


'We can still fight'.

Jung Heewon declared this and stepped forward while emitting a calm, still
Status.

Meanwhile, [Nebula Chat] messages entered my ear.

  –         Dokja hyung is still alive.

Lee Gilyoung said that.

  –         He may not be here, but he's still looking at us from somewhere.

Shin Yoosung nodded her head.

On the other hand, a warning message was resounding in my head.

[Outer God transformation rate: 96.1%]
…

…

…

[Outer God transformation rate: 96.3%]

The rate was suddenly climbing up rapidly.

[The Wenny King is doubting the agreement you two have made.]

The reason why I didn't immediately transform into an 'Outer God' was
because even though my companions knew that the 'Demon King of
Salvation' was alive somewhere, they didn't know that the person playing
Sun Wukong, me, was their real 'Demon King of Salvation'.

My deal with the Wenny King stated that I should not reveal myself to the
<Kim Dokja's Company>, after all.

[Outer God transformation rate: 97.1%]

Perhaps something was in his mind, because Yoo Joonghyuk was silently
staring up at the sky. Jung Heewon placed her hand on his shoulder and
walked forward.

He spoke in a weighty voice. "…You alone will not be sufficient."

"No, I'm more than enough."

Her refreshing grin imparted the feeling of her being utterly dependable
right now.

[Exclusive skill, 'Hour of Judgement', has received <Kim Dokja's
Company>'s blessing.]
Her [Hour of Judgement] was no longer influenced by <Eden> or those
sitting on the 'Absolute Good' spectrum. Her blade now only needed to
borrow from <Kim Dokja's Company>'s Probability, and it was currently
pointing at the targets of her judgement.

[Nebula, <Emperor>, is unhappy at the unannounced participation of the
applicable role!]

The members from <Emperor> seemed to be taken aback by Jung
Heewon's sudden intrusion.

Fei Hu tilted his head and stared at her. "And who you might be?"

"Was it you?"

"…?"

"The one who was looking for Korea's best Incarnation."

Right at the end of those words, Jung Heewon's figure dashed forward like
an arrow.

Fei Hu panicked and quickly raised his Ruyi Bang, blocking her sword
strike just in time. The friction sound of "Kwa-du-duk!" resounding out was
unusually heavy.

He frowned deeply as his body slid back quite some ways. "That is a pretty
heavy sword. However, that isn't the 'Bull Demon King's' weapon, is it?"

"Correct."

Jung Heewon's hands were gripping a Steelsword that no one had seen
before. It was not the Bull Demon King's weapon, or for that matter, Jung
Heewon's own [Sword of Judgement], either.
[Player 10-nim is participating in ⸢I've become the retired SSSSS-grade Sun
Wukong⸥ as an 'Extra'!]
…Huh?

[Player 10-nim's role is 'Ruyi Jingu Bang'.]

Just as I began thinking that such a role shouldn't even be possible, her
sword suddenly extended in an abnormal fashion. It was like watching the
actual Ruyi Jingu Bang that weighed thirteen thousand and five hundred
'geun'.

"What is this…?!"

Her sword continued to extend. Ten meters, twenty, thirty, forty… Her
hands tightly grasped the sword that grew to a truly nonsensical length.

[Exclusive skill, 'God Slaying Lv.3', is activating!]

The 'God Slaying', the higher-ranked skill derived from 'Demon Slaying'
after she evolved into the 'Judge of Destruction'.

The violent power of Chaos flowed viciously within the Steelsword, now
hundreds of meters long. The world seemed to vibrate slowly, and her
hands moved from left to right.

Fei Hu sensed something deeply ominous at that moment and loudly
shouted out towards the other Constellations. "Evacuate, now!!"

Some managed to reflexively escape, but the majority didn't even know
what befell them.

A single silvery line drew along the impressively-vast river's surface, and
every single battleship in the vicinity exploded into bits and pieces in a loud
screech.
[Nebula, <Emperor>, is astonished by the strength of 'Bull Demon King'!]

The truly gob-smacking firepower that could set the surface of water
ablaze, turning it into a sea of flames with just one attack.

That wasn't Jung Heewon's power alone.

The Steelsword vibrated within her hands. I recognised that weapon right
away.

Although it was impossible to talk to the guy since he had entered weapon
mode via [Steel Transformation], he was without a doubt, Lee Hyunsung.

Jung Heewon ran on the burning surface of the river and shouted back at us.

"Go! Leave this place to me!"

She not only stopped Fei Hu's advance, but also that of Erlang Shen and
Prince Nezha. Having sensed the enormous fighting spirit flooding out from
her entire figure, I looked back at my companions and spoke up. "Let's get
going."

For sure, I'd be able to leave this battle to the current Jung Heewon.

"Do your best, noona!"

"You should escape if things look bad!"

Lee Jihye's phantom ship quickly disembarked.

Behind us, Fei Hu was roaring out in anger after being blocked by Jung
Heewon. We didn't care and continued to scythe past the Tongtian's dense
fog. We then spotted Fei Hu's Tang Sanzang hurriedly escaping up ahead of
us.

[Location of the sacred texts is close by.]
We could sense the gazes of the audience and the judges on top of us.

[Many in the audience are focusing on your Story.]

[Judge, 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband', is telling you to work a little bit
harder.]

[Judge, 'Cleanser of Altars', is cheering on as his belly fat jiggles around.]

[100 additional points have been awarded.]

Thanks to Lee Jihye and Jung Heewon's hard work, the point gap between
Fei Hu's chamber and ours had pretty much disappeared.

If we manage to scoop up the 'sacred texts' first, then we should become the
winner of ⸢Journey to the West Remake⸥.

It was right then that the skies of all four cardinal directions distorted.

[Nebula, <Emperor>'s 28 Mansions, are making their descent!]

From all directions of the blackened sky, 28 stars shot down to where we
were.

"Evade it!"

Yoo Joonghyuk and I each grabbed Lee Gilyoung and Shin Yoosung, and
flung ourselves into the river. Along with the explosive noise of the
Tongtian itself blowing up, our phantom ship shattered and sunk beneath
the water.

We found debris floating on the river's surface and managed to barely grab
hold of it.

"Woo-ehck! Hey, I can survive by myself, so let me go!"

Lee Gilyoung kicked around and shouted out.
We stepped on to our own floating debris. And in the meantime, 28 stars
were blocking our way forward.

[What an incomprehensible bunch of people.]

[Why do you stain this noble story with the blood of Yogoes?]

[You're not qualified to complete this 'Giant Story'.]

They were openly declaring their intentions to hinder us.

I expected this to happen, but now that <Emperor> had come out like this, I
couldn't help but feel dismayed somewhat.

[A portion of the audience members are complaining about the unfairness
to the Constellations of <Emperor>!]

Lodging complaints wouldn't change anything. Whatever the case might
have been, the 'Journey to the West' was <Emperor>'s Giant Story, and they
wouldn't want to lose it to other Nebulas.

From the get-go, this event was created for the Incarnation of <Emperor>,
Fei Hu.

The only reason why other Incarnations and Constellations were allowed to
participate was simply to enhance the status of the entire Story itself and
turn this event into a proper scenario.

This was a game where Fei Hu had been decided as its final winner
beforehand.

As for the ensuing dissatisfaction of Constellations and their Nebulas,
simply supplying them with Coins and adequate-enough Stories as
compensations would calm them down pretty quickly. That was the truth
behind this <Emperor>-planned ⸢Journey to the West Remake⸥, and other
Constellations already had some idea without being explicitly told about it.
Even if you participate, you can't win. But we will compensate you
accordingly.

[Why do you insist on disrupting the order of the scenario? You have
already climbed up to second place, yet are you still not satisfied by the
number of votes?]

In that regard, it was the same thing as us already crossing that unspoken
line that <Emperor> had drawn.

[It's not too late to back down. If you do, we will not confiscate the Story
you have compiled up to this point.]

One of the directions of the 28 Mansions, 'Seven Mansions of the Azure
Dragon of the East' – Horn Mansion, Neck Mansion, Root Mansion, Room
Mansion, Heart Mansion, Tail Mansion, Winnowing Basket Mansion –
stepped forward and unleashed their Status.

The strengths of the individual Constellations hovered between
bottomtiered Narrative-grade or Historical-grade, but the real problem was
when they were together like this.

Azure Dragon of the East, 7 Mansions.

Black Tortoise of the North, 7 Mansions.

White Tiger of the West, 7 Mansions.

Vermilion Bird of the South, 7 Mansions.

These were the guardian Constellations tasked with defending <Emperor>,
as well as the enforcer of the Jade Emperor himself.

Even back in the 'Journey to the West', they got into conflict with the Great
Sage Heaven's Equal.
['Constellations of 28 Mansions' are unleashing their Status!]

When 28 stars all released their light simultaneously, the waves of
truly blinding Status smashed into us in full. Even if they were
individually nothing more than Historical-grade, with that much
aura… Shu-ru-rung.

Yoo Joonghyuk unsheathed his sword and stepped forward. He glanced at
me as he did so. "Take the kids away and acquire the sacred texts."

That prompted Lee Gilyoung to shout out as if he was having a breakdown.
"Who's taking who here?! I…!"

The boy's lips snapped shut after he sensed Yoo Joonghyuk emitting his
Status.

His jet-black coat danced in the air. It was as if he had suddenly
transformed into a black hole; his back faced us as he stood there against
the lights shining from 28 stars. That was the back of a man who had been
silently protecting certain people.

Lee Gilyoung faltered a little after being overwhelmed by that and muttered
out softly. "…Let's go."

Even if it was Yoo Joonghyuk, there was no guarantee of victory against
the entirety of the Constellations of the 28 Mansions. However, we had no
choice but to believe him. The current him was strong enough to fight
against <Lokapala>'s best, Indra.

I nodded my head and replied. "Do your best."

"Get going!"

Yoo Joonghyuk's [Black Heavenly Demon Sword] carved out a path on the
border where the river and the sky met.
Breaking the Sky Swordsmanship.

Inner Mysteries.

Split the Dark Ocean.

One sword strike that cut the ocean of the night. Like the miracle of Moses,
the river's water dispersed and the pathway to the front split apart.

Several stars failed to dodge the strike in time, and they were sunk under
the water as a consequence.

[How can such a nonsensical Status be…!]

[You bastard!]

The astonished 28 Mansions roared out and quickly scattered. Yoo
Joonghyuk didn't wait and continued to swing his sword about during that
space of time.

Breaking the Sky Thunder Sword.

A make-shift raft made out of floating debris was dashing forward on the
road created by Yoo Joonghyuk's lightning.

"Chimera Dragon!"

The Dragon Horse powerfully flapped its wings. A powerful gust of wind
caused the raft containing me, Lee Gilyoung and Shin Yoosung to shoot
forward. Even though the number of passengers had decreased, the speed of
the voyage was so great that it actually consumed Chimera Dragon's Status.
The distance to Fei Hu's Tang Sanzang decreased in an instant.

They discovered us overtaking them and began shouting in our direction.
Lee Gilyoung flipped them a middle finger, instead. "Why don't you munch
on this!"
[Nebula, <Emperor>'s Lords of the Nine Stars, are descending to the
scenario!]

"Dang it! More's coming? What a cheat!"

<Emperor> wasn't a great Nebula for nothing.

Simply from the number of 'Constellations' alone, <Emperor> could easily
be called the <Star Stream>'s strongest Nebula.

The heavens before our eyes split open along with descending rays of light,
and nine indistinct humanoid figures appeared. They could be distinguished
only through their different individual colours.

The Lords of Nine Stars.

They were automated combat weapons of <Emperor>, created by
condensed
Stories. Each one was a weapon possessing as much combat capability as a
Narrative-grade Constellation, where seven heavenly bodies – the Sun,
Moon, Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus, and Saturn – plus the Solar and
Lunar Eclipses, had become anthropomorphised.

Kwa-kwakwakwakwakwa!

Particle cannons fired from the mouths of the weapons burned one half of
Tongtian, while the other half was frozen solid.

The moment I went, "Dammit!", a single streak of light flew out from the
thick wall of rising steam.

"Shin Yoosung!"

She was focused on controlling the Dragon Horse and couldn't dodge in
time; her figure was flung up into the air. Lee Gilyoung and I reached out at
the same time to reel her back in and place her on the back of the Horse.
Perhaps the attack has struck her vital point, because she was knocked
unconscious.

"Those sons of bitches…!"

Lee Gilyoung took over the control of the Dragon Horse and unleashed his
own Status. However, the Lords of the Nine Stars were still perfectly fine,
and to make matters worse, they weren't our only problems.

[Nebula, <Emperor>'s Twelve Star Lords, are preparing to descend!]

[Nebula, <Emperor>'s Dragon Kings of the Four Seas, are preparing to
descend!]

I finally realized the truth by then. <Emperor> was dead serious about this
'Giant Story'.

[Outer God transformation rate: 98.1%]

The enemy's battleship overtook us and shot forward again.

[Many audience members are looking at you with great anticipation!]

[Currently, the difference in voting score between you and the first ranked
chamber is negligible!]

If we lose here, the Giant Story would become Fei Hu's.

I turned to look at Lee Gilyoung and spoke to him. "Xuan High Priest-nim."

"I'm busy, so don't talk to me!"

"Please protect Zang High Priest-nim here. I shall break past them and
retrieve the sacred texts."

"What? What are you…"
He failed to comprehend the situation and was about to shout out, but
before he could, I placed my hand on top of his head first.

"You understand? Gilyoung-ah."
                Chapter 438: Ep. 82 - Outer God, VII


For a moment there, Lee Gilyoung's lips bobbed up and down. Tears
rapidly welled up in the boy's clear eyes.

"Y-you, you…"

I finished patting his head and dragged a nearby piece of floating debris to
me.

(Sun Wukong fired a wind-type magic behind him.)

[Exclusive skill, 'Way of the Wind Lv.10', is activating!]

Along with the gust of wind, the debris, with me as its passenger, shot
forward at a rapid pace. Lee Gilyoung's voice called out to me from behind,
but it was buried under the noise of the rushing winds.

[Someone in the <Kim Dokja's Company> is suspecting your real identity.]
[The Wenny King is glaring at you!]

The Nine Stars noticed my movement and began pursuing me instead. A
couple of them even shot past me, rather than stopping me here.

I spotted the location of the 'sacred texts' in the distance. A single book
emitting beautiful light rested on top of a small island shrouded in a
mysterious fog.

And also, the Nine Stars and <Emperor>'s Constellations were standing
before it.

I sighed softly under my breath.

[Outer God transformation rate: 98.3%]

[Damage to your Incarnation Body is critical.]

There was only one remaining method now.

Out of the blue, Yoo Joonghyuk [999] maintaining his silence on my
shoulder spoke up.

– This is an idiotic move. Do you wish to become an 'Outer God'?

I broke out in a smirk.

'Are you scared?'

– If you force yourself any further, you will really become an 'Outer God'.
If you do, you'll fail this scenario.

I accessed the scenario window to confirm my goal.
  < Hidden Scenario – Verifying Agreement>

  of 'Outer Gods' as before.

  Time limit: 100 days

  Reward: Outer Gods' trust, ???

  Failure: You will lose all of your memories and transform into an
  Outer God.

  *'During the progress of the applicable scenario, you must not
  contact<Kim Dokja's Company> and reveal your identity. If this
  condition is violated, the transformation into an 'Outer God' will

  *Warning! Your identity is on the verge of being discovered.

  *Currently, the rate of Outer God transformation is accelerating due
  tothe poor condition of your Incarnation Body.




As I thought, reading it again only confirmed my suspicion.
'Even if I become an Outer God, I still won't fail the scenario. Becoming
one is simply the 'penalty' for failing the scenario, not the 'condition'
leading to its failure'.
– There is no difference between the…

'No, it is different. I'll be turning into an Outer God first before failing the
scenario itself'.

The time limit of the 'Hidden Scenario' I got from the Wenny King was 100
days. Meaning, I only had to accomplish my task in that time frame.

The problem had to do with the 'transformation into an Outer God' bit.

"The reason why I'm transforming quickly into an Outer God isn't that I
failed the scenario, but due to the bad condition of my Incarnation Body.

So…"

– …You won't fail the scenario even if you become an 'Outer God'. Is that
it?

'Right'.

I nodded my head and studied our immediate front. It seemed that [999]
had finally realized what my goal was.

[Shares of 'Outer God' in the applicable Story currently is 12.171%.]

[In order to complete the scenario, you must secure over 30% of the shares
for 'Outer God'.]

At this rate, I'd not be able to meet that goal even if I got my hands on the
sacred texts and acquire the Giant Story. However, what if I became an
Outer God…?

[Your role in the applicable Story is 'Sun Wukong'.]

[Your share in the applicable Story is 22.51%.]
What if the role of the greatest Yogoe, 'Sun Wukong', was played by an
Outer God, and what if my goal was accomplished by doing so…?

 – Why are you willing to go this far?

'What do you mean?'

 – You won't lose anything even if you let the 'Secretive Plotter' or
 OuterGods be on their own.

'Won't lose anything…'

 – Are you by any chance pitying the 'Secretive Plotter'? He doesn't
 needsympathy from a fool like you.

'I'm sure that's the case. He's Yoo Joonghyuk, after all'.

 – Yoo Joonghyuk? Don't make me laugh. He's not the 'Yoo Joonghyuk'
 youthink you know. He has already become a completely different
 'something'.

I didn't reply to him. [999] continued on as he scanned the Constellations of
<Emperor> rushing towards us.

– You don't understand what it means to become an 'Outer God'. Once you
become one, you rapidly lose all the memories you have accumulated in
your life. Even the 'Secretive Plotter' had to create 'ports' like myself in
order to endu…

So, that was the reason why these 'kkoma Yoo Joonghyuks' existed, I see.

I lightly nodded my head and replied.

'I know what I'll have to pay'.

– In that case, why…!
'Because… I have to do it'.

I replied with a simple grin.

I slowly blinked, and during those short moments of darkness, the figures
of the 'Outer Gods' brushed past my mind.

[AhAhAhAhAhAh]

[SavemeSavemeSavemSavemeSaveme]

[MymemoriesMymemoriesMymemories]

The Outer Gods.

Creatures born out of all the countless world-lines where Yoo Joonghyuk
had failed.

The worlds that allowed me to live on until now. The traces of the worlds
that I loved so much.

'How can I make any other choice after seeing the truth?'

Especially so, when I could still clearly hear them even now?

Kuwaaaaaah!

An energy blast destroyed the log I was riding on. But I simply ran on the
surface of the water by using the scattered debris.

['Way of the Wind' is accelerating even further.]

[Way of the Wind' is evolving due to your speed that has reached its limit.]

My leg speed gradually picked up and soon, I began running on the water
without the debris serving as footholds.
[You have understood the pinnacle of 'Walking on Water'.]

[Due to the usage of an excessive amount of Status, the damage to your
Incarnation Body has worsened!]

[Outer God transformation rate: 98.6%]

My heart began pounding away in an ominous rhythm.

[Outer God transformation rate: 98.7%]

That beating noise, it was the sound of me becoming something that was no
longer 'me'.

[999] said something to me, but I couldn't hear him as the river exploded all
around us. What I did hear, though, was another voice coming from the
inside.

⸢Kim Dok ja.⸥

[The Fourth Wall] was talking to me.

⸢Thi s is in sa ne.⸥

It seemed that this guy had also been observing everything until now. But
that was pretty obvious.

⸢Y ou w ill forg et ev eryt hing.⸥

⸢Kim Dok ja no lo nge r w ill be Kim Dok ja.⸥

[The Fourth Wall] was right.

[Outer God transformation rate: 99.1%]
Once I become an 'Outer God', I'd lose every memory I acquired until now.

⸢Kim Dokja was scared.⸥

It was a horrifying prospect when I thought about it.

⸢To lose all the memories he had made until this moment.⸥

I looked at the paragraphs rising above the wall and spoke up.

'It'll be fine. Because you remember everything, right?'

⸢Wha t?⸥

'You've recorded everything about me, so I'll never forget about myself'.

The normal me wouldn't have tried something like this. I'd never want to
experience losing all my memories, after all.

['The Fourth Wall' is greatly shaken up!]

However, I possessed [The Fourth Wall]. I had no idea how I acquired this
skill, but nevertheless, this Wall recorded everything the moment this story
began.

I recalled the sight beyond the Wall – the Library shrouded in forlorn yet
cosy darkness, as well as the Librarians that greatly cared about the place.

The important story of the 'Ways of Survival' that contained every Yoo
Joonghyuk regression turn had been recorded there, and…

…Even the unimportant life of 'Kim Dokja' was recorded there, as well.

⸢That Library was recording everything about Kim Dokja, even in this very
moment.⸥
⸢Kim Dokja's breaths, his appearance, his laughter, and his manner of
speech.⸥

⸢The food Kim Dokja likes and the ones he dislikes. Songs he hummed
occasionally. Expressions he makes when he's sad or happy. His habit of
muttering to himself when he's not feeling confident, and the ensuing
selfdeprecation.⸥

⸢His habit of leaning his head slightly when worrying about the kids. The
slight twitch of his eyelids as he closes his eyes after thinking about his
mother. The smile he makes whenever he's talking to Yoo Sangah. His
arcing eyebrows and naughty smile whenever he's making fun of Han
Sooyoung. The guilt when he thinks about Lee Hyunsung. And…⸥

⸢The glint in his eyes when he recalls the story he loves.⸥

That was why I could say it openly like this.

'I can just read from the beginning again'.

⸢B u t⸥

'From the moment the subway arrived, all the way up to when I arrived here
in the Journey to the West. I can just read them all again'.

The shell made out of light, fired from afar, landed near my feet.

I was swept away in the explosion of light and sunk into the water below. I
flailed about and grabbed hold of a piece of nearby floating debris.
[Damage to your Incarnation Body is critical!]

[Outer God transformation rate: 99.3%]

I stood up and ran again.
I really had only a little more remaining.

'Because I love reading the most in this world, after all'.

Breathing got heavier and harder.

[Outer God transformation rate: 99.4%]

It felt as if my memories were beginning to scatter away already, bit by bit.

A spear fired by one of the Nine Stars brushed past my shoulder. But the
pain shooting up didn't even feel like it belonged to me.

At that moment, I inexplicably recalled a post I made a long time ago in the
online community portal.

– I'm looking for eyes that haven't read the 'Ways of Survival' yet.

I felt really bummed about the fact that the story I loved so much was
coming to an end and so, posted such a thing online. Recalling it made me
smile ever so faintly.

'To think that I'd forget about such an entertaining story and read it from the
beginning again. That'll be a good thing in my case, actually'.

⸢Kim Dok ja is an id iot.⸥

As if it was angry, [The Fourth Wall] yelled back.

⸢I wo n't t ell y ou an yth ing.⸥

Even if it was saying that, I knew it'd help me out anyway.

⸢I w on't fo rgi ve y ou forg etting⸥
My skin was ripped up from the barrage of the firestorm and the pain akin
to my back snapping in half tore through me.

[Exclusive skill, 'The Fourth Wall', is strongly activating!]

And such pain was being blocked by [The Fourth Wall].

I swung my fist at the Nine Stars pouncing on me. My knuckles ached as if
they were punching hardened steel, but I didn't back off.

[Giant Story, 'Demon Realm's Spring', has begun its storytelling!]

[Giant Story, 'Torch that Swallowed the Myth', has begun its storytelling!]

…

…

…

[Setting of, ⸢I've become the retired SSSSS-grade Sun Wukong⸥, is
activating.]

[Due to the 'Retirement Penalty', your will to fight has decreased.]

[Due to the 'Retirement Penalty', you can't use all of your strength.]

…Come to think of it, I forgot about that stupid setting being in place.

All the power of the Stories wrapped around my body were quickly
abandoning me.

[Block him!]

[He must not reach the sacred texts!]
The ruins housing the 'sacred texts' were right before my eyes. It was an
island made out of granite, a treasure that withstood the hardships of a
lengthy amount of time. The 'answer' that Tang Sanzang and his
companions acquired after 14 years of journeying was there.

[Many audience members are looking at your Story.]

[Judge, 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband', is waiting for your choice.]

[Judge, 'Meihouwang', is waiting for your answer.]

[Judge, 'Bimawen', is studying your Story.]

[Judge, 'Sakyamuni's Successor', is looking at you.]

Everyone on this ride along with me was staring at this very moment
together.

[Outer God transformation rate: 99.7%]

The Nine Stars desperately blocked my path. Fei Hu's Tang Sanzang was
hurriedly running towards the 'sacred texts' in the meantime.

If I wasted any more time here, then more Constellations from <Emperor>
would arrive and I'd not be able to retrieve the sacred texts.

[Score: 50412]

[Ranking of the applicable Story chamber is 1st.]

I looked up into the sky.

[Scenario Master is looking at you.]

For some reason, I had this feeling that, if it was her, she should've realized
it a long time ago.
That she knew already who I really was.

And why… I had to keep my identity a secret from my companions.

For some reason, I had this baseless hunch that she knew everything but
decided to feign ignorance until now.

And then, the Scenario Master's voice came to me next.

(…Goddammit.)

I smirked after hearing that. As the Constellations rushed at me, a new
narration began to unfold.

(Sun Wukong looked at his enemies.)

(He had already fought against them in his previous life.)

[Outer God transformation rate: 99.8%]

(All those tiresome battles.)

(He was a retired man, and he swore that he'd never fight again.
However…)

I blinked my eyes while listening to the narration that sounded like a
lovingly-crafted letter.

Right, if it was you, I knew you'd have figured it out already.

…Figured out how this story would conclude.

(As he slowly clenched his fists, strength from a long time ago welled up
uncontrollably.)

[Your 'Retirement Penalty' has been completely removed.]
(Heaven's Equal, the power to control the clouds and lightning of the sky.)

[Fifth Bookmark has been initiated!]

[Exclusive skill, 'Electrification Lv.23(+13), has been initiated.]

[Your 'Status' is overcoming the physique requirement penalty.]

Pure-white physical energy swirled around; the electrical arcs from the
[Electrification] tore into the heavens above and destroyed the stars of the
Lords of the Nine Stars.

(He was called the 'Saviour' because he saved many with his fists. And he
was called the 'Demon King' because he killed many living creatures.) Jet-
black wings tore out of my shoulder blades.

(And that was why he was the 'Demon King of Salvation'.)

(These were memories of the distant past.)

I shifted my gaze back and saw the corpses of Outer Gods dyeing the
Tongtian River's waters.

(Back when he reigned supreme at the zenith of all 'Yogoes'.)

(He ruled Yogoes, he fought, and in the end, was defeated.)

(The lengthy journey changed him, and through his awakening, he became
a Buddha.)

They had died as the expendables for the sake of this scenario.

(And this was the result of his awakening.)

The headband on my head began hurting me. Even when suffering from
this pain, I still dashed forward.
Powerful Constellations of <Emperor> pounced on me next.

[Stop him!]

[He must never lay his hands on the sacred…!!]

(For the sake of all the Yogoes that died…)

(He decided to become the 'Demon King of Salvation' one more time.)

[Demon King, 'Demon King of Salvation', is revealing his Status.]

Every Constellation before my eyes was flung away as blinding light
exploded. And beyond that light, a single book was waiting for me.

I reached out towards the 'sacred texts'.

[Outer God transformation rate: 99.9%]

[Your existence is evolving into an 'Outer God'.]
            Chapter 439: Ep. 83 - Dokja's Incarnation, I


The boiling power of Chaos encroached into the blood vessels in my entire
body. One by one, Stories began resisting against the invasion of this
foreign power.

[Story, 'One who opposes Miracles, dreams of miracles.]

[Story, 'One Who Killed an Outer God', is resisting against your change!]

[Giant Story, 'Demon Realm's Spring', is protecting you!]

I barely managed to hold onto my wavering consciousness and staggered
towards the sacred texts.

⸢…⸥

I thought I heard voices coming from somewhere, which could've been a
side effect of transforming into an Outer God. I figured that my
consciousness breaking apart somehow automatically activated [Omniscient
Reader's Viewpoint].

However, it wasn't only one person this time; as if I was seeing many
people's POVs, several voices came at me at the same time.

⸢…I already knew.⸥

That was Yoo Joonghyuk.

⸢It was just too obvious from the get-go, you know. I thought that it might
as well be.⸥
Lee Jihye.

⸢If he didn't tell us up-front, then he must've had his reasons.⸥

Shin Yoosung.

⸢I, I already was suspecting it too, you know?! D-Dokja hyung! Dokja
hyung!!⸥
Lee Gilyoung.

⸢…Dokja-ssi?⸥

Jung Heewon.

To these folks who understood it all already without being told – just what
could I possibly say to them?

⸢What a powerful Sun Wukong he is… Who could he be?⸥

…That was Lee Hyunsung.
I ended up smirking softly.

Right, maybe it's for the best that he doesn't find out.

I sensed my memories beginning to crumble away. Once the transformation
into an Outer God was over, all of my memories should scatter away like
cosmic dust.

⸢Kim Dokja was scared.⸥

[The Fourth Wall] probably was aware of it already – that big talk of mine
was nothing more than just a coward pretending to be tough.

⸢After losing all my memories will I still remain as 'me'?⸥

I did die a few times so far, but never have I lost all of my memories. What
would happen to the 'me' that remembers everything, from here onwards?

[What really scared him was not death.]

Even if I got to read them all again, would I be able to regain the emotions I
felt back then in full?

[Story, 'Life and Death Companions', is looking at you.]

[Story, 'One who Hunted the King of Calamities', is looking at you.]

[Story, 'Liberator of Giants', is looking at you.]

Would I really be able to feel the same emotions that I felt during the
acquisition of all these precious stories?

⸢And finally, the 'sacred texts' were waiting for Kim Dokja right before his
eyes.⸥
The [Journey to the West Remake].
That book was the 'Giant Story' itself. The moment I grasp it, this Giant
Story would become <Kim Dokja's Company>'s, as well as the Outer Gods.

⸢Kim Dokja reached out towards the 'sacred texts'.⸥

With this, we'd be able to complete this [Journey to the West].

Tsu-chuchuchuchu…

It was at this moment that something strange happened.

[Due to the unexpected event in the scenario, your transformation into
the Outer God is being delayed.] …It's being delayed?

Sparks exploding all around me got even more violent while the roars from
the Constellations grew further away. The flow of space-time was being
warped strangely. Probability so powerful that it gave me chills and
backwetting goosebumps was being mobilised. It felt as if the entirety of
the <Star Stream> was writhing around.

Someone was intruding into the scenario by breaking through the distorted
space.

[Great Dokkaebi, 'Heoju', has incarnated to the scenario!]

[Great Dokkaebi, 'Heoche', has incarnated to the scenario!]

[Great Dokkaebi, 'Harong', has incarnated to the scenario!]

[Great Dokkaebi, 'Haram', has incarnated to the scenario!]

[Great Dokkaebi, 'Haesol', has incarnated to the scenario!]

Several Great Dokkaebis were incarnating before my eyes.

Tsu-chuchuchuchuchut!
As if it had turned into stone, my hand reaching out towards the 'sacred
texts' froze up in place.

This shouldn't be happening.

[You cannot acquire that story.]

Dokkaebis weren't able to interfere with the main scenarios.

No, actually, some did try indirectly to pick fights with us, but there had
never been an instance where a Dokkaebi with "Great" as its classification
personally distorted a scenario like this.

However, these ones had betted away their Probability and did indeed
intervene with the scenario.

[<Star Stream> is violently convulsing!]

Great Dokkaebis were also a part of the <Star Stream>.

Even if they were tasked with controlling the system, they were not exempt
from the consequences of abnormally abusing the Probability.

Perhaps that was the reason why the powerful sparks were dancing around
wildly on the bodies of the Great Dokkaebis.

[The forgotten ones need to remain forgotten.]

I thought I could understand just a little why they were willing to go this
far. If I took the 'sacred texts' and acquired the 'Giant Story' in the
process…

[AhAhAhAhAhAh]

[OhOhOhOhOhOh…!]
Then, the Outer Gods they had been excluding from the story would
officially be incorporated into a 'Giant Story'.

Outer Gods were beings that couldn't be controlled fully by the system they
possessed. Never mind the mid-to-lower grade [Old Beings], if the
higherranked Outer Gods were to enter the scenarios indiscriminately, then
the <Star Stream> would fall into unbridled chaos.

Even then, I simply had to complete this task.

[Give up.]

Statuses from the Great Dokkaebis had tied my entire body down like
chains, and my fingertips reaching out to the 'sacred texts' came to a dead
stop only a single hand span away. However, I didn't get flustered.

As the Great Dokkaebis appeared here while going against the Probability,
there's was no doubt that another creature tasked with fixing the tilted
balance of the distorted Probability would appear soon.

Ku-gugugugu!!

Speak of the devil – a whirlpool suddenly formed in the middle of the sky.
It was the [Great Hole]. And an existence revealed itself and looked down
at me from beyond the opening.

[Take the 'sacred texts', oh apostle of ■■.]

It was none other than the Wenny King, the one I met back in the N'Gai's
Forest.

Great Dokkaebis discovered the Wenny's presence and roared out in sheer
astonishment.

[How dare…!]
[The devil of the horizon, how dare you show yourself here!]

[You do not possess the Probability to appear in this scenario!]

The Wenny King sneered back at them. [It's the same story for you, too.]

The Statuses of the Great Dokkaebis and the Wenny King collided, and my
previously-restrained body regained its freedom. And my hand crossed that
final distance.

[Outer God transformation has resumed.]

The Wenny King smiled brightly.


[Oh, dear <Star Stream>. The worlds you have erased shall advance once
more.]

The moment my hand touched the 'sacred texts', my consciousness faded
away within the brightly-lit storm of electricity.

I could barely sense what might happen from here onwards.

I looked behind me and slowly closed my eyes.

⸢The only thing he could trust now was…⸥




Showers of light exploded and scattered in the distant sky.

Even the Nine Stars, even the 28 Mansions – they all had no choice but to
look at the explosion in that moment.

[Every Constellation of the Nebula, <Emperor>, is freaking out!]
Lee Gilyoung atop the Dragon Horse was busy evading the Nine Stars'
attack until then, but even he had to bring his mount to a stop.

"…Shin Yoosung?"

Shin Yoosung regained her consciousness and opened her eyes on top of
the saddle. The moment she did, her eyes quickly snapped towards the
western sky where Lee Gilyoung was also looking at.

Her heart was beating powerfully.

[Something has gone wrong. Eliminate these small fries quickly, and…]

The Lords of the Nine Stars and <Emperor>'s Historical-grade
Constellations recovered from their fluster and hurriedly rushed towards
Lee Gilyoung and Shin Yoosung once more.

The boy spoke up, his gaze still fixed to the western skies. "I'll create a
path, so get going."

No one needed to explain it to them. The story they were searching for was
over there.

"Go and rescue Dokja hyung!"

That was where Kim Dokja was.

Shin Yoosung could sense it. Maybe, far better than anyone out there.

Just as Lee Gilyoung jumped off from the Dragon Horse and unleashed his
Status, Shin Yoosung made her mount break out into a dash. The horse
reverted back to the Jade Dragon and flew forward like a speedboat on the
river's surface. A nostalgic scent of a Story wafted in from the distance.

That's where she could see the starlight from her Sponsor that protected her
for a long time.
It was shining so brightly like that, yet… why hadn't she been sure of it
before?

Countless questions raged on in her head before slipping away.

Why was Kim Dokja in this place?

Why didn't he reveal his true identity to anyone?

Shin Yoosung couldn't answer any of that. However…

…She felt that if Kim Dokja was lost again in that place, she'd never be
able to see him ever again.

Kwa-kwakwakwakwa!

Beams of light fired by the Nine Stars slammed into the Dragon Horse.
Shin Yoosung screamed as she plunged into the river water.

However, there were creatures that dragged her back out of the water.

[KimdokjaKimdokjaKimdokjaKimdokja]

[WeareWeareWeareWeareWeare]

From when did this happen? Yogoes that had been previously floating
around gathered into a large group and were crossing the river.

Somehow, she ended up on top of the group. Yogoes were floating up like
stepping stones and created the path forward.

[SavehimSavehimSavehimSavehimSavehim]

And as Shin Yoosung ran on top of the Yogoes, she belatedly realized it.
⸢The reason why ahjussi is here, it's for the sake of these guys.⸥ The

moment she realized it, something welled up from deep inside her.

She saw Kim Dokja's Story scattering away within the blinding rays of
light.

She didn't need anyone to explain to her that he was clearly in serious
danger right now.

⸢Why does ahjussi, always alone…!⸥

The first emotion she felt was resentment.

Why didn't Kim Dokja ask his companions for help?

⸢There must've been a reason for that.⸥

She knew that. But…

⸢He probably thought that this is for the best.⸥

Even then, there were some things that remained difficult to accept.

It was the same story back in the Dark Castle, and also in the Demon
Realm. And even during the 'Great War of Saints and Demons', too. Their
lengthy scenario was simply Kim Dokja's history of continued sacrifices.

⸢And that was why this resentment wasn't directed at Kim Dokja, but
towards Shin Yoosung herself.⸥
She was none other than Kim Dokja's Incarnation and that's why she felt
this sadness. The pain she was experiencing right now was nothing when
compared to his determination.
⸢For sure, Kim Dokja would've said something like "Yoosung-ah, listen.
There's no 'weight' to sadness."⸥
Shin Yoosung didn't agree with those words.

Sadness did indeed have 'weight'.

The despair of a person risking his life trying to save someone else, and
another's grief borne from powerlessness while watching that feat unfold,
would never carry equal weight.

In the end, to every human being, the most precious thing was themselves.

And Kim Dokja risked everything of his, always.

It was right at that time that the river water suddenly exploded in front of
her eyes. Constellations of <Emperor> vomited out as they crashed back
down to earth.

[Come, you disappeared stories!]

Accompanied by the voice reverberating throughout the world, the entire
world began changing.

Several [Great Holes] opened up in the various parts of the sky, and
creatures possessing unimaginable Statuses started to cross over.

They were no longer the 'Outer Gods'.

[■?■?■■ is participating in the role of 'Extra'!]

[■■?■ is participating in the role of 'Extra'!]

They were Yogoes from the Journey to the West.

(This was the final war to determine the owner of the 'sacred texts'.)
(The horde of shadowy demonic beings rushed in to put the finishing
touches to the final pages of this lengthy tale.)

A spectacle akin to the world meeting its annihilation played out.

And in the center of that apocalypse, Kim Dokja with his two blank eyes
was wandering among the Yogoes.

Was Shin Yoosung mistaken when she thought that he no longer seemed to
be 'Kim Dokja', but a Yogoe?

'I need to stop him'.

On top of the broken Yogoes' path, Shin Yoosung looked down at her small
hand. It was a hand that she believed was capable of achieving things far
greater than any adult could. And it had done precisely that many times
before. However, at least in this moment…

…She felt that it was nothing but a child's small hand.

[■■■■■■■■■■■■…!!]

The heavens split up and the ground caved in. The Tongtian River's waters
overturned in its entirety, and the living creatures atop it died in their
droves as blood and Stories flooded out.

[Judge, 'Sakyamuni's Successor', is looking at you.]

It was exactly then that she felt someone's gaze and heard that person's
voice.

[Yoosung-ah, only you can do it.]

It was a voice she knew so well.

"Sangah unni??"
[At this rate, Dokja-ssi won't be able to come back. Only you can prevent
that.]

There was not enough time to ask how something like this was possible. So,
Shin Yoosung only asked the necessary question first. "What, what should I
do?"

Yoo Sangah didn't answer her right away. However, what she did say
sounded like a Buddha bringing up a new topic for a conversation.

[Do not forget your role.]

Shin Yoosung stared momentarily at the sky in stupefaction, before her
gaze shifted over to Kim Dokja's direction. A golden headband glowed
faintly on top of Sun Wukong's head.

She looked down at her fist again. It was still that of a little child's. But at
the same time, it was the fist of 'Tang Sanzang', as well.

"…Can I really do it?"

Her voice was trembling.

Kim Dokja's figure staggered about in the distance.

[Story, 'Demon King of Salvation', is continuing with its storytelling.]

Finally, the tears she was holding back broke free. "But, that could be what
ahjussi wants, you know?"

And to such a child, Yoo Sangah spoke.

[He has been alone for a very long time.]

Kim Dokja (⾦獨子).
[To someone like that, telling him that he's not alone a few times won't
suddenly change anything.]

Shin Yoosung was Kim Dokja's Incarnation.

[You need to tell him, always be next to him, and reaffirm it for him.]

As she cried, Shin Yoosung stepped forward.

[Until he realizes that he's truly not alone anymore.]

She gathered every little scrap of her Status and began running hard. Just
like Kim Dokja using the [Way of the Wind], she too gave everything she
had and ran on top of the river.

While stepping on the water's surface sinking in bit by bit, Shin Yoosung
shouted out loudly as if to tear out her vocal cords.

"Ahjussi!!"

Kim Dokja wasn't listening. In the midst of the bloody battle between
Yogoes and the Constellations, he was looking back at her with empty eyes
as he slowly morphed into another Yogoe.

His body was changing. Kim Dokja was scattering away.

"Don't go! Please!! Please don't go!"

She watched her Sponsor slowly disappear right before her eyes and
shouted even louder and louder. It didn't sound like words, but screams,
instead. These were things that couldn't be conveyed with mere words.

[A brand new Story is sprouting within you!]
Not everyone could use special methods to communicate, and that was why
Stories existed. Words that couldn't be conveyed would become stories
eventually.

The golden letters of the Constrictive Sutra had become a Story and they
began emitting bright light now.

⸢I'm not going to give up. Just like how you keep rescuing me, ahjussi, I…!⸥

As the meteors rained down all around her, Shin Yoosung looked straight at
her 'star' and told her tale.

⸢I'll definitely save you, too.⸥
           Chapter 440: Ep. 83 - Dokja's Incarnation, II


The sounds of explosions spread out from the center of the battlefield. The
surrounding atmosphere was going through a change.

Ranks of Yogoes were rushing over there and <Emperor>'s Constellations
continued to descend.

Fei Hu's eyes chased after those ranks before shifting back to the enemy
blocking his path. "…You're truly strong. Are there more Incarnations like
you in Korea?"

Jung Heewon's whole body was riddled with wounds. However, her Status
remained firm and unaffected, while her will to fight burned brightly.

He looked down at his sliced-off chest and waist, the wounds inflicted by
her Steelsword.

He wasn't fighting alone; currently, both Erlang Shen and Prince Nezha
were aiding him, plus he was receiving support from his Nebula, as well.
Even then, he had failed to defeat a single Incarnation from another Story
chamber that entered the scenario as a mere 'Bull Demon King'.

"Stop yapping and just come at me."

Fei Hu stared into Jung Heewon's blazing eyes and slowly shook his head.
"The mere fact that we had to fight so bitterly against a single opponent
already signifies our loss."

As if he was no longer interested in fighting her anymore, he sheathed his
weapon and looked at the distant sky.

"And more importantly, the true battlefield doesn't seem to be here."

As those words came to an end, Fei Hu flung himself in the direction of the
'sacred texts', along with Erlang Shen and Prince Nezha.

Jung Heewon was about to hurriedly chase after them, but then, a battleship
suddenly summoned onto the river took them away at a rapid pace.

[Activation of 'Hour of Judgement' has ended.]

…That was a really close call.

If the fight continued on for a little bit longer, she would've lost for sure. As
expected of Fei Hu. He wasn't a direct Incarnation of the <Emperor> for
nothing, it seemed.

[Constellation, 'Demon-like Judge of Fire', is worriedly scanning the center
of the battlefield.]

Wings of an Archangel grew on Jung Heewon's shoulders. She began
halfrunning and half-flying on the water.

"…Just what is going on here?"
Several skirmishes were unfolding all around her and she couldn't tell
where she should go first.

Lee Jihye, battling against <Emperor>'s fleet. Yoo Joonghyuk, fighting
against the 28 Mansions Constellations. Lee Gilyoung, dealing with the
Lords of Nine Stars…

Dozens upon dozens of [Great Holes] had opened up in the sky and the
Outer Gods crossing over had all transformed into Yogoes to battle the
Constellations.

And in the center of it all…

"Yoosung-ah!"

A young girl was reaching out towards a star.




Shin Yoosung studied <Emperor>'s Constellations rushing at her.

[Nebula <Emperor>'s Twelve Star Lords are descending!]

[Nebula <Emperor>'s Dragon Kings of the Four Seas are descending!]

(One by one, Sun Wukong's sworn enemies were gathering.)

[It's not over yet!]

[It's fine as long as Tang Sanzang doesn't touch the 'sacred texts'!]

[Divide the army. One side shall retrieve the texts, while the others will
suppress their Sanzang!]
She grabbed tightly onto the Chimera Dragon's mane, currently in its Jade
Dragon form. The main attack force of <Emperor> was now taking aim at
her.

Kim Dokja, meanwhile, was still too far from her.

[<Emperor>'s Twelve Star Lords are baring their Statuses!]

Ka-booooom!

Light exploded before her eyes.

The Chimera Dragon protected her by wrapping around her body. Choking
heat penetrated into her entire figure. The second and third explosions went
off one after the other and the Dragon screeched out loudly. Shin Yoosung
gritted her teeth and leapt up by stepping on her mount's back.

[Your Sponsor's blessing is influencing you.]

[Your stunning talent has blossomed!]

[You have comprehended the 'Way of the Wind' on your own!]

She didn't know how this was possible but still, Yoosung ran on the river's
surface. The blessing of [Way of the Wind] was exploding out from the tips
of her feet, and golden ripples spread out everywhere they landed.

⸢Shin Yoosung ran as Kim Dokja had.⸥

This was the same method that her Sponsor used to run.

A mixture of blades and spears pounced on her from the surroundings.

Three from the left, one from right.

Two more, from below.
She evaded them all by a hair's breadth. However, the more she dodged, the
more vicious the attacks became. Hundreds of sharp blades rained down
like a dangerous storm. It was a spectacle akin to a monster opening its
maw wide to bare hundreds of fangs at her.

And as she found herself right in front of such a monster, Shin Yoosung
pulled out a dagger from her inner pocket.

⸢Shin Yoosung analysed the situation like Yoo Joonghyuk.⸥

There was something she learned from Yoo Joonghyuk some time ago.

[Story, 'Supreme King's Disciple', has begun its storytelling!]

⸢"In the future, you shall become the 'Beast Lord'. Countless monstrous
beings will cower before your feet and serve you."⸥

⸢"However, that does not mean you can become friends with every monster
out there."⸥
During Kim Dokja's three-year absence, Yoo Joonghyuk taught her how to
hunt.

Ways to face off against large monsters. Ways to hunt monsters with sturdy
outer shells. And even ways to kill monsters that were hard to fight against
in close quarters.

⸢"If you must kill, then do not hesitate and end its life."⸥

⸢"If you don't, the one dying will be you."⸥

The moment she held her breath, she spotted a gap between the blades.

It was the calm eye of the raging storm.
She unleashed all of her Status and threw the dagger in that gap.

Kwa-kwakwakwakwa!

Waves of winds scattered away and the blades flying in at her fanned out
away from her.

Unfortunately, she couldn't evade every single weapon; a blade's edge
brushed past her small figure. Blood spluttered out from her shoulder.

⸢Shin Yoosung crouched as Lee Hyunsung would.⸥

She crouched and, while hiding behind one of the floating debris, Lee
Hyunsung's face flitted in and out of her mind.

⸢"This is how you hide, you see? Don't forget to always memorise the
location of all the covers in your vicinity, okay?"⸥

Ahjussi, moving his bear-like huge body and assuming a crawling position
with a troubled smile on his face. And then, Jung Heewon's voice, adding
one more thing on top of what Lee Hyunsung had said.

⸢"It's possible that you won't find a place to hide if there are too many
enemies around."⸥

⸢"Mm, you're right."⸥

The powers of the Dragon Kings of the Four Seas were currently
controlling the river.

Sharp spears made out of water aimed at Shin Yoosung's body and rushed
in. Debris continued to explode one after the other, and there was no more
place left to hide behind on the river's surface now.
⸢"When that happens, you should use your enemies, instead. Like this."⸥

Han Sooyoung spoke as she grabbed and lifted the head of the crouching
Lee Hyunsung. Jung Heewon was shooting a glare at her, while Lee
Gilyoung was cackling away.

Shin Yoosung recalled all those memories and grabbed one of the
Incarnations attacking her to use as a shield.

"W-what are you… Kuwaaahk?!"

⸢Shin Yoosung became as cold-hearted as Han Sooyoung.⸥

She discarded the Incarnation Body riddled with grisly holes and continued
to run forward.

[She's a pretty smart kid.]

[Do not let her get away!]

The distance to Kim Dokja had closed up quite a bit.

"Ahjussi!"

Kim Dokja's figure stopped as if he heard her call.

As she looked into his empty eyes, Shin Yoosung recalled what Yoo
Sangah told her in the past.

⸢"I'm sorry that the world is like this."⸥

She could see her companions gathering around one by one.

⸢"I'm sorry that you got hurt like this. I'm sorry that you had to rely on
powerless adults like us. Even if that's case, I'll promise you one thing.
We'll always be by your side. We'll do our best so that you don't get to use
these types of skills."⸥

Shin Yoosung remembered those words well.

⸢"To make sure that you don't forget who you are."⸥

Slice!

A long spear brushed past her cheek. She unconsciously touched there as
blood trickled down. No one was around to help her. Neither Yoo
Joonghyuk's back that protected his companions, nor Jung Heewon's sword
that she could always rely on, were here.

A lengthy arm used the moment that she had lowered her guard and
grabbed her collar. <Emperor>'s Twelve Star Lords were getting closer and
closer.

[…Didn't expect her to be a real kid.]

[They let a child play such an important role?]

The Status of <Emperor> that defied all attempts to resist pressured her
entire frame.

In any other normal circumstances, she'd never be able to fight against these
enemies. Running away was the obvious route to take, and seeking help
from her companions was the best she could do.

But, Shin Yoosung didn't try to run away.

[Condensed Story has caused an abnormal event!]

She slowly blinked and opened her eyes. Her heart previously pounding
away like crazy suddenly grew calm. A cold glint flickered in her eyes next.
[Incarnation, 'Shin Yoosung's', Attribute evolution is imminent.]

[You have found the opportunity to evolve your Attribute!]

"I'm not just a little child."

[…What did you say?]

Shin Yoosung grabbed the Star Lord's left arm. The powerful grip
emanating from the child's hand caused the Constellation's arm to tremble.

"My name is Shin Yoosung."

[You have acquired a legendary Attribute.]

[You have become the 'Beast Lord'.]

"Shin Yoosung, from <Kim Dokja's Company>."

A Status as white as snow ran amok on the surface of the river. As the Star
Lords screamed and backed away, a girl wearing a white coat made an
appearance before their shocked eyes.

[Beast King's Sensitivity].

It was the greatest defensive skill of the 'Beast Lord' deployed by Shin
Yoosung from the 41st turn.

The surrounding river water overflowed and every Yogoe, as well as
monsters submerged under it, leapt out at once.

Gu-ooohhhhhh!

As if they wanted to pay respect to their 'king'.

[Son of a… Where did these things come from…?!]
[Attack! Kill these beasts first!]

<Emperor>'s Constellations began their bombardment. But a rising tide of
monsters protected her.

"Chimera Dragon!" Gu-

aaaaahhh!

Affected by her Attribute, the [Chimera Dragon]'s body had grown even
bigger. The creature swam in the water like an Imoogi and swallowed up
the Star Lords while screeching out loudly. Constellations being torn apart
by the sharp fangs cried out.

[You stinking lizard…!]

Shin Yoosung disregarded those Constellations and ran forward.

[OhOhOhOhOhOhOh]

[YoosungYoosungYoosungYoosungYoosung]

Yogoes created a clear path for her.

And now, the star was literally right before her nose.

"Ahjussi!"

She shouted at Kim Dokja. However, he showed no signs of movement as
if her voice didn't reach him.

It was then she heard the Wenny King's laughter resound out as it battled
the Great Dokkaebis. [It's too late. He now belongs to the 'Great Plotter'.]
Those words seemed to be the trigger; the heavens above powerfully shook
right away.

Tsu-chuchuchuchut!
A [Great Hole] boasting a size so immense that others couldn't even be
compared to was slowly revealing itself.

Great Yogoes on the river's surface simultaneously lowered themselves. All
the fur on the white coat of the [Beast King's Sensitivity] rose up like fuzzy
hair.

She could sense it without anyone telling her. The one descending right
now, it was an existence far surpassing all the Constellations of the
<Emperor> Nebula.

And Kim Dokja was now that creature's possession.

"I won't allow that."

[Tang Sanzang has recited the 'Constrictive Sutra'!]

The moment Shin Yoosung activated the skill, the golden headband on Kim
Dokja's head began emitting bright light.

[Item, 'Constrictive Headband', is reacting!]

The Constrictive Headband was a treasure to control Sun Wukong.

Didn't matter whether it was an Yogoe transformation or not, every change
taking place in Sun Wukong would come to a halt when the Sutra was
being recited.

[What foolishness…!]

The Wenny King's Status bore down on Shin Yoosung's whole body. She
tasted blood in the deepest part of her mouth. The coat created through
[Beast King's Sensitivity] flapped around crazily. She staggered on her feet
as she walked closer to Kim Dokja. One step closer, and yet one more step.
She saw his messed-up face, his gaunt cheeks. Her Sponsor, his eyes
quietly closed.

"Ahjussi!"

[A brand new Story is sprouting in you.]

She still had so many things to tell him.

She'd tell him about that stuff that saddened her.

And also tell him that ahjussi looked terrible right now.

For the first time ever, she'd earnestly tell him everything.

"Please, please listen to my voice!"

She'd tell him that she wanted everyone to stop by at a PC Bang.

She'd pester him to buy her pizza and Cola and have a picnic by the
Han River. And while talking about her impossible wishes in a world
where many things have become impossible to enjoy… …She'd
become happy again.

Her vision quaked and tears streamed down without rest.

Finally, her hand touched the ends of Kim Dokja's fingertips.

One hand covered in scars wrapped around yet another, also covered in
wounds. It hurt as wounds rubbed against each other. Even then, Shin
Yoosung didn't let go of that hand.

[Quasi Myth-grade Story, 'Saviour of a Star', has been acquired!]

[Story, 'Saviour of a Star', has begun its storytelling.]
"I still have too many things I haven't told you yet!"

Like, when she was studying history with Sangah unni.

Or, when she was cooking the hunted game with Joonghyuk ahjussi.

Back when she learned how to wield a sword from Heewon unni.

And when she practised riding a skateboard with Jihye unni.

Also, when Hyunsung ahjussi lifted her up and carried her around like an
aeroplane…

When she ate ice cream with Lee Gilyoung and read a manhwa, knowing
that the follow-up volume would never be released…

"I, really…"

If only ahjussi was also in those memories.

"So many things…"

'I'm not wishing for many things' – she simply couldn't say those words.

Because the world's Probability and this screwed-up <Star Stream> didn't
allow that.

"I just wanted to be normal…"

The stars in the sky were moving quickly.

Individual heavenly bodies sang their own Stories and looked at her.

[Many audience members are looking at you.]

Actually, she understood it already.
She knew that the ordinary happiness of an ordinary person in this world
would not be able to attract any interest whatsoever.

And that was why that ordinary happiness…

…Was the greatest luxury in a ruined world.


Even then…

[Audience members are paying the cost to reveal their Modifiers.]

[Constellation, 'Queen of the Darkest Spring', is…]

[Constellation, 'Bald General of Justice', is…]

Even then, if someone was willing to hear her story…

[Constellation, 'Demon-like Judge of Fire', is…]

[Constellation, 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon', is…]

[Constellation, 'Goryeo's First Sword', is…

As the indirect messages continued to pour in, Shin Yoosung held Kim
Dokja's hand even tighter.

It was precisely at that moment that a certain indirect message landed in her
ear.

[Judge, 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband', has heard your story.]

Warmth began returning to Kim Dokja's hand.

A blinding torrent of golden rays shot out from Sun Wukong's headband,
and that was followed up by a raging storm of Probability's powerful
sparks.
Constellations of <Emperor> shouted in their great astonishment.

[C-could it be?? But that doesn't make sense…!]

From several places in the sky, lightning-bolt-like rays gathered towards
Kim Dokja's figure.

[Judge, 'Bimawen', has heard your story.]

(And in that moment.)

(Something that had never happened before in the history of 'Journey to the
West' finally happened.)

[Judge, 'Meihouwang', has heard your story.]

(The retired Sun Wukong has finally turned over a new leaf.)

[Judge, 'Dou-zhan-sheng-fo (Victorious Fighting Buddha)', wishes to hear
your next story.]
           Chapter 441: Ep. 83 - Dokja's Incarnation, III


[Exclusive skill, 'Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint' 3rd stage, is currently
active!]

My consciousness grew dim. The first thing I heard within this pitch-black
darkness was the paragraphs coming to me from beyond [The Fourth Wall].

⸢In that moment, Lee Jihye looked at the battlefield.⸥

Lee Jihye's battlefield was there, alongside dozens of ships seemingly
blanketing the whole of Tongtian River.

Incarnations of <Emperor> prepared to fire the cannons, while
Historicalgrade Constellations were in charge of the command.

⸢"Open fire!"⸥
<Emperor>'s battleships surrounding the [Turtle Dragon] commenced firing
simultaneously.

Lee Jihye advanced forward while brushing past the wreckages of other
destroyed vessels. Some attacks she let them land her ship, while some
others, she dodged.

⸢"Load the cannons."⸥

It was like watching an orchestra. Her ability to command the fleet, that had
surely reached the realm of a naval god, allowed her to move the [Turtle
Dragon] and the Ghost Fleet as she saw fit.

⸢"Fire."⸥

Naval Admiral Lee Jihye's fleet opened fire. The Ghost Fleet had
rearranged their formation according to her command and they soon
repeated the accurate hit-and-run tactic, and the enemy fleet tasted
destruction in the blink of an eye.

⸢"How can something this unbelievable be…?!"⸥

Her ability to overcome the difference of overwhelming numbers – this was
the moment that the true worth of the 'Naval Admiral', one of the strongest
Incarnations in the 'Ways of Survival', announced itself to the world.

⸢[Constellation, 'Maritime War God', is proud of his Incarnation.]⸥

Lee Jihye actually surpassed her Sponsor in the latter half of the original
story. Maybe, I might get to see that spectacle unfold during this regression
turn.

⸢"We're changing our tactic!"⸥
Perhaps they realized that things weren't going so well, as <Emperor>'s
fleet suddenly began charging at her. An armoured battleship was taking
the lead. It seemed that they had chosen to engage her in a close-quarter
melee since they lost out in the long-range firefight. Unfortunately for
them, though, there was something that they didn't know.

⸢"…Argh, I created this technique so that I could give Dokja ahjussi a good
one later on, but this…"⸥

The thing was, the Naval Admiral Lee Jihye was also very handy in
closequarter battles, too.

Seeing her crouched posture getting ready to draw her sword, I could just
about guess what she was thinking of doing here.

⸢Instant Kill (瞬殺).⸥

I could see that she had mastered one of the best anti-personnel combat
skills in 'Ways of Survival'.

Kwa-aaaahh!

As the loud explosions burst out from the side of the ship, Lee Jihye began
her close-quarter combat. She cut, sliced, and then, cut some more. A sword
demon's blade cut through the waves of water and reaped the head of the
enemy commander.

And how much longer did she continue to cut after that? In the middle of
the Tongtian's battlefield, now dyed crimson by the spreading Stories, Lee
Jihye lay on her back utterly fatigued, having dealt with all of her enemies.

She stared at the darkening sky and asked softly as if she was talking to me.

⸢…Ahjussi. You're okay, right?⸥
I wanted to tell her that I was fine, but my lips didn't want to part.

[Your current level of proficiency for 'Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint' is
very high.]

[It's now possible to split the POV.]

[Character Jung Heewon's viewpoint has been added to the '3rd Person
POV'.]

The second person I saw was Jung Heewon.

⸢"Get! Out! Of! My! Way!!"⸥

She was in the midst of chasing Fei Hu down. Lee Hyunsung's blade, as she
held him tightly, was busy shooting out the licks of flames belonging to
[Hellfire]. Everywhere she passed by, ashes danced in the air.

I could more or less figure out what happened here. To think that 'Fei Hu'
gave up on the fight first… Maybe the strongest Incarnation in Korea was
Jung Heewon, after all.

[Character Jang Hayoung's viewpoint has been added to the '3rd Person
POV'.]

Jang Hayoung, still wearing the fake beard, was running on the river, Han
Myungoh stuck under her arm. The end of her gaze was fixed on Lee
Gilyoung, currently engaged in a bitter battle against the Lords of the Nine
Stars.

⸢"Hey, kid! Step aside!"⸥

The Lords of the Nine Stars were a part of <Emperor>'s elite forces. Jang
Hayoung got ready to unleash the power of [Breaking the Sky Force Punch]
at them.
However, Lee Gilyoung shook his head and shouted back.

⸢"Please don't interfere, Hayoung-ie hyung. I'm more than enough for
this!"⸥

He looked at the distant center of the battlefield and gritted his teeth.

⸢"…I can't lose to Shin Yoosung."⸥

Lee Gilyoung's voice, darkness seemingly overflowing from it, was tinged
with an ominous undertone. And in the following moment, a
yellowcoloured storm exploded out from the boy's entire body.

No, hang on a sec. Could that be…??

Before I could come to any sort of conclusion, the scene changed.

[Character Yoo Joonghyuk's viewpoint has been added to the '3rd Person
POV'.]

Next up was Yoo Joonghyuk, currently facing off against the 28 Mansions
Constellations by himself.

⸢"No matter how strong he is, in the end, he's still an Incarnation from a
weak little Nebula!"⸥

⸢"You think a lone bastard like yourself can deal with actual stars?"⸥

Even though they were acting tough, Yoo Joonghyuk's hand was currently
holding a couple of severed heads belonging to dead stars. His coat had
turned into a tattered rag from the concerted attacks of the 28 Mansions,
and there was a noticeable wound on his arm, but beside that, he was
completely fine.
⸢If you're talking about 'Constellations', then I've cut down plenty of your
kind already."⸥
Blood trickled down his forehead. His hair stained by the Constellations'
Stories danced about, and like some kind of an evil monster, Yoo
Joonghyuk raised his head up.

⸢"And that is why all of you will fall today."⸥

And the screen changed for the final time.

⸢"Ahjussi."⸥

It was my own Incarnation.

⸢"Please, please listen to my voice!"⸥

Her figure trembled as if she was sobbing.

Next up, I saw my hand, held tightly in hers. That limp, powerless hand
couldn't even hold hers at all. Her words cut off intermittently, and the
things I need to say to her and the things I need to hear from her all
disappeared in between the flitting words.

[Story, 'Saviour of a Star', is continuing on with its storytelling.]

I… wanted to move. I wanted to wipe her tears away. I wanted to
kneel down and hug her, before telling her that, her wishes were…
…Also mine, too.

Tsu-chuchuchuchut.

Memories were crumbling away.
Letters floated around the surroundings. I sensed myself scatter away inside
this darkness. I heard a voice calling out to me from beyond the empty
abyss.

I saw something resembling a violently-whipping [Great Hole] in the
distance. Slowly, very slowly, my soul was being sucked in there.

[Ti me to ke ep yo ur pr omi se]

I was scared.

If I were to forget all of these… These emotions, where would they go to,
then? And from where and to how far would [The Fourth Wall] remember
my story?

[Baat, baaaht!]

Biyoo suddenly appeared and grabbed hold of my soul being sucked out.
She did everything in her power to pull back at that clump of soul.

[Ba-aaaht!]

I could only look on at her confused, flustered struggling.

I, too, didn't want to go there.

[Co me to th e si de of th e Gr ea t Pl ot ter]

That was, if only I could.

[Are you really planning to go there?]

Along with the noise of "Tsuchuchuchu!" the flow of the surrounding
atmosphere changed. The letters stopped scattering away, and the suction
force pulling at my soul disappeared.
Someone was using his own Status to forcibly suppress my extinguishment.

[This Master Sun is asking you.]

I looked back, and discovered a rather familiar Constellation standing there.
His platinum-blonde hair gently danced in the air, and his headband was
emitting a soft glow.

"…Great Sage."

Indeed, it was the Great Sage Heaven's Equal, a mischievous smile etched
on his lips. However, he wasn't alone this time.

⸢The re are too ma ny Sun Wu kongs here⸥

[Oh, so that's the 'Fragment of the Final Wall' that I heard about? What a
noisy bastard.]

[Hmm… What an interesting visualised world this is.]

One was a handsome monkey kitted out in a cowboy get-up, while the
other monkey had this languid expression on his face, his hand stuck under
the tiger-striped thong and busy scratching away at something… I
immediately recognised who they were.

"…Are you Bimawen and Meihouwang?"

Before any reply could come to me, voices resounded out from the air
above.

[Ki ng of mo nk ey s]

[Ar e yo u pl an ni ng to in te rf er e wi th us]

[Urgh, shut up. We're busy talking here.]
Meihouwang got irritated and unleashed his power, causing the ripples
from the 'Outer Gods' to instantly disappear. That was truly a gob-smacking
Status.

[Demon King of Salvation, we came here to ask you about something.]

The one who said that was not the Great Sage, Meihouwang, nor was it
Bimawen.

Someone I had never seen before was there. He had an exotic countenance,
a face oozing with this mysterious aura preventing anyone from identifying
his gender. Short, neatly-trimmed black hair, and an elegant Buddhist robe
on his frame.

And judging by the fact that he was also carrying a Ruyi Jingu Bang, he too
was definitely Sun Wukong. The odd thing was, though, I couldn't see the
usual constrictive headband on his head.

⸢To Kim Dokja's knowledge, there was only one 'Sun Wukong' like that in
the world.⸥
"Douzhanshengfo (Victorious Fighting Buddha)." Tsu-

chuchuchuchut!

Thin sparks exploded in the air as if to react to what I said.

Douzhanshengfo asked me with an expressionless face. [I've been watching
your story from the beginning.]

"…My apologies for that."

[It was a Story with a meaning. Even out of all those numerous times when
the 'Journey to the West' repeated itself, there never had been a Story that
focused itself on the pain of the dying Yogoes.]
Meihouwang, listening to him talk on the side muttered, "Here comes the
sermon-loving idiot". Completely disregarding him, Douzhangshengfo
continued on.

[However, their pain is their preordained destiny. Not everyone can become
protagonists, after all.]

"Why do you think so?"

[You speak as if all Yogoes are victims, but not all of them are wrongly
thrust into their positions. Some among them had never worked hard once
in their lives, while some carry evil intentions and choose to hurt others.
Therefore, it is quite obvious that they will never become the main
characters.]

"You're correct. However, just like what you've implied, some of them are
not guilty of anything. No, make that quite a lot of them."

[And that is why countless Stories exist in this world. Giant Stories aren't
the only good Stories. Those who are nothing more than small, insignificant
beings inside a Giant Story can still become the main character of a
different Story.]

He was right.

Indeed, as right as it can be. However…

"…That is only applicable when they are allowed to participate in Stories."
There were some creatures in this world that were excluded from entering
even those Stories. Beings that were simply spent as expendables in various
Stories while not even receiving a single percent of shares.

[AhAhAhAhAhAh]

[ComeComeComeComeComeCome]
"Stories should be permitted to even those who have failed."

The ones that had forgotten about themselves weren't even allowed to enjoy
the opportunities of the scenarios. The <Star Stream> gagged them, and
made sure that their words would become incomprehensible to others.

[…Is that what you truly believe?]

Douzhanshengfo asked, his unreadable eyes still locked on me. No, more
correctly, he was looking at the power of Chaos rising out from my body.

[And you wish to sacrifice your whole being and become an 'Outer God'?]

"…That's correct."

The Great Sage was yawning with a bored face during my answer and once
he was done, spoke his opinion. [Are you done with your confirmation? I
told you, didn't I? This guy's really like that.]

[…Indeed.]

[Seriously, man. Convincing the dear ol' Buddha-nim is the hardest thing
ever.]

I had no clue what these guys were talking about.

Four Sun Wukongs glanced at me while yapping among themselves.

[Okay, so. Who's going to do it, then?]

[I shall do it. I had lost most of my memories after I was granted the
Buddhahood, after all.]

[…Well, I guess you being a fakey monk can be helpful in situations like
this one.]
Right in the next moment, bright light rose up all around me, causing my
scattering memories to come back. And as the Probability's sparks
exploded, my body glowed brightly too, as if I was being electrocuted.

[Someone is dealing with the penalty of 'Outer God Transformation' in your
stead.]

…Wha?

[Demon King of Salvation, you're wrong about one thing.] said
Douzhanshengfo, as he unleashed the power of Chaos. [Becoming a
'Yogoe' will not help you in understanding them. You simply do not have
the qualifications to represent them.] He was right once more.

I couldn't possibly have known anything about the 'Outer Gods' suffering
pain and agony as the Yogoes from the 'Journey to the West'. Because I was
just another actor playing Sun Wukong.

Meihouwang sniggered and remarked sarcastically. [You should know your
place.]

Bimawen quickly added something else. [Your 'main topic' is not in this
place.]

The last person to speak up was the Great Sage. [Leave the matters of
Yogoes to other Yogoes. And you, you should live your own Story.]
Only then did I finally figure out what was going on here.

[Giant Story, 'Journey to the West', has begun its storytelling for you.]

But, why? Why were they doing this for me?

The Great Sage smirked and replied. [Because we like your Story. That's
all.]
I thought I could hear the loud roars of the upper-rank Outer Gods coming
from afar. At the same time, I sensed the power of the Outer Gods
strengthening gradually.

[HeisHeisHeisHeisHeis]

[OursOursOursOursOurs]

[My bad, but we can't give him to you.]

[NoNoNoNoNoNo]

[KingiscomingKingiscomingKingiscomingKingiscoming] The

[Great Hole] continued to churn angrily within the darkness.

Something was trying to descend to this world.

It was the king of all these 'Outer Gods'.

[Constellation, 'Secretive Plotter', is glaring at the 'Prisoner of the Golden
Headband'.]

That message brought out a bright smile on the Great Sage's face.

[Right, I wanted to have a go at you sometime, didn't I?]

Four Sun Wukongs stood all around me.

[So, who'll be the main this time?]

[Of course, it'll be me, the Great Sage.]

[And thus the dumbass Sun Wukong is born.]

[Hey, you. Don't flip your finger like that. You think this is a fusion
fantasy?]
In the following moment, Sun Wukongs around me grasped each other's
hands.

[Oh, <Star Stream>! We will be accepting the 'Demon King of Salvation' as
our fifth self!]
             Chapter 442: Ep. 83 - Dokja's Incarnation, IV


"Ahjussi!"

Powerful rays of light exploding out from Kim Dokja's entire body, and the
waves of magical energy containing <Emperor>'s Giant Story pouncing on
Shin Yoosung's position, happened almost at the same time.

She reflexively embraced his body. The durability of her [Beast King's
Sensitivity] had dropped to a critical level after defending against countless
attacks so far. But she had no other methods to defend against this new
wave other than this one.

She squeezed her eyes shut and the moment she hunkered down, a storm of
blinding light exploded and the waves of Stories blanketing the
surroundings disappeared as if they were washed away.

"…Ah?"

Her body, raised up to the sky, slowly descended back down again.
The spot where Kim Dokja had been standing only until a moment ago was
now occupied by a tall man. He was blessed with the blindingly pure
platinum-blonde hair, forged steel-like muscles, and [Fiery Golden Eyes]
burning in a crimson hue.

<Emperor>'s Constellations freaked out.

[T-this can't be…!]

The Outer Gods were also shocked by the emission of the stupendous level
of Status from him.

Currently possessing the bodies of the Yogoes, these Outer Gods expressed
their fluster at the stunning Status of Chaos rising from this tall man.

[WhoWhoWhoWhoWho]

The man grinned brightly. [For them to not recognise me. I guess my
retirement has gone on for too long.]

Shin Yoosung couldn't figure out what was going on here. She could
definitely sense Kim Dokja's aura from this man, but he was not 'him'.

In that case, just who was this man?

"Ahjussi…?"

[So, you're Sanzang?]

The Great Sage calmly looked down at her before slowly lowering himself.
Soon, their gazes were locked on the same eye level.

[Kim Dokja is safe.]
An unfathomable sense of lonesome longing flooded out from his [Fiery
Golden Eyes]. Shin Yoosung unconsciously reached out. The moment her
hand touched that cold golden headband on his head…

[Story, 'Demon King of Salvation', is continuing with its storytelling.]

Her hand trembled.

She could sense it so clearly.

Kim Dokja was living and breathing within this person. Not only did he not
transform into a mysterious something, but the figure of Kim Dokja she
was familiar with remained as was.

"Yoosung-ah!"

Jung Heewon dashed in from the distance and hurriedly shielded Shin
Yoosung away while shooting the Great Sage a glare. He simply grinned
back at her, and shifted his gaze up to the sky.

That was where a portion of <Emperor>'s Constellations, Great Dokkaebis,
as well as the Wenny King could be found.

[Why do you all look like that? Weren't you yapping on happily among
yourselves without the protagonist of 'Journey to the West', me, present
earlier?]

Indeed, he was the main protagonist of the Journey, the Great Sage
Heaven's Equal.

One of the Great Dokkaebis asked him a question. [Why have you stepped
forward? Do you not have an agreement with the <Emperor>?]

[I didn't break the deal. Besides, do you even have any idea what that deal
is in first place, before asking me that?]
The Great Dokkaebi didn't have the chance to reply, as the Wenny King's
true voice butted in first.

[Monkey King! Are you insane? The 'Demon King of Salvation' is ours.
He's an Outer God now, in other words. That was our agreement!]

[He's my brother now. And also…] The Great Sage's [Fiery Golden Eyes]
emitted bright light. [I'm also an 'Outer God' now.]

Due to Douzhanshengfo's transformation into an Outer God, the aura of
Chaos was billowing out from Sun Wukong's entire body.

[Shares of 'Outer God' in the applicable scenario currently is 35.333%.]

[Hidden Scenario – 'Verifying Agreement' has been completed!]

[Power of the Giant Story has begun moving!]

[Scenario, ⸢Journey to the West Remake⸥, is entering its final phase!]
(And then, Sun Wukong looked at his long-time companions.)

Yogoes that had fallen into confusion were all looking up at him. The
majority of them were 'Outer Gods' used as expendables in the scenario. Up
until only a few moments ago, they had been searching for their king, yet
now, they were shaking their heads in a clear sign of fluster.

[KingisKingisKingisKingisKingis]

[WhichoneWhichoneWhichoneWhichoneWhichone]

Yogoes were at a loss, stuck between the Great Sage appearing as a
brandnew 'Outer God', and the 'Secretive Plotter' they had been following
originally.
He spoke to them as if he could understand their confusion. [You all
suffered greatly until now, my friends.]

(These Yogoes, they had experienced this really lengthy tale together with
him.)

[I know very well of the ordeals you were subjected to. I was born as a
Yogoe, but got influenced by men's ways, and ended up accepting their
ideals and customs. I carried out what they deemed to be true righteousness,
and walked on their path of Dao.]

(Sometimes, they were his enemies. At other times, they were his allies.)

[And the result of that, is this. Yogoes were sacrificed. And the meaningless
epiphany repeated itself. Now, ⸢Journey to the West⸥ has become a tool to
strengthen the Nebula's influence by spreading around the tired, obvious
truths.]

(However, all of that was nothing more than a Story, a play performed on a
stage.)

[I'm sure it'll be impossible to atone for the past. Even then, if you are
willing to forgive me…]

(The ancient king of the Yogoes. Their king, who used to fight against the
heavenly worlds once upon a time, was now speaking to them.)

[Then I shall fight for you from now on.]

One by one, Yogoes raised their heads.

[ReallyReallyReallyReallyReally]

The Great Sage replied to them. [I shall put my true name on the line and
swear to you.]
Yogoes began moving towards him. One and two soon became ten, grew to
a hundred, and before long, went past a thousand. Yogoes hiding under the
river's water, ones hiding within the clouds in the sky, they all revealed
themselves. They gathered like swarms and began forming a horde. As if
they were trying to worship the king they had served a long time ago.

[Ancient 'Giant Story' is waking up.]

[Halt! Cease what you're doing!]

[You're a judge! A judge cannot interfere with a Story in progre…!]

Great Dokkaebis urgently stepped forward to stop this situation, but it was
useless, at least this time around.

[<Star Stream> has acknowledged the Probability of the 95th Main
Scenario.]

[Main theme of the ⸢Journey to the West Remake⸥ is changing drastically!]

Even the Great Dokkaebis couldn't go against the gigantic flow of the <Star
Stream>. As for the Wenny King, it stepped back without resistance as if it
wished to observe the unfolding situation first.

Its original aim was to send 'Outer Gods' into a scenario anyway, so
technically, that goal had pretty much already been accomplished. The only
problem was…

…Who was the one leading all these 'Outer Gods'?

Ku-gugugugu!

Thunderbolts crashed down from the [Great Hole] in the sky, and soon,
something broke past the abyss to make their descent.

[H-he is…!]
Status emitted by him was so powerful that the Outer Gods appearing so far
couldn't even compare to him. The Great Sage, the Wenny King, even the
Great Dokkaebis – they all witnessed that person's incarnation into the
world.

The Great Sage smirked. [So, he finally showed up.]

[Constellation, 'Secretive Plotter', has incarnated into the scenario's
location!]

[Someone has joined the scenario in the role of 'Demon King of
Confusion'!]

The 'Secretive Plotter', currently in the form of a jet-black lump of shadow
wavering around in the wind, took on the role of a Yogoe to participate in
the scenario. Perhaps due to him not going through a proper entry
procedure, blindingly bright sparks were enveloping his entire body.

The Great Sage asked him. [Are you here to hinder this great Master Sun?]

【That depends on your choice.】

[As expected, you have a rather insidious-sounding voice, 'Secretive
Plotter'.]

This would be the first time that these two came face-to-face. A
confrontation was brewing between two Constellations who had been
watching Kim Dokja for a long time through Bihyung's, and later, Biyoo's
channel.

The Great Sage growled and spoke up. [You pretended to be all slick and
sophisticated in your indirect messages, but today, you finally reveal your
true colours.]
The 'Secretive Plotter' quietly studied the Great Sage. 【Meanwhile, you
are just as thoughtless as your indirect messages suggest.】

Sun Wukong emitted a stupendous amount of Status and roared out
triumphantly while gripping his Ruyi Jingu Bang. [Enough talk. Since
you're here, let's fight. This situation won't get resolved unless I kick your
ass first, anyway.]

The Plotter's entrance caused agitation and unrest to spread among the
surrounding Yogoes. It seemed as if they were hesitating on who to follow
among these two absolute beings.

Submit to the king of all Yogoes, the Great Sage, Heaven's Equal?

If not, submit to the king of Outer Gods, the 'Secretive Plotter'?

The possibility of a sudden confrontation between two Constellations
brought about a palpable sense of tension to the Great Dokkaebis, Wenny
King, and to other Constellations floating in the air.

On one side, an Outer God who dreamed of the <Star Stream>'s
destruction, while the other, the strongest Constellation within <Star
Stream> itself.

A battlefield that had never been created before was about to commence.

Sun Wukong, burning with the will to fight, was about to raise his Ruyi
Bang high up into the sky, but then…

【I'm sorry, but your opponent today isn't going to be me.】

Accompanying those words, the heavens split open wide and a great
amount of sparks exploded out.

[Nebula, <Emperor>'s, Constellations are descending to the scenario!]
The number flooding in was in another realm altogether compared to
<Emperor>'s forces that had entered so far. Half-destroyed stars of the 28
Mansions, the few remaining Lords of the Nine Stars, Dragon Kings of the
Four Seas, and after that, a countless number of immortals and wargods
from the Taoist pantheon were incarnating into the scenario.

[Constellation, 'Master of the Immortal Peach Garden', is incarnating into
the scenario!]

[Constellation, 'Heaven's Wise Man', is incarnating into the scenario!]

[A great number of Constellations hiding their Modifiers are incarnating
into the scenario!]

That wasn't all. Spirits that ruled the plains, the mountains, and the rivers,
and even the great cosmic army that guarded the heavenly palaces – an
army consisting of over 100 thousand in total blanketed the scenario's sky.

[The Pagoda-Bearing Heavenly King Li Jing, Prince Nezha, and Erlang
Shen. Now that is a nostalgic combination. And not only that, the heavenly
palace's lazy-arsed geezers are here too…]

(The enemies from the heavenly palace he used to fight against a long time
ago were now standing before him.)

[Great Sage, what's the meaning of this?]

Prince Nezha, the very one who tried to suppress Jung Heewon along with
Fei Hu earlier, was now brimming full with the power of a Story
incomparably mightier than before. That was because he was no longer
playing a role from the Story chamber, but making an appearance as
himself.

[What do you mean, what? I'm here to end this scenario.]
The Great Sage's curt reply prompted an immediate opposition from
<Emperor>'s Constellations to rise up.

[You can't arbitrarily decide on the conclusion like this!]

[Don't you realize that the ⸢Journey to the West⸥ will end up in the hands of
a weakling Nebula if you do this?!]

[Hurry and give up on the 'sacred texts'!]

The Great Sage looked at the 'sacred texts' held in his hand, and then, took a
glance at Shin Yoosung next to him. Then, a smirk formed on his lips.

[Argh, it's fine if it ends up with them. What's the problem? I mean, it's
good that its fame is spreading out even further, am I wrong?]

[This is against our agreement!]

[Nope, it isn't. Us helping you out was until 'The four Sun Wukongs choose
the same Story', wasn't it? And that day has arrived, that's all.]

Having realized what the Great Sage was thinking of, the <Emperor>'s
Constellations began exchanging glances with each other.

[Nebula, <Emperor>, is greatly enraged at the 'Prisoner of the Golden
Headband'!]

Erlang Shen stepped forward to represent his Nebula. [Great Sage. Do you
understand what your actions mean? Could you be possibly planning to
start the 'Great War against the Heavenly Worlds' in this place?]

[Hmm? No, I didn't think of that, but well, if you wish to fight, then…] Ku-
gugugu!!

The incredible aura flooding out from the Great Sage's Incarnation Body
forced Constellations of <Emperor> to falter and retreat. His story that
swept across the heavenly worlds in the past was being unshackled in this
scenario.

However, Erlang Shen's voice remained composed. [I acknowledge your
strength. No one from <Emperor> can even dream of besting you in one on
one combat. However, you can't win in this fight. Because the Story will
simply repeat itself.]

Tsu-chuchuchuchut…!

Signs of ⸢Stage Transformation⸥ could be spied now. Stories collided, and
the event from a long time ago was about to be recreated once more.

A great war between the king of Yogoes, the Great Sage Heaven's Equal,
and <Emperor>.

The Great Sage spoke up. [For sure, I did lose back then. However, that
was when I was just the 'Great Sage, Heaven's Equal'.]

The <Emperor> sensed something was off and made their move first.

[He's about to use his magic! Subdue him, now!]

[Lord Daode Tianzun! Your Jingangzhuo…!]

[Come, Six Brothers from the Mae Mountain!]

The Great Sage summoned his Somersault Cloud while watching the
army of the heavenly worlds pounce on him. Dark clouds dyeing the sky
black heeded Sun Wukong's Story and began gathering into one place.
[Giant Story, 'Journey to the West', has begun its storytelling!]

And then, he opened his mouth. [My true name is Sun Wukong.]

⸢The Great Sage Heaven's Equal.⸥
⸢Meihouwang.⸥

⸢Bimawen.⸥

⸢Douzhanshengfo.⸥

And, finally…

⸢The Demon King of Salvation.⸥

A storm began raging on top of the Tongtian River. Thunder and lightning
crashed down. And in the center of this storm, the Great Sage was slowly
clenching his fists.




As the blinding lightning bolts pounded down on the battlefield, Yoo
Joonghyuk finally arrived at his destination.

The godly figure of the Great Sage bringing down numerous Constellations
in the middle of the Tongtian was truly something to behold.

'…Kim Dokja is inside that guy, huh'.

Thanks to his golden-coloured [Sage's Eye], Yoo Joonghyuk got to quickly
confirm Kim Dokja's current situation. It seemed that the fool was still
alive. And for some strange reason, that powerful 'Great Sage' personally
incarnated to grant the man his own powers.

Jung Heewon and Shin Yoosung could be seen some distance away. They
were basically hiding among the great battles taking place between the
Yogoes and the Constellations, which was a wise decision on their part,
really.
As for Lee Gilyoung, Lee Jihye, or even Jan Hayoung, it seemed that they
hadn't arrived in this location as of yet.

'We need to finish this scenario soon'.

Their Story chamber had already reached the top of the rankings, and the
'sacred texts' were in the hands of Shin Yoosung, currently playing the role
of Tang Sanzang.

[The ⸢I've become the retired SSSSS-grade Sun Wukong⸥ Story chamber is
currently holding the 'sacred texts'.]

[Guarding the 'sacred texts' for one hour will automatically conclude the
scenario.]

[54 minutes remaining until the conclusion of the scenario.]

Even the final phase of the scenario had been activated, as well. Just by
holding on, the Giant Story of the 'Journey to the West' would be <Kim
Dokja's Company>'s.

However, there was one thing that concerned him. And that would be…

Ku-gugugu…

It was that 'person' currently spectating on the battlefield from the middle of
the sky.

The 'Secretive Plotter'.

He was simply watching on at the fight between the Great Sage and
<Emperor> without getting involved. Yoo Joonghyuk could guess what he
was planning here. He was probably planning to wait until the Great Sage
ran out of strength and launch a sneak attack on his opponent afterwards.

However, the incarnated Plotter's aura wasn't the same as before.
– He seems to have wasted a lot of Probability. He indeed has far too much
riding on this regression turn.

Those words were spoken by Yoo Joonghyuk [999]. From some time ago,
this damn dumpling was making himself home on the full-sized Yoo
Joonghyuk's shoulder.

He glanced at [999] with disinterested eyes before silently unsheathing the
[Black Heavenly Demon Sword].

"Meaning, this is my chance to kill him."

That was when the Secretive Plotter accurately locked eyes with him. Just
from meeting that being's gaze caused Yoo Joonghyuk to freeze up on the
spot.

[Story, 'One who Opposes Miracles', is shrinking away.]

[Story, 'One who Hunted the King of Disasters', is refusing to fight.]

His Stories were shivering in fear. So, becoming weak meant falling into
such a state? The memories of defeat brushing past him now ruled over
him.

Perhaps, the [Black Heavenly Demon Sword] wasn't the only thing that
broke on that day.

[999] addressed him again.

– Looks like you're afraid.

Yoo Joonghyuk didn't want to acknowledge it, but it was the truth.

– Indeed, the current you will never defeat the 'Great Plotter'.
It was the 'despair' that couldn't be overcome no matter which history he
was willing to bet away. Yoo Joonghyuk stared at that overwhelming wall
of time. That wasn't something mere 'effort' could overcome.

– However, it's not as if there are no other avenues left for you.

"What?"

[999] leapt off from Yoo Joonghyuk's shoulder, and his outer appearance
began transforming. A Murim dumpling was changing to that of Yoo
Joonghyuk.

[999]'s height grew back up in an instant, and regained the exact same
appearance as Yoo Joonghyuk's.

The distinctive Status of a Transcendent oozed out from the back of another
him currently facing away. Yoo Joonghyuk became keenly aware of who
this was in this moment.

Yoo Joonghyuk from the 999th turn.

As his black coat danced in the air, [999] addressed his counterpart.
"Remember. Remember who you really are. Remember what you wished to
achieve by coming this far."

[999] then slowly pulled out a sword from his inner pocket. Surprisingly, it
was not the [Splitting the Sky Sword].

No, it was the [Black Heavenly Demon Sword], the exact same weapon that
the 3rd turn Yoo Joonghyuk possessed.

[999] spoke up once more.

"Let me show you the battle from the 999th turn."
            Chapter 443: Ep. 83 - Dokja's Incarnation, V


Anyone would've read about Sun Wukong's story at least once in their
lives. In my case, the first thing I'd recall after hearing his name would be
his description as written in the 'Ways of Survival'.

⸢Ruyi Jingu Bang that destroys the heavens.⸥

⸢Body Outside Body spell that allows him to fight against a Nebula all by
himself.⸥

⸢Thunderclouds capable of bringing down stars of the world.⸥

One of the strongest Constellations in the 'Ways of Survival', that was the
Great Sage Heaven's Equal, Sun Wukong.

[Giant Story, 'Journey to the West', is continuing on with its storytelling!]

And right now, I had become that very Sun Wukong.
Kugugugugu!

Every time the Great Sage's fist pointed at a spot in the sky, the stars of
<Emperor> fell in droves. I ended up holding my breath after witnessing
that overwhelming power from a first-person perspective.

I already knew that he was powerful, but never did I guess that it'd be by
this much.

'Hey, maknae-yah. What are you busy yapping on about?'

I heard Meihouwang's voice in my head.

It seemed that including myself, all five versions of Sun Wukong were
watching the Great Sage's rampage in real-time as well.

'Are you shocked by your hyung-nims' power level?'

'…To be honest, I'm really impressed'.

Kwa-kwakwakwakwa!

[Kuwaaahk!]

A giant that got sent flying away just now was a Narrative-grade
Constellation.

Come on now, how could blowing away a Narrative-grade with a single
lightning bolt even make sense?

Meihouwang spoke as if to mock our opponents. 'Hng, was that the Giant
God? That measly little Narrative-grade made a mistake by trying to fight
us'.

'But, wasn't the Prisoner of the Golden Headband' a Narrative-grade as
well…?'
The one who answered back this time was Bimawen. 'If we were on our
own, sure. But you now understand what kind of an existence we are, don't
you?'

He was right. This was really hitting home for me.

The main protagonist of the 'Journey to the West', Sun Wukong, was
created by four different Sun Wukongs.

The king of all monkeys that ruled the Water Curtain Cave, 'Meihouwang'.

Acknowledged by the Jade Emperor for his magical prowess and awarded
the post of 'Bimawen'.

The 'Great Sage Heaven's Equal', who fought against the heavenly worlds
that looked down on him.

And finally… 'Douzhanshengfo' who gained enlightenment through the
events of the 'Journey to the West'.

Only after the Stories of these 'Sun Wukongs' gather in one place would his
true power be unleashed.

Bimawen muttered out. 'That Great Sage dude, he's really having fun, isn't
he? Well, I guess it's been a long time since he got to cut loose like this'.

Indeed, the Great Sage's true voice sounded as if he was really enjoying
himself. [The heavenly worlds have become a lot weaker, haven't you! Is
this all you've got?]

Narrative-grade Constellations couldn't even endure ten-or-so exchanges of
blows and all came crashing down into the Tongtian River's waters.

[Attack him!!]
Despite that, <Emperor>'s forces still remained powerful. After all, it was
the Nebula that boasted the highest number of stars in the <Star Stream>.

The thing was, though, the Great Sage's Story was only getting started, too.

[OhOhOhOhOhOhOh!]

Outer Gods roared out all at the same time, and a lightning bolt landed on
Sun Wukong's Ruyi Bang. Ripples of golden light exploded then, and he
powerfully threw his weapon into the sky.

Kwa-aaaaah!

Ruyi Bang's torpedo-like attack burned the heavens and flew forward with
ferocious momentum. Incredible gusts of gale winds whipped around.

Finally, the dispersing spray of water died down. One of the Constellations,
soaked to the bone like a mouse that fell inside a well, muttered out in
disbelief.

[W-what is the meaning of…?!]

A portion of the skies was now empty.

That single attack managed to annihilate thousands of divine immortals
rushing in.

[T-this, is this the real Great Sage, Heaven's Equal…]

Even then, even when facing this overwhelming spectacle, <Emperor>'s
spirit didn't diminish one bit.

[There's no need to fear! His Story is bound to hit its limit soon!]

[Do not let up and attack! He's all alone in the end!]
The number of divine immortals swelled back up again and refilled the
empty void in an instant.

This was how <Emperor> fought.

I got goosebumps. No matter how strong our side was, that side had no end
to their supply. At this rate, the one to lose would be…

'Hng, no need to cower already. That fool hasn't used his power yet, after
all'. 'That fool?'

'I meant Douzhanshengfo'.

Ah, Douzhanshengfo, the Victorious Fighting Buddha. He was the one who
dealt with the Outer God transformation penalty earlier in my stead.

'Is he alright?'

'The fourth is fine. He's enlightened in the ways of the Four Noble Truths
(苦集滅道), so the memories of the material world are meaningless to him.
Everything would return to 'nothingness', that's why'.

Bimawen quickly tackled Meihouwang down. 'Since when did
Douzhanshengfo become the fourth?'

'Since he was the fourth one to make the appearance, that's why. Isn't it
normal to count chronologically?'

'With that thought process, then…'

'Obviously, I am the first since Sun Wukong started off with me. And
congratulations, even though you're the least famous one, you get to be the
second'.
'Acting exactly like a dumbass monkey that you are, busy spitting in your
own face. You think anyone would actually remember a king of monkeys
stuck in a cave?'

'Well, it's a lot better than you fool who had to clean horse shit out of a
stable'.

Was it because of the two Sun Wukongs' bickering? The construction of the
Great Sage's Story became unstable for a moment there, and he ended up
getting struck abruptly by an enemy attack.

As the main body began shaking, the Great Sage finally exploded in
irritation. [Shut the hell up! I can't concentrate!]

Of course, he didn't forget to add one more thing triumphantly, as well. [I'm
the most famous one, so obviously I'm the first!]

Meihouwang and Bimawen exploded in a fit of dissatisfaction at the same
time.

For the first time since the battle commenced, the Great Sage had to be on
the defensive against the incoming vast wave of the stars.

If he got pushed back here, then he'd not be able to win this war. Maybe
both Meihouwang and Bimawen understood that point as well, as they
stopped bickering and concentrated, as well.

Boom!! Bang!! Ka-boom!!

It was at that moment that a corner of the battlefield collapsed and a huge
battleship made its entrance.

"Ahjussi! I'm here-!!"
It was Lee Jihye, advancing forward while destroying <Emperor>'s vessels.
The members of <Kim Dokja's Company> had made their move in order to
support Sun Wukong fighting alone. That wasn't all, though.

[Constellation, 'Golden-bodied Arhat', is incarnating into the scenario!]

The Great Sage's real companions began entering the scenario one by one.
The Golden-bodied Arhat, Sha Wujing, appeared in the sky in his
Incarnation Body and smiled contently as he looked at Lee Jihye down
below.

[So, you are the one who played me?]

"…Who the heck is that monster??"

[Constellation, 'Cleanser of Altars', is incarnating into the scenario!]

The next one to appear was the owner of the Nine-tooth Spike Rake. Zhu
Bajie kitted out in a piece of loincloth so flimsy and small that it might not
as well be there flapping below his jiggling belly fat, shouted out loudly.
[Where are you, the Supreme King Pigsy, Yoo Joonghyuk? Hahaha! I was
thoroughly impressed by you, the one who played me!]

It seemed that the 'Cleanser of Altars' was fixated on Yoo Joonghyuk at this
point.

The Great Sage looked at both Zhu Bajie and Sha Wujing, and nodded his
head. [You came, fellow disciples. A bit late, weren't you.]

[I didn't really come to help you out, senior brother. No, I was just curious
about the actor playing me, so don't be mistaken.]

Zhu Bajie muttered out some excuses that sounded oddly coy for some
reason, and along with Sha Wujing who looked somewhat shocked and
hurt, stood next to Sun Wukong.
When the Demon-Slaying Staff and the Nine-tooth Spike Rake unleashed
their Statuses right next to the Ruyi Bang, it finally dawned on me that all
of the 'three musketeers' from the 'Journey to the West' had gathered in one
place.

[Giant Story, 'Journey to the West', is regaining its original Status!]

Soon, the nervous Constellations of <Emperor> loudly yelled out.

[Judges! Are you saying that you'll be siding with the Great Sage?]

[It's not just them.]

Six more humanoids were standing tall behind the three Journey to
the West's main characters. One of them resembled a monkey, while
others resembled a shark, a lion, and even a roc. I immediately
recognised who they were.

The Great Sage Who Covers the Seas, Saurian Demon King.

The Great Sage Who Brings Chaos to the Heavens, Roc Demon King.

The Great Sage Who Moves Mountains, Lion Spirit King.

The Great Sage Who Pierces Through the Winds, Macaque Spirit King.

The Great Sage Who Chased Away the Immortals, Snub-nosed Monkey
Spirit King.

The last person wasn't a Yogoe, but Jung Heewon.

"…This just got rather interesting."

Thanks to the blessing from the 'Great Sage who Pacifies Heaven' Bull
Demon King, the Status of the actress playing that role, Jung Heewon, was
rising up at a break-neck pace.
[We will fight alongside you, Great Sage, Heaven's Equal.]

The Seven Great Sages that waged the 'Great War against the Heavenly
Worlds' alongside Sun Wukong had finally gathered in one place once
more.

These Yogoes didn't get much page-time during the original ⸢Journey to the
West⸥ and as a result, their presence had always remained behind the veil of
obscurity. They appeared today to undo the knot of resentment in their
hearts.

[I always felt wronged because my nickname also happens to be
'Meihouwang'. Today, I shall resolve my deep-seated grudge!]

After the Seven Great Sages jumped into the fray, the flow of the battlefield
changed greatly in an instant.

Those Outer Gods hesitantly studying the Plotter's moods until then joined
the battle as well.

Meihouwang (Handsome Monkey King) watching the battle unfold
muttered to himself. 'Where did that Supreme King Pigsy disappear to,
anyway?' Now that I took a look, I couldn't see Yoo Joonghyuk anywhere.

He should've been battling the 28 Mansions Constellations just now, so…

Suddenly, I had this ominous foreboding.

I looked up at the Wenny King and the Great Dokkaebis watching the
climax of this scenario from high up in the sky.

[Advance! Do not retreat and continue fighting! The victory shall be
<Emperor>'s in the end!]
<Emperor>'s Constellations roared out energetically and continued to push
forward.

The ones taking the lead up front were the Heavenly Palace's Four
Heavenly Kings.

Dhrtarastra of the East.

Virudhaka of the South.

Virupaksa of the West.

Vaisravana of the North.

Not only that, there were the Pagoda-bearing Heavenly King Li Jing as well
as Prince Nezha. It seemed that they were getting desperate as well.

And then, even the Queen Mother of the West, and the owner of the
Jingangzhuo, Daode Tianzun, too… Constellations that you might
recognise by their names alone had descended to this place and unleashed
their Stories.

There was little doubt that the 'Great War against the Heavenly Worlds' was
being recreated right now.

[Nebula, <Emperor>, is releasing its Giant Stories!]

This was the might of a 'Great Nebula'.

Even then, the Great Sage didn't back off.

[Many in the audience can't close their slack jaws while watching this
abrupt spectacle.]
[Constellation, 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon', declares that if the 'Prisoner
of the Golden Headband' loses today, they will no longer be considered
rivals.]

[Constellation, 'Demon-like Judge of Fire', is cheering on the 'Prisoner of
the Golden Headband'!]

[Constellation, 'Goryeo's First Sword', is expressing his respect towards the
'Prisoner of the Golden Headband's' martial prowess.]

The first one to kneel was Dhrtarastra, followed by Virudhaka. Everywhere
the Ruyi Bang flew past, the Heavenly Worlds army crumbled.

The divine level of martial arts, the might of the greatest Constellation, Sun
Wukong was in full display.

But then, a Buddhist chant coming from somewhere caused the Great Sage
to come to a stop for the first time.

Tsu-chuchuchuchu…

Even I ended up gasping out in pain.

It seemed that I wasn't the only one suffering here. Both Meihouwang and
Bimawen spoke in annoyed voices.

'Goddammit…!'

'…It's that baldy monk'.

The constrictive headband was tightening around the Great Sage's head. He
massaged his temples with one hand while issuing a warning. [Guanyin. Do
not interfere!]
Those words prompted a Buddhist lotus pedestal to appear among the
clouds. Guanyin was sitting in the middle of the pedestal in the lotus sitting
position.

[Wukong, have you forgotten about what happened in the past?]

[What are you talking about!?]

[Please stop this. This is not the righteous path.]

[What if I don't want to?]

[Have you not received my aid until this moment? Can you not concede in
consideration of that, at least?]

[…Your aid?] The Great Sage's brows shot up higher. [All thanks to your
ohso-wonderful aid, I got to enjoy untold hardship.]

As if he was venting out all of his built-up resentment, the Great Sage
began shouting out loudly. [All those trials and tribulations we had to go
through came to be because of your voyeuristic tendencies…!]

The Great Sage's memories related to Guanyin, the one who perceived the
sounds of the world, began telling their tale.

⸢"The law stipulates that one has to fulfil all nine by nine, eighty-one
tribulations in order to return to their 'self'. However, they have only
experienced the eightieth calamity, and thus lacks one. Five Gates, I now
task you to go after them and create the final calamity!"⸥

The 'Journey to the West' final calamity – the one behind it was none other
than Guanyin.

[The ones responsible for the world's calamity by raising up the army of
demons and inciting the Yogoes, were you and <Emperor>!!]
[…They were all necessary tribulations. You must cool your ire now.]

As the Great Sage grew even more agitated, Guanyin began reciting the
Constrictive Sutra once more.

[You think you can stop me with such a pathetic sutra?] Pah-

chuchuchut!!

The Status emitted by the Great Sage, Heaven's Equal disrupted the
Constrictive Sutra's effect.

Guanyin was taken greatly aback by this development and while retreating
along with her lotus pedestal, she raised her voice.

[…Your powers have grown too strong. I alone can't handle him.]

The Pagoda-bearing Heavenly King bit his lower lip. [We'd be able to win
if we drag out the fight, but…]

Less than 30 minutes remained until the conclusion of the scenario. They
knew that, even if they emerged victorious through a protracted battle, there
would be no meaning if they were defeated in the scenario.

[Sakyamuni! Where is Sakyamuni?!]

In the end, <Emperor> had to make the obvious choice as their final move.

[We only need the ⸢Five Pillars⸥! As long as we have that Story, defeating
that damn monkey bastard will not pose any problems!]

The ⸢Five Pillars⸥ referred to the Buddha's five fingers.
Even if it was the heaven-defying Sun Wukong, as long as there existed the
Story of him being subdued by the Buddha's palm, he'd not be able to
escape from the ⸢Stage Transformation⸥'s influence.

And one of the split bodies of the Buddha, Sakyamuni, existed in this
world.

Prince Nezha whispered to the Pagoda-bearing Heavenly King next to him.

[Have you forgotten? Sakyamuni's whereabouts are unknown since the
'Great War of Saints and Demons'. Most likely… I fear that he had perished
during the process of sealing away the Isle of Reincarnators.]

[Sakyamuni has died? Doesn't that mean, there is no method to suppress
him…?!]

[Please, do not worry. We do have his successor with us.]

At the end of those words, the army of <Emperor> split open.

[Come, 'Sakyamuni's Successor'!]

The highest-ranked Constellations of <Emperor> were walking out from
the space created by the army. Each and every one of them were powerful
beings that rivalled the likes of <Olympus>'s 12 Gods.

But when I saw the person wearing the airy Buddhist robe walking in the
middle of them, I quietly grew agitated.

⸢Yoo Sangah was there.⸥

Yoo Sangah, reincarnating through the promise with Sakyamuni. And by
the eternal chain of Samsara, she was reborn as the 'Sakyamuni's
Successor'.

'…Great Sage?'
The Great Sage's body had stiffened up immediately. I could sense a great
deal of emotional turmoil within him.

I also heard Meihouwang's and Bimawen's voices just then.

'So, that was why, when he saw her for the first time…'

'Who'd have thunk that it was 'that' Incarnation Body?'

At that moment, a certain part of the Great Sage's memories rushed in. That
lengthy storyline of the 'Journey to the West' was abridged in an instant.

And I realized it then. Yoo Sangah hadn't simply reincarnated as the
'Sakyamuni's Successor'. No, her current Incarnation Body used to belong
to someone very special.

⸢"Oh, dear Sanzang."⸥

Tang Sanzang (三藏法師).

The one whose mastery of the Constrictive Sutra had surpassed everyone
else's in the whole world, and also the only one capable of coercing Sun
Wukong with just one sentence.

<Emperor>'s Constellations loudly shouted out.

[Hurry and suppress that bastard, oh 'Sakyamuni's Successor'!]

Even as he saw Yoo Sangah walk towards him, the Great Sage Heaven's
Equal showed no sign of budging – as if he had fallen deeply into the
reminiscence of the ancient past.

'Great Sage! Get a move on! What are you doing?!'

'We're going to get done in at this rate!'

Hearing those words made me a bit anxious as well.
Was the 'Yoo Sangah' before my eyes the 'Yoo Sangah' that I used to
know? What if she lost her memories, like how the reincarnated Shin
Yoosung lost hers?

What if she became a completely different person to whom I used to know?

Yoo Sangah's hand gently reached out and touched Sun Wukong's
headband.

[You seem to be in great pain. It must've been difficult for you.]

But the moment I heard her clear voice, I realized something.

This person… was definitely someone that I knew.

She was neither 'Tang Sanzang' nor 'Sakyamuni's Successor'. No, she was
the one companion that I could trust the most – Yoo Sangah.

[I believe that this item will look better on someone else now.]

Her hand slowly moved and took Sun Wukong's Constrictive Headband off.

The headband that had been tightening around the Great Sage's head fell to
the ground with absolutely no resistance whatsoever.

Meihouwang, Bimawen, and even the Great Sage – all of them stared at her
in pure disbelief.

<Emperor>'s Constellations freaked out grandly and tried to rush in, but by
then, it was all too late.

As the roars from the Constellations rained down, the prisoner of the oldest
prison was finally being freed.

[Awakening condition for the Constellation, 'Prisoner of the Golden
Headband' has been satisfied.]
[Douzhanshengfo's Story is being unsealed.]

[Modifier for the Constellation, 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband', is
evolving!]

As the glorious rays of light exploded forth, the 'Prisoner of the Golden
Headband' slowly opened his eyes.

[Constellation, 'The Most Ancient Liberator', has been freed from his seal.]
           Chapter 444: Ep. 83 - Dokja's Incarnation, VI


After he was freed from the seal, the Great Sage Heaven's Equal became
more like a Yaksha.

[Constellation, 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon', is greatly astonished.]

[Constellation, 'Demon-like Judge of Fire', is dazedly watching the
battlefield.]

[Constellation, 'Spear that Draws the Borders of the Oceans', is opening his
eyes wide.]

[Constellation, 'Great Mother God Who Created Man out of Earth', can't
tear her eyes away.]

This power that, never mind the highest-ranked Narrative-grade
Constellations, even the Myth-grade Constellations had no choice but to
pay attention to.
Sun Wukong's clones multiplied through the Body Outside Body spell to
number in the hundreds, nay, into thousands, and began dealing with the
Nebula's great army. Thunderbolts shooting out from their fists obliterated a
group of Historical-grade Constellations in one go, and a dozen or so
Narrative-grade stars crashed to the ground below after getting struck by
the Ruyi Bang.

The entirety of the Tongtian River couldn't handle his power and began
crying out.

Kwa-aaaaaah!!

This was the might of Sun Wukong, the one who had completed the
conclusion of the grand epic, the 'Journey to the West'.

Tsu-chuchuchuchut!

Sparks exploded non-stop on our body. We were inside the 'Journey to the
West', the location of his Story no less, yet the <Star Stream> was still
suppressing his powers. The disjointed Probability was returning in full to
the Sun Wukongs as well as myself, and thanks to that, I thought I might
lose my mind here.

[Excessive distortion in the Probability is eroding your consciousness

away!] 'Looks like maknae is finding it hard to handle'.

'Let him leave'.

[Four Sun Wukongs have agreed to separate the 'Demon King of
Salvation'.]

My body grew out of the main one like a sprout and began crashing down
to the earth below.
I wretched uncontrollably and by the time I regained my wits, I found
myself sagging on top of a piece of floating debris on the Tongtian River.

I could see Sun Wukong that I used to be a part of only a moment ago busy
engaging the <Emperor>'s Constellations in a bitter warfare up in the sky.

"Ahjussi!"

A voice came to me from somewhere. And soon enough, two humanoids
crashed into me. One fairly large, and one fairly small.

[Baat! Baaaaaht!]

I raised my upper body with great difficulty and saw Shin Yoosung and
Biyoo clinging onto me.

While crying her eyes out, the former was hugging my arm dirtied by the
blood and flesh of various Yogoes. I wiped my hands caked in blood on my
coat and carefully hugged her.

Even though [The Fourth Wall] existed, the incoming rush of emotions
couldn't be restrained.

I was back.

I had managed to come back again.

"Dokja-ssi."

I raised my head to find Yoo Sangah in her white robe standing nearby.

She had reincarnated into the Incarnation Body of Tang Sanzang. Even
though her body was now different, her appearance was the same Yoo
Sangah that I remembered.

I smiled weakly at her. "You came back."
"I've seen all the things you've done while I was away, Dokja-ssi."

My shoulders flinched just a bit before I knew it. I wondered if she'd scold
me, but to my relief, she simply smiled benevolently.

"It must've been hard for you."

Before I could say something in reply, though, she continued on.

"However, please stay that way for a little while longer."

Huh?

Just as I was about to open my mouth, Yoo Sangah gently reached out and
placed something on my head.

[You have become the owner of the 'Constrictive Headband'.]

[Due to the effect of the 'Constrictive Headband', a new Modifier has been
generated.]

[You have become the 'Prisoner of the Constrictive Headband'!]

My jaw went slack from this unbelievable event.

"Hmm, so, what should I do with you now?"

Seeing Yoo Sangah pressing her finger to my forehead and wagging it
around a bit, I was overcome with this slight sense of terror. I was well
acquainted with the pain from the headband already.

I quickly opened my mouth. "I-I know that I made a few mistakes. I do.
However… Can, can I tell you in detail about them a little later? Right
now…"
"Right now, that side should take priority, I

know." I nodded my head.

We looked up at the sky where the [Great Hole] was still whirling around.
And in the middle of the hole, at the two Yoo Joonghyuks currently locked
in a bitter battle.




Yoo Joonghyuk [999] wielding the [Black Heavenly Demon Sword] dashed
into the air while scattering the Status of a Transcendent.

At the end of his travel awaited the king of all Yoo Joonghyuks.

【So, this is what you chose in the end.】

The oldest Yoo Joonghyuk in the universe.

He was Yoo Joonghyuk who broke past the 1863rd regression turn and
witnessed his own Conclusion.

[999] stared at that 'Secretive Plotter' and recalled his own ancient
memories.

'■■'.

The end that came around to all living creatures just once.

[999] also experienced his own version of the end. Although what he saw
was different from the Plotter's Conclusion, he at least glimpsed his end just
a little.

The 999th regression turn was quite different from the others.
The majority of people would never understand what it meant for a single
person to live a thousand lives. However, [999] did just that, and he knew
that he'd get to live just as many lives in the future. And that was why, he…

⸢"…At least for this turn, I shall live for all of you."⸥

He sacrificed himself for his companions during the 999th turn.

⸢"Captain, just forget about me! I'm telling you, leave me behind and go!!"⸥

During the 38th scenario, he lost his left arm trying to rescue Lee Jihye.

⸢"Joonghyuk-ssi! No!! Joonghyuk-ssi!!"⸥

During the 55th scenario, he lost his right leg for Lee Hyunsung's sake.

⸢"But, but why did you, for someone like me…"⸥

And during the 74th scenario, he sacrificed both of his eyes to awaken Shin
Yoosung.

⸢"It's because all of you also did that for me. That is all."⸥

Whether this was him trying to atone for his past lives, or an odd, unlikely
whim resulting from the thousandth stab at life, he couldn't tell.

Except that, Yoo Joonghyuk of the 999th regression turn earnestly lived his
life like that. For the first time ever, he gave up on the idea of wanting to
see the 'Conclusion'. What he wished for instead, was…

⸢"I wish for all of you to see the end of this world."⸥

Didn't matter even if he didn't make it, he just wanted one person at the
very least to see the end of this <Star Stream>.
Yoo Joonghyuk of the 999th turn sacrificed his memories and soul for that
purpose. He didn't hesitate to form the 'Other World Pledge' if that allowed
his companions to grow stronger.

And at the end of the road where he sacrificed his everything…

⸢"Captain, we're almost at the Final Scenario."⸥

A small miracle happened.

⸢"Just a little bit more, a bit more and we're there! Joonghyuk-ssi!!"⸥

He couldn't even walk with his own power anymore. He no longer
possessed hands to swing a sword, he didn't have eyes to look at the world
anymore, and couldn't use any of his skills after his bloodstreams all went
haywire.

But as the reward for his sacrifice, his companions managed to get near the
Final Scenario.

⸢"Please wake up! Please. Please!!"⸥

In the end, though, he didn't get to see the conclusion to all the scenarios.
The 'Other World Pledge' had taken away his life on the verge of the Final
Scenario, that was why.

The 'Secretive Plotter' stared at such [999] and spoke up. 【Yoo Joonghyuk
from the 999th regression turn. I respect the life you led. Excluding me, you
were the only one who managed to get near the 'Conclusion'.】

[999] quietly pointed with the [Black Heavenly Demon Sword].

From the body of the 'Secretive Plotter', shouts directed at [999] coming
from other Yoo Joonghyuks flooded out.
– Are you being serious?

– Do you really wish to fight the Great Plotter?

– You need to wake up, [999]!

【However, you are a part of me. No matter how much history you drag
out and use it against me, you'll still never defeat me.】

"If you are really me, then you should know that you can't persuade me."

【The life you experienced only amounts to half of mine. Besides, your
memories aren't even perfect. Yet, you wish to fight me regardless?】
[999] didn't reply and simply built up his momentum.

Perhaps he read something from such a [999], the Plotter's attitude suddenly
changed.

【If this is what you truly want.】

Jet-black smoke rose up and began creating the outer skin of the 'Secretive
Plotter'. A certain man's outer appearance slowly materialised within the
smoke.

The loneliest king in this universe, the white coat-wearing Yoo Joonghyuk
from the 1863rd turn now stood there.

【I too no longer have the need to carry on with this pointless charade.】

At the end of those words, the 'Secretive Plotter' discarded the coat he was
wearing. The white coat flew away with the wind and landed on the surface
of Tongtian.
Pitch-black darkness seemed to wrap around his shoulders, and before long,
a black coat was now covering him. It was the same coat that stayed with
him through to the 1863rd turn.

The [Splitting the Sky Sword] in his hands began emitting ominous aura.

And at the same time, the figures of two Yoo Joonghyuks vanished in the
air.

Kwa-kwakwakwakwakwa!!

Countless friction noises arising from two swords clashing alerted others to
the unfolding fierce battle. The vicious collision of two Statuses caused
sparks to explode endlessly and dyed the sky pure blue.

This sudden eruption of the violent clash prompted the eyes of the
audience, focused on the Great Sage's struggles until then, to shift away.

That also included Yoo Joonghyuk, standing on the surface of Tongtian and
looking up at the ferocious battle between the 999th turn and the 1863rd
turn.

His clenched fists trembled as his muscles tightened. Both of them would
prove to be a difficult opponent for the current him. If he continued to
diligently acquire more 'lives', then he might have reached that lofty height.

Yoo Joonghyuk kept his eyes wide open and fixed his gaze. As if he wanted
to absorb everything about [999] and the 'Secretive Plotter', he read their
Stories over and over again.

[Story, 'Hell of Eternity', has begun its storytelling!]

The Story depicting the truly unfathomable hellish landscape – the 'Yoo
Joonghyuk' who had walked half of that hellish nightmare, and another
'Yoo Joonghyuk' who had actually witnessed the end of that hell, were
clashing against each other.
Two [Breaking the Sky Swordsmanship]'s drew long arcs in the air like
shooting stars. One was from the [Splitting the Sky Sword], while the other
was the [Black Heavenly Demon Sword]. Two swords burned brightly like
a pair of supernovas.

【Now that I look back, you didn't use Splitting the Sky Sword as your
main weapon, did you?】

During the 999th turn, Lee Jihye inherited his [Splitting the Sky Sword].

The 'Secretive Plotter' used the [Breaking the Sky Meteor Strike]
(破天流星決), piercing through [999]'s entire body.

【You will never win against me with such poor sword technique.】

"…I'm sure that's the case. However."

[999] became riddled with wounds in the blink of an eye, yet he didn't back
off and held the sword even tighter.

For a moment there, the Plotter's eyes quaked.

[999] had disappeared for a blink, but then, he materialised right before the
stunned Outer God's eyes. This was not the [Breaking the Sky
Swordsmanship].

It was 'Instant Kill'.

"At least, I can show you the history that I lived through."

It was Lee Jihye's technique.

【Something like this…!】

The [Black Heavenly Demon Sword] was deflected away in the nick of
time, but it now smoothly drew the arc belonging to [Kendo] next.
Tsu-chuchuchut!

The eyes of [999] now flickered with the lights of [Demon Slaying].

The life Lee Jihye lived during the 999th turn was now unfolding from
[999]'s hands. The kick as sturdy as Lee Hyunsung's. The Claw Technique
as ferocious as Lee Seolhwa's. Shin Yoosung's natural perceptiveness, and
even Kim Namwoon's excellent battle sense, too.

Histories that [999] experienced through his body, began telling their
stories now.

In this very moment, [999] wasn't alone.

Techniques from the companions he had saved were being recreated
through his flesh.

[Kendo] broke past the [Breaking the Sky Swordsmanship], and the
combination of [Blackening] and [Demon Slaying] dug into the open gaps
of [Red Phoenix Shunpo].

And so, as Lee Seolhwa's [Thousand Spirits Poison] took aim at the
Plotter's heart…

【With these measly trivial techniques…!】

[Giant Story, 'Pilgrim of the Lonely Apocalypse', has begun its
storytelling!]

[999]'s Story began crumbling away. Lee Hyunsung's defenses crumbled
and
Lee Seolhwa's claws broke. Kim Namwoon and Lee Jihye both fell, while
Shin Yoosung went down on her knees. The [Black Heavenly Demon
Sword] flew out of his hands after he failed to withstand the impact, and the
weapon fell to the surface of the Tongtian River.
Just like always, [999] was left alone.

【999, you have failed.】

Confronted by the unfathomable life lived by one individual, the lives of his
companions all crumbled away.

[999] nodded his head, yet he did not despair. "…In another universe, it
might be different."

[999]'s gaze was redirected to the Tongtian's battlefield, something that the
Great Sage and <Kim Dokja's Company> had created. Events of this
universe that had never happened before.

【…Even you have been fooled by the baseless hope in this place, it
seems.】

"You speak as if it's someone else's business, Great Plotter." [999]
staggered unsteadily, yet he continued to speak. "We have failed. We failed
to save a single one of our companions, and witnessed the end by ourselves.
Was that really the end we wanted to see?"

【That is futile sentimentality.】

"This universe is different."

【No, this universe shouldn't even exist from the beginning.】

The 'Secretive Plotter' spoke coldly as his figure moved.

【This universe was created by the end result interfering with the cause.
This universe hastens the collapse of Probability with its mere existence.
Indeed, this place shouldn't even be allowed to exist, as it's simply a
practical joke by the 'Oldest Dream'…】
"Great Plotter, you already understand this, don't you? Within that closed-
off universe of the oh-so-great 'original storyline', it was impossible to see
the story we wanted to. And that was why you…"

For the first time there, the 'Secretive Plotter' faltered slightly. But that
lasted only for a moment.

He lightly wielded the [Splitting the Sky Sword] which pierced into [999]'s
body.

【Return to me, [999]. I need you back.】

The stabbing [Splitting the Sky Sword] began sucking out [999]'s
memories. Their ego that had been split apart was now being reclaimed.

[999]'s blurring vision shifted down to the Tongtian's surface below. The
'Secretive Plotter' already knew who was down there and spoke in a
mocking tone. 【He has already tasted defeat at my hands. Do you honestly
believe that someone who can't even remember anything is capable of
stopping me?】

"Yoo Joonghyuk, take hold of the sword!"

A sorrowful voice reverberated throughout the Tongtian. And at the place
where that voice reached stood Yoo Joonghyuk, who was neither [999] nor
the Secretive Plotter.

He was looking up with a confused expression but then, looked back down
to the two items resting on top of the debris floating on the river.

[999]'s Black Heavenly Demon Sword, and then… the white coat the
'Secretive Plotter' had discarded.

⸢"I wish to live."⸥
⸢"If I have a chance, just like the world that I saw…"⸥

Pain assaulted him in his head. Unknown memories brushed past his mind.

[Your Stories are getting agitated.]

"You need to remember who you really are!"

As if he was under a spell, Yoo Joonghyuk grasped the [Black Heavenly
Demon Sword]. It felt so natural in his hand, as if it had been his since a
long time ago. And he picked the coat up from the debris as well. It was
white, the colour he disliked.

– You are not the 3rd turn Yoo Joonghyuk.

That day, [999] told him that.

– Haven't you ever wondered why something felt off? Even if Kim
Dokjawas here, does you of the mere '3rd turn' developing this fast make
sense to you?

As he fell deeper into this familiar sense of deja vu, he slowly put the white
coat on. It fit him like a glove, as if he had worn it before.

– Do not try to bullshit me. I'm 3rd turn. I…

It'd be a lie if he had never thought about it at least once before.

Was he really the '3rd turn' Yoo Joonghyuk?

– …And even if I'm not the '3rd turn', all I can remember are the
memoriesof up to the 3rd turn, anyway.

Yoo Joonghyuk slowly raised his head and looked up at the sky.

The slowly-vanishing [999] was looking back at him.
– Don't you have companions now?

The face that he had not seen once, even with a mirror.

– Companions, that remember your life far better than yourself?

The Plotter's [Splitting the Sky Sword] moved. The jet-black Status capable
of rending even the universe itself took aim at him, and in that moment,
Yoo Joonghyuk recalled someone.

And then…

[The 'Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint' 3rd stage has activated!]

As if a Sponsor had descended, the power of a familiar star incarnated into
him.

⸢Let's go.⸥

And the story began.
                      Chapter 445: Ep. 84 - 1864, I


"Dokja ahjussi?"

I hesitated while watching the distant battle between two Yoo Joonghyuks.

[Your Incarnation Body's condition is currently unstable!]

I'd not be any help whatsoever if I joined the fight in my current condition.
And when I took a closer look, the ones fighting were [999] and the
'Secretive Plotter'. I wasn't sure why, but [999] must've decided to side with
us.

I clenched my fists tightly.

⸢Kim Dokja made a decision. There was only one method remaining.⸥

The [Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint].
Just like back then against Nirvana, or during the fight against Poseidon…

– Maknae-yah, what are you hesitating for?


The Great Sage Heaven's Equal spoke to me. Even though he was in the
middle of a huge battle in the sky, he still sensed my emotions.

I muttered in a voice that could barely be heard. "…I've gotten a little afraid
of reading them."

It was probably after fighting against Yoo Joonghyuk back in the 'Isle of
Reincarnators'. And more recently, right after I heard what [999] had to say.

⸢"Do you still believe that you can understand someone through just a few
lines of text in a couple of chapters?"⸥
Up until now, I had been a 'reader' of the stories. However, for how long
would it be okay for me to remain as one?

– Right, you possess the power to read another person.

He had accurately guessed my ability. He stuck around my channel for a
long time as the 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband', so it wouldn't have
been that difficult to figure that much out.

– There was a time when I too, wanted to know more about someone.

I sensed the Great Sage's gaze landing on Yoo Sangah. Or more correctly,
not her exactly but her current 'Incarnation Body'. He was staring at the
body's 'former owner'.

– I still haven't fully understood why Sanzang chased me out twice.

During the original 'Journey to the West', Sun Wukong was expelled from
the party twice.
– However, I never asked Sanzang about it properly. Maybe it was
becauseof my worthless pride. I was stuck in a loop, thinking and
wondering only to myself. Why did that idiot do that? What was the reason
for those decisions? What was the point of such obstinacy? What did I do
wrong, and where did a problem come from? Even after our journey was
over, those questions kept bubbling inside my head.

This would be my first time hearing such a story.

Even to someone like the Great Sage, there were unresolved questions
reserved only for him.

– And by the time I finally found the courage to ask, my opportunity
hadslipped away already.

The faintest trace of dejection could be felt from his voice.

Since I didn't know much about the story after the conclusion of the
'Journey to the West', I had no way of estimating the depths of his sadness.

One thing that I could be sure of, though, was the fact that the real
'Sanzang' was no longer with us in this world, as Yoo Sangah had
reincarnated into the Incarnation Body in question.

– And to find out the answers to those questions, we kept repeating this
⸢Journey to the West Remake⸥, hoping that maybe, someone else would tell
us the story that I didn't know before, something that I had not read before.

Only then did I realize why the Great Sage participated in this scenario
event. I felt curious just then. Did he finally find his answer?

– I couldn't find it. However… I did find a small solace.

The Great Sage's gaze was now fixed on Shin Yoosung. As the
<Emperor>'s attacks rained down, he continued to speak.
– And about that solace, let me tell you all about it.

[Giant Story, 'Journey to the West', is continuing with its storytelling.]

– I'd probably never get to understand certain things. I'd never even
getclose, and maybe, everything I did might be in vain. However, even if
we know it's impossible, we still have to read the Story. That is what it
means to exist as 'Constellations', as the stars of the heavens.

The Great Sage failed to understand Sanzang. And quite likely, he'd never
get to understand even into the future.

Even then, he didn't give up.

– That's why you should read it.

'However, I alone can't…'

– Why do you think you're alone?

I reflexively raised my head after hearing his words.

– Maybe not like you, but people always are reading each other. So, you
should not stop reading, either.

In a way, this advice wasn't really on point.

However, I still ended up feeling a certain something. It was as if small
feathers had piled up. I began thinking that maybe this was the solace the
Great Sage felt while watching our story.

"Yoo Sangah-ssi."

I called out to her, and she looked at me as if she was waiting. "Will you be
alright?"

"Yes. By the way, if it's possible, be gentle…"
Yoo Sangah nodded her head and chanted the Constrictive Sutra in my
direction.

My body slumped to the floor as if a fuse had gone out. My consciousness
managed to slip out and quickly flew towards where I needed to go.

['Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint' 3rd stage is activating!]

[Your degree of understanding of the applicable individual is very high!]

[The '1st Person Protagonist's POV' is activating!]

My vision slowly stabilised and at the same time, powerful strength
overflowed within my body. It was Yoo Joonghyuk's strength.

A short while later, the enemy's figure could be seen before us. An
existence enveloped in the aura of immense Status and arrogantly glancing
at us.

The 'Secretive Plotter'.

The Great Sage was right. That guy could never be defeated alone.

⸢Let's go.⸥

The Transcendent's Status violently raged within my body. I added every
ounce of my own Status to Yoo Joonghyuk.

[Transcendent's Status has encountered the Demon King's Status!]

The powers that I earned so far interweaved with that of Yoo Joonghyuk's
and began boiling up. Vigorous energy circulated within the blood vessels
as if they had a complete overhaul.

Yoo Joonghyuk slowly opened his eyes gleaming in golden light and spoke
back to me. 'You're late'.
He didn't get angry or reprimanded me, simply choosing to say that.

He probably knew that I was playing the role of Sun Wukong, though…

⸢I'm sorry.⸥

'Talk about unimportant matters later. Defeating this bastard takes our
utmost priority'.

Kwa-aaaaah!!

The Plotter's [Splitting the Sky Sword] lightly danced, and the Tongtian
River was split in half. With nary a hair's breadth, we managed to evade the
attack. Constellations and Incarnations coincidentally within the range were
swept away and became nothing more than fading screams. That was truly
a nonsensical attack power.

【You're struggling in vain. Even if you managed to regain your memories,
you still can't defeat me. Because you too also began from me.】

⸢What is he on about now?⸥

Yoo Joonghyuk running on the river's surface replied in annoyance.
'According to him, I'm not Yoo Joonghyuk from the 3rd turn'.

⸢Really? Then, what?⸥

I reflexively asked him, but to be honest, several dizzying theories were
floating around in my brain already. Perhaps this was the question that had
been building up from a long time ago.

⸢'The 3rd turn Yoo Joonghyuk shouldn't have known about such
information, though?'⸥
Back during the [Green Zone] scenario.

⸢'…No matter what, his rate of growth is just too fast'.⸥

…And even back in the [Cinema Dungeon], too.

All the questions I secretly had every time I checked Yoo Joonghyuk's
[Character List] began rising up one after the other. Even the conversation I
had with [999] entered my head.

⸢"Yoo Joonghyuk in this world-line said that he was the 'third turn'. So, this
place is the third regression turn."⸥

⸢"Trusting such information at its face value. How naïve."⸥

By the time I came around, I was already initiating the [Character List].
[Applicable individual's information is far too numerous. 'Character List'
will change to 'Summarised List'.]

[For the convenience of the user, only the selected items will be displayed.]

  <Character Summary>

  Individual: Yoo Joonghyuk

  Exclusive Attributes: Regressor <3rd turn> (Myth), Ruler of
  Amusement (Legendary)…


It said 3rd turn. He was definitely from the 3rd turn.

In that case, just what on earth were those guys talking about…?

⸢Kim Dok ja re ally ca n't t ell?⸥
Pages of my memories began flipping. Memories that I tried so hard not to
recall.

⸢"That 'world' you've shown me, does it really exist?"⸥

⸢[The applicable individual is not a 'Character'.]⸥

'Wake up, Kim Dokja!'

I abruptly regained my wits after hearing Yoo Joonghyuk's shout. Now
wasn't the time to think about something else.

The Plotter's Status as he floated up in the air was strengthening gradually.

【It seems that you still haven't really regained your memories.】

"…I won't lose so easily this time."

As if to oppose that rising Status, Yoo Joonghyuk raised his own power
level. The movement technique, [Red Phoenix Shunpo], and the power of
the [Breaking the Sky Swordsmanship] were pushed to their absolute limits.
The [Breaking the Sky Thunder Sword] completely covered the [Black
Heavenly Demon Sword].

He fought in the same manner the last time. And still lost.

However, those weren't the only things accompanying him this time.

[5th Bookmark has been initiated!]

[Exclusive skill, 'Electrification Lv.23 (+13)', has been initiated.]

[Exclusive skill, 'Way of the Wind Lv.18 (+8)', is activating!]

['Demon King Transformation' is activating!]
Effects of the [Way of the Wind] were added to Yoo Joonghyuk's [Red
Phoenix Shunpo], while the electrical energy from the [Electrification]
permeated into the [Breaking the Sky Thunder Sword]. And finally, the
power of 'Demon King' was added to the power of 'Transcendent'.

Double the power, triple, quadruple… Yoo Joonghyuk's Status multiplied
in an instant and threateningly spread over the Tongtian's surface.

Tsu-chuchuchuchut!

As the sparks danced in the air, we dashed towards the 'Secretive Plotter'.
The [Electrification] and the [Breaking the Sky Thunder Sword] permeated
in the [Black Heavenly Demon Sword]. The greatest technique belonging to
both Kyrgios and the Breaking the Sky Sword Saint emitted blinding light
simultaneously, causing a truly incredible storm of sword aura to gush out.

Kwa-aaaaaah!!

This was the power capable of cleanly splitting mountains in half and
vaporising the ocean itself.

Unfortunately, the 'Secretive Plotter' remained unperturbed even when
facing such power. Two swords then clashed, emitting screeching friction
noise. As I was sharing the sensation with Yoo Joonghyuk, I felt the full
brunt of the pain akin to my hands being torn to pieces.

We were attacking with both hands, while he used only one. Even then…

【How pitiful, Yoo Joonghyuk.】

…We failed to cut the 'Secretive

Plotter'.

Tsu-chut, tsu-chuchuchut.
Sparks exploding around him indicated that he wasn't even going all out.
How could there be such a large gap between our fighting power if that was
the case?

[Story, 'Hell of Eternity', is continuing on with its storytelling.]

The surroundings were morphing into his stage. The hell of regression that
reached 1863 turns. 'Outer Gods' moaning in pain inside burning craters and
countless corpses of the stars strewn about.

【The price for escaping the closed universe and dreaming of a new story is
for you to not even remember who you are. Is that the world you've been
truly wishing for?】

That evil demon-like voice came from beyond the hellish landscape.

I was confused. It was as if I could almost get what he was saying, but at
the same time, I couldn't readily accept it.

Yoo Joonghyuk that escaped from a closed universe and dreamed of a new
story. I knew of only one 'Yoo Joonghyuk' that fit that criteria.

And if that was true, then…

Then, if the Yoo Joonghyuk I knew was that 'Yoo Joonghyuk'…

['The Fourth Wall' is getting even thicker.]

'Kim Dokja, we won't win unless you use that powerful skill'. Yoo
Joonghyuk suddenly yelled out. 'Utilise the Story from the last time'.

I knew what he meant by 'last time'.

The ⸢Hell of Eternity⸥, the Story that I used while fighting against Poseidon
in the past.
Back then, we killed Theseus by borrowing the memories of the 362nd turn
Yoo Joonghyuk. I looked at the Story of darkness flowing around the
'Secretive Plotter' and could only sigh in doubt.

⸢Honestly, I'm not sure whether we can win or not even after using that.⸥

The regression turn I used all my being to read back then was only 362nd.
Things would've improved somewhat by now compared to then, but still, I
couldn't even guess whether that'd be enough to defeat the guy before our
eyes or not.

⸢And also…⸥

That wasn't the only thing making me hesitant here.

If I succeeded in borrowing the strength of Yoo Joonghyuk from higher
turn than 362nd, then this Yoo Joonghyuk would lose his memories
alongside me.

Just like how Constellations and Incarnations read Stories, I too read Yoo
Joonghyuk's 'Ways of Survival'.

If I used the ⸢Hell of Eternity⸥ here, then Yoo Joonghyuk would have to
experience the 'reading' stained by my misunderstandings along with me.

The 'Ways of Survival' I read in order to survive. History that I
'remembered' as I pleased.

I had one-sidedly twisted or exaggerated the 'Yoo Joonghyuk' in that
'history'. My version was questionable at best, an idealistic depiction of the
reality.

⸢…Dammit.⸥
Even then, I had no choice but to do this unfair thing.

[Story, 'Hell of Eternity', has begun its storytelling!]

While stuck inside the feeling of powerlessness, I flipped the pages.
Whether it was before or after the apocalypse, it was the same story – all I
could do at any given moment was to flip through the pages of a book.

Countless regression turns of Yoo Joonghyuk went past my eyes.

3rd turn, 4th, 5th… 41st… 182nd…

Memories continued to flow by.

Many Yoo Joonghyuks were now staring back at us.

362nd turn… 598th… 724th…

[Your 'Comprehension' is advancing towards a new possibility!]

[Pages you couldn't read before are now available!]

862th… 999th…

Blood welled inside my throat. Pain pummelled my head as if to shatter it
into pieces.

[999]. The regression turn that I really liked.

Yoo Joonghyuk's dialogues gradually decreased in the number. This was
my limit.

[You have reached the highest turn you can read.]

[The highest turn 'Yoo Joonghyuk' you can read is '999th'.]
The message popped up like the final score tied to the book report. But I
couldn't lift up my head. How could reading something be this shameful
and feel so wrong?

It was in exact moment that Yoo Joonghyuk opened his mouth. 'Doesn't
matter how you read it, the one to judge it will be me. So, you simply
concentrate on reading'.

He deflected yet another one of the Secretive Plotter's attacks even though
his body was riddled with wounds. He spoke again. 'It's my freedom to
decide what I hear and what I remember. And I shall decide who I am'.

With a voice I knew so well, he was talking about a story that I didn't know.

'You fool, you are not reading it alone'.

The moment I heard him, something woke up inside me.

It wasn't the memories related to the 'Ways of Survival'. No, it was of the
conversation I had with my mother a long time ago.

⸢"Why are we rereading the story we know already?"⸥

There were stories that didn't change even if you read it again. It'd not
change, because the one reading didn't change.

My mother replied to that question in this manner.

⸢"Shall we read it together, then?"⸥

Reading it together.

[Your 'Comprehension' is rapidly being enhanced!]

As my head became even more of a mess, the pages that I couldn't flip with
my powers alone began flipping over.
1146th… 1398th… 1561th… 1733th…

The people I met in this world were flipping the pages together with me. I
still failed to understand some things, but I got to figure out a few others
just then.

And there were some paragraphs that I'd seemingly never understand.

【…!!】

I thought I heard the 'Secretive Plotter' shout something.

My consciousness continued to waver. Like a man fighting the drowsiness,
I continued to flip the pages again and again – while vomiting blood, while
enduring against the merciless barrage of sparks.

I still didn't know much about Yoo Joonghyuk.

⸢"You can only return to that world after I die, correct?"⸥

⸢"If you remain here, you won't be able to save that world."⸥

However, what if my misunderstanding built up over the period of ten-plus
years could help me reach just a tiny sliver of understanding like some kind
of miracle?

⸢"I've become curious about that world's ■■."⸥

Then, I'd be able to read it again.

[The highest turn 'Yoo Joonghyuk' you can read is '1863rd'.]

The Plotter's Status flying in touched the [Black Heavenly Demon Sword]
and scattered away.
I dazedly blinked my eyes. As if the overwritten letters were being peeled
off, the [Character List] began changing. The number '3' was peeled off,
and new numbers were being engraved there, instead.

And on top of this empty piece of blinding white paper, a page I had never
read before began unfolding.


  <Character Summary>

  Individual: Yoo Joonghyuk

  Exclusive Attributes: Regressor <1864th turn> (Myth)


It was a completely new story.
                    Chapter 446: Ep. 84 - 1864, II


The 1864th turn.

We were not in the 3rd turn, but in the 1864th world-line.

The moment I saw that attribute window, waves of realizations that I could
barely digest right now crashed into me.

⸢…This 'Yoo Joonghyuk' is the one that disappeared during the 1863rd
turn?!⸥

⸢How can that even be possible?⸥

⸢But, didn't that Yoo Joonghyuk escape from being a [Character]?⸥
⸢Yoo Joonghyuk from the 1863rd turn escaped from being a [Character]
because the 3rd turn exists. But if that's true, then how could he be the 3rd
turn Yoo Joonghyuk from the get-go…?⸥

Numerous questions brushed past my head, and the last thing to pop up was
the final conversation I had with tls123.

⸢I was thinking of sending you a special gift as a way to express my
gratitude, Dokja-nim.⸥
That 'gift' the author was talking about, could it be…

Kwa-kwakwakwa!!

The Story's power overflowed; the surrounding view of the hellish
landscape began changing. The world was wailing in sorrow, and Outer
Gods fallen into lamentation cried on.

And on that stage of despair, a thin and thread-like, but clear, ray of light
existed. It was the sword light belonging to the [Black Heavenly Demon
Sword].

【Have you regained your memories, then?】

The 'Secretive Plotter' asked, but Yoo Joonghyuk didn't reply. I knew why
he didn't, of course – the explosive amount of memories were making an
utter mess inside his head, that was why.

My reading wasn't perfect.

No matter how diligently I read it, and even though Yoo Joonghyuk worked
together with me, it was physically impossible to completely restore the
'1863rd Yoo Joonghyuk'.

As he staggered about, fragmented memories continued to enter his head.
⸢"Eat dirt, Yoo Joonghyuk."⸥

⸢"Happy memories! Happy memories!"⸥

⸢"Yoo Joonghyuk, sit."⸥

"You son of a…"

⸢This isn't the time to think about that, you idiot!⸥

I hurriedly awakened Yoo Joonghyuk. Because the [Splitting the Sky
Sword] carrying the Status of a Hellscape was slashing towards his nose
right at that moment.

Along with "CLANG!!" two swords clashed loudly once more.

The attack still felt considerably heavy. However, it wasn't as intolerable as
before.

【…I wanted to fight you.】

For the first time ever, the light of emotions began spreading within the
Plotter's eyes that used to remain calm no matter what happened. The 'Yoo
Joonghyuk' who survived the 'original story' I read, and who saw its finale –
the 'Secretive Plotter' was now talking to us.

【You bastard, you disappeared to the 'beyond' without a word.】

I had no idea what he was talking about. It seemed that Yoo Joonghyuk,
too, had no idea. The stuff I read in great haste was imperfect, and because
of that, there were lots of holes in Yoo Joonghyuk's memories.

He then angrily spat out. "Looks like I'll have to teach you how not to speak
in riddles."
[Giant Story, 'Demon Realm's Spring', has begun its storytelling!]

[Giant Story, 'Torch that Swallowed the Myth', has begun its storytelling!]

[Story, 'Hell of Eternity', is continuing on with its storytelling!]

The Stories we shared were shoved into the [Black Heavenly Demon
Sword] simultaneously. The ensuing attack clashed against the [Splitting
the Sky Sword]. And the moment two Hellscapes collided, a whole
universe opened up between the blades.

It was basically a Big Bang of memories.

[Two remarkably similar beings are colliding.]

['Disconnected Film Theory' is activating!]

The moment I saw the view of the universe, I instantly realized which
phenomenon was about to unfold here.

It was none other than the [Disconnected Film Theory].

A similar event also occurred back when the two Shin Yoosungs from the
two different world-lines met.

⸢【…This is a new world-line?】⸥

These memories were brought up to the surface after two definitely-similar
Yoo Joonghyuks walking on completely opposing paths collided.

⸢【It's not possible for this kind of a world-line to exist.】⸥

These were the Plotter's memories. Memories of the very day that he had
discovered this particular '3rd turn'.

…
…

…

【Interesting. Is this really the 3rd turn…?】

The 'Secretive Plotter' couldn't tear his eyes away from the 3rd turn's story
playing out before his eyes. Someone he didn't recognise was advancing the
story along with himself from the 3rd turn. He couldn't understand how
such a thing could even be possible. 【However, you'll still fail.】

They used some methods he recognised, while he hadn't even thought of
some others before. Sometimes, they looked to be reckless, and in some
other times, they got real lucky. This was a Story he had never seen before.
The 'Secretive Plotter' watched the Story of this world-line as if he was
sucked right into it.

And so, how long had he been watching this Story?

He finally realized that he had become exactly the same as the
Constellations that he loathed so much.

All the 'Yoo Joonghyuks' he had absorbed were talking to him.

– Have you forgotten, the Great Plotter?

– We wish for 'death'.

– That regression turn will not succeed, anyway.

Death. That was the ardent wish of all Yoo Joonghyuks cursed with the fate
of regression. The 'Secretive Plotter' existed solely for the sake of fulfilling
that mission.

– It's impossible to kill the 'Oldest Dream'.
– As long as we are alive, we must regress again.

– Even if dying is impossible, what would it be like to get infinitely close
toit?

The reason for sending Han Sooyoung's Avatar to the 1863rd turn was
precisely because of that. By using the irregular discovered in this 3rd turn,
they'd complete their 'death'.

He was planning to seal away every Yoo Joonghyuk via the [Disconnected
Film Theory] – to merge with the 1863rd Yoo Joonghyuk and fall into an
everlasting slumber.

But on the verge of that plan's completion, he had a sudden change of heart.
⸢"I'm simply heading towards the 'Final Chapter(終章)'."⸥

It was because of one certain Constellation that searched for his own ■■.

The Final Chapter. The name of ■■ that he dearly wished for, but never
received.

[41st turn's 'Yoo Joonghyuk' is shocked.]

[416th turn's 'Yoo Joonghyuk' is shocked.]

[967th turn's 'Yoo Joonghyuk' is shocked.]

[1472nd turn's 'Yoo Joonghyuk' is shocked.]

…

Yoo Joonghyuks from all the regression turns inside him also witnessed
that spectacle. Some Yoo Joonghyuks marvelled, some despaired. And
some Yoo Joonghyuks grew furious.

The 'Secretive Plotter' belonged to the last category.
【…It's not possible for another Final Chapter to exist.】

His world had already come to an end. He had reached his 'Conclusion' by
going through trials and errors of the 1863rd regression turn. He had lost
everything, and he witnessed the end of all scenarios. And he reached that
Wall.

He hadn't been wrong – and he wanted validation for it.

【Let's say that you reached the end and saved the world through your
methods. If so, what are you going to do about the 'other worlds'?】

【What will happen to other worlds that you didn't save?】

And so, the 'Secretive Plotter' sent Kim Dokja to the 1863rd turn.

He made the fool witness the end of the story.

To tell him, "This is the true 'original story'."

To tell him, "This is the end of the world I have decided on, and nothing
can change that fact no matter what."

⸢"I'll end your story for you."⸥

However, Kim Dokja, he…

⸢"I won't be returning to the 3rd turn. I'll remain here and witness the end
with the people of this place."⸥
…He changed that.

Tsu-chuchuchuchuchut!!

The Yoo Joonghyuk sealing plan failed, and the direction of the story that
should've been set in stone was diverted.
[1863rd turn's 'Yoo Joonghyuk' is refusing to cooperate with you.]

⸢"I wish to live."⸥

Yoo Joonghyuk who should've been sealed away, chose 'regression' instead,
and entered a brand new world.

The 'Secretive Plotter' hurriedly collected the memories of all the 'dead'
Yoo Joonghyuks and chased after him. He chased after the Yoo Joonghyuk
wearing the white coat, crossing the blinding starlights of the world-lines
while his memories scattered away.

This Yoo Joonghyuk had cast off the mask of [Character] and flew towards
the brand new world.

【Stop!! You cannot head to the next part!】

Only the 'Secretive Plotter' knew of this world's conclusion.

The 1863rd turn was the 'end of all stories'. And after it was…

⸢I wish to witness that 'world'.⸥

【Return to me. The place you're supposed to be, is here! You…!】

The 'Secretive Plotter' roared out. Even if the 'Oldest Dream' permitted this
regression, in the end Yoo Joonghyuk was bound to repeat the nightmare
again. And not to forget, him starting the scenarios without his memories
would mean…

⸢That fool definitely said it. He said that universe definitely exists.⸥

['Oldest Dream' is growing curious of that story.]
Yoo Joonghyuk was reaching out. He was now picturing it, a world located
so far away. A world that didn't exist within the universe of the 'Ways of
Survival'.

The 'Secretive Plotter' managed to catch up to Yoo Joonghyuk's soul form
in the nick of time. But what he grabbed onto was simply the white coat.
Yoo Joonghyuk's body had already disappeared by then.

The 'Secretive Plotter' muttered out hollowly. 【You fool…】

The 'Yoo Joonghyuk' who lost his memories succeeded in regressing.

This would be another futile story where the beginning and the end were
already set in stone. The everlasting nightmare was about to repeat itself
again in that place.

The 'Secretive Plotter' began searching for this world-line.

He wanted to learn more about the world-line that the oh-so-amazing idiot
disappeared into even at the cost of his memories. The Plotter thought that
he'd feel better about himself after witnessing that fool living out the
scenarios in wretched, broken misery and regret.

Eventually, he discovered the world-line in question. Shockingly enough,
he knew about this world-line already.

【…This can't be possible.】

But only then, everything seemed to click into place.

The reason why a world-line he didn't recognise suddenly appeared.

The reason why a completely different world-line existed where the 3rd
turn should've been.
Every regression he experienced was used as a sacrifice to create this
'worldline above the Wall'.

['Oldest Dream' is dreaming the 'Final Dream'.]

This was the impossible world-line created by the end result interfering
with the cause.

His universe was shaking now.

…

…

…

As the explosion resounded out, Yoo Joonghyuk's and the Plotter's figures
separated. We fixed our grip on the [Black Heavenly Demon Sword] and
glared at the enemy before us.

The 'Secretive Plotter' spoke. 【…Now you know. This universe shouldn't
even exist.】

Finally, I could understand what this guy was talking about. And also, I
could understand just a little how this world-line came to be, and why these
events had occurred.

The 'beyond' that Yoo Joonghyuk from 1863rd turn chose during his
regression – that was the regression turn we were experiencing right now.

【What a cruel thing this is. You just about managed to escape from being
the puppet of the nightmare, yet you became the puppet once more.】

His tone of voice was heavy with grief. I couldn't even fathom the depths of
resentment contained within his words.
【If you read the same book hundreds of times, you might come up with a
different interpretation. However, the texts will not change. Because those
are the events that had already ended, and can't be turned back to the
beginning.】

The Plotter's [Splitting the Sky Sword] was drawing a long trajectory in the
sky. It contained the weight of the 1863rd turn.

The one who used to be Yoo Joonghyuk once upon a time, but now lived
on as the 'Secretive Plotter'. The one who dreamed of the death of all the
'Yoo Joonghyuks' in the world.

He spoke up once more. 【The only reason why all of you managed to
survive was because I exist.】

And that existence was wielding his history like a weapon.

【All of you, you should've died in that subway. Or back in that Cinema
Dungeon. You should've died at Nirvana's hands, and should've perished
in the Dark Castle.】 He was right.

【You should've died in the Demon Realm. You should've died during the
'Gigantomachia', and you should've all died tens, no, hundreds of times
already during the 'Great War of Saints and Demons', and during the
'Journey to the West'.】

If his life didn't exist, if his failures didn't exist…

…Then none of us would have survived until now.

【So, how did you all manage to survive??】

And now, he was asking us.
【Why, why is it not me, but you??】
                    Chapter 447: Ep. 84 - 1864, III


I recalled that time when I visited the 1863rd turn.

When I first saw the 1863rd turn Yoo Joonghyuk, I thought that he was the
'Yoo Joonghyuk from the original'. The main character that I spent my
childhood years with, the very one that propped up my life.

But then, he was not him.

The 'Yoo Joonghyuk' who helped me endure, had finished his tale a long
time ago. He had reached the conclusion of the 1863rd turn and witnessed
the end of the world, and then, roamed the horrifying abyss of the
worldlines. For thousands of years, maybe even for tens of thousands.

I didn't know just how long he lived on like that. But, what I knew for sure
was that one, he had survived until now, two, he remembered all of those
times, and…

…And, he was being hostile towards me.
【You all do not possess the right to witness the ■■.】

He was right.

The only reason why I managed to wade past the scenarios was due to the
Plotter's life preceding mine.

His Status was growing even stronger. The 'Outer Gods' observing the
situation in the vicinity all knelt down simultaneously.

[OhOhOhOhOh…]

His aura mushrooming up like clouds wrapped around the [Splitting the
Sky Sword]. That was the power he gained after living through 1863 lives,
and also, while roaming the world-lines afterwards.

[Giant Story, 'Pilgrim of the Lonely Apocalypse', has begun its

storytelling.] Countless 'Yoo Joonghyuks' were looking straight at me from

inside him.

['Yoo Joonghyuk' from 41st turn is looking at you.]

['Yoo Joonghyuk' from 362nd turn is looking at you.]

['Yoo Joonghyuk' from 666th turn is looking at you.]

['Yoo Joonghyuk' from 999th turn is looking at you.]

The histories they had compiled together – all their sins, they were right
there. Sins so numerous that not even Jophiel's [Eye of Sin] could see the
end of.
He was an existence deemed to be 'Terror' by this <Star Stream>. A being
that went beyond the boundaries of 'evil' and had been declared as
'incomprehensible' by the world. He was the king of the Outer Gods.

However, his true nature was neither evil nor was it terror.

No, the reason why he had to be ostracised by the <Star Stream> was
because his character proved to be simply too uncompromising.

⸢"I shall destroy the <Star Stream>."⸥

And the thing was, the <Star Stream> didn't like such characters that lacked
any flexibility whatsoever.

One's character had to bend sometimes, had to know when to yield, and
also, had to know when to crumble away. However, the 'Secretive Plotter'
wasn't a character like that.

That's why he was able to get this far, and was able to become the
'Secretive Plotter'.

⸢"I shall definitely kill the one that started this story with these hands."⸥

That was the 'apocalypse' of this world, the one he wished for. And also, the
'end of regression' that all Yoo Joonghyuks wished for, as well.

[Constellation, 'Secretive Plotter', is looking at you.]

He was definitely in the right.

He definitely… was far more qualified than anyone to witness the
conclusion of all the stories. Especially so, when compared to someone like
me, whose only achievement was reading the 'Ways of Survival'…

'Stop with your unnecessary thoughts. And don't stupidly sympathise with
him, either,' said Yoo Joonghyuk. 'Are you planning to yield to some
random bastard after you came this far? Was the Story you managed to
compile so far created solely by copying that bastard's life?' I couldn't reply.

'If you sympathise with what he says, then it's the same thing as denying the
lives of your companions who fought alongside you'.

For sure, I did rely on the 'Ways of Survival' in the beginning to skirt past
the dangers, but things were different after that. Events that didn't happen
during the original novel occurred, and dangers not found within it also
came to visit us. And I managed to overcome those dangers with my
companions.

As our Story continued to grow, so did my distance from the 'Ways of
Survival', and from a certain moment on, I stopped consulting the original.
That was also the reason why I hadn't read the final revised version yet.

This world was not the same one from the 'Ways of Survival' that the
Secretive Plotter lived through.

Yoo Joonghyuk continued to speak. 'He could be right. His decisions might
have been right, too. However, it's still not a good enough reason for you to
yield to him'.

[Story, 'Life and Death Companions', has begun its storytelling.]

'Because we are also right,' said Yoo Joonghyuk, the one who also endured
the tragedies of the 1863 regression turns. Without a doubt, he too was also
'Yoo Joonghyuk'. 'It still doesn't really feel real to me, but if I have been
truly experiencing the 1864th turn, then…'

Yoo Joonghyuk, gripping the [Black Heavenly Demon Sword], shifted his
gaze for a brief moment towards our companions on the Tongtian River.

Lee Jihye's fleet was continuing their barrage, and Shin Yoosung's
[Chimera
Dragon] was spewing out its Breath attack. Lee Hyunsung gripped tightly
by Jung Heewon was also fighting hard as well. Meanwhile, Jang Hayoung
was running hard with Lee Gilyoung on her back.

None had died, and they were trying their best. So that they could see the
end of this stinking world.

'Most likely, I came here to witness this sight'.

The [Black Heavenly Demon Sword] and the [Splitting the Sky Sword]
clashed once more. Two swords that didn't want to back down continued to
roar on, their blades filled with the self-belief of their wielders.

The 'Secretive Plotter' shouted out. 【Do you still not understand? Even if
you have regained your memories…】

"How persistent. Just what do you expect to hear from me, then?"
【…What?】

"Do you want us to admit our loss? If not, do you want us to understand
your life?"

【Understand? You can keep your…!】

"Indeed, you probably don't need it." Yoo Joonghyuk replied
disinterestedly. And because he was also Yoo Joonghyuk, he could say
these following words. "I too don't need you to understand me."

He said that, because they understood each other already.

Loud metallic clangs resounded out every time two swords collided. One
Status violently clashed against another Status.

[Story, 'Hell of Eternity', is roaring out!]

Two hellish landscape intertwined to create this battlefield.
Frustratingly, all I could do was to watch these two Yoo Joonghyuks. And
do whatever it took to flip these damn pages.

[Giant Story, 'Season of Light and Darkness', is thrashing violently.]

The winner couldn't easily be decided. Even then, the 'Secretive Plotter'
remained utterly relaxed.

Perhaps that was obvious; our side only just got to use the power of the
'1863rd' turn, after all. In terms of proficiency and familiarity, we were in
an overwhelmingly disadvantageous position.

Maybe thinking that victory was in the bag now, the 'Secretive Plotter'
leisurely asked a question. 【I'm curious. The puppet of the 'Oldest Dream',
what is the conclusion you wish to see?】

"And why should I answer you?"

【Could it be that it's the same thing as that 'Demon King of Salvation'? Do
you honestly believe that man?】

Two blades clashed in mid-air and huge shockwaves spread out.

Yoo Joonghyuk took a step back while wiping the blood off his lips.

【You have no idea. No idea how pathetic that 'companion' you trust so
much actually is. You don't know what the 'conclusion' of the world he
wishes for is.】

The 'Secretive Plotter' faintly grinned as he rained down his [Breaking the
Sky Swordsmanship].

【When this world-line opened for the first time, Kim Dokja's goal was to
merely 'survive'.】
⸢I dazedly raised my head and looked at Yoo Sangah. Quite likely, this
woman will die. And so will I.⸥
In the gap between the two blades, the Stories I lived through were
breathing with life.

【His next goal was to… To become stronger by using you.】

⸢"Make me your companion. I can fill in the part you lack."⸥

⸢Yoo Joonghyuk is definitely necessary in order to clear the numerous
scenarios still remaining in the future.⸥
As if pages were flipping over, Stories I lived through were being projected
right before our eyes. As if to stop that story, Yoo Joonghyuk viciously
swung his sword, but all of his attempts were denied by the Plotter's
[Splitting the Sky Sword].

Meanwhile, the Plotter continued on. 【After that, well. After he found
himself with a little bit of leeway, he even dared to dream of this 'world's
conclusion'.】

⸢"Hyung, aren't you going to make a wish for something?"

I quietly stared at Lee Gilyoung for a little while before making my reply.

"I made a wish to see the epilogue of a certain novel."⸥

The Great Sage Heaven's Equal said this before, that it wasn't only me who
read other people. Just as I've read them, they were also reading me at the
same time, he said.

He was right.
While I was busy reading the 'Ways of Survival', the 'Secretive Plotter' was
also reading my story. He had been observing the entirety of the life I
experienced.

【Kim Dokja began dreaming the same thing that I used to dream about
once upon a time. He wanted to destroy the heaven's <Star Stream>, and
destroy the world beyond the 'Wall' that I couldn't overcome. He wanted
to save every one of his companions, and even…】 ⸢I saw the group of
Nebulas floating in the middle of the darkened sky. <Vedas>,
<Olympus>, <Papyrus>… I shall never forget everything you have
done.⸥

⸢"I will create a 'Story' that hasn't existed before."⸥

Memories continued to stream by before our eyes. Some were as exactly as
I remembered, while some were distorted or twisted around. Because it
wasn't an intact 'Story', that's why.

This was the Plotter's interpretation of 'Kim Dokja's story'.

⸢This is what the 'Secretive Plotter' feels.⸥

He continued to speak. 【Kim Dokja will not achieve that goal now.
Specifically, he won't be able to.】

I wanted to ask why he thought that.

['The Fourth Wall' is faintly shaking.]

【A Story could be made up, but it'll never tell a lie.】

The Plotter's left hand touched Yoo Joonghyuk's hair. The [Black Heavenly
Demon Sword] reflexively slapped that hand away, but by then it was too
late.
[Story, 'One Who is Loved by an Archangel', has begun its storytelling.]

As if they were newborn babies, the Stories I possessed began crying out
one by one. Some of them were Stories I was familiar with. On the other
hand…

[Story, 'The Fifth Sun Wukong', has begun its storytelling.]

Some were Stories I had earned not too long ago. And…

[Story, 'Rival Acknowledged by the Dragon', has begun its storytelling.]

[Story, 'the Sea God's Companion-in-Arms', has begun its storytelling.]

[Story, 'Goryeo's Number Two Sword', has begun its storytelling.]

And, there were some Stories that I didn't even know I had them.

All of my Stories were speaking up at the same time.

【Oh, 'Demon King of Salvation'. You can't destroy the <Star Stream>.】

Stars in the sky were flickering brightly. They were the same stars that I
used to hate.

[Constellation, 'God of Wine and Ecstasy', is watching you.]

[Constellation, 'Father of the Rich Night', is watching you.]

Those who had been watching me, allowing me to get this far.

[Constellation, 'Queen of the Darkest Spring', is watching you.]

…My supposedly oldest enemies.

【…Because you do not hate the Constellations.】
Even as I listened to the 'Secretive Plotter', I couldn't say anything. I wanted
to say that it wasn't true. I wanted to say that I hated Constellations. I
wanted to say that bringing them down was still one of my goals. However,
I couldn't. Because goddammit, I…

[Constellation, 'Maritime War God', is watching you.]

…I knew now that not every star in the sky emitted the same sort of light as
the others.

[Constellation, 'Bald General of Justice', is watching you.]

[Constellation, 'Goryeo's First Sword', is watching you.]

From the 'Absolute Throne' scenario, to the 'Demon Realm'…

Without the Probability they had gathered for us, I'd not be able to get this
far.

[Constellation, 'Demon-like Judge of Fire', is watching you.]

[Constellation, 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon', is watching you.]

[Constellation, 'Most Ancient Liberator', is watching you.]

I had no choice but to acknowledge it.

All of my Stories were created together with them.

【You do not wish for any 'loss' to occur to this world-line. Because you
grew to love this story. And that is why…】 As if he was putting a full-stop
on the story, the 'Secretive Plotter' declared loudly. 【…You shall never
witness this world's ■■.】

Thunders roared in the heavens.
The battle between the Great Sage and <Emperor> was intensifying.

[Many audience members are watching your battlefield.]

Constellations were looking down at us from above.

Some pitied me, while some got angry in my stead. Countless indirect
messages flooded in endlessly.

Yoo Joonghyuk remained wordless. The raindrops falling on the Tongtian
River substituted for any spoken words.

I wanted to say something, anything.

But before I could open my mouth, though, someone else stole the
opportunity away.

"So? What is it that you're trying to say here?" It was Yoo Joonghyuk.
"Since Kim Dokja doesn't have the qualification, you will see this world's
■■ in his stead, is that it?"

A faint crease formed on the forehead of the 'Secretive Plotter'. 【It seems
that you can't think straight anymore. That man whom you thought of as
your companion is no different to the Constellations that you hate. That
bastard is…】

"…He's a pathetic fool, indeed." Yoo Joonghyuk cut him off in the middle.
"He was just some contracted worker for a no-name game developer, and
his hobby was reading novels."

His shabby self-introduction-like words reverberated around the sky.

Those were the things I told Yoo Joonghyuk some time ago.
"His specialty is to run his cocky mouth off, and he has this habit of
throwing his life away so that we can overcome any and all impossible
situations hindering us."

Yoo Joonghyuk was talking about me that even I didn't know about.

"Someone like that managed to lead his companions this far."

The [Black Heavenly Demon Sword] shoved the [Splitting the Sky Sword]
along with a loud "Creaaaak!!". For the first time ever since the battle
commenced, Yoo Joonghyuk was going on a concentrated offensive.

The Plotter's expression shook. Yoo Joonghyuk's sword strikes were now
digging into the Outer God's defenses for the first time.

"Regardless of what the incoming conclusion is, this world wouldn't have
come this far without him around."

【You don't know anyt…!!】

"It seems to me that you're the one who can't think straight here. Why are
you interfering with this world-line, then?"

The wrathful [Breaking the Sky Swordsmanship] mowed the darkness
down. The Plotter's figure wavered around greatly as he was pushed back.

Not missing that small opening, Yoo Joonghyuk's sword rained down like a
raging storm.

"What is your goal, anyway? If you found Kim Dokja an eyesore, why
didn't you kill him earlier? If you found him using your life to survive that
disgusting, then…"

The [Black Heavenly Demon Sword] was now aiming at the neck of the
'Secretive Plotter'.
[Constellation, 'Secretive Plotter', is glaring at the Incarnation, 'Yoo
Joonghyuk'.]

The moment when the two gazes collided, Yoo Joonghyuk asked again.

"Why are you still watching this story?"
                    Chapter 448: Ep. 84 - 1864, IV


Why did the 'Secretive Plotter' watch our Story until now?

"Answer me."

He was the king of Outer Gods, and he had seen his 'Conclusion'. Meaning,
if he wanted to eliminate me he'd have done so even if it cost a huge
amount of Probability.

⸢However, he didn't do that.⸥

The 'Secretive Plotter' was now looking at Yoo Joonghyuk and me.

His consciousness was far too deep and extensive that I'd not be able to
understand even if I used the [Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint] on him.
That might've been the case, but at least in this moment, I thought that I
could understand him.
– If I plagiarised the 'Ways of Survival' for my novel, then what were you
plagiarised from?

Han Sooyoung of the 1863rd turn asked me that question.

Even though I knew the answer, I didn't give her one. Because I didn't want
to admit it.

The world created by her during the 1863rd turn was, in a way, far more
complete than the life I had led. Everyone from the original novel was
alive, and Seoul possessed the necessary infrastructure to deal with the
Final Scenario, too.

The only thing missing in that picture was 'Yoo Joonghyuk'.

I thought that was unfair. I thought that the world copied from the original
with its main character excluded was wrong.

⸢Certain copies can surpass the original.⸥

Despite that, I couldn't take my eyes off the world that Han Sooyoung had
created. Even when I thought it was wrong. Because her story contained the
elements that I was also aiming for.

[Constellation, 'Secretive Plotter', is looking at you.]

Did copyright exist for one's life, too?

But, was it okay to describe one's life as a 'work of an author'?

【Demon King of Salvation.】

The one who offered up his life for the sake of another world-line's success
was now looking straight at me. The only man in this world who possessed
the 'right' to witness the 'Conclusion'.
Even then, he couldn't see the end he wanted to see. Such a man grabbed
Yoo Joonghyuk's [Black Heavenly Demon Sword] with his bare hand and
spoke up. 【Is a story with no proper 'Ending' a failed story?】

Stories flowed out from the fingers cut by the blade. Stories that I was
intimately familiar with.

The story that I read for over ten years.

【Do you truly, honestly believe that a 'proper conclusion' exists in this
world?】

Yoo Joonghyuk hurriedly swung the [Black Heavenly Demon Sword],
causing the Plotter's figure to distance himself.

'Stay sharp, Kim Dokja. He's going to come at us seriously now'.

[Attribute, 'Demon King Slayer', is activating!]

[Attribute, 'Terror of Stars', is activating!]

The sword made to cut down Demon Kings and Constellation began crying
out.

[Story, 'Hell of Eternity', is howling out!]

[Giant Story, 'Pilgrim of the Lonely Apocalypse', is continuing with its
storytelling!]

A person who completed a 'Giant Story' through nothing but his own life
was right before us.

Kka-gagagagack!!
We couldn't handle the approaching Story and were forced back. Like
soaked cotton, the whole body felt heavy. The Tongtian's waters overturned
and the bottom of the river got exposed.

We used the exposed bottom as our support and swung the sword towards
the sky.

Breaking the Sky Swordsmanship.

Destruction Technique.

Breaking the Sky Meteor Strike.

The thunderbolt stabbing into the sky shot out from the tip of the [Black
Heavenly Demon Sword]. The Statuses of a Demon King and a
Constellation, as well as a Transcendent, were added on top of the multiple
sword lights that hacked the sky like a falling meteor shower.

And the other side shifted his [Splitting the Sky Sword] as well.

Kwa-kwakwakwa!!

He also possessed the same techniques we possessed. Two identical meteor
showers collided in the air and a massive explosion rang out.

When the technique was the same, what decided the outcome was the
proficiency as well as the Status of the Story.

[Giant Story, 'Pilgrim of the Lonely Apocalypse', is remembering the

story.] Unfortunately, we couldn't claim an advantage in either of those

aspects.

'Kim Dokja!'

That didn't mean we'd back off here, though.
I desperately unleashed other Stories while still operating the ⸢Hell of
Eternity⸥.
[Story, 'One who Murdered the Outer God', has begun its storytelling!]

The reason why our opponent held the upper hand was due to the two
attributes – 'Demon King Slayer' and 'Terror of Stars'. In that case, we
needed to unshackle the Story that allowed us to fight against the 'Outer
God'.

Ku-gugugugu!!

One Status collided with another. Blood trickled down Yoo Joonghyuk's
nose. However, he didn't back away.

Not just him, but even the Stories seemed to understand it. They perhaps
knew that, if they stopped telling their stories now, then all stories would
stop right here.

【It's useless.】

The Plotter's Status moved. The Giant Story's aura that previously existed
in vague ripples was rapidly changing. The ⸢Pilgrim of the Lonely
Apocalypse⸥ morphed into a giant, and its huge palm began crushing down
on us.

Yoo Joonghyuk roared out in opposition. "We too have Giant Stories!"

[Giant Story, 'Demon Realm's Spring', is continuing with its storytelling!]

[Giant Story, 'Torch that Swallowed the Myth', is continuing with its
storytelling!]

The world of the Giant Stories streamed past before our eyes.
The ⸢Demon Realm's Spring⸥ that battled against Surya during the Demon
King Selection.

The ⸢Torch that Swallowed the Myth⸥ we earned while experiencing the
'Gigantomachia'.

Two Giant Stories, one taking on the figure of a lion while the other, a
dragon, began biting and tearing into the giant's palm, and resisted it.

[41st turn's 'Yoo Joonghyuk' is watching you.]

[666th turn's 'Yoo Joonghyuk' is watching you.]

[999th turn's 'Yoo Joonghyuk' is watching you.]

Countless Yoo Joonghyuks within the 'Secretive Plotter' were observing
this battle.

I recalled the [666] and [999] in my mind. They should be in there
somewhere. Along with the Plotter himself, they had been watching me
from the beginning of this world-line.

They were watching the heated battle between two Yoo Joonghyuks and
were growing agitated.

[The ⸢Stage Transformation⸥ is activating!]

The sky split open, then light and darkness began creating a new 'world'.

[Giant Story, 'Season of Light and Darkness', has begun its storytelling.]

The ⸢Season of Light and Darkness⸥ was our 'Giant Story'. But at the same
time, it was the Plotter's Story, as well.

And even in this Giant Story, Yoo Joonghyuk still lost to the Plotter.
【You cannot win.】

The effects of the ⸢Stage Transformation⸥ were absolute.

The history of defeat would only go on to create yet another history of
defeat.

⸢A man wearing a white coat was looking up at the sky. And the man
wearing the black coat met that gaze.⸥
The Plotter's eyes trembled.

Without a doubt, this was the exact same battle against the same Yoo
Joonghyuk as before. Yet, something was different. The Plotter looked
down at his own coat.

It was black.

The colour of his coat was the opposite.

⸢Light and darkness were colliding. And one single watcher was observing
the whole story.⸥

Incredible Status gathered on Yoo Joonghyuk's right arm. It was clear
which technique he was planning to use.

The greatest technique the current him could call upon: the [Shooting Star
Slash].

Back during the Apocalypse Dragon battle, Yoo Joonghyuk failed to defeat
the 'Secretive Plotter' with this technique.

[Incarnation, 'Jung Heewon', has temporarily transferred her share of the
Giant Story.]
Everyone from <Kim Dokja's Company> in the not-too-distant battlefield
was adding their strength to us. Everyone who held shares in the Giant
Story was now participating in this battle.

[Incarnation, 'Han Sooyoung', has temporarily transferred her share of the
Giant Story.]

[Incarnation, 'Shin Yoosung', has temporarily transferred her share of the
Giant Story.]

[Incarnation, 'Lee Gilyoung', has temporarily transferred his share of the
Giant Story.]

Every Story of <Kim Dokja's Company> gathered on Yoo Joonghyuk's
[Black Heavenly Demon Sword]. After seeing his Story balloon up like
that, the 'Secretive Plotter' began pouring out his own Status as well.

They might be two identical Yoo Joonghyuks, but the Stories they created
were completely different.

⸢Who is Yoo Joonghyuk?⸥

The Stories they possessed acted like that question's answer.

[Giant Story, 'Pilgrim of the Lonely Apocalypse', is continuing with its
storytelling.]

The Story of the 'Secretive Plotter' was Yoo Joonghyuk from the 1st
regression turn, 2nd, then 100th, and even the 1000th. A Story built up
solely by one person's existence piling up on top of one another.

⸢All tragedies had become dull, and only one being's existence grew
bloated.⸥
The sword light from the swung [Black Heavenly Demon Sword] opposed
that very Story.

[Story, 'Life and Death Companions', is continuing with its storytelling.]

That was Yoo Joonghyuk's reply.

[Story, 'Child of the Past and Future', has begun its storytelling.]

Yoo Joonghyuk was Shin Yoosung.

[Story, 'Judge of Destruction', has begun its storytelling.]

He was Jung Heewon, and…

[Story, 'False Saviour', is continuing with its storytelling.]

He was also Han Sooyoung. And then…

[Story, 'Demon King of Salvation', is continuing with its storytelling!]

And, he was me.

Kwa-aaaaah!!

The [Shooting Star Slash] collided with the Plotter's Giant Story. This fight
was quite literally at a deadlock, and a moment's carelessness could very
well decide the victor. Every Story we possessed powerfully slammed
forward. And then…

[666th turn's 'Yoo Joonghyuk' is…]

A very small change occurred in the midst of this battle.

[362nd turn's 'Yoo Joonghyuk' is…]
A deafening boom went off, and the exploding spray of the river water
formed a curtain of grey fog. The river water then rushed down on us and
swept Yoo Joonghyuk's body away. His consciousness was fading.

I subbed for him and dragged the Incarnation Body towards some nearby
floating debris to climb on top of it.

When I took a closer look, though, it wasn't some normal piece of debris,
but a small island created out of the corpses of the 'Outer Gods', instead.

It was then that I heard a voice.

【There is only one difference between you and I.】

As the grey fog of river water rescinded, the figure of the 'Secretive Plotter'
flopped down on the corpse island revealed itself.

【You simply got lucky, and I didn't.】 Tsu-

chut, chuchuchut!

His black coat was in a tattered mess. Sparks were dancing all over his
body.

[1562nd turn's 'Yoo Joonghyuk' is…]

[1321st turn's 'Yoo Joonghyuk' is…]

'Yoo Joonghyuks' inside him were now rebelling against him. They were
refusing to heed the Plotter's will.

[999th turn's 'Yoo Joonghyuk' wishes to see the end of the 1864th turn.]

His Status was decreasing little by little. And his body was also gradually
shrinking, as well. His bulging muscles were getting smaller, and his height
decreased, too.
Soon, the 'Secretive Plotter' that lost his Status had morphed into the figure
of a boy.

I staggered back to my – Yoo Joonghyuk's – feet.

"You…"

I wanted to say something, but no voice wanted to come out.

[The absolute majority of the audience are shivering at your battle!]

[A portion of the audience is…]

We won.

Countless indirect messages flooded in, but not one of them entered my
head.

The 'Secretive Plotter' was sitting on his butt all alone on top of this island.
The [Splitting the Sky Sword] stabbed into the floor was the only thing
supporting him.

While gripping the [Black Heavenly Demon Sword] tightly, I cautiously
approached him.

Even though he was the same Yoo Joonghyuk, why did he have to live such
a different life? Why did this guy have to overcome all these tragedies by
himself?

[Giant Story, 'Pilgrim of the Lonely Apocalypse', is faltering in its
storytelling.]

Was it because he didn't have any companions?

Companions…
[41st turn's 'Yoo Joonghyuk' is staying vigilant of you.]

…No, he had.


He definitely had companions.

'Kkoma Yoo Joonghyuks' emerging out of his body were standing right
there.

[Youcan'tYoucan'tYoucan'tYoucan'tYoucan't]

Kkoma Yoo Joonghyuks were now surrounding him protectively. And then,
the 'Outer Gods' were surroundings those kkoma Yoo Joonghyuks.

[TheresonlyoneTheresonlyoneTheresonlyone]

The history that the 'Secretive Plotter' had lived through – every part of the
'Ways of Survival' he lived through was now protecting him.

[DontkillhimDontkillhimDontkillhimDontkillhim]

They were stories that got discarded because they failed to reach the
'Conclusion'.

I moved Yoo Joonghyuk's body again and lowered my posture towards
them.
When I reached out, one of the small Outer Gods bit the extended finger.
Crimson blood formed on the tip of the bitten finger.

It was a lie that this world-line was a brand new story.

Even now, Yoo Joonghyuk's story – the 'Ways of Survival' – hadn't ended
yet.

'Kim Dokja'.
He must've regained his consciousness, because Yoo Joonghyuk began
talking to me.

I didn't reply immediately, and made my way past the Outer Gods to
approach the 'Secretive Plotter'.

Now in the form of a boy, he was looking up at me while being surrounded
by the Outer Gods.

Yoo Joonghyuk saw me holding the [Black Heavenly Demon Sword]
tightly and spoke. 'You'll regret this'.

⸢No, I won't.⸥

I raised the sword only to slowly sheathe it back in its scabbard.

⸢Besides, you weren't going to kill him, anyway.⸥

Yoo Joonghyuk's retort came back a little later than usual. '…Even if we
kill him, he'll simply regress again, anyway'.

Even if he was saying that, it was pretty clear what he was thinking of right
now. We had enough of this tragedy already.

[Many Constellations are watching you.]

[Many Constellations can't understand your decision.]

I didn't make this decision for the sake of earning a Story. And I knew that
this wouldn't even offer a tiny speck of solace to a life that lasted for 1864
lives.

But, even then…

"Secretive Plotter."
I called out and he looked up at me.

Even if this world had changed from the original story, even if this world
was no longer a simple novel… If it wasn't for this guy's story, this world
wouldn't have existed.

⸢Without him, the current Kim Dokja wouldn't be here.⸥

I definitely owed him a debt. A debt that nothing could possibly repay.

"You said that a sentence once written, can never be changed, right? I
disagree with that."

Indeed, sentences could be changed. Just like how the revised versions of
the 'Ways of Survival' existed.

【My Story has already come to an end.】

"…And then?"

【…There is no 'then'. That is what it means to end.】

"Some stories can only begin anew after coming to its end. Back in the
world I lived in, there was this guy who repeatedly said that his story
would end that year, but he kept it going for over ten years." And that very
story was what helped me to survive.

"I think I heard that the story was supposed end at around the 500th
chapter, but before I knew it, it went past 1000th, and then, it shot past 2000
chapters."

【…What is it that you want to say?】

"That story was written up to the 3149th chapter… but the 3150th hasn't
been written."
Even if a full stop had been laid down, as long as the next sentence was
written, then the story would continue on.

The 'Secretive Plotter' should be well aware of this, too. Because he was a
guy who had been telling his story far longer than anyone else out there.

I spoke with a grin on my face. "It feels like that story is still continuing on
even right now. And maybe, it is really continuing on. I feel relieved,
actually."

【You…】

"Because I'm a Constellation." As the Plotter's expression hardened, I added
something else with a cold voice. "Constellations are creatures like that."
This was the answer I had chosen. This was the only way to not belittle
him, even if it ends up hurting him.

The Secretive Plotter's eyes were glaring straight at me. 【…That story you
bastard have seen…】 His seething voice was directed at me. 【…Will
result in your death. It will show you the worst end result imaginable. And
as for your Nebula…!】

"Doesn't matter."

I knew that what I was saying here could be seen as irresponsible. My petty
attempt at atonement could bring upon untold misery and misfortune for
everyone else. I knew that.

Even then, this was the best I could do right now.

"Every time that happens, I'll do my best to fight back."

The Plotter's expression was changing – to one that I couldn't make. An
expression seemingly reserved for when analysing the ends of the distant
universe. With that sort of expression, he scanned the battlefield.
The rain falling on the battlefield had stopped, and the storm clouds that the
Great Sage Heaven's Equal had summoned were receding away.

The 'Great War Against the Heavenly Worlds' was drawing to a close.

<Emperor>'s fallen Constellations were looking up at the Great Sage and
the Yogoes. The sense of defeat thickly drawn on their faces told me who
today's winner was.

[Currently, the Story chamber ⸢I've become the retired SSSSS-grade Sun
Wukong⸥ is in possession of the 'sacred texts'.]
[Scenario will automatically conclude if the sacred texts are guarded for
one hour.]

[Ten seconds currently remaining until the conclusion of the scenario.]
Finally, the lengthy scenario was coming to a close.

I looked up at the blindingly bright skies of the <Star Stream>. The 'Great
Dokkaebis' who'd control the Final Scenario were there, glaring at me.

[Scenario has concluded.!]

[Story chamber ⸢I've become the retired SSSSS-grade Sun Wukong⸥ has
won the scenario!]

Bright messages announcing an incredible amount of reward payout and
words of congratulations sent by the Constellations rained down and
blanketed the sky above.

I spotted Shin Yoosung, with Biyoo riding on top of her head, hurriedly
running towards me while waving around the 'sacred texts'.

The title of the texts was the following:
⸢I've Become the Retired SSSSS-Grade Sun Wukong⸥

"Ahjussi!"

[Shares for 'Outer God' in the applicable scenario is enormous!]

[<Star Stream> is acknowledging the existence of 'Outer God'.]

['Outer Gods' can now officially participate in the scenarios!]

(As the blinding rays of light accompanied them, the Yogoes all rose up to
the air.)

(Yogoes gathering around Sun Wukong as their center all howled
towards the heavens like a single colony.) I heard their cries.

(It sounded like a song from an unfamiliar foreign country.)

Next up, I spotted Jung Heewon carrying my Incarnation Body while
waving her hand. I might have heard it wrong, but I thought I heard her say
"I finally got you" or something like that.

Next up, I saw Yoo Sangah, now the 'Sakyamuni's Successor', and Jang
Hayoung carrying the enervated Lee Gilyoung.

I looked to my side to discover the 'Secretive Plotter' witnessing the same
spectacle as me.

(The 'Journey to the West' will end here.)

One scenario came to an end, yet the story continued on. However, even
that story would have an end.

[You have acquired a new 'Great story'!]
[You have partially completed the fourth condition of the 'Hidden Scenario
– A Single Story'!]

And so, ever so quietly…

[Your Giant Story has completed the first half of the 'Conclusion'!]

The message foretelling the end of this world could be heard.

[Your Nebula has acquired the qualification to enter the 'Final Scenario'.]
