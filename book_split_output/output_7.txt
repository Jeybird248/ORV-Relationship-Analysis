300: Ep. 57 - Glorious Return, I


[The exclusive skill, 'Fourth Wall' is strongly activated!]

The Fourth Wall moved the moment Secretive Plotter stared at me. The
Fourth Wall growled like a beast protecting its cubs.

「 Be care ful Kim Dok ja. 」

The first time I came here, Secretive Plotter called the Fourth Wall the 'Last
Wall'. There was no information about it in the original but that didn't mean
I had no idea at all. It was because there were various types of walls in
Ways of Survival, including Jang Hayoung's Unidentified Wall.

"I came to receive the compensation, Secretive Plotter." I opened my mouth
but Secretive Plotter didn't reply. Sparks were flying around Secretive
Plotter. The darkness covering his expression looked angry as he asked me,
[Demon King of Salvation, why did you make that choice?]

"Huh?"
I didn't know what he meant by his sudden question. Secretive Plotter asked
again, [ Why didn't you want to go back to the third round? That world
wasn't your round. ]

"This world saved my life. That's it."

[ If you left it, they could find rest. ]

"That isn't rest. Secretive Plotter, why did you send me to that parallel
world?"

The sparks around Secretive Plotter intensified. It seemed like his existence
was becoming unstable. Secretive Plotter sighed and said, [ Everything was
already decided… you don't know what you changed. ]

The white hole in the place where there should be eyes was watching me.

[ I will give you the reward I promised. ]

I nodded. There were three rewards promised for this sub scenario. An
item, skill and story that was acquired in the 1863rd round.

[ What item will you take? ]

"This coat." I was a bit tense as I pulled out the white coat that Han
Sooyoung gave me. Secretive Plotter's eyes leaked out light and narrowed.
It seemed I couldn't deceive the outer god.

Secretive Plotter had promised me one item. However, the coat's inner
pockets contained more than one item.

[ …That's fine. Since one less flower is returning, the total sum of
probability must be similar to the flower. ]

[The 'Infinite Dimension Space Coat' has been received as a reward item.]
Fortunately, Secretive Plotter overlooked Han Sooyoung's coat. Next was
the 'story.

[ You will naturally be taking 'that' story? ]

"That's right."

In the first place, the only story I got in the 1863rd round was the one that
Yoo Joonghyuk gave to me. Obtaining this story meant I needed to modify
some of my planned routes but… it didn't matter. The important thing was
to see the end of the story that I chose.

[You have acquired a new story.]

[This story will be applied normally after returning to the original world
line.]

Last was the 'skill'.

[ What will you do about the skill? You didn't acquire any new skills. ]

"I wasn't able to receive a skill but… is it possible to receive this type of
compensation?"

I started explaining to Secretive Plotter. After a while, Secretive Plotter
nodded. [ It is possible. ]

[You have acquired the reward skill.]

[This skill will be applied normally after returning to the original world
line.]

I obtained everything I needed to get. The unexpected happened when I was
going to ask the Secretive Plotter to return me to my original world. There
were strong sparks as someone tried to penetrate this space from the rear.
I noticed the 'status' that could be felt beyond this space. It seemed that the
bureau had noticed Secretive Plotter in this place. In other words, the
person trying to break into this space was likely to be a great dokkaebi of
the bureau.

[ You'll be going now, Demon King of Salvation. ]

Secretive Plotter moved his fingertips lightly and a portal appeared under
my feet.

I hurriedly called out to Secretive Plotter. "Wait a minute! How many
years will have passed when I return to the world?" Secretive Plotter
glanced at me.

[ Some stories are read quickly and some are read slowly. ]

I tried to open my mouth but my lower body had already passed through the
portal.

[ Demon King of Salvation. Do you think the story of your disappearance
will be read quickly or slowly? ]

I could hear a mischievous laugh coming from somewhere. The portal was
fully activated and my field of view was completely blocked.

[ Once we meet again, I hope that you are the proper master of the wall. ]




Was it because it wasn't my first time crossing the world line? I was able to
maintain my consciousness despite being swept through the portal.

[The Fourth Wall is strongly activated!]
[The Viceroy's Dimensional Door has set the time-space coordinates.]

The scene of the flowing Star Stream. I thought of the things I needed in the
memories that floated up like buoys.

[The Viceroy's Dimensional Door is closed.]

I woke up at the message and was lying on the ground. It was a spacious
place dimly illuminated by lanterns hanging from the ceiling. There seemed
to be voices in the distance.

…Where was I? It didn't seem to be Earth. Why? Why did I suddenly come
here?

[The Star Stream has detected your presence in the world!]

[The Star Stream has reconfirmed your modifier.]

[The Star Stream will assign you to the scope of your constellation.]

[The bureau is calculating your status.]

I thought I knew what was going on. I left the scenario of the original world
through the Outer World Covenant. A price was necessary to return to the
original scenario. I felt the muscles of my body jerking as the messages
continued to rise.

[The bureau has completed your examination.]

[Returning you to the original scenario isn't

suitable.] [The bureau will review scenarios for your

level. [The review has been completed.]

I sighed as I watched the messages that came up.
…I expected this to happen. No, actually, I intended it. I left my original
world and went to another world. The categories were different but all
beings who came back to the original scenario like me were called by the
same name.

[You have acquired a new story!]

[You have acquired a new attribute!]

[You have obtained the qualification of a 'returnee'.]

[A new scenario is being prepared for you.]

I had become a returnee. I slowly raised my body and saw several men and
women talking around me. They were all returnees like me.

"Hahaha, I can finally return to Earth! It has been 10 years!"

"I have been waiting 20 years."

"Where have you been? Based on the colours, was it Murim?"

"I'm from Gratus. Have you heard of it?"

Then someone waved at me. "Oh, you must be the last one."

It was a man dressed in black shaman clothing. He was wearing a mask but
his eyes and the impression he gave off were somewhat familiar.

I briefly greeted him and the man spoke again. "Brother, where are you
from?"

"Earth."

"No, that isn't the question. There is no one here who isn't from Earth… I'm
asking about the planet you moved from."
The man smiled wryly. At this moment, I thought I knew the identity of the
man.

「 A towering person who looks like he has a bag of tricks. Eyes that are
suitable for night vision and only half the eyebrows are left, as if eaten by
crows. 」

I couldn't help smiling. It was already time for this person to appear…

"The place I went to was also Earth. The Earth of a parallel dimension."

"Hrmm, is that so? You are a very unusual person."

The man extended his hand towards me.


"I will introduce myself first. My name is Wang Weirong. In the 2nd
Murim that I went to, I was called Flying Fox."

Flying Fox, Wang Weirong. He was one of Yoo Joonghyuk's later
colleagues.

"My name is Kim Dokja." Also known as… um… the Demon King of
Salvation."

A few returnees listening to the story from the side laughed.

"Demon King of Salvation? Ahahaha!"

"It is a great title. It looks like you went to some third-rate fantasy world!"

A hand hit me on the back. More of them were returnees from Murim or a
medieval world. Flying Fox said with a grin. "Nice nickname."

"It's nothing."

"By the way, you have already been given the returnee's clothing."
"Ah, yes."

I looked down at the Infinite Dimension Space Coat I was wearing. I forgot
it was originally a garment only for returnees, just like the Disaster of
Questions who I once faced. Maybe that guy was summoned to Earth after
going through the same procedure.

Just then, dokkaebis appeared in the air and started giving coats to the
returnees. Several returnees looked between the coats they received and
mind and protested.

"Hey dokkaebi! The one he is wearing looks much better…!"

It was natural. It didn't make sense if a coat received from the 95th scenario
was worse than the supply coat.

Some of the dokkaebis were shocked when they saw me and reported to
their superiors. By now, Bihyung should know I was back.

I wanted to see the people of Earth as soon as possible. How many years
had passed? Everybody had to be doing well.

Flying Fox received the coat and said with a smile, "Uh, nice clothes. What
will you do when you get back?"

"I'm going to look for somebody."

"Ho, do you have a lover waiting?" I smiled at him. Flying Fox kept
speaking. "I think I will live in a grand style once I go back. I have obtained
a long-awaited strength. I don't need to be intimidated by bullies anymore!
Now is the beginning of happiness!"

"…The days won't be that happy. Earth would've changed a lot."

"Uhuh, you are already talking weakly. I have been through all that
suffering. What can happen when I get back to Earth?"
[All returnees, please pay attention.]

The turmoil subsided and the intermediate dokkaebi in charge of the
returnees opened his mouth as the representative.

[You will soon return to Earth. You will be assigned a 'returnee only
scenario' and will perform that scenario in your hometown. It is a simple
play and I would appreciate it if you enjoyed it.]

"A returnee scenario? Tell us properly!"

[Please check the scenario window for details. Ah, please note that this is a
group scenario so there is a leader. Please remember that the one with the
most prominent status will be automatically elected as leader.]

"I will naturally be the leader!"

"That friend from Murim looks pretty strong…"

I wondered who would be the 'king' of this group.

[The return to Earth has begun!]

Together with the dazzling light, the 10 returnees started to move through
the space at once. My vision briefly blackened and when I opened my eyes
again, we were in the middle of a vast city.

A damaged sidewalk covered with dust. The skyline where the
reconstruction of buildings had begun. It was unmistakably Earth.

"Where is this? Those characters…"

"South Korea! It is South Korea!"

A returnee from the Korean Peninsula jumped forward. I checked the
information related to the 'returnees scenario' and shouted, "Wait a minute.
Everyone calm down and gather together."
The returnees were already out of control. Some hasty returnees grabbed
the people passing by and asked,

"Where is this? What year is it now?"

I sighed,

[The 'returnee trigger' has been activated!]

"T-They asked for the date! They are returnees!"

"Aaaack! Returnees! Run away!"

"Report to the alliance!"

The whole street was rattled by the word 'returnee'. The people fled like the
tide and the returnees made puzzled expressions.

"What? What did I do wrong?"

[A new main scenario has arrived.]

[Main Scenario #45 ― 'Glorious Return' has started!]

The reflections on the glass building could be seen. Sparks flew as my
appearance changed. It was the terrible appearance of a dirty monster with
tentacles.

The real me wasn't like this but outwardly, I looked like a smaller outer
god. I probably looked like this to everyone on Earth. To the people of
Earth, all returnees were disasters.

The incarnations of Earth stepped closer with cold eyes. I turned around to
see the confused Flying Fox open his trembling lips. "B-Brother. What is
this…?"

"I told you nothing joyful would be waiting for us."
[The summoning of the 163rd returnees group has been completed!]

[You're the king of the 163rd returnees group.]
              Chapter 301: Ep. 57 - Glorious Return, II


It was a tranquil dream. Smoke spread in the field of view. It was definitely
South Korea but there were unfamiliar structures and story weapons I had
never seen, while the sky was dark like the world was about to collapse…

Han Sooyoung in the dream muttered, 'What is this?'

However, her voice didn't come out at all. There were two people fighting
in front of her. A man in a black coat and a white coat. She had seen this
before but something was different. The two men had the same face.

…Yoo Joonghyuk? There was a sound and the two Yoo Joonghyuk in front
of her were gone.

What was this situation? What the hell was this sight? In a place not far
away, she saw Kim Dokja. Kim Dokja knelt down like a man who lost
everything. The moment Han Sooyoung reached out her hand, somebody
called from right beside her.
–We won't get any further.

She looked over and there was a 'Han Sooyoung' with the same face as
herself. A chill went down her spine. The cold feeling caused Han
Sooyoung to wake up from her dream.

"…!"

Han Sooyoung woke up with a light man and realized she was lying on the
couch.

"Another dream, dammit."

It was a dream that had been repeating since a few days ago. Yoo
Joonghyuk and Yoo Joonghyuk fought each other while another one of her
and Kim Dokja watched. At first, she thought it was a visionary dream.
However, no matter how much she tried to interpret it, she couldn't get a
sense of the dream.

News was coming from the distant television.

–The launch of the new Incarnation Alliance is causing a change to the
situation on the Korean Peninsula…

Han Sooyoung listened blankly while rolling around the cold ice in her
mouth.

…Huh? Ice?

"What is this? Ahjumma, did you put it in my mouth?"

"Why would I do that?"

Lee Sookyung received the water without even looking back. Han
Sooyoung frowned as she broke the ice. Then it had to be Yoo Sangah.

"How long did I sleep?"
"Two hours."

"Yoo Sangah?"

"She is drinking coffee in the break room."
"What break room? Is this place a company?"

She said this but in fact, the building they were residing in was an
abandoned company building. Han Sooyoung grumbled and headed to the
break room.

"Hey, what are you doing?"

There was a small paper cup on the table in the break room. Yoo Sangah
was moving her white fingers through the air. The information that
emerged from the hologram was leaking into Yoo Sangah's retinas. The
startled Han Sooyoung shouted, "…Are you crazy? Are you using that
stigma again?"

"…"

"You can score goals at a really young age. I don't know what will happen
if you spam such a powerful stigma…"

The stigma used by Yoo Sangah was the Hermes System of Olympus. It
was Olympus's big data network that gained information from all over the
Star Stream to measure the future.

"It can't be helped. The worst situation has to be avoided."

"Don't I know information about the future?"

"It isn't enough. There are too many variables."

The stigma Hermes Stigma dramatically shortens the user's life span. Han
Sooyoung was aware of this fact but she was unable to dissuade Yoo
Sangah because Yoo Sangah played a large credit in the group members
reaching the 45th scenario. If it wasn't for Yoo Sangah measuring future
scenarios, the party members would've experienced a major crisis in the
35th scenario and 40th scenario.
Han Sooyoung bit her lips. This girl…

It had been three years since Kim Dokja disappeared. It had already been a
long time since the hope of him coming back had started to dim. Steam rose
from the cup of coffee. Yoo Sangah stared at it and opened her mouth.
"Sitting here reminds me of my days working at the company. At the time, I
always hid in the break room."

"I never worked in a company so I don't know."

"You definitely aren't a company person."

Yoo Sangah smiled and Han Sooyoung licked her lips. "You were in the
same company as Kim Dokja?"

"Yes."

"Were the two of you close?"

Yoo Sangah stared at Han Sooyoung, who had tried to sound casual.
Yoo Sangah smiled and replied, "Even then, we were companions." –-
Disaster alert!

–-Disaster alert!

There were loud notifications and Han Sooyoung rushed to the office. Lee
Sookyung, who had been on standby, checked the warning area through the
television.

"…Another? Where is it this time?"

"Busan."

"Busan? That isn't too far. The kids will handle it." Han Sooyoung replied
curtly while looking at the news flash on the screen. Tentacled monsters
appeared on the screen and engaged with incarnations.
Lee Sookyung sighed and asked, "Sooyoung, are you keeping in touch with
the other kids?"

"Why keep in contact with the kids who don't like me? Rather, what is
emerging on the bowl ahjumma?"

Lee Sookyung looked down at her star relic. Han Sooyoung asked, "What
have you seen this time?"

Lee Sookyung didn't answer. Han Sooyoung raised her head as she smelt
something strange and Lee Sookyung stood like a stiff statue.

Thus, Han Sooyoung realized something.

Kim Dokja had disappeared for three years. In the first place, there was
only one thing that Lee Sookyung had been checking.

Han Sooyoung stared at the bowl for a long time before declaring, "I'm
going to take a quick trip to Busan. By the way, there is Yoo Joonghyuk
now?"




I looked at the scenario window that popped up in the air.
  [Main Scenario #45 ― 'Glorious Return']

  Category: Main

  Difficulty: ???

  Clear Conditions: After a long journey, you have finally returned home.
  Let people in your hometown

  know about your presence and leave a mark that you are back in one of
  the main base areas. The people of your hometown will welcome you.

  Time Limit: None

  Compensation: 200,000 coins, the removal of the disaster
  transformation.

  Failure: Death

  * While the scenario is in progress, the incarnations will
  recognizereturnees as creatures.

  * While the scenario is in progress, the incarnations can't understand the
  language of the returnees.


The clear conditions were screwed up but cursing didn't make people feel
better.
[Your goal is 'Yeouido, Seoul.]

[There is currently no markable base area nearby.]
I took a deep breath. Yes, maybe this was better. If I had to carry out the
45th scenario anyway, it might be a good thing that I was a returnee. This
scenario was practice for some places that would be opened in the future.

"Shit! Why are they attacking?"

The returnees attacked by incarnations were angry. Not all the surviving
incarnations were strong. There were still some incarnations without
sponsors and others who later joined the scenario. Therefore, the attacks of
the incarnations weren't threatening to the returnees.

"I can't stand it. Hey friends, just wipe out the whole area―"

"It isn't possible."

The returnees' expressions hardened at my words. "Why? They attacked
first!"

"What is the good reason?"

"What is the reason? Shit, look at their faces. They want to catch and kill us
right away."

It certainly seemed that way. I was confused on how to explain this
situation.

[The dokkaebis disapprove of your presence.]

Originally, the 45th scenario was a full-scale deployment of returnees and
existing incarnations. Since my group number was 163, there must be 162
groups summoned all over the world.

The first returnees war. In the original novel, the third round Korean
Peninsula was devastated by this war. In other words, it would flow like the
original if this kept happening.

"What? The disasters are talking together?"
"Kill them quickly! The Black Flames Demon Ruler said so. It is easy to
kill them when they are off guard!"

"No, didn't you hear about the Moonlight Empress? There are disasters that
can communicate so be careful…"

I heard some familiar nicknames. In any case, the strong incarnations of the
Korean Peninsula were still alive, allowing these incarnations to be
carefree.

Then a returnee waiting for my words seized my collar. "I will kill you
if you disturb me. Get lost." "What if I don't want to?"

The returnee aimed his status at me and I grabbed the returnee's wrist.

[The constellation 'Demon King of Salvation' is opening his 'status'.]

There was the sound of bones breaking and the face of the returnee I
grabbed started to turn blue.

"W-Who are you…?"

The frightened returnee's legs weakened.

[The temporary channel has opened.]

[Constellations of the Korean Peninsula are paying attention to you!]

[The constellation 'Bald General of Justice' has entered the channel.]

[The constellation 'Maritime War God' feels a sense of deja vu from you.]

They were welcome modifiers but now wasn't the time for greetings. I told
the returnees, [Shut up and put away all weapons. Then gather by my side. I
will blow away your brains if you are late, so move quickly.]
I deliberately spoke in a radical manner. Those who realized the difference
in my true voice gathered around me. By the way, it wasn't only the
returnees who were confused.

"Crazy! What is that monster?"

"Report it quickly! Report to the alliance!"

The incarnations that felt my status were running away. I thought this had
worked out better. Flying Fox asked, "B-Brother. Are you the leader of our
group?"

I nodded and the returnees exclaimed, "Oh my god, we have a constellation
among us…"

There were 10 returnees gathered around me. There were five from a
medieval planet and three from Murim. The remaining two were from other
areas. I gazed at their faces one by one and started talking.

"I don't know where you came from or your purpose for coming back." The
nervous returnees were looking at me. "There is one certain thing. If this
scenario fails, we will all die."

Some of the returnees belatedly opened the scenario window.

"You can't meet your loved ones or acquaintances, nor can you step on your
hometown. We will be remembered as 'disasters' to the people of Earth."

The returnees who argued with me and the returnees who were deeply
shocked. They seemed to be coming to their senses one by one. Some
returnees saw themselves in the glass of the broken buildings.

"The reason they attacked us…"

"It isn't just our appearance. There were returnees who were summoned
before us."
Some returnees came back because they missed their homes while others
came back to destroy their homes. They threatened Earth's well-being and
perhaps it was currently happening in other places. I declared with
confidence, "You shouldn't fight. It will only cause ruin."

"Why don't we tell them that we don't intend to fight?"

"It is doubtful if they will believe it and it is also hard to communicate our
words. Our words won't be properly conveyed to them until the end of the
scenario."

The returnees' expressions darkened. "Do you have any plans?"

"Avoid combat as much as possible. Make it a top priority to leave a mark
on a base. Once we clear this scenario, we can escape from being disasters."

Fortunately, I was able to communicate with this group. There was Flying
Fox so if I was lucky, I would be able to complete the scenario without
much conflict. However, things didn't work out so easily, just as in all
scenarios.

"Alliance! The Busan Alliance!"

Along with the shouts, people approached through the crowd of
incarnations that split apart. At this moment, I heard the distant sound of
boats in my ears. There was a faint saltiness in the breeze from Haeundae.

[The 'Fourth Wall' is shimmering faintly.]

12 boats appeared on the sandy beach of Haeundae. Two people leapt from
the front boat.

"The admiral has come!"

"The Insect King!"
I once again realized that a lot of time has passed. Some things had changed
and some hadn't changed. The girl with the cap on her head was still
wearing her distinctive hoodie but she no longer wore a uniform skirt.

The boy with the insect net still had his distinctive, fierce eyes but his
features were more pronounced and he was taller. At the very least, he
couldn't stick to my thighs anymore.

"Kid, do you want to do it or should I?

"We will decide by tossing a coin."

I missed them. I really missed them. I wanted to say this. The pure white
sand sparkled and I knew I had to run away, but I couldn't move my feet.

[The constellation 'Demon King of Salvation' is looking at his companions.]

Maybe I had hope. The others were different but they would definitely
recognize me. Perhaps I wanted to believe that.

[The scenario penalty has distorted the indirect message.]

The next moment, an indirect message emerged in the air.

[The 'Ugly Squid' is provoking the incarnation 'Lee Jihye'.]

Lee Jihye stared at me. "Kid, I will kill that squid."
             Chapter 302: Ep. 57 - Glorious Return, III


Lee Jihye was holding the Duke of Loyalty and Warfare's sword in her
hand. It wasn't the Double Dragon Swords that Lee Jihye of the 1863rd
round had but the performance was excellent. Maybe she took it from a
museum somewhere…

"Where is the squid?" She asked the baffled returnees.

"Jihye. Stop! It's me!" I shouted desperately but my mouth didn't open. On
Lee Jihye's side, it looked like I was screaming and waving my tentacles.

"Ugh, disgusting squid. Die!" Lee Jihye's blade flashed as she ran towards
me.

…This was vaguely similar to the 1863rd round. Lee Jihye's blade narrowly
grazed the top of my head. My hair was severed and Lee Gilyoung called
out.

"Do a good job noona! Cut the big tentacles instead of the small ones!"
"Shut up!"

Somehow my hair looked like tentacles to the other side. They didn't know
it was me but I couldn't help feeling sad.

I warned the returnees who were retreating nervously. "Everyone, don't
attack! I'll take care of it!"

Fortunately, it was comforting that the returnees listened to me. Flying
Fox's confused voice was heard. "I'll help you anytime."

Flying Fox was a returnee who was pretty outstanding in the 2nd Murim. If
an unavoidable situation happened then I could borrow his help. How could
I let Lee Jihye know of my existence?

"Cut the squid!"

In this scenario, my 'spoken language' wasn't conveyed to Lee Jihye.
However, originally human communication wasn't just through spoken
language.

"What? Don't move strangely!"

I activated Way of the Wind and started writing on the ground. Lines were
drawn on the ground as I avoided Lee Jihye's sword. The returnees behind
me noticed my intentions and let out exclamations.

In fact, I didn't know if this would work or not. The original novel didn't
cover these types of communication possibilities in detail. The question
was, would Lee Jihye notice my intentions?

"What? Is it writing on the ground?"

Fortunately, Lee Gilyoung was quick to notice and understood my
intentions first. Lee Jihye paused and looked down at the ground. There
was a note left by my dazzling footsteps. The handwriting was bad but it
wasn't illegible.

–I am Kim Dokja.

This was the sentence that I wrote. By the way.

[The scenario penalty has distorted your writing.]

…The penalty was applied to this? The Fourth Wall read the distorted
sentence on behalf of Lee Jihye.

「 I am a good look ing squid. 」

[The character 'Lee Jihye' has used Demon Slaying Lv. 10!]

Lee Jihye's eyes turned red as she started to accelerate towards me. She was
much faster than before and this made it hard for me to dodge. I tried to
wave my coat in a sign of surrender but all my efforts were in vain due to
the scenario penalty.

[The 'Ugly Squid' is provoking the incarnation 'Lee Jihye'.]

"Die!"

I had a slight headache. If these hallucinations continued, my message
would never be delivered over there.

…It would be best just to suppress them. However, I didn't want to do that.
Maybe something had changed in me after the 1863rd round.

「 At that time, something popped up in the head of the good-looking
squid.
」
Ah, wait. If this was the case…? I thought for a moment before deciding to
do it. No matter how the scenario distorted my language, it couldn't distort
it this much.

[The constellation 'Demon King of Salvation' has sponsored 91 coins to the
incarnation 'Lee Jihye'.]

Something that couldn't be distorted.

[The scenario penalty has distorted the indirect message.]

[The 'Ugly Squid' has sponsored 91 coins to the incarnation 'Lee Jihye'.]

It was precisely the coin number. Lee Jihye frowned at the sudden
donation from the squid. "…What?" Come on Jihye, please.

[The 'Ugly Squid' has sponsored 91 coins to the incarnation 'Lee Jihye'.]

"Do you think I won't attack you if you give me this?"

[The 'Ugly Squid' has sponsored 91 coins to the incarnation 'Lee Jihye'.]

"Don't be so annoying! I dislike coins that aren't in units of 100!"

…Really? Then what about this?

[The 'Ugly Squid' has sponsored 9,158 coins to the incarnation 'Lee Jihye'.]

For the first time, Lee Jihye's attacks stopped. She didn't understand
anything. It was just because the amount of sponsored coins had increased.

Lee Gilyoung asked, "Why did you suddenly stop noona?"

"No, it keeps giving me coins."

"Coins?"
The surprised Lee Gilyoung glanced at me. "Is it a constellation?"

"What constellation will have a modifier like the Ugly Squid?"

There was one. No, not me. It wasn't a squid but there was someone with a
similar modifier. Now my modifier had changed… damn, why was I
explaining this?

Lee Jihye hesitated as she stared at me with uncertain eyes. "Why does it
keep giving 91 coins?"

"91 coins?"

"Yes. Then he gave me 9,185 coins at the end."

"9,185 coins is quite a lot. Is it a hidden scenario? Or maybe something
meaningful…"

I thought this was my only opportunity.

[The 'Ugly Squid' has sponsored 7,942 coins to the incarnation 'Lee Jihye'.]

Lee Gilyoung looked shocked at my coins baptism.

"7,942? Perhaps…"

The children's eyes were shaking. I watched the clear eyes and was deeply
moved. Yes, that's it children. It's me. Kim Dokja.

[The constellation 'Maritime War God' doubts your identity.]

[Some constellations on the Korean Peninsula are curious about your
identity.]

Then an unexpected constellation entered the channel.

[The constellation 'God of Wine and Ecstasy' has entered the channel.]
[The constellation 'God of Wine and Ecstasy' has noticed your identity!]

God of Wine and Ecstasy, Dionysus. Speaking of which, it was Dionysus
who told me about this '7942'. I thought things might work out better than I
expected. If it was this constellation, he might decipher the message I sent
to the children.

[The constellation 'God of Wine and Ecstasy' claimed the number '91' to be
a type of numerical play!]

My heart was pounding. Dionysus' guess was right. The number, which was
read as 'ninety-one', was my code to the children.

9 (Gu) 1 (One). Guwon (Salvation).

Fortunately, Dionysus seemed to understand what I was saying. Now
Dionysus just needed to tell them that I was the Demon King of
Salvation…

[The constellation 'God of Wine and Ecstasy' says the squid must be an
intelligent squid.]

I looked up at the sky. Lee Gilyoung cried out happily. "It is a hidden piece.
Will it give coins every time a tentacle is cut?"

[The constellation 'God of Wine and Ecstasy' is nodding.]

Once this scenario was over, I would smash Olympus.

Lee Jihye cried out, "I will catch it. Hey Gilyoung, you take

half!" The tentacle that Lee Jihye ran along was my arm. "It's

really nimble. Noona, cut that big tentacle there first!" That was

my leg.
"Ah, I'm annoyed. I'll just cut it from the middle."

That… couldn't happen. The moment I was about to liberate my 'status,'
there was a dragon's roar. The force caused the returnees to momentarily
flinch.

I looked up at the sky and saw the black dragon covering it. There was a
nostalgic face. Like Lee Jihye and Lee Gilyoung… this child had grown a
lot.

"You're always late, Shin Yoosung! Don't rush around on your own!"

Only the plump cheeks proved that this girl was the child I remembered.
Shin Yoosung on the chimera dragon landed on the ground. Shin Yoosung
glanced to this side and asked Lee Jihye, "You haven't finished it yet? I told
you not to take too long."

"I'm trying but it is a strange disaster."

"Strange?"

"That squid over there."

Shin Yoosung stared at me.

"It keeps giving me coins. I feel bad…"

Shin Yoosung kept watching me.

[The constellation 'Demon King of Salvation' is looking at his

incarnation.] I slowly went up to her.

"Shit! Don't approach suddenly!" Despite Lee Jihye's threat, I kept moving
forward. I couldn't help moving forward.

"The Beast Master has come!"
"Okay, we can kill them now!"

The emergence of Shin Yoosung caused the incarnations who fled to the
periphery of the shore to ran back across the white sands. There were the
sounds of weapons colliding all over the place. The courageous
incarnations were aiming blades towards me and the returnees.

In fact, a real hidden piece was concealed in the 45th scenario. If our group
could clear the scenario without having a single victim…

Flying Fox shouted as he was pushed back with the returnees. "Brother! We
can't hold out long! I don't know what you're trying to do but do it quickly!"

Human beings were people who didn't even trust fellow humans. Then how
could they be friends with a disaster?

"Die tentacled monsters!"

A race that tried to dominate what was similar to them while excluding
what was different from them. My appearance was reflected in their eyes. I
was just a tentacled monster to them.

「'Maybe there is another way'. 」

Yoo Joonghyuk in the original novel took this 'returnee route' several times.
However, Yoo Joonghyuk had never once accomplished this hidden piece.
To be precise, he couldn't accomplish it.

「 'Even if it is a bit hard, if I had been able to find another way…' 」

Everyone who took the 'returnee path' walked the road of regret. Thus, I
knew his failure. All the ways I could fail were the roads he had already
walked.

Now Yoo Joonghyuk left for a road that didn't exist in the original. It was a
world where the possibility of countless failures was open again.
[The 'Fourth Wall' is shimmering faintly.]

Thus, I couldn't lose either.

[The constellation 'Maritime War God' is looking at you closely.]

[The constellation 'Bald General of Justice' is looking at you closely.]

[The constellation 'God of Wine and Ecstasy' is looking at you carefully.]

"What are you doing all of a sudden?"

"Jihye noona, be careful!"

Lee Jihye's blade flew towards me as I moved forward. I didn't avoid it this
time.

Blood from my unprotected skin flowed onto my coat.

She didn't know I wouldn't avoid it and the startled Lee Jihye's eyes
widened. The other incarnations rushed through the gap towards me. In a
moment, my surroundings were filled with the weapons of the incarnations.

The number of tears on my coat started to increase. I took some attacks,
blocked some attacks and kept moving forward.

There was a girl at the end of the road. The child who was my first
incarnation. There was Shin Yoosung who was supposed to be a 'disaster'
like me. The child was watching me.

I went through the road and approached the child. One step, another step. I
walked at a steady pace to not frighten the child. I didn't care if my blood
was splattered or my flesh was torn. I didn't release any status to raise her
vigilance or take out a weapon to pose a threat.

The child's face was right in front of my nose. If the destruction hadn't
happened, she would be at an age to enter middle school. The child grew up
this way but I had been away from her for too long. A sharp sensation
pierced my chest and I dropped my head.

[The 'Ugly Squid' is looking at the incarnation 'Shin

Yoosung'.] I suddenly felt funny. Maybe I was better off as an

ugly squid.

The words of Secretive Plotter crossed my mind.

[ What if the ending they wanted was to die with you there? Do you still
want to save them? ]

[ It isn't salvation. It is a curse. ]

I was arrogant. My longing was just my longing. There was no guarantee
that my feelings would be shared by my party members. The Kim Dokja
they remembered was just a selfish constellation. Forcing a goal at will,
forcing them to live and forcing wounds on them. I was a colleague who
wasn't around when they needed me most.

「 Then why is this child crying? 」

Lee Jihye and Lee Gilyoung lowered their weapons and the incarnations
stopped attacking. As everyone stared at us, I knelt slowly towards my
incarnation. It might be because I wanted to show respect to my child who
grew up brilliantly alone or to seek forgiveness for all the times I wasn't
there.

"I'm back, Yoosung."

My words wouldn't be delivered.

[Your incarnation is looking at you.]
My incarnation slowly stretched out her hand and laid her little hand on my
head.
             Chapter 303: Ep. 57 - Glorious Return, IV


The texture of the hand was like a feather on my head. Something hard
deep inside my heart crumpled. Perhaps she recognized me.

She looked up and Shin Yoosung's clear eyes could be seen. "…Ahjussi?"




After a while, I was flying in the air on the chimera dragon. To be exact, it
wasn't just me but the other returnees who had a similar appearance. Four
on the legs, two on the wings, three on the tail and… me. A total of 10
returnees rode the dragon and flew to Seoul.

I spoke to encourage the returnees who had motion sickness. "Seoul is a
little bit further. Have strength, everybody."

"Ugh, I could've run faster…" Flying Fox grumbled.
"It's safer to go by air. There might be unknown risks."

"Well… I guess if Brother is saying this. By the way, is that Brother's
child?"

He seemed to be asking about Shin Yoosung and I nodded. "Yes, well… it
is similar."

She was my incarnation and it was true that she was special like my child.

"…Huh, you must've had a hard time at a young age. What about your
wife?"

I wasn't married in the first place. Somehow, he understood my silence and
Flying Fox looked at me with sympathetic eyes. I turned my head and other
returnees had a similar expression.

"Tsk tsk, too bad…"

"Well, let's do out best now. After this scenario, we can meet our families."

"Brother! Have strength!"

These sentiments were best directed for the returnees who had family or
lovers. In any case, things were going better than I expected. Rather…
"What are you so nervous about? Can't you listen quietly?"

At Lee Jihye's words, the returnees all shut their mouths. As if she still
couldn't believe it, Lee Jihye glanced at me and told Shin Yoosung, "It
will be your fault if things go wrong. Don't you know?" Shin Yoosung
nodded.

A few dozen minutes ago, Shin Yoosung had declared to Lee Jihye and Lee
Gilyoung. "I think the squid is Dokja ahjussi."
Lee Jihye, who cut my hair, had a wide open mouth while Lee Gilyoung,
who wanted to cut my leg, stiffened. Needless to say, the reactions of the
two people seemed the same.

"…This is Dokja ahjussi?"

"Hyung can't be a squid, you idiot!"

Shin Yoosung cried out, "Really! It is really Dokja ahjussi!"

We had been flying for dozens of minutes but the argument was still
continuing.

"You are sick again… Gilyoung, how many times is it now?"

"Five to six times."

A breeze blew against our faces. Shin Yoosung sat beside me and sighed
like she was upset.

"Ahjussi…"

[The demon king 'Demon King of Salvation' is proving his existence.]

[The indirect message is distorted by the scenario penalty.]

[The Ugly Squid is waving his own suckers.]

Shin Yoosung nodded and exclaimed triumphantly. "Look! It really is
ahjussi!"

Thank you. I was grateful but I didn't know why it was so complicated.

Lee Jihye sighed, "What will you do if he isn't Dokja ahjussi?"

"That…"
"Bringing all these disasters to Seoul, what if something goes wrong?"

"Even if it isn't Dokja ahjussi…"

Shin Yoosung bit her lip before saying. "Sangah unni told me. There might
be disasters who aren't enemies."

"…There has never been a case so far."

"This might be the first time."

Fortunately, Yoo Sangah had communicated my words to the party
members. In the 45th scenarios, returnees turned into disasters and some of
them weren't enemies.

"The level of Sangah unni's Interpreter skill is high. Maybe we can
communicate this time. We have to try, even if things go wrong."

Little by little, hope emerged. In any case, I just needed to get to Seoul.
There was a moment of silence between the party members. For a while,
there was only the sound of wind blowing. I spoke to Shin Yoosung.

'Yoosung'.

[Your language is distorted by the scenario penalty.]

[The Ugly Squid is attracting attention.]

Shin Yoosung stared at me. "Yes, ahjussi."

'You don't have to convince people that I'm Kim Dokja'.

[Your language is distorted by the scenario penalty.]

[The Ugly Squid is waving his ten legs.]

"Huh? Ahjussi…"
I didn't answer. I didn't have the confidence to answer correctly.

[The Ugly Squid has a gloomy expression.]

I silently stared at Lee Jihye.

「 It is a lie. It isn't possible. 」

Lee Jihye's thoughts entered my head. From the moment I met the party
members, I activated Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint.

「 Dokja ahjussi… 」

Some emotions weren't conveyed through language. There were fragmented
sentences and broken off words. Sometimes they couldn't be left that way
because I couldn't look properly.

My presence is an indelible wound on them. The sense of helplessness
caused by their companion dying in front of them. The despair of nothing
being able to do anything, only watch as someone sacrificed themselves.

A small keyring hanging from Lee Jihye's sword shook. I knew the identity
of this keyring. Lee Jihye had long been a scarred sword demon.

Lee Jihye smiled as if trying to hide her feelings. "Hey, take a good look.
This is the real Dokja ahjussi, right?"

"…"

Shin Yoosung didn't answer. Maybe she was feeling my emotions as well.
This was the relationship between a constellation and incarnation. We
understood more than was spoken.

Lee Jihye laughed mischievously. "Hey, why aren't you saying anything?
Are you not confident?"

"That isn't it…"
"I knew Shin Yoosung would do this again!"

Lee Gilyoung interrupted. "Noona, she did this before! She saw the frog
and said that Dokja ahjussi must've come back―"

"I'll kill you…"

"Don't you remember? We were almost killed because of you."

Lee Jihye nodded. "…Certainly, that happened."

"There is a collection at your house. Frog Kim Dokja, Tentacled Disaster
Kim Dokja, Elephant Monster who Almost Became Kim Dokja…"

"Die…"

"By the way, can you give me Frog Kim Dokja?"

"This is really…!"

The chimera dragon flapped its wings wildly and suddenly stopped in the
air.

Lee Jihye screamed, "Waaah! What's happening?"

A series of airships were blocking our way. It wasn't just one or two. A
coin flying boat that could only be purchased after the 40th scenario. The
decks of the ships had 'GG" written on the …I think I knew their identity.

–Busan Alliance, why did you come here?

A high-pressure voice was heard from an airship. Memories of the original
novel came to mind.

Lee Gilyoung grumbled, "Why can't we come?"
In the original novel, after the 25th scenario, the Korean Peninsula was
divided into several regional alliances such as the Busan Alliance, the
Daegu Alliance, the Seoul Alliance…

Most of the alliances were centered around incarnations with powerful
sponsors and if I remembered correctly, there was one such person in the
Gyeonggi region.

–Disasters can't enter the Gyeonggi area. Leave the disasters behind right
now.

The Gyeonggi Alliance. It was called the Gyeonggi Alliance but most of
the members weren't from Gyeonggi. They were predators who only moved
for the benefits of the group. They were one of Yoo Joonghyuk's headaches
in several rounds. It was because the head of the alliance was one of the 10
Evils.

–I will fire if you don't leave in five seconds. Five.

The troubled Lee Jihye rose from her seat. "Ah, I can't help fighting if you
come out like this."

In the original development, the present party members wouldn't be able to
deal with the Gyeonggi Alliance with an individual force. However, the
third round was a lot different from the original.

This Lee Jihye didn't survive because of luck. "I am the leader of the Busan
Alliance, Lee Jihye."

Blue flames soared from Lee Jihye's blade. I watched the spectacular wave
of magic power and was truly amazed.

Jihye, you really tried.

It was an ether blade. Lee Jihye was able to implement a technique that
only those in Murim could use.
–Admiral! This isn't the sea! At least in the sky, our Gyeonggi Alliance…!

"That remains to be seen."

Lee Jihye laughed and leapt forward with his blade pointed backwards.
Suddenly, there was an explosion from the other side of the airships. The
fleet was cut in half along with the soundwave. Lee Jihye stared at Lee
Gilyoung like she was dumbfounded.

"Is that Titano? Why are you intervening?"

"…My Titano is dead."

The chimera dragon hadn't moved yet so it wasn't done by Shin Yoosung.
Less than a minute later, all the alliance's airships were blown up. There
was a blazing inferno as someone jumped towards this side.

Lee Jihye raised her blade cautiously. Not long after, the wariness
lightened. It was because the person was known. The thoughtful Shin
Yoosung yelled at Lee Jihye, "Jihye unni! Did you tell

Heewon-ssi already?"

"That… I texted her a while ago. I just didn't know if she would come this
soon…" Lee Jihye smiled apologetically.

"It is great that we're gathering after a long time! That is either Dokja
ahjussi or a squid party. Heewon unni―!"

I gazed at the welcome face that was approaching and my heart ached.

–If you were going to do this anyway, why have you been preparing us for
the past few days? Why give me these skills?

–I told you how to deal with the Sasquatch in the 28th scenario.
I could see it the moment I saw Jung Heewon. She kept everything I said.
Then she became stronger than I expected.

–Shit! Don't talk nonsense! I can't let you go! Don't go alone again! Please!

Jung Heewon dressed in a special suit emerged from the thick smoke and
landed on the chimera dragon's back. The Sword of Judgment emitted a
light as it cried out wildly. Jung Heewon glanced at the squid before asking,
"Who is Kim Dokja?"

The frightened returnees held their breaths in unison. Shin Yoosung
realized that something wasn't right and quickly came forward.

"I-I don't know who ahjussi is just yet. I just got the feeling of ahjussi…"

Jung Heewon laughed. "I see. Then you're going to see Sangah-ssi?"

"Yes, I wanted to go see Sangah unni and ask for her opinion…"

"There is no need. I can tell if he is Kim Dokja or not."

"Huh?"

[The character 'Jung Heewon' is preparing to activate Judgment Time!]

"I'll see soon. If he is the real Dokja-ssi, the squid will survive." An almost
crazy magic power nestled in Jung Heewon's blade. "Or he will go to hell at
my hands."

It was a horrifying will-o'-the-wisp. Shin Yoosung realized that something
was wrong and shouted, "Ahjussi! Run!"

The moment the chimera dragon howled, I jumped down from its back with
the other returnees. There was a deafening collision as I used Way of the
Wind and pulled the returnees one by one.
In any case, the goal was around the corner. Once I arrived at Yeouido, I
could prove myself without fighting. The 10 returnees, including me, joined
hands and made a formation in the air. It was all prearranged in advance.

"Flying Fox!"

"Leave it to me!"

Flying Fox, the fastest man in Murim, started to make a rapid journey by
repeatedly stepping through the air. He used Walk on Snow with No Traces
while supported by the momentum created by Way of the Wind.

We rotated like a pinwheel and started to accelerate. We entered Seoul
through the sky and a system message was heard.

[The 'target base' is very close.]

I could see Yeouido in the distance. There was a huge monument I had to
leave a mark on.

At that moment, I felt time and space creaking. Strong alarm bells were
telling me that I shouldn't go to this place. It was an almost instinct-based
choice to change the course of the party.

Then by one hair's breadth a sword with a tremendous destructive force
swept through the sky. The black sword crushed the ceiling of the sky and
disappeared as cracks formed. It would've been a terrifying blow if I was
hit. As far as I knew, there was only one incarnation on the Korean
Peninsula with this technique.

I raised my head and met a cool gaze. As if the second hand stopped, time
flowed very slowly. A huge Black Heavenly Demon Sword was inserted
into the ground. The incarnation who was stronger than anyone I knew and
with the strongest determination was waiting for me.

"Yoo Joonghyuk."
Standing there was the supreme king of this world.
              Chapter 304: Ep. 57 - Glorious Return, V


Why was Yoo Joonghyuk here? I was confused as I guided the returnees to
safely land on the ground. In front of the monument, Yoo Joonghyuk
scattered a heavy status and the returnees nervously stepped back. Flying
Fox asked, "Brother, this person…?"

"Get back and I'll talk to him." I signalled to Flying Fox and slowly
approached Yoo Joonghyuk. After all, our aim was to leave a marker on the
base. The scenario was completed once we accomplished this.

The moment I got within a few dozen meters of Yoo Joonghyuk, the
momentum flowing from Yoo Joonghyuk's body changed. I gulped and
opened my mouth. "Yoo Joonghyuk."

Understandably, my voice wouldn't be delivered properly.

"Get lost. Please."
Yoo Joonghyuk didn't move. Yoo Joonghyuk would've become stronger,
just as I become stronger after going to the 1863rd round. Based on what I
felt, I couldn't guarantee the outcome. Then there was only one way.

[The exclusive skill, 'Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint' has been activated!]

This way, my body would pass out and I would transfer to Yoo
Joonghyuk…

[The exclusive skill, 'Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint' is cancelled.]

[Your complex understanding of this person is insufficient!]

[There isn't enough comprehension to understand the current state of this
person.]

…What? I stepped back with surprise. This was the first time. This was
definitely the third round. It wasn't the 1863rd round that I didn't know
well.

The Yoo Joonghyuk in front of me felt strange. What happened in the last
three years?

"Brother! Avoid it!"

If I hadn't been pushed by Flying Fox, I would've been cut by Yoo
Joonghyuk's blade. Flying Fox exclaimed. "Let's do it together! I think he's
dangerous!"

"…It isn't possible."

"Why? Do you know him?"

I stared at Flying Fox. "He is my colleague."

The words that came out of my mouth were funny. I felt I could understand
Yoo Joonghyuk's feelings in the past.
Yoo Joonghyuk and I didn't fit well. Our personalities were different and
the way we carried out the scenarios differed. The way we communicated
with others was also different. Nevertheless, we saved each other's lives on
a number of occasions and arrived here.

"…Thus, he can't be killed."

I put my hand into my coat. Just as Yoo Joonghyuk had his own beliefs, I
had my own beliefs.

[Blade of Faith is activated!]

It wasn't my Unbroken Faith. This blade was much glossier than my sword.
It was the one that belonged to the 1863rd round Han Sooyoung. The ether
that rose from the Blade of Faith was a deep black.

[The rating of this item doesn't match the fairness level of the scenario.]

[The item's stats are partially adjusted.]

The Unbroken Faith of the 95th scenario that was refined using Han
Sooyoung's method.

Yoo Joonghyuk's eyes were shaking slightly. I couldn't see what I looked
like now. Perhaps the ether blade being swung was like a giant tentacle.

"Stop it, Yoo Junghyuk. I have no intention of fighting."

How could I not fight against Yoo Joonghyuk? How could I tell him that I
was Kim Dokja? The moment I avoided Yoo Joonghyuk's blade, I had a
flash of a thought.

…Wait a minute, perhaps? I couldn't be sure. In addition, the effect would
be distorted because of the scenario penalty. Still, it was better than doing
nothing.

[You have triggered the item Midday Tryst.]
[The connection with the current target is good.]

[Due to the scenario penalty, the item username has been changed to 'Ugly
Squid'.]

I immediately sent a message to Yoo Joonghyuk.

–Yoo Joonghyuk! I am Kim Dokja! Don't cut me!

The Midday Tryst. It was an item used for communication when Yoo
Joonghyuk had died one day. Surprisingly, the item was still valid.

[The scenario penalty has distorted the message sent.] –

Come on, sunfish.

…Son of a bitch. The distortion went this far? I was slightly vigilant as I
watched Yoo Joonghyuk. The contents were strange but the fact that Yoo
Joonghyuk received the message was important.

The Midday Tryst was an item that could only be used between set people.
The name might've changed but the quick-witted Yoo Joonghyuk should
guess my identity just by receiving the message.

–Yoo Joonghyuk! I said stop! I am Kim Dokja! [The

scenario penalty has distorted the message sent.] –I

am the king of the sea.

Yoo Joonghyuk stared at me for a moment and slowly lowered his sword. I
took a deep breath. Did he finally notice?

A huge stream of air flowed from Yoo Joonghyuk's body. His whole body
was covered with a blue light before emitting a golden torrent. Yoo
Joonghyuk released his transcendent power.
I panicked and asked, "…Yoo Joonghyuk?"

My head was pounding. If I was Yoo Joonghyuk, I would've noticed my
existence just by receiving a message. Then why? The moment the two
swords collided, my body was bounced back. There was a shock that
seemed to break my wrist and a single question rose.

「 Why was Midday Tryst activated? 」

Midday Tryst was a temporary item. After a certain time elapsed, the period
of use had to be extended by paying additional coins. Yet Midday Tryst
was activated without any delay. In other words, someone had been
extending that period of time.

[The character 'Yoo Joonghyuk' is telling the giant story 'Demon Realm's
Spring'.]

Finally, Yoo Joonghyuk opened the giant story. At this moment, I
realized. Now Yoo Joonghyuk was sincere. "Dammit…!"

I didn't back down and faced him.

[Giant Story 'Demon Realm's Spring' is being told.]

I wouldn't lose if it was the same big story. In the first place, I was the best
speaker for this story. I aimed the status of a demon king towards Yoo
Joonghyuk who was running away.

[The constellation 'Demon King of Salvation' is opening the status of a
demon king!]

A huge fortress was seen in the center of Seoul. It was my industrial
complex that was once located in the 73rd Demon Realm. It was sent to
Seoul with the help of Secretive Plotter. I would never lose as long as the
industrial complex was here.
[The demonic energy in Seoul is raising your status!]

Black wings tore from my spine. The dark attributed poured into the ether
blade of Unbroken Faith. The transcendent sword and Blade of Faith
clashed and caused a roar. The first conflict was intense.

Yoo Joonghyuk and I were both pushed back a step and at the same time,
we wielded our swords to each other again. Unbelievable explosions
occurred as the sword and sword hit each other. We struck, struck and
struck each other again. We fought desperately as if it was the only
conversation we could share with each other.

I couldn't believe it. I knew that Yoo Joonghyuk was strong. I expected him
to become stronger in the meantime.

However, I didn't expect him to be this strong. I couldn't win against Yoo
Joonghyuk despite using Way of the Wind and Electrification. Yoo
Joonghyuk's expression didn't change as he stood there like a solid wall.

I couldn't help smiling. I thought this whole thing was a misunderstanding.
I thought Yoo Joonghyuk attacked me because he didn't recognize me.

Nevertheless, it wasn't like that. Throughout the fight, Yoo Joonghyuk
didn't say a word. He was a born swordsman and had written his story with
the sword for countless years. Thus, I could see it.

[Your understanding of the character 'Yoo Joonghyuk' has increased!]

Yoo Joonghyuk recognized me and knew I would come here. I didn't know
how it was possible but it was obvious. He was waiting for me here. The
battle was temporarily interrupted by a child who jumped in the way.

"Stop it! Joonghyuk ahjussi! Stop it!"

It was Shin Yoosung. The small child stood in front of me and started
weeping.
"This squid is Dokja ahjussi!"

In the end, I remained silent. I looked around and saw the party members
gathered. Jung Heewon's expression was stiff, Lee Jihye looked worried
and Lee Gilyoung was excited. I could feel eyes looking at me from the top
of the Demon Realm's fortress.

…It was a person I had long resented at one time.

The inhabitants of the Demon Realm were also seen. They were people I
met in the 73rd Demon Realm. Aileen was there, Mark as well. Perhaps she
ran from a distance as the panting Han Sooyoung looked down at me from
a nearby high-rise building.

The history of my life was gathered in one place. However, none of them
interfered in the fight.

Yoo Joonghyuk stopped before raising his blade again. It was like he didn't
hear Shin Yoosung's words.

Shin Yoosung shouted again, "Uh… t-that is actually a lie! That isn't Dokja
ahjussi! I-It is just a disaster I tamed! A monster I tamed! I'll control him
well so please forgive me!"

"Yoosung."

I stretched out a hand and placed it on Shin Yoosung's shoulder. Then Jung
Heewon pulled Shin Yoosung back with her. Jung Heewon's steadfast eyes
were shaking. At this moment, I realized something.

Yes, it was like this. I lowered my head and Jung Heewon avoided my
gaze.

[Your understanding of the character 'Jung Heewon' has rapidly increased!]
I looked back and saw Yoo Joonghyuk approaching. Yoo Joonghyuk was
gathering the energy of the Breaking the Sky Swordsmanship. The ultimate
technique was being prepared at the tip of Yoo Joonghyuk's blade.

I nodded. Yoo Joonghyuk probably had something he wanted to prove to
me.

"Bring it on, Yoo Joonghyuk."

The moment I raised my sword, Yoo Joonghyuk and I clashed head on.
There was a blinding glare right under my nose.

[The constellation 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' has entered the channel!]

[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' has entered the
channel!]

[Multiple constellations are entering the channel!]

The constellations felt our clash and entered the channel.

[The constellation 'King Heungmu the Great' is surprised at your status!]

[The constellation 'One-eyed Maitreya' is admiring the incarnation Yoo
Joonghyuk.]

Some constellations were shocked to see Yoo Joonghyuk and I.

[The constellation 'Queen of the Darkest Spring' realizes something and is
sighing.]

Some were surprised in a completely different sense. The sound of an
explosion occurred again and I rolled across the ground. My eyes peered at
the sky through the dust while gazes poured down on me. Laughter
emerged. "…It is dirty."
I hadn't used all the means available to me but I didn't want to. It was a
confrontation of pure power and I was pushed back by Yoo Joonghyuk. The
sound of Yoo Joonghyuk's footsteps approaching was heard.

His Black Heavenly Demon Sword stabbed the ground right next to my
head. Yoo Joonghyuk stared down at me with his distinctive eyes. I
watched him and spoke,

"Take a look. Hey."

Yoo Joonghyuk didn't say anything but I could tell. Perhaps this was what
Yoo Joonghyuk wanted to prove. This was Yoo Joonghyuk's last three
years. This was what he really wanted to say.

I laughed. "I didn't take care of it."

The towering monument behind Yoo Joonghyuk was shining. The base that
was the goal. One man was talking from the monument.

"Hey Brother! I just write here?"

The moment the surprised Yoo Joonghyuk turned around, Flying Fox
moved his feet. He quickly kicked and carved a stylish marker on the
monument. It was a phrase I told him in advance.

[The 163rd returnees group has cleared the scenario!]

My body was covered in smoke. To be exact, it wasn't just me but the other
returnees. The appearance of the returnees was changing inside the smoke.

[You are no longer a disaster.]

In the pupils of my party members, my figure lying on the ground could be
seen. Shin Yoosung burst into tears and ran over. I patted the child who was
in my arms.

"It has been three years. Three years…"
Lee Gilyoung belatedly ran over and hugged my waist while crying.

"Hyung, I knew you were alive! I knew from the beginning that you were
Dokja hyung!"

[You have met the clear conditions for Main Scenario 45 - Glorious
Return!]

[The rewards for the scenario are being prepared.]

[You have met the progress conditions of the 46th main scenario!]

I hugged the children and slowly stood up. The top of the monument was
clearly visible in the dusty sky. I pointed to the monument.

"It is a commemorative gift."

[The name of the nebula you belong to is officially announced.]

[The site of the nebula you belong to has been established.]

The marking on the monument was as followed:

–Kim Dokja's Company.

I arbitrarily decided the name of the nebula. The party members
approaching this way looked at me in a dumbfounded manner. Lee Jihye
has swollen eyes while Han Sooyoung sighed and shook her head. I
watched them and wondered, "Are you going to join me?"

I could see the faces of the upcoming party members. One person, one
person. They were all the people I wanted to see. The moment I opened my
arms to the running group members, a stinging pain struck the back of my
head. In my gradually blurring consciousness, I could see Jung Heewon's
face.

"This man, lock him up."
      Chapter 305: Ep. 58 - Context of the Constellations, I


During the past three years, Jung Heewon had changed a lot.

–Leader of the Chungcheong Alliance, Jung Heewon!

–The age of the Supreme King has passed! The strongest incarnation is
Destroyer of Evil!

She had fan clubs and people in various media wanted to turn her story into
a product. Any incarnation who used a sword would admire her. There
were constellations who tried to get her to join their nebula.

Of course, it was a futile effort. Jung Heewon was the incarnation of a
famous constellation in the Star Stream. The problem was that the famous
constellation didn't appear in front of Jung Heewon for three years.

"I thought my sponsor was dead."
Her sponsor suddenly disappeared after the incident three years ago. Thus,
Jung Heewon was forced to try harder than other incarnations. She had
been trained by transcendents such as Breaking the Sky Sword Saint and
Kyrgios every day. It was in order to not lag behind the party members or
sacrifice anyone else.

"It would've been a lot less unfair if you were there."

Jung Heewon was really strong. Then in front of her strong self, the
vanished sponsor once again appeared.

[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' is silent.]

Jung Heewon sighed. "That… what are you saying to me just now?"

[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' is smiling.]

Jung Heewon didn't smile She quietly raised her hand to grip her sword.

[The incarnation 'Jung Heewon' is prepared to invoke Hour of Judgement
on her sponsor!]

[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' is surprised!]

[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' says that Hour of Judgement
can only be used against the wicked.]

Jung Heewon replied, "I know."

Indirect messages poured out.

[Some constellations of the absolute good system have agreed with Jung
Heewon's request.]

[The constellation 'Guardian of Youths and Travel' has agreed to the
request.]
[The constellation 'Friend of Justice and Harmony' has agreed to the
request.]

[The constellation 'Master of the Ark' has agreed to the request.]

[Some constellations of the absolute good system have opposed the
request.] [The activation of the skill is cancelled!]

Jung Heewon stared at the air with wide eyes.

[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' is avoiding the eyes of her
incarnation.]

Jung Heewon released her sword and sighed once again. In her head, the
feelings of her sponsor were conveyed.

Sorrow and joy. Regret and guilt.

In fact, Jung Heewon knew why Uriel was detained for the past three years.
It was miraculous that she was just confined in Eden after the events of the
Demon King Selection.

[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' says she is sorry.]

However, she was still disappointed. Furthermore, her sponsor appeared for
the first time in three years…

"If you want to see Dokja-ssi, why don't you go and see him yourself? You
know he is at the top of the fortress."

[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' says that it isn't possible to
summon a symbolic body because the probation period isn't over yet.]

The worried Jung Heewon hesitated for a long time before opening her
mouth. "…I understand. Instead, don't do anything weird."

[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' is greatly pleased!]
[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' is asking if Kim Dokja is
really imprisoned.]

"…Why do you like it?"

[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' is asking if Kim Dokja really
became a squid.]

[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire'…]

"I'll go now and look directly."

Not long after, Jung Heewon arrived at the top of the fortress where Kim
Dokja was trapped.

[This is a space where the Celestial Emperor's Sturdy Ward is enforced.]

[The incarnation 'Jung Heewon' is permitted to enter.]

The door opened and the interior of a lavish room appeared. It was a prison
but it was a room worthy of being a suite in a five star hotel. There was a
sumptuous feast on the dining table that could be eaten whenever a person
was hungry and a king-size bed to help with sleep. On the side were a few
fantasy novels published before the fall of the world. Come to think of it,
Kim Dokja liked fantasy novels.

Jung Heewon tried one of them as a test. Title: The World After the Fall.
Author: Sing Shangshong…

[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' is screaming!]

She turned her head and saw Kim Dokja sitting on a soft rocking chair. A
catheter was plugged into his arm to feed him story packs.

[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' is looking at the Demon King
of Salvation.]
The pack also contained sleeping pills made by Lee Seolhwa. She came
closer and could see Kim Dokja's face. At the gaze, Kim Dokja opened his
eyes. "…Heewon-ssi?"

Jung Heewon didn't know that she was biting her lips. Kim Dokja's
defenseless face that was weary from the hard times. A corner of her heart
ached at the sight.

"This place…"

There were many things she wanted to say when she met Kim Dokja again.
She wanted to be angry, she wanted to puke, she wanted to ask why the hell
he did those things. Even so, all her emotions melted away after seeing Kim
Dokja's face. These were her feelings or perhaps they were the feelings of
her sponsor. Jung Heewon didn't know.

Jung Heewon controlled the amount of sleeping pills flowing through the
catheter.

"The person who wants to see Dokja-ssi… no, it is an angel."

A white light shone around Jung Heewon's hand. It was a warm light
reminiscent of an archangel. Jung Heewon raised Kim Dokja's body and
laid him down on the bed. Not long after, Kim Dokja fell asleep with a light
breathing sound. Jung Heewon's hand surrounded by the white light passed
over Kim Dokja's head several times.

[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' is looking at the Demon King
of Salvation.]

It was a valuable emotion that couldn't be conveyed in words. In the
meantime, Jung Heewon hadn't understood Uriel's companionship but
somehow, she felt like she knew it a bit.
I had a long dream. The dream was a bit strange.

–The vitals check is good.

–There is a stable dose of the story pack.

Lee Seolhwa and Aileen's voices came and went like a hallucination.

–Hyung… um…

Sometimes I saw the faces of Lee Gilyoung and Shin Yoosung as they
clung to my waist.

–Uwahhhh! Dokja-ssiiiii!

I heard Lee Hyunsung howling like a monster. Then…

At first glance, it seemed like my mother's face. I thought about it. If this
was a dream, I would rather not wake up.

–Hey, he's going to wake up! Quickly get another dose of sleeping pills!

I listened to Han Sooyoung's loud voice and smiled. In other words, this
dream was a play for only one person. Just like Ways of Survival was to
me.

「 In fact, he couldn't wake up anytime he wanted but Kim Dokja didn't do
this. 」

Thus, I decided to be the audience of the play.

「 For the first time since the fall began, Kim Dokja slept comfortably. 」

It was the first time I felt this way. My heart was always impatient. Now I
could be protected by someone. There were people I could trust.

–Take a break, Dokja-ssi.
…Yes, there was still some time until the 46th scenario. The moment I
made up my mind, a full sleep came over me.




Lee Gilyoung, who was caught by the collar, screamed. "Ah, noona! Do I
have to go? I want to stay with Dokja hyung!"

"You have been with him long enough."

"Shin Yoosung was together with him for eight hours! I was only there for
six hours!"

Lee Jihye gave some sweet honey to the complaining Lee Gilyoung. "These
guys are offensive. You and Yoosung are the only ones who can deal with
them. In addition, Dokja ahjussi is sleeping and you can meet him
anytime."

"But…"

"Unni, we've almost arrived."

The chimera dragon started a sharp descent along with Shin Yoosung's
words. The buildings of the Gyeonggi Alliance could be seen below. The
reason the Busan Alliance came here was simple.

"…You really made a kingdom." The people treated as slaves were crying
out with pain. Lee Jihye bit her lips and declared, "Kill them."

Lee Jihye pulled out her sword while Lee Gilyoung stepped forward. "Hey,
Shin Yoosung. I'll handle it so you're out."

"Shut up, you didn't even recognize Dokja ahjussi."

"…Go, Titano-MKII!"
The moment Lee Gilyoung gave the command, the insect king unit wearing
hard armour flew into the air. They were at least fourth grade insect kings.

"The enemy!"

Lee Jihye asked as she saw the scythe of a giant praying mantis cut the
buildings.

"Didn't Titano die?"

"That was just Titano. This is Titano-MKII."

"What's the difference?"

An explosion occurred in the middle of the enemy's camp. It wasn't caused
by Titano. The high-rise buildings that formed the main pillars of the
Gyeonggi Alliance collapsed and there was a huge storm. The airships
floating in the sky could be seen crashing down after being hit by
something that was like black lightning.

Lee Jihye was dumbfounded. "We said we would take care of it…"

There was only a ruin in the place where the storm passed. A man was
slaughtering the fleeing alliance members. It was Yoo Joonghyuk.

"W-Wait a minute! Wait! Stop Supreme King!" A man who appeared to be
one of the leaders of the Gyeonggi Alliance hurriedly shouted, "You will be
in trouble if you kill me now! We have a hostage on our side!"

Yoo Joonghyuk's sword stopped for the first time at the word 'hostage'. The
man thought it worked and kept shouting, "Phew… the reason why the
Moonlight Empress doesn't emerge from the top floor if the fortress is
because her disease is worsening."

The confused Lee Jihye and Shin Yoosung glanced at each other.

"What is this brat talking about?"
"…The Moonlight Empress, Sangah unni?"

The man's words continued. "Haha, it took a long time to pierce the barrier
of the Demon Realm but we did it!"

"What are you saying?"

"The elite forces of our alliance have penetrated the fortress while you were
absent. In other words, the life of the Moonlight Empress is now in our
hands. It was hard to break through but your colleague's life is now in our
hands―"

"You pierced the wards?"

Yoo Joonghyuk's expression cracked for the first time. The facial
expressions of the other party members shifted. Shin Yoosung asked,

"There isn't anything around Sangah unni's room?"

"Then that crazy guy is saying…"

At the same time, the group looked at Seoul.




At the same time, ten men penetrated the fortress of the industrial complex.
They were all elite fighters of the Gyeonggi Alliance.

–It's here.

–Yes, that's correct.

–The Snacks Team, get started.
The members in charge of releasing the ward rushed at the order of the
leader. One of the group members asked.

–What if the Black Flames Empress is present? Won't all of us be cut
down?

It was only recently that the Black Flames Empress was renamed Black
Flames Demon Ruler and the Moonlight Girl was renamed Moonlight
Empress. It was due to the Seongnam Disaster that took place a year ago.

–The Black Flames Demon Ruler is away. The only one inside the room is
the Moonlight Empress.

–Is it really okay for us to do this alone?

–There is a rumour that her illness is deep. It's no problem if she's alone.

A while later, the ward blocking the door was released.

–The ward has been lifted!

–Already? It was faster than I expected.

–Well, it is hard to penetrate from the inside but it is easy from outside.

–How funny. There was something like this?

–That's right. Really stupid…

They laughed as the ward was broken and the door opened.

–Shall we see the workmanship of the Moonlight Empress? Everybody, get
ready to infiltrate!

The moment they touched the door handle, an unexpected message entered
their ears.
[The constellation 'Black Sword Assassin' is giving a warning!]

[The constellation 'Hunter of the Dark Moon' is astounded!]

[The constellation 'Knight of the Frozen Heart' is convulsing.]

They were all the sponsors of the incarnations.

–What is this? My sponsor… –D-

Did you hear it as well?

Their curiosity didn't last for long. A formidable aura was felt from beyond
the door. A huge aura they never encountered before was covering their
body.

–Body…?

The elite members stiffened at the power that was on a different dimension.
It was impossible.

"I was enjoying my rest but that isn't my fate."

A man in a white coat walked through the open door. The smiling man
placed a hand on the shoulder of the leader.

"Everyone, thank you for bringing me out."
      Chapter 306: Ep. 58 - Context of the Constellations, II


It took less than 30 seconds for the nine people to be lying on the ground.

"Kuock…"

I ignored the groan and wiped the blood off my hands. I used Character List
but the answer came out without having to look.

"The Gyeonggi Alliance. Why did you come here?"

One of the bleeding bodies started melting down. It seemed to be a
technique.

[The constellation 'Black Sword Assassin' is wary of you!]

[The constellation 'Hunter of the Dark Moon' questions the fairness of the
scenario.]
I frowned towards the air as the messages died down. I thoroughly checked
the routes of their movements. I saw someone flying and fleeing through a
broken window. I saw the method of running through the air and knew who
it was.

I thought they were mere members of the alliance but one of the 10 Evils
was among them. The leader of the Gyeonggi Alliance, one of the 10 Evils
Cho Jinchul. The guy who had a sponsor from Murim and was one of the
problems of the original 45th scenario.

Of course, that was according to the original story. The person in front of
me right now wasn't worth caring about. There were ranks among the 10
Evils and Cho Jinchul was one of the small fries. For the current party
members, there were no incarnations on the Korean Peninsula who could be
a match against them. Perhaps if it was the United States or India…

"This guy! Chase him!"

I saw some people chasing after the distant Cho Jinchul. Among them was
the returnee Flying Fox who I brought with me. As the fugitive and pursuer
engaged in a cat and mouse chase, the panoramic view of Seoul entered my
vision.

I knew it was Seoul. In addition, it was the center of the industrial complex.
Through a contract with Secretive Plotter, the Industrial Complex was
transferred to empty Seoul. As if the reality and fiction are combined and
he realized that the world is watching, the landscape has changed and
realized that. The bottom of the fortress had 'Yoo Joonghyuk - Kim Dokja
Industrial Complex' engraved.

…Why was Yoo Joonghyuk first? I would change it later.

[The constellation 'Guardian of Youths and Travel' is looking at you.]

I looked up at the air. Guardian of Youths and Travel. I knew the owner of
the modifier.
"Raphael."

An archangel of Eden, Raphael. Sparks flew in the air like Raphael was
reacting. I thought I would hear from Eden soon. "I was just going to find
you. I will give back…"

I remembered that I still had the symbolic body of Gabriel. Jophiel's
confinement effect was over and it was time for Gabriel to wake up. By the
way…

[The constellation 'Guardian of Youths and Travel' says that Gabriel has
already been recovered.]

The lily had disappeared. Come to think of it, I remembered an archangel's
hand passing over me when I was sleeping. Maybe one of the constellations
of Eden had visited at that time. Since Jung Heewon's sponsor was Uriel
then it was likely to be Uriel.

…By the way, what happened to Uriel? Why wasn't there an indirect
message from her?

[The constellation 'Guardian of Youths and Travel' says that Uriel doesn't
yet have authorization to speak in the channel.] Ah, I see.

[The constellation 'Guardian of Youths and Travel' is curious about you.]

[The constellation 'Guardian of Youths and Travel' says that the red cosmos
hasn't returned.]

At Raphael's message, I hesitated for a moment and opened my mouth.
"The Commander of the Red Cosmos didn't come back with me."

Commander of the Red Cosmos, Jophiel. I wouldn't have been able to
return to the third round without her help. "She wanted to remain in the
other world line out of her own will."
There was a wild gust of wind.

[The constellation 'Guardian of Youths and Travel' distrusts your words!]
Raphael was furious. I calmly continued speaking. "If you use your ability,
you know that I'm not a lie."

Not long after, the winds sweeping around slowly eased.

[The constellation 'Guardian of Youths and Travel' is looking at you.]

[The constellation 'Guardian of Youths and Travel' is asking you for
clarification.]

"I will go there. The 46th scenario is ahead… we'll be able to talk soon."

I felt a strange change in Raphael's gaze on me. The archangel knew the
contents of the scenario.

"I will go to Eden as soon as the scenario is over."

[The constellation 'Guardian of Youths and Travel' will wait for your
answer.]

After the message, Raphael's energy in the area completely disappeared.
The status flooding the area was gone and I felt bitter. In the meantime, I
had accumulated many stories and became quite strong. I could suppress
low to mid-grade constellations and it was almost impossible to find a
stronger presence among the constellations. Yet the archangel's status was
still too high.

Guardian of Youths and Travel, Raphael. A powerful adversary who took
down Demon King Asmodeus.

「 Kim Dokja quietly clenched his fists and repeated. 」

I still had a long way to go. However, I didn't have to rush. I was doing well
enough right now. That reminded me of Asmodeus… no, Department Head
Han. So many things had happened when I was gone. There weren't only
one or two things to wonder about. I checked the system messages first.

[You have missed the dokkaebi communication.]

[Sender: Senior Dokkaebi Bihyung.]

There was a message from Bihyung. I thought it was strange that Bihyung
hadn't made a fuss when I came back… he expressed his concerns in this
message. I opened the screen and manipulated the message window. The
message was long but the contents itself was simple.

–I'm sorry that I couldn't come. I am busy with some things. I will go see
you once things are over.

These were roughly the contents of the long message.

–By the way, don't you care about your baby?

The news I was curious about appeared at the end of the message.

–I have Biyoo. Well, she is also my child. You left her in front of the portal
and she was almost taken away by the wenny people.

I had been worried because Biyoo didn't appear.

–You will be a bit surprised when she comes back. Look forward to it.

Bihyung's message was over. I felt a bit uncomfortable but I was relieved
that Biyoo was with Bihyung.

Then let's move. I piled up the bodies in one place and decided to find the
party members.

.
.

.

Dozens of minutes passed. I was wandering along the road. Why was this
factory so wide? I scratched my head and looked around but I couldn't tell
where I was located. It wasn't too late but I should purchase the Reading
Map or Pathfinding skill.

"Excuse me, is anybody there?"

I had a tendency to get lost in the 'first building I visited'. When I entered
elementary school and middle school for the first time, when I got my first
placement and when I joined Mino Soft…

Thinking about it, this was the reason why I first spoke to Yoo Sangah.

「 Kim Dokja thought, 'Where is the emergency exit?' 」

I had never been inside the Factory properly and had no idea where I was.
In addition, the structure seemed changed from back then. I decided to open
suspicious doors one by one.

The moment I opened a door, a small tentacled monster and frog stared at
me. Some objects were inside test tubes while others were freely roaming
the room.

[Frog Who Could've Been Dokja ahjussi]

[Elephant Monster Who Was Almost Dokja ahjussi]

[Tentacle Monster Who Unfortunately Wasn't Dokja ahjussi]

The frog gazed at me and shot out its tongue. I closed the door with
surprise. Wait, this room

perhaps…
I wanted to check the nameplate when I heard a voice nearby.

"…Hey! How did you get out?"

"Dokja-ssi?"

It was Han Sooyoung and Lee Hyunsung.




"I mean, Dokja-ssi. In the 35th scenario…"

Lee Hyunsung was talking about the scenarios he experienced. I silently
listened to the story while examining Lee Hyunsung's body. His pectoral
muscles were more developed than before. The magic power of steel was
connecting muscle fibres.

Now Lee Hyunsung's Steel Transformation had reached the edge of
mastery. It wasn't unreasonable if the 46th scenario started right now. It was
a bit impressive. While I was away, the party members faithfully trained
while following the guidelines I gave them.

Of course, I wasn't just listening to Lee Hyunsung.

[Midday Tryst has been activated.]

[Incarnation 'Han Sooyoung' is currently participating in the conversation.]

I was fortunate to have met Han Sooyoung first. Preparing for a scenario
was always late. For quick preparations, I needed someone who could
provide the most accurate information efficiently and there was only one
person best suited for it.

–Where is Jang Hayoung and the Breaking the Sky Master?
–He went to other scenario areas with the Breaking the Sky Sword Saint
and Kyrgios. It seemed to be a scenario only for transcendents.

–What about Han Myungoh and Gong Pildu?

–They are currently in North Korea. Gong Pildu has gone to carry out the
North Korean scenario. Han Myungoh was dragged away as an extra.

…North Korea. By the way, now was the time for North Korean
incarnations. There were a few prominent constellations to be found in
North Korea. Of course, most of them were historical-grade but there were
some comparable to narrative-grade. For example, the Great King…

–Where have you been so far?

–The 1863rd round of Ways of Survival.

Han Sooyoung's eyes widened.

–What? Really?

–Ah, you were there. I don't know if it was a true self or not.

–…True self? What is this bullshit?

I tried to answer when someone stood in our way.

"…Dokja-ssi." It was Jung Heewon.

"I slept well thanks to you."

Jung Heewon stared at me with a complicated gaze. It seemed that she
wanted to say something but she also wanted to hear my story. Jung
Heewon's gaze slowly moved towards Han Sooyoung.

For a moment, sharp currents flowed between Han Sooyoung and Jung
Heewon. Jung Heewon stared at Han Sooyoung with cold eyes before
turning her head. In this awkward atmosphere, I opened my mouth first.
"Yes, there were intruders in front of my room…"

"I gave orders to handle it. If you have woken up then go see Sangah-ssi.
We can talk about the details next time." Her voice was much colder than
usual. It was different from the Jung Heewon I knew. Lee Hyunsung,
standing beside me, gazed after Jung Heewon with sad eyes.

Once Jung Heewon disappeared around the corner, I asked Han Sooyoung.
"What is this?"

"What?"

"What's going on between you and Jung Heewon?" I gazed at Han
Sooyoung's pout and felt a bit anxious. I didn't know what happened but it
wasn't the time for them to be fighting. "Have you forgotten the 46th
scenario? You now…"

"You haven't been here for three years. You don't know anything so shut
up."

Han Sooyoung also turned away and left at these words. Only Lee
Hyunsung remained. I saw Lee Hyunsung's sagging shoulders and felt
depressed. It seemed this had happened more than once.

During the three years I was away, a rift that I didn't know about formed
between the party members. It was clear without asking Lee Hyunsung
about the shape of the group.

I lightly patted Lee Hyunsung's shoulders. I didn't know what happened but
it was obvious what I had to do to grasp the situation. "Hyunsung-ssi,
where is Yoo Sangah-ssi?"

"This way."
It was very brief but I didn't miss Lee Hyunsung's darkening expression. I
followed Lee Hyunsung's big back and we arrived at a small door covered
with simple white paint. Unexpected, Jung Heewon and Han Sooyoung
who left earlier were standing in front of the door.

…What was with these people? I was about to speak to them but their
expressions were a bit strange. It was the first time I had seen Han
Sooyoung and Jung Heewon making this expression.

「 Kim Dokja thought, 'There isn't any easy task'. 」

Shut up. I sighed lightly and placed my hand on the door handle. Things
would be resolved once I met Yoo Sangah. I briefly knocked on the door
and heard Yoo Sangah's voice from inside.

–Who is it?

"Kim Dokja."

The answer was unexpected.

–Go back.
      Chapter 307: Ep. 58 - Context of the Constellations, III


The door shut me out. I held the door handle and glanced back. Jung
Heewon was watching to see how I would act while Han Sooyoung's eyes
were oddly vigilant. Meanwhile, Lee Hyunsung looked like he would melt
from anxiety.

I leaned back against the door and carefully sat down. "I won't enter. Can I
talk here for a while?"

This wasn't anyone else, it was Yoo Sangah. There must be a reason if Yoo
Sangah was refusing to meet me. The answer came back after a long time.

–…If you want.

There was no strength in her voice. In the midst of the stillness so deep I
could hear people breathing, I thought about Yoo Sangah. It was Yoo
Sangah when I was still at Mino Soft.
If you asked me if I was close to Yoo Sangah, I couldn't say yes with
confidence. However, if you asked me what type of person Yoo Sangah
was… I might have a few words to say.

"Did I come back too late?" I spoke softly. "I'm sorry. I was a bit too much.
The incident where I was late on the first day of my new job and Yoo
Sangah-ssi helped me… do you remember?

Yoo Sangah was silent for a moment before replying.

–…You were late both times.

Yoo Sangah looked perfect on the surface but she wasn't. Yoo Sangah was
more sincere than anyone I knew.

"Do you remember searching in the interview?"

–I remember.

Mino Soft's interview for new employees was quite popular in the industry.
Every year, different types of 'quests' emerged. The most common ones
were 'raising the interview's favourability' or 'finding hidden interview
hints'. For reference, the quest in the year when Yoo Sangah and I were
interviewed was 'find the interview'.

–…I think I received more help from Dokja-ssi.

"I only found the quest items. Yoo Sangah was the only who worked out
how to find the path using the items."

At the time, I teamed up with Yoo Sangah and found the interview location.

–Dokja-ssi pointed out the inefficient quest routes.

"Sangah-ssi pointed out the causal relationship with the quest upgrade
system."
The 'quest' wasn't simply about clearing it. Identifying problems,
weaknesses and finding the efficiency of the quest. This was the core of
Mino Soft's interview. Yoo Sangah and I passed the interview with the
highest score.

"It was a pity that we were split into different departments after joining…
well, it was a natural thing."

–…

I joined the QA team while Yoo Sangah was in HR. After joining the
company, we barely managed to exchange greetings.

"Yoo Sangah-ssi, I'm happy to be on the same team as you again." I heard
the very small sound of someone breathing. "Just as I did then, I need Yoo
Sangah-ssi now. I need someone to help me find the way."

Lee Hyunsung was looking at me with tearful eyes. Jung Heewon sighed
lightly while Han Sooyoung turned her head away. Then Yoo Sangah's
voice was heard.

–Dokja-ssi.

"Yes."

–I'm not such a good person.

I didn't know what to say. If Yoo Sangah wasn't a good person then there
were no good people in the world.

–Do you remember the break room incident?

I replied to the unexpected question.

"…I remember."
There was a case where someone sprinkled pepper in the break room.
Thanks to this incident, the company was noisy for a while. The bosses
were upset at drinking pepper flavoured coffee and the new employers were
criticized.

–I was the one who did it.

"…Is that so?"

–…You aren't surprised.

"Thanks to you, the newcomers didn't have to do coffee errands for a
while."

In fact, I knew Yoo Sangah was the culprit. At the time, the QA team were
given the task of catching the culprit. As the youngest member, I was
mostly responsible for it. I was hiding in the break room while using the
cleaning tools as a cover to read Ways of Survival. Then I saw Yoo Sangah
entering alone late at night.

–It wasn't just that.

Yoo Sangah kept talking. Most of the cases were minor but despite this,
they changed things little by little. They were events where someone
suffered, someone found their lost rights or someone felt happy.

"Yoo Sangah-ssi."

She wasn't a character. Yet in fact, before Ways of Survival arrived, she
was like a 'character' to me. It was because I didn't think there was anyone
like her in reality.

「 "You will be killed." 」
From the moment the first scenario started, I began to know Yoo Sangah.
The person who tried to maintain 'ethics' that didn't exist in Ways of
Survival.

「 "I'll do it Gilyoung. I will do it." 」

Without Yoo Sangah, the party would've surely collapsed.

「 "You're so inspiring, Dokja-ssi." 」

No matter what nonsense I spoke, Yoo Sangah smiled and accepted it.

「 "I should also live my own life!." 」

If she hadn't been there, no matter the story I wanted to create…

「 "I never hated Dokja-ssi like I do today. Come back, please." 」

I wouldn't have been able to make the Outer World Covenant with
confidence.

–I really can't stand it…

Yoo Sangah's weak words followed.

I slowly got up. "Yoo Sangah-ssi."

Yoo Sangah continued like she couldn't hear my voice. I silently listened to
her as I grabbed the handle again. Helping someone who didn't want help
could be a curse. However, some people couldn't ask for help despite
needing help. It was because they had never asked for it before.

…Just like the day I went to the interview.

"Wait a minute, Dokja-ssi―!"
I ignored Jung Heewon's words and forcibly turned the locked door. The
door opened and the scene of the room was revealed. Then I saw three dark
faces. Lee Seolhwa, Aileen and… my mother. My mother's eyes were
saying, 'You came'.

The three people stood on the bed and Yoo Sangah was lying on the bed.
Her face was pallid. Her firmly closed lips had no colour. It was the others
who had conveyed her words on her behalf.

「 So… 」

Inside Yoo Sangah, the broken stories were flowing incessantly.




After a while, I sat down in Yoo Sangah's hospital room with the group.

"Since when has this been happening?"

"…It hasn't been long." Jung Heewon replied. It was Lee Seolhwa who
gave the detailed explanation. "The side effects from the excessive use of
the stigma are serious."

I gazed down at Yoo Sangah's pale face. Yoo Sangah wouldn't have
suffered like this if she had a normal sponsor. Right now, she had the
nebula Olympus itself as a sponsor. The unusual Sponsor Contract reduced
the lifespan of the incarnation. The 'lifespan' didn't simply mean physical
life. It was the 'lifespan of the story'.

"The soul has fallen asleep under the consciousness and all that is left is the
stream of consciousness."
She repeatedly used a stigma she couldn't afford and the absurdity
accumulated in Yoo Sangah's soul. Probability created cracks in her mind
and body and the stories eventually started leaking out of the cracks.

Aileen added, "Story packs are constantly transfused and the broken
fragments collected and re-added. Nevertheless, there is no difference."

I couldn't think of what to say as I watched Yoo Sangah. It was because of
me. I came back too late…

"I told you not to go in because you would make this expression." Han
Sooyoung grumbled.

I bit my lips and asked Lee Seolhwa. "How much time is left?"

"3 months…"

"Is there a way?"

"As of right now… there is nothing we can do here."

"It might be possible somewhere else."

[The constellation 'Guam Divine Doctor' is nodding.]

The sponsor responded on behalf of Lee Seolhwa. [The

constellation 'Guam Divine Doctor' says Incarnation

Yoo Sangah's disease isn't a human disease.


Human diseases could be treated using human power.

…Then what if it was a disease of the gods?
[The constellation 'Demon King of Salvation' is looking up at the night

sky.] In the dark Star Stream, several small stars shone.

[The constellation 'Abandoned Lover of the Labyrinth' is looking at you.]

[The constellation 'God of Wine and Ecstasy' is looking at you.]

All of them were stars of Olympus with a connection to Yoo Sangah.
Suddenly, my anger soared. Certainly, it was Yoo Sangah herself who used
the power. Even so, it was Olympus who induced such an absurd contract
in the first place.

[Olympus, you can bear the probability.]

My true voice headed towards the night sky. A few stars shone again.

[The constellation 'Abandoned Lover of the Labyrinth'…]

The next moment, the indirect messages were cut off by unknown sparks.
The shining stars were no longer visible. Someone had interfered with the
indirect message.

I spoke through gritted teeth. "If it is them, there might be a way."

There was no one here who didn't know who 'they' were. Jung Heewon's
expression darkened. "However, there is no way to ask for help. We made a
few attempts but…"

The constellations were selfish and did what they wanted. They only looked
at stories they wanted to see or listened to stories they wanted to hear. If
Yoo Sangah was still in this state, it meant the high level constellations
didn't want Yoo Sangah's miracle.

Han Sooyoung asked, "Why don't you go to the Underworld like you did
last time? You're friendly with the queen."
"The situation at that time was special. In addition, Yoo Sangah isn't dead
yet. Besides, she isn't like Biyoo."

In fact, I contacted Persephone but there was no answer. It was also a
difficult situation. It was already lucky that Shin Yoosung could be
reincarnated as Biyoo. Most deaths in this world were literal deaths.
Reincarnation and regression were just miraculous stories of the Star
Stream.

"You said Jang Hayoung went to perform another scenario?"

"…He went pretty far."

If Jang Hayoung was here, I could've sent messages directly to the
constellations… I looked at the face of the sleeping Yoo Sangah and
thought.

「 How to save Yoo Sangah? 」

In the end, there was only one method. I slowly breathed in. "There is still a
way. It is a bit earlier than I expected but…"

"We have to clear the 46th scenario first."

The low and cold voice interrupted my words. I turned around towards the
man.

…He appeared like he had been waiting. The group of people who had
been dispatched to destroy the Gyeonggi Alliance was standing at the door.
Shin Yoosung, Lee Gilyoung and Lee Jihye. In addition… Yoo Joonghyuk.

The children ran into my arms and hugged me. I stroked Shin Yoosung's
head while watching Yoo Joonghyuk. He stared at me ferociously before
glancing at the other party members.

"It is time to meet the constellations."
"The constellations?"

The wind blew through the slightly open window. Two dokkaebis appeared
in the distant sky. Perhaps they were those who came to prepare for the next
scenario. Beyond that, the number of constellations watching the scenarios
increased. I pointed to the stars and declared. "There are constellations
present in the 47th scenario area."

The 47th scenario. It involved the interstellar cities of the constellations and
the 'constellation context'.

"Let's go destroy Olympus."
      Chapter 308: Ep. 58 - Context of the Constellations, IV


After a short time, the party members managed their equipment while
waiting for Kim Dokja. Lee Jihye changed her blade and asked Jung
Heewon, "Is Dokja ahjussi being serious? Really destroying Olympus…"

"It must be a joke. Dokja-ssi isn't that stupid."

"Still, we don't know where he has been for three years. Do you know the
last three years?"

"…I understand. I'm not a fool."

"We might not know where he has been for three years but if we look at
Master…"

The speaking Lee Jihye quickly shut her mouth as she felt Yoo Joonghyuk's
gaze from a distance. Jung Heewon sighed at Lee Jihye before glancing at
the meeting room that Kim Dokja entered.
Two people were sitting in a private room reminiscent of the reception
room of a detention center.

"It's been three years."

"…It took me longer than I thought."

Kim Dokja watched Lee Sookyung and locked his lips several times. There
were many things to say but some were buried in the layers of scenarios
and others were missed by time passing.

"That…" In the tomb of a bygone story, a word was barely excavated. "I'm
sorry."

Lee Sookyung smiled and wondered,"Are you thinking of leaving for the
next scenario?"

"Yes."

"When?"

"This evening." Kim Dokja kept his mouth shut for a moment before
asking,
"Will you go with me?"

"I still have a lot of work to do here."

Lee Sookyung gazed out the window at the industrial complex. Kim Dokja
followed Lee Sookyung's gaze and looked out the window. They were
women who had once been prisoners in this society.

There were Cho Youngran who had Jeon Woochi as her sponsor and Lee
Boksoon who fought with him on Peace Land.
"There are more people than you think who make the wrong choice because
they are attracted to greater power."

The criminals who left prison were now fighting for people.

"The important thing is that people can change. Perhaps now they are
getting the opportunity."

Lee Sookyung's voice was sneering at herself. Lee Sookyung turned her
head and stared into her son's eyes.

"Do you know? A big story is a way to destroy an individual."

"I know."

Kim Dokja's eyes shook slightly. Small sparks jumped out from his two
eyes. Perhaps it was a topic that shouldn't have been brought up. A human
being exterminated by a 'big story'. Her son probably knew this better than
anyone else in the world. Lee Sookyung hesitated for a long time before
speaking.

"There is something I want to say."

"I know. I read it as well."

The book written by Lee Sookyung, the Underground Killer. Lee
Sookyung's book became a bestseller and society started talking about
domestic violence in earnest, leading to a bill to strengthen the law on
punishment. On the macro level, it might've been the right thing to do.

However, thanks to the story, the humans 'Lee Sookyung' and 'Kim Dokja'
were completely dissected.

Kim Dokja became the son of a tragedy caused by domestic violence in this
society and Lee Sookyung became a criminal who killed her husband and
made it a story. People called them by different names. The son of a
murderer or a cruel mother… It changed the world only a little bit.

"We were exterminated even before the book came out. Maybe even in the
future…"

Kim Dokja's words were cut off halfway before the end. Rather than look at
each other, they stared out the window.

The world was there. There wasn't anyone who wasn't hurt. On top of the
scenario-weary incarnations, the constellations wishing for more terrible
stories were shining.

Kim Dokja spoke, "A big story destroying an individual. I'm going to
change that."

"I'm here to change it as well."

"Then… we have to separate here again."

Kim Dokja stood up and told her, "Be well."

The door closed and Kim Dokja disappeared. Lee Sookyung silently
watched Kim Dokja disappearing through the door. After a while, a shadow
emerged from behind a curtain of the meeting room and Han Sooyoung
came out. Han Sooyoung watched the door that Kim Dokja had gone
through. "…He is a grumpy fellow."

"That's how I raised him."

At Lee Sookyung's words, Han Sooyoung narrowed her eyes. "Ajumma.
Why didn't you tell me?"

"Tell you what?"

"The book."
Lee Sookyung looked like she didn't know. Han Sooyoung glanced at Lee
Sookyung and was oddly incensed.

"I heard about ahjumma's motives. The earnings from that book, did you
send it to your relatives? It supplemented his living expenses."

"It didn't go to that child so it's like I didn't send it."

"Where are your relatives now?"

"They are dead by now."

Han Sooyoung closed her mouth. The previous animosity was pointless
after the destruction of the world. All the people who had to pay a price had
died comfortably and the rest of the people had to live their lives in a more
terrible world.

Han Sooyoung sighed and asked. "By the way, you really aren't coming?"

"I think I have raised my child for too long. It is enough for me to live my
life."

Lee Sookyung's lightly smiling face was wrinkled. One reason why the
industrial complex could be safe was Lee Sookyung. The Demon Realm
and Earth. The fact that two different ecosystems could unite safely was
possible thanks to the non-discriminatory rule of Lee Sookyung and Yoo
Sangah.

Lee Sookyung was a necessary person for the industrial complex.

Han Sooyoung knew it well and turned away without a word. She walked
to the door that Kim Dokja had exited through.

Lee Sookyung opened her mouth. "Sooyoung."

Han Sooyoung raised her hand without looking back. "Don't worry. Leave
your son to me. You just―"
"Be careful."

Han Sooyoung glanced back with a bemused expression. Lee Sookyung
was smiling. Her eyes were the same colour as Kim Dokja. Han Sooyoung
licked her lips and sighed.

"Anyway… I have no luck to the end."




A girl sucking on candy suddenly pointed at me and declared, "Squid."

I briefly lost my soul at the mental attack.

[Some constellations are wondering about the girl's identity.]

This girl… I mean… I sighed and spoke the girl's name. "Mia, have you
been well?"

"Who is this ahjussi?" She had forgotten since I hadn't seen her for a long
time. I was about to explain when Yoo Mia clapped her hands. "Ah, my
brother's friend."

"Not a friend… in any case, you've changed your way of speaking in the
time since I last saw you."

"You have become uglier in the time since I last saw you."

"Hey, Yoo Joonghyuk. Surely you aren't taking your sister with you?"

At my words, Yoo Joonghyuk glared at me from where he was putting a
hand on Yoo Mia's head. I watched him for a moment before asking, "…
Have you been well? I was so busy that I forgot to ask."

"There is no time to leisurely ask something like that."
I heard that hard voice and felt it was somewhat familiar, rather than feel
upset. Yes, this was the Yoo Joonghyuk I knew. The Yoo Joonghyuk I
knew kept speaking. "The 46th scenario is dangerous. Of course, I am
leaving my sister behind."

"Who else are you going to leave? Yoo Sangah-ssi will naturally stay
behind. My mother and the wanderer forces…"

"I will leave Flying Fox."

"You have already talked to Flying Fox?"

"I signed a contract with the returnees group."

Those freed from being a disaster needed time to adapt to their home world.
Yoo Joonghyuk contacted them and came back with a contract related to
the protection of the industrial complex. As expected from the protagonist,
he was pretty good at acting.

However, I shook my head. "They won't be able to protect this place
alone."

"Teacher will be back soon."

"That isn't the problem. Besides, it will be more dangerous if transcendents
are here. Don't you know?"

Yoo Joonghyuk was well aware of what I was saying. It was because he
lost the Breaking the Sky Sword in the last round.

Yoo Joonghyuk nodded. "I know. You can come back before 'that' happens.
You should be thinking about the 46th scenario."

"I've thought about it."

"It won't be easy. It might fail."
It wasn't unusual for him to say so.

–You can't break through the 46th scenario alone. Don't you know?

I spoke these words to persuade Yoo Joonghyuk the first time I met him.
Finally, the day had come to realize those words.

Yoo Joonghyuk said, "There are many ways to clear the 46th scenario."

"No, there's only one."

"It won't turn out like you think."

"Haven't you talked with the party members while I was away?"

"I don't believe in people." Yoo Joonghyuk replied in a composed manner
while Yoo Mia, listening by his side, shook her head.

I told him, "Don't you know what's after the 46th scenario? If you don't
cooperate with others from now on—"

"A real disaster doesn't appear on the surface."

I shut my mouth at Yoo Joonghyuk's words. The 45th scenario 'Glorious
Return' was a scenario where people fought disasters. The appearance was a
monster but they were fighting against humans. I read the messages stored
in the system log.

[You have cleared the 45th scenario.]

[Your group members didn't kill anyone throughout the scenario.]

[Your group members didn't kill any incarnations throughout the scenario.]

[Your group has shown new possibilities between incarnations and
returnees!]
[The 'disaster state' of you and the group will be released.]

New possibilities. It was evidence that trust and faith were capable between
different species. Yoo Joonghyuk spoke like he read my thoughts. "After
the scenario started, many people were killed by the scenario. More than
that, many people were killed by the same human beings."

Yoo Joonghyuk's cold eyes suddenly looked far away. "You will lose the
party in this scenario."

"What are you saying…"

"I have already lost a lot of people. You are different."

"…"

"You better prepare your heart."

I frowned because I knew the 46th scenario. Thus, I wasn't convinced by
Yoo Joonghyuk's words. It was impossible with the party that I knew. After
three years, they might've locked me up and fed me sleeping pills but they
would never fight against each other…

"By the way, are you going with me?"

"Uh, why?"

"Well, I'm just asking."

Intense sparks flew in the air. In the distance, the party members were
coming this way. Gilyoung and Shin Yoosung were leading from the front
while Lee Jihye, Lee Seolhwa and Lee Hyunsung were behind them. The
problem was Jung Heewon and Han Sooyoung.

…Come to think of it, they had a problem. Damn.

[Main Scenario #46 - Proof of the Stars has arrived!]
The 46th main scenario, Proof of the Stars. In order to meet Olympus and
the other constellations, I had to break through this scenario. Soon after, the
dokkaebi carrying out the scenario appeared in the air.

[Let's start the main scenario.]
      Chapter 309: Ep. 58 - Context of the Constellations, V


The dokkaebi who appeared for the scenario wasn't Bihyung. Nevertheless,
it was a very familiar dokkaebi. At one time, he was a low-grade dokkaebi
and he even learnt how to use the Dokkaebi Bag from me.

–…Kim Dokja?

The dokkaebi's eyes widened and he activated the Dokkaebi
Communication.

–It's me! Dokkaebi Youngki!

Dokkaebi Youngki in a suit was looking at me. Perhaps it was due to the
main scenario progress but he seemed reluctant to look at the other
participants.

–It has been a while.
–I heard rumours that you had come back… –

The rumour spread?


–Ah, you don't know. Right now, Bihyung is trying to deal with
the probability caused by Kim Dokja in every direction.

Youngki laughed and continued,

–Anyway, it was a pleasure to see you again. Other constellations have
been asking a lot about Dokja-nim. After this scenario, you will finally go
and see those sponsors.

–Yes, if things turn out well.

–Huhu, of course, it will. However, Kim Dokja won't receive any special
treatment. Do you understand?

–I know.

I heard distant sounds from afar. Without realizing it, the incarnations
participating in the 46th scenario had gathered.

[Hmm… there are 48 people. The Seoul area has fewer participants.]

Youngki changed his tone as he studied the volunteers with calm eyes. The
appearance of the volunteers varied. They were originally residents of the
industrial complex or incarnations who desperately reached this point.

Some of the returnees who stopped being disasters but rejected Yoo
Joonghyuk's contract could be seen. Their expressions were distorted with
deep rage or sadness. Perhaps they couldn't find their family.

[This scenario is different from many scenarios. First of all, this scenario is
an optional scenario.]
It was a returnee from Murim who asked the question. "An optional
scenario? What is that?"

[It means you can choose to participate as an 'individual qualification' or
you can choose to participate in the 'nebula qualification'. No matter which
one you choose, you will need colleagues.]

I listened to Youngki's words and clenched my fists. The 46th main
scenario, Proof of the Stars. It had finally come. The voices of the
incarnations could be heard.

"What's the difference between participating as an individual or
participating as a nebula?"

"Stupid. An individual qualification literally means participating alone and
a nebula qualification means participating as a group. Well, this is a nebula
we're talking about."

"What about the people who are already in a nebula?" Will they be forced
to participate as a 'nebula qualification'?"

[Oh, this is an important question. In regards to that…]

The moment Youngki's words were about to continue, a light flashed in the
night sky.

[Oh, you're already here. Your nature is too hasty.]

At the same time, messages poured from the sky. The messages headed to
their destination like a meteor shower and hovered above the heads of
incarnations.

.

.

[The nebula 'Asgard' has invited you to join.]
[The nebula 'Guardian Tree' has invited you to join.]

[The nebula 'Tamna' has invited you to join.]

[The nebula 'Emperor' has invited you to join.]

.

.

The 46th scenario started with a nebula selection competition.

"W-What is this?"

The shocked incarnations screamed. There were also incarnations checking
the list of nebulae with a cautious expression. There were a handful of
returnees who already knew the scenario. Some incarnations also counted
the number of stars above another person's head. Most of them had one or
two but there were several cases that went beyond five.

"Crazy, what is this?"

Of course, my party was the one who received the most messages. In
particular, Yoo Joonghyuk and some of the party members couldn't have
their faces seen due to the blinding light. I looked above my head.

[A total of 137 invitations have arrived for you.]

[However, if you accept this invitation then the nebula Kim Dokja's
Company will automatically be disbanded.]

The messages were sent with the intention of poking at people who couldn't
eat. Did they really think I would disband my nebula and join them?

Youngki continued when the incarnations seemed to settle down a bit.
[This scenario is the first scenario to receive a nebula selection. You can
join one of the invited nebulae and participate in the scenario.]

"Do we have to join? What is so good about joining up?"

[It doesn't matter if you don't join. However, if the nebula you join
has already completed the 46th scenario…] Youngki smiled slyly.

[You can be exempt from the scenario and go straight to the 47th scenario.]




In the midst of the incarnations, the party members gathered around me.

"I will pick Emperor!"

"I will choose Flag of Glory."

In the meantime, the incarnations finished choosing and shouted from
everywhere.

[Those who have chosen an exempt nebula will be automatically sent to the
47th scenario area. Please keep this in mind.]

Most incarnations chose to join a nebula rather than challenge the 46th
scenario. It was a reasonable judgment to some extent. The Korean
Peninsula was slowly when it came to scenarios so the notoriety of the 46th
scenario had spread from other countries that had already gone through it.

–If two people challenge the 46th scenario together, one of them will die.

None of them wanted to be the ones to die. Some of the incarnations gave
up on participating in the scenario while others chose a nebula and
proceeded to the next scenario. The number of incarnations increased and
Youngki finally looked at us.

[Now you're the only ones left. What will you do?]

The party members gathered around me were waiting for my choice.

Youngki asked again. [Do you want to apply as an individual or a nebula?
No matter what you choose, you can't do it alone.]

"If I pass this scenario with the qualification of a nebula, the members of
the same nebula will automatically be promoted?"

"Hoh that's right, Demon King of Salvation. Do you intend to challenge as
a nebula?]

"Yes."

The 46th scenario Proof of the Stars was the debut stage for our new
nebula. In this scenario, the story recorded in the constellation's context
depended on the number of victims and the performance.

I looked around at the party members. Apart from Yoo Joonghyuk and I,
they hadn't joined a nebula. I made eye contact with every one of them and
slowly breathed in.

"I won't force you to choose but keep this in mind. If you choose another
nebula here and proceed with the scenario, you will definitely be under
unfair constraints―"

"Dokja ahjussi really isn't honest. Why don't you just tell us to sign up?"

Lee Jihye pouted and interrupted my words. Among the party members, it
was Jung Heewon who opened her mouth first. "Hmm, what should I do?"

Jung Heewon smiled playfully while the nebulae invitations shimmered
above her head. "Considering Uriel, I should go to Eden…"
In fact, it was common for many incarnations to join the nebula their
sponsor belonged to. However, there were cases where the sponsors were
very open and respected the choice of the individual incarnation. In
particular, Eden respected the free will of the incarnations.

Jung Heewon asked, "Will we be eligible for the four major insurances if
we join Kim Dokja's Company?"

"Uh, um. This is the first time I'm operating this type of thing…"

"Is there a lunch break and nap time?"

"What about a personal maintenance time?"

"What about the support of medicinal or material items?"

Lee Hyunsung, Lee Seolhwa and Lee Jihye. Each of them threw out the
questions they wanted to ask.

"Well, that… as you know, Kim Dokja's Company is just a new nebula." I
stuttered at the explosive baptism of questions before sighing. "You can
decide your break time and maintenance time. I will supply consumable
material items but it might not be the best. There might be frequent night
work and the overtime allowance isn't enough."

It felt like I had no true conscience while speaking. If it had been before the
destruction, I would wonder about who would join such a company.

Nevertheless, Lee Hyunsung was listening to me while Lee Jihye yawned.

"As well as…"

"Dokja-ssi."

"Huh?" Jung Heewon interrupted in a calm voice. "In fact, there are many
questions I want to ask. Where have you been in the meantime, why have
you come back so late?"
"I will tell you soon…"

"In fact, I can't easily let go of my anger."

"…"

"I become furious every time I think about that day. Why should Dokja-ssi
decide our lives? We aren't Dokja-ssi's pets to be raised."

"…I'm sorry."

"Even if Dokja-ssi doesn't help, our lives are what we decide."

I couldn't fathom the extent of Jung Heewon's scar. Maybe it wasn't only
Jung Heewon. I didn't know what the past three years had been like for the
party members.

"Thus, this is my decision."

Jung Heewon bowed her head. Her shoulders were trembling. The moment
I approached, Jung Heewon raised her head and looked at me. The tough
swordsman was looking at me with faintly red eyes.

[Incarnation 'Jung Heewon' has joined the nebula 'Kim Dokja's Company'.]

[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' respects the opinion of her
incarnation.]

I bit my lips as I faced those eyes. Then I barely smiled. "Thank you,
Heewon-ssi."

Jung Heewon smiled slightly.

The second one was Lee Hyunsung. "I also have many words but…
Heewon-ssi has mentioned everything."

"Then why didn't you say it first?"
"I'm not very eloquent… In fact, I wanted to quit my job."

[Incarnation 'Lee Hyunsung' has joined the nebula 'Kim Dokja's Company'.]

[The constellation 'Master of Steel' respects the opinion of his
constellation.]

Then Lee Jihye was next. "Ugh, I hate this atmosphere. Quickly change it!"

[Incarnation 'Lee Jihye' has joined the nebula 'Kim Dokja's Company'.]

[The constellation 'Maritime War God' respects the opinion of his
constellation.]

Lee Seolhwa also smiled. "In fact, I joined through Joonghyuk-ssi
yesterday."

[The constellation 'Guam Divine Doctor' is nodding.]

Shin Yoosung and Lee Gilyoung hung onto me. "Us as well, ahjussi!"

I checked the list and it was true. These three people had already joined my
nebula.

As everyone was checking the nebula message above their heads, only one
person was gazing at me. A few party members were also glancing over
there. Only one person among the group hadn't joined the nebula.

Han Sooyoung paused before speaking. "I'll do it just this once, you idiot."

[Incarnation 'Han Sooyoung' has joined the nebula 'Kim Dokja's
Company'.]

[The constellation 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' is grumbling but respects
the opinion of his incarnation.]
"Instead, change the name at a later date. It will be the Han Sooyoung
Corporation."

I bowed at the party members and looked back at Youngki.

[Hmmm, it seems you are done. Then I'll ask you. Would the nebula 'Kim
Dokja's Company' like to challenge the scenario with the nebula
qualification?]

I nodded. Youngki smiled and continued.

[It isn't fun for a lot of people to enter at once so I'll divide the party.]

Something was weird. We had a lot of people so the party would be
divided? There was no such thing in the original 46th scenario.

Youngki's expression was weird. His forehead was strangely sweaty.

–I'm sorry Kim Dokja.

…What?

[The nebula 'Papyrus' disapproves of your challenge!]

[Many nebulae are frowning at your challenge!]

I seemed to understand what was going on.

…These jerks, they were going to bother me to the end?

I shouted at the party members. "Keep this in mind! Never touch the
'star'…!"

There was a dazzling light and the scene in front of me started to change.

[Your nebula has met the criteria to participate.]
[Going to the 46th scenario area.]

[A room will be allocated to the participants.]

At the same time, the scenario contents appeared in the air.


  [Main Scenario #46 - Proof of the Stars]

  Category: Main

  Difficulty: ???

  Clear Conditions: Acquire and use the 'star' in the center of the room or
  prevent the other party from obtaining the 'star' within the time limit. If
  one of the two conditions were met, the scenario would be
  automatically cleared.

  Time Limit: 3 hours.

  Compensation: Check the additional message.

  Failure: Conditional death


Youngki's voice followed.
[I'll put together something very special for your companionship.]

I opened my eyes and stood alone in a white room. In the center of the
room, there was a star floating on top of a small marble pedestal.

[Oops, one room is wrongly assigned. Haha, it can't be helped! I wish all of
you the blessing of the story.]
Then another person was summoned to the other side of the room. I rubbed
my eyes as I gazed at the person standing opposite me with a dreadful
expression.

"…I guess this is the wrongly assigned room."

[The rewards for the star in the room will be revealed!]


  [Star Reward]

  Choice 1. If you acquire or use the 'star' before your opponent, you can
  acquire all the skills and stories of the opponent.

  Choice 2. If you acquire or use the 'star' before your opponent, you can
  have indefinite life or death rights over your opponent.

  Choice 3…


I didn't read the rest of the compensation and waved my hand to the other
person.

"Hey, you know what to do? As you know, this scenario… ah!"

I stopped talking and started running towards the star. Yoo Joonghyuk, who
already arrived at the center of the room, was reaching for the star.
          Chapter 310: Ep. 59 - Kim Dokja's Company, I


"Yoo Joonghyuk, you are crazy!"

I shouted while hurriedly running towards Yoo Joonghyuk. I was so
surprised that I couldn't control the power of my skills. Way of the Wind
and Electrification were activated at the same time through Bookmark and
collided with Yoo Joonghyuk's body.

The power of the Purest Sword Force dyed the air and the star on the
pedestal rolled to the ground. Yoo Joonghyuk was hit by my magic power
and spoke without looking at me. "Get out of the way."

"What get out of the way? Are you really crazy?"

I was dumbfounded. Other characters might not know anything but Yoo
Joonghyuk, who knew everything, wanted to touch the star. It was
unbelievable.
"Don't you know what the 46th scenario is? Haven't you read the scenario
properly?"

Of course, I couldn't read the scenario properly because of Yoo Joonghyuk.

"I read it."

"It is over if you touch it!"

"Not really. Most people acquire a star and move onto the next scenario."

Yoo Joonghyuk slowly gazed at me. I couldn't feel any agitation from his
expression. This wasn't the first time he did the 46th scenario.

「 In the 46th scenario, only those who are part of the same nebula or have
been recognized as 'colleagues' would participate together. 」

In the previous round, Yoo Joonghyuk calculated everything and jumped to
the 46th scenario. He didn't want to be restricted so he didn't join a big
nebula. Instead, he picked companions and challenged the scenario. He also
used the information given to him by the 41st regression Shin Yoosung.

However, there was one existence that Yoo Joonghyuk didn't expect. A
person who adapted to the new future changed by Yoo Joonghyuk and
appeared as Yoo Joonghyuk's companion.

「 "I believe in you, Yoo Joonghyuk." 」

Prophet Anna Croft. In the past round, she was Yoo Joonghyuk's
companion.

I blocked his hand and called out, "Yoo Joonghyuk."

I thought it would be fine. I thought it would be different from the previous
lives that he lived. We came to this place by saving each other's lives
several times and I thought there must be some type of trust between us.
"I'm not Anna Croft. I won't betray you."

「 "I believed you wouldn't betray me." 」

Yoo Joonghyuk failed the 46th scenario thanks to Anna Croft. He lost his
party members and everything he had. Yoo Joonghyuk survived but he
didn't survive. After losing everything to Anna Croft in the 46th scenario
and having his existence given to her, he lived like a slave until he died.

Yoo Joonghyuk stared at me.

"Kim Dokja, you said you are a prophet." The expression on Yoo
Joonghyuk's face was cold. "I don't like you. It was like this from the
beginning."

Transcendent energy rose from Yoo Joonghyuk's body. The Black
Heavenly
Demon Sword didn't hesitate even a bit and I also raised the power of
Electrification to the limit. My body bounced like a warm as shock waves
were felt.

Now I was really angry. "You son of a bitch―!"

[The status of the demon king has opened!]

It was Demon King Transformation combined with Electrification. I
focused all my power and responded to Yoo Joonghyuk. It was the opening
of the second round that we didn't finish the other day.

The star was rolling around from the collision and I shouted. "You reached
all this way and you're just going to give up? Do you covet my skills and
stories that much?"

Yoo Joonghyuk didn't answer. I bit my lips as I swung my sword.
Unbroken Faith and the Black Heavenly Demon Sword collided and
created an earsplitting sound.
.

…Yes, it wasn't that I didn't understand. Yoo Joonghyuk was betrayed by
the prophet in the last round. Thus, the strength he desired most must be the
power of prophecy itself. In addition, he still misunderstood me as a
prophet.

「 Kim Dok ja is a fo ol. 」

What?


[The exclusive skill 'Fourth Wall' is activated!]

[The 'Fourth Wall' is shaking and smiling.]

My head instantly turned cold like cold water was poured on me. Was Yoo
Joonghyuk really trying to kill me because I was a prophet? Was he doing
this to gain my skills and stories?

.

…Had he postponed everything only for this moment?

[There are unread messages left in Midday Tryst.]

An item with the traces of the past three years. I blocked Yoo Joonghyuk's
sword while opening Midday Tryst.

[There are ??? unread messages.]

[The messages can't be read because they are corrupted.]

Damn…

「 Shoul d I he lp? 」
At these words, the messages in my mind started to be sorted.

[The corrupted messages will be recovered in an incomplete manner with
the power of Fourth Wall.]

The messages left by Yoo Joonghyuk started to play in an incomplete
manner through the Fourth Wall's mouth.

「Lee Gil young and Shin Yoo sung, annoy ing kids. 」

「 Lee Hyun sung is a stu pid sol dier. 」

They were funny messages. Did this brat use a chat window as a notepad?

「It is bad be tween Jung Hee won and Han Soo young. 」

「 Lee Ji hye's head is not go od. 」

「 Yoo Sang ah does not ha ve to do this. 」

He only wrote bad things about the party members. However, I knew Yoo
Joonghyuk. Yoo Joonghyuk was a person who didn't mention anyone he
was uninterested in.

「 Kim Dok ja. 」

I instantly became dizzy, like I had been hit on the head with a hammer.
"Yoo Joonghyuk, you now…"

In the first place, this scenario could only be activated when recognized as a
'companion'. If he hadn't trusted me and recognized me as a colleague, he
couldn't enter this scenario.

[Your understanding of the character 'Yoo Joonghyuk' is increasing
explosively.]

[The exclusive skill, 'Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint' has been activated!]
I stared at Yoo Joonghyuk in a daze. Yoo Joonghyuk didn't want my skills
or stories. Finally, he opened his mouth. "My indulgence is up to here."

The Black Heavenly Demon Sword pointed at my neck. "You have
been acting freely in the last three years. You can't do that again." "It
was necessary. It was unavoidable to go to the ■■!"

"Nobody knows if your pursuit of the ■■ is right or not."

"So you want the right over my life and death?"

A calm anger flared in Yoo Joonghyuk's eyes. "At least this way, you won't
be willing to sacrifice yourself again and the others… they won't do
anything unnecessary."

The Fourth Wall continued to read sentences from Midday Tryst.

「 Lee Ji hye ta kes her life light ly. 」

「 Lee Hyun sung deliber ately jump ed in to the mon sters. 」

I realized the 'unnecessary' things the party members had been doing. I
declared, "I will never do such a thing again."

"…"

"Who wants to die? I don't want to either."

Yoo Joonghyuk didn't remove the sword aimed at me. His eyes showed he
didn't believe my words. In the end, I had to change the direction of my
persuasion.

"Yoo Joonghyuk, if you touch the star, you can gain the my 'life and
death rights' but you will also get the traitor story." The traitor story.
"Once you get that story, you won't be trusted by the party members even if
you go to the following scenario. No one will believe you anymore. Do you
want to live like that?"

No one wanted to be hated. It was the same for the cold-blooded regressor,
Yoo Joonghyuk. Especially if it was the Yoo Joonghyuk who had
companions.

"It doesn't matter."

"What?"

Yoo Joonghyuk looked at me. His thoughts were heard through Omniscient
Reader's Viewpoint.

「 …It would've been better if I was like you. 」

The Yoo Joonghyuk I knew would've never done this. My feet hardened as
Yoo Joonghyuk moved towards the star. Everything around us slowed as if
someone had pulled the anode of time.

–By the way, is the Yoo Joonghyuk of your world okay?

The voice of the 1863rd Han Sooyoung was heard.

–This Yoo Joonghyuk is a worn-out person but is the 3rd round Yoo
Joonghyuk still right in the head? He will surely be broken if someone like
you shows up.

The expression on Yoo Joonghyuk's face as he reached towards the star
wasn't that of the main character. This was no longer the proud and
confident Yoo Joonghyuk that I remembered. Rather, Yoo Joonghyuk was
frightened by something.

「 This world needs Kim Dokja. 」
「 And the other party members… 」

「 I'm not the one who can clear the scenarios to the end. 」

The Fourth Wall said. 「 You want ed this to o. 」

My ears were buzzing as the things I had done so far passed through my
head. The history where I obtained the things that Yoo Joonghyuk
should've got and took the places where Yoo Joonghyuk's should've
climbed flowed like a panorama.

「 "I am Yoo Joonghyuk." 」

The words that were uttered as a joke were returned to me. The history that
I took away without thinking made the present Yoo Joonghyuk.

「 You want ed to be the ma in charac ter. 」

No.


The Fourth Wall said. 「 You are Yoo Joonghyuk.

」 I wasn't Yoo Joonghyuk.

「 Kim Dokja is Yoo Joonghyuk. 」

I didn't want to be the main character.

「 Th en why ha ve you be en do ing the scena rios so far? 」

Why have I been doing the scenarios? I could see Yoo Joonghyuk reaching
towards the star. I muttered inwardly. I couldn't explain in words why I was
clearing the scenarios.

[The 'Fourth Wall' is causing an unknown reaction.]
I heard a sound in my head. It was the sound of something solid cracking. I
listened to the sound as I ran towards Yoo Joonghyuk. As if he had been
waiting, Yoo Joonghyuk turned towards me.

The transcendent power that had matured. Over the past three years, Yoo
Joonghyuk had become stronger.

[The character 'Yoo Joonghyuk' is telling the giant story 'Demon Realm's
Spring'.]

"You aren't my opponent."

"Maybe that is true." During my trip to the 1863rd round, Yoo Joonghyuk
became strong enough that perhaps I couldn't win against him. I didn't
understand how such a strong person could be lacking confidence.
"However, I know a person who can beat you."

Yoo Joonghyuk was afraid. The information he received from the 41st
regression Shin Yoosung would soon run out. He would be starting a story
he didn't know.

[You have received the story reward given for the Outer World Covenant.]
Thus, I had to let him know.

You aren't only this much. The place you can reach isn't only the 41st
round.

[You have earned the 'myth'-grade story!]

[The story has been handed down to you by someone.]

There was a dazzling light as the messages exploded in my head.

[The myth-grade story 'A Single Story' is responding to your level!]

[The myth-grade story is sufficient to replace the giant story!]
[The 'succession' portion of your first myth-grade story has been
completed!]

[Part of the story is lost during the transmission and the 'succession' couldn't
be completed.]

[Acquire other myth rated stories or giant stories.]

…Obtaining this story wasn't part of my original plan. I didn't know I
would get this story in the 1863rd round. In any case, the situation was like
this so it wouldn't be bad to use the story.

[The size of the story has gone beyond your capacity to tell it.]

[At your Reading Comprehension level, you can only interpret part of the
story.]

I got a nosebleed and my body trembled like it was electrocuted. Dark
shadows flocked around me and Yoo Joonghyuk. The scenery of the room
changed and I could smell sulfur. Hot hellfire and blood covered the floor.

I could hear Yoo Joonghyuk's confused voice. I didn't respond to him and
just gazed at the countless shadows around me.

[Measuring the number of rounds possible with your Reading
Comprehension level.]

Numbers quickly passed before my eyes.

[The maximum number of times you can read 'Yoo Joonghyuk' is up to the
'41st round'.]

[Do you want to select the 41st round?]

I slowly nodded and Yoo Joonghyuk's emotions filled my head. Terrible
despair and helplessness. Emotions that were worn out from the scenarios.
A crazy depression attacked me and the sound of derisive laughter could be
heard. I endured all of it.

[The talent of 'Yoo Joonghyuk' in that round is attracted to you.]

In the midst of this distant feeling of loneliness, a shadow was watching
me. The 41st round Yoo Joonghyuk. The cruel man who sent Shin Yoosung
to his past.

He spoke to me, 「 My specialty is the spear. 」

A spear that existed in the dark shadow appeared in front of my eyes. I
didn't hesitate to grab the spear.

[The story 'Hell of Eternity' has begun.]
          Chapter 311: Ep. 59 - Kim Dokja's Company, II


The story, Hell of Eternity. It was a story the 1863rd Yoo Joonghyuk
passed to me.

[Many constellations are astounded by your story.]

[The nebula 'Asgard' is focused on your story.]

[The nebula 'Vedas' is focused on your story.]

A story that drew the attention of the nebulae. It wasn't strange. This was a
myth-grade story and had enough destructive power to replace some of the
giant stories. There was a ripple in Yoo Joonghyuk's eyes.

"How…?"

Hell of Eternity was a story that allowed me to borrow the 'history' that Yoo
Joonghyuk had accumulated through 1863 rounds.
I felt a power that wasn't mine from the spear held in my hand. I couldn't
borrow the skills or stigma of Yoo Joonghyuk with this story. However, the
real strength of Yoo Joonghyuk didn't come from the system. It was
embodied through the transcendental training.

「 In order to hold that spear, Yoo Joonghyuk trained with a single focus
for decades. 」

The 41st round Yoo Joonghyuk.

Rather than look for the Breaking the Sky Sword Saint, he found a legacy
of the vanished Zero Murim. It was a world of martial arts that had been
destroyed a long time ago.

Soul Killing Spear. The martial arts that were comparable to the Breaking
the Sky Swordsmanship, the strongest martial arts of Murim.

Yoo Joonghyuk of the 41st round had destroyed the returnees with this
spear. The 3rd round Yoo Joonghyuk would probably recognize this power.
It was one of the achievements he had in mind.

"Yes, this is the power you've been trying to learn."

I spoke with a stiff expression. The hand holding the spear trembled like it
was caught in a heavy wind. It was due to excessive integration. It was only
the 41st round. The 41st round Yoo Joonghyuk had already reached this
level.

This was the power that the human Yoo Joonghyuk accumulated through
his life that went beyond skills and stamina. This was the status of a
transcendent.

I felt like I was going to faint from dizziness but held on. The mental load
was greater than the physical burden. However, if this load was only
mental…
[The exclusive skill, 'Fourth Wall' is in action!]

I could hold out somehow. "Bring it on, Yoo Joonghyuk."

The story version of Yoo Joonghyuk took a stance. It would've been better
if I had a star relic like Harmony Fox Halberd or White Lightning God
Spear but for now, this 'shadow spear' was sufficient.

The fictional 41st round character summoned by me spoke.

「 You are weak. It is good to regress. 」

Yoo Joonghyuk was weakened. Perhaps I was the one who weakened him.

"If you don't do it correctly, I will kill you."

A torrent of transcendent power rushed from Yoo Joonghyuk's body. Yoo
Joonghyuk noticed that I was serious. We rushed towards each other
without needing to be told.

Our statuses collided and caused a roar. Beyond the towering dust cloud,
the
Soul Killing Spear divided into hundreds of different branches. The
Breaking the Sky Swordsmanship started to be pushed by the offensive of
the Soul Killing Spear.

It wasn't a skill or a stigma. It was a history made by the efforts of 41
regressions.

The Soul Killing Spear exploded and wounds appeared all over Yoo
Joonghyuk's body.

"Is this all you can do? Three years have passed but it is only this much."

I was breathless and dizzy from my magic power being exhausted.
Nevertheless, I kept talking. I spat out inflammatory words in order to
provoke him. Yoo Joonghyuk's thoughts floated through the air.
「 What would it be like if I had won the Absolute Throne at the time? 」

In the midst of this overflowing regret, Yoo Joonghyuk stepped back again.

「 If only I had tried more. 」

Step back, step back. After the constant retreat, Yoo Joonghyuk reached a
dead end as always.

A wall with no more place to retreat.

I stabbed the spear towards Yoo Joonghyuk. The spearman spoke as he
rushed towards Yoo Joonghyuk.

「 No, you tried. 」

Yoo Joonghyuk's eyes grew bigger as he narrowly avoided the spear. Yoo
Joonghyuk shuddered as he stared at the spear stuck in the wall. The
spearman kept speaking.

「 It wasn't enough. 」

Yoo Joonghyuk's trembling slowly subsided. His shaking eyes sunk and a
cold image flickered in his retina.

[The story 'Hell of Eternity' has affected the incarnation 'Yoo Joonghyuk'.]

Yoo Joonghyuk raised his sword again. As the spearman's split apart the
air, the Breaking the Sky Swordsmanship overlapped with its trajectory.
Blue sparks flashed and Yoo Joonghyuk stared at the spearman rather than
me. The number of collisions increased and the time and space around us
changed.

The time of transcendence was opening.

「 You sent me Shin Yoosung. 」
「 That's right. 」

Yoo Joonghyuk kept wielding his sword. It was a swordsmanship that was
more unrefined than earlier.

The trajectory was immature and clumsy. The Breaking the Sky
Swordsmanship that was on the verge of completion was falling apart
again.

Yoo Joonghyuk asked, 「 Can I become this powerful after going through
41 rounds? 」

「 To be exact, it was only this much. 」

In order to transcend transcendence, one must have the courage to abandon
the framework.

Like an architect breaking the castle because of a window frame, a
persistent obsession and desire for perfection became the key to open a new
transcendence.

Then Yoo Joonghyuk chose his road. Every time he encountered the Soul
Killing Spear, the shape of the Breaking the Sky Swordsmanship collapsed.

The trajectory changed, causing the meaning to change. Ultimately, the
power of transcendence followed the grains of the story he pursued. Yoo
Joonghyuk's history became stronger every time we faced a huge challenge.
That history was once again preparing for a jump forward.

「 Become stronger, Yoo Joonghyuk. 」

Yoo Joonghyuk and Yoo Joonghyuk were talking.

[The constellation 'Demon King of Salvation' is looking at incarnation Yoo
Joonghyuk.]
Perhaps this was my role. Once he reached a certain phase of his life, Yoo
Joonghyuk looked inside himself. I looked at such a Yoo Joonghyuk and
thought about myself.

I couldn't be the protagonist. I couldn't save someone else. Still, at least I
knew the story and could tell the story. All the strokes of the spear
contained the sentences I read.

From the terrible 3rd round through to the 41st round. In addition, the
1863rd round that was like hell. I read every sentence without fail.

–Ahhhhhhh!

Within the clash, Yoo Joonghyuk was living different threats. Just as I lived
through Ways of Survival, Yoo Joonghyuk experience a life he hadn't lived.
Yoo Joonghyuk of the 3rd round was growing thanks to the 41st round.

[The character 'Yoo Joonghyuk' is staring at the story of Hell of Eternity.]

Human beings couldn't be saved by others. They could only save
themselves. The thing I could do for others was to play the role of a bridge
at best.

"All of you have failed." Yoo Joonghyuk said. "I won't listen to the advice
of those who have failed."

Finally, it was the Yoo Joonghyuk that I knew. The trajectory of the
evolved
Breaking the Sky Swordsmanship followed the flow of the Soul Killing
Spear. His persistent sword destroyed the shadow of the spear, breaking the
link that followed.

Yoo Joonghyuk was frustrated but he didn't give up. Even if the despair
didn't stop and everything collapsed, he would once again pick up the first
building block.
「 I am Yoo Joonghyuk. 」

"No." Finally, he surpassed himself. "I am Yoo Joonghyuk."

The explosion scattered through every corner of the room.

[The story 'Hell of Eternity' has finished.]

The burning hell disappeared and the bloody scent became dull. In the dirt
and the dust, the blade of the Black Heavenly Demon Sword touched my
throat. At almost the same time, the Unbroken Faith that I stretched out and
reached his chest.

[The constellation 'Maritime War God' truly feels admiration.]

[The constellation 'One who Overcomes the Late Trials' is paying tribute to
you.]

[The constellation 'Last Hero of Hwangsanbeol' admires the true
confrontation.]

Time passed and only breathing sounds filled the area. In the stillness that
was intermittently broken, Yoo Joonghyuk stared at me. Yoo Joonghyuk of
the 3rd round had exceeded the 41st round and declared, "I won."

I smiled. "What are you saying? I won."

The star rolling on the ground shone brightly.

[The scenario's time limit has ended.]

Like a blessing, the star burst apart in the air and scattered a silver light. We
looked up blankly at the light.

[The room star has failed to be acquired.]

[Nobody hurt their companion.]
The 46th main scenario, Proof of the Stars. The scenario could be cleared
properly when all the participants didn't harm each other.

[You have proven your 'trust'.]

However, those who had reached the 46th scenario didn't think it could be
cleared this way.

Up to now had been a world of constellations. Finally, there was no
incarnation that would abandon the opportunity to grow their strength.

One star was born and another star would die. In addition, there would be
no one to share the light.

[You have acquired a new story!]

[You have met the conditions to clear the scenario.]

Once we came to our senses, we were lying on the floor like we had made a
promise. It was because Yoo Joonghyuk and I had reached our limits. The
fuses of our consciousness was cut off for a short time and came back. I
opened my eyes and could hear Yoo Joonghyuk murmuring. "…It is a
pity." "I agree. This was a good chance to get the story of the Supreme
King."

I didn't respond but laughter emerged. All the muscles of my body were
sore. I chewed on a few Great Return Pills that I secretly pulled out but the
restoration of my broken body was slower than I expected. Hell of Eternity
was a story that caused severe overload.

"You seem okay?"

"…"

Yoo Joonghyuk was breathing hard as he seemed to think of something.
Yoo Joonghyuk had probably reached a new ground due to the
enlightenment he just gained. This was the thing called talent. I was
envious. Well, he was the protagonist.

The silent protagonist opened his mouth. "You said you went to another
world line."

I wondered why he hadn't asked before.

"What round was it?"

"The 1863rd round."

Was the number too big? Yoo Joonghyuk was silent for a moment. "The me
in that world gave you the story?"

"That's right."

Yoo Joonghyuk didn't ask for further details. He thought about something
for a while before asking, "That me… did I fail?"

I looked up at the air. "You succeeded."

I could feel Yoo Joonghyuk stiffening.

[The 'Fourth Wall' is shimmering faintly.]

Yoo Joonghyuk of the 1863rd round, who went beyond the original novel
and left to find his own story. I was reminded of that Yoo Joonghyuk's last
appearance. "He'll be able to reach the end of the scenario. Maybe it is an
ending I don't know."

"…You didn't check it properly."

"If I checked it, I wouldn't have returned."

"It wouldn't be so bad to see the end in that place."
"That wasn't my world." I looked at the empty space. "My world is here."

Yoo Joonghyuk was silent for a long time. I licked my lips and laughed.
"This place has my incarnation Yoosung, my colleague Yoo Sangah, Han
Sooyoung who hasn't blackened yet, my mother…"

"Don't feel joyful. It isn't over yet."

Then the voice of a dokkaebi was heard in the air.

[Geez, one room is already over. [Hihi, truly… it was a thrilling battle that
the scenario anticipated!]

It wasn't Youngki. There were a number of dokkaebis handling the scenario
so their responsibilities had probably changed. I struggled to get up. Yoo
Joonghyuk was right. This scenario wasn't over yet. Yoo Joonghyuk said.
"The other rooms entered later than us."

In fact, the following message was in front of our eyes.

[Currently waiting for the remaining nebula members to clear the scenario.]

Then Youngki's voice was heard.


[For those who have satisfied the clear conditions, I'll show you the scenery
of another room!]

Along with the message, a few screens popped in front of us. This was
followed by numerous indirect messages entering my ears.

[The demon king 'Ruler of the East Hell' is watching the clash between two
constellations.]

[The demon king 'Black Mane Lion' is deeply interested in the battle.]
[The constellation 'Guardian of Youths and Travel' is focused on the
battlefield.]

[The constellation 'Friend of Justice and Harmony' has an anxious
expression.]

[The constellation 'Twisted Head of Calamity' wishes for the victory of a
friend.]

They were all modifiers difficult to gather in one place. I fixed my gaze on
one of the screens that had emerged. Why were these bigshots gathered?

…Dammit, this was what happened. Black and red waves of magic power
were colliding on the screen. It was a feast of magic power that filled the
room. There was a hellfire that melted everything and black flames with
formidable destructive power. The mere sight made me feel like my body
would burn from the heat.

The two most terrible constellations I knew. The incarnations of these
constellations were fighting.

Abyssal Black Flame Dragon and Demon-like Judge of Fire.

A dokkaebi's laugh was heard.

[The wrong that was wrongly assigned will probably end in a bland way.]
There was an explosion of red magic power and everything in the room
burned. Pale shadows shook in the hazy field of view.

Flesh was sharply torn and blood flowed. Someone's body was slowly
falling down in the smoke.
         Chapter 312: Ep. 59 - Kim Dokja's Company, III


Fragments of the ceiling fell as Jung Heewon quietly stared through the
dust. She could see the collapsed Han Sooyoung through her blurred vision.

Judge of Evil and Black Flames Demon Ruler. Demon-like Judge of Fire
and Abyssal Black Flame Dragon.

It was a battle that almost all the constellations on the Korean Peninsula
looked forward to but the expressions of the parties involved weren't
pleasant at all. Jung Heewon stepped through the dirt and pointed the
Sword of Judgment at Han Sooyoung. "Why don't you stop acting?"

Han Sooyoung scattered into powder. There was a sharp ripple. Jung
Heewon reflexively twisted her body and stabbed the sword behind her.
There was the sound of metal being struck. Han Sooyoung untied the
bandage around her right hand while the Sword of Judgment pierced
through the darkness.

"…You weren't fooled?"
"I know you have the Avatar skill." A white light emerged from the Sword
of Judgment. "You are the First Apostle."

Their status collided with each other and both people fell at the same time.
Jung Heewon's eyes were red after she triggered Demon Slaying. It
strengthened the user's attack power but also heightened their uneasy
emotions. The grief and anger amplified.

"It was you who attacked the people of Chungmuro."

The battle of Chungmuro when the flag war was in full swing. It was the
first time Han Sooyoung met the party members.

"At that time, Jihye and Gilyoung almost died."

"…You aren't the one who almost died so why are you so angry? You
weren't even there at the time."

"I am angry because I wasn't there. If I was, I wouldn't have left you alone."

Lights were shining in the air and the things that happened during the flag
battle was projected as holographic images. Perhaps it was a service from
the dokkaebis for the constellations who weren't in the channel at the time.
The appearance of Lee Jihye and Lee Gilyoung as they were terribly hurt
by the apostles was shown. Han Sooyoung seemed like she was going to be
sick. "Then are you going to kill me now?"

"I can't trust you."

Han Sooyoung bit her lips. She also understood that Jung Heewon's anger
was reasonable. Certainly, she was the First Apostle and at one time, the
enemy of the party.

It happened one day two years ago. The rumour that Han Sooyoung was the
First Apostle spread. It was unknown why the rumour spread. One thing
was for certain. Han Sooyoung didn't deny the rumour. It might've been due
to guilt or it could've been a cowardly heart. Han Sooyoung didn't know
either.

The only thing she knew was the attitude of the party members towards her.
–Well, it is a thing of the past.

–Really? Noona was the person who talked with your head cut off? How
amazing.

Lee Jihye and Lee Gilyoung were the ones who suffered the most during
the flag battle but they didn't care at all. Yoo Sangah was already aware
Han Sooyoung was the First Apostle and closed her eyes, while Yoo
Joonghyuk didn't mind. However, Jung Heewon was different. "You have
to atone properly."

"Why are you―"

"If you continue roughly like this, what about the scars the kids received?"

"…"

In order to make everyone happy, there were things they put up with
because they didn't want to break the harmony. This was especially true for
people who kept an eye on the surroundings.

"Han Sooyoung, if you're an adult then you should act your age. Don't be
immature."

[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' is nodding.]

Han Sooyoung's eyes became ferocious.

[The constellation 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' is angry.]

"This person, do you think you're the apostle of justice? It is good to
pretend to be cool but think about the time and place. Would Kim Dokja
like what you are doing now?"
"It has nothing to do with Kim Dokja."

"You said it with your own mouth. You will be Kim Dokja's sword."

For the first time, Jung Heewon fell silent. Han Sooyoung ridiculed her.
"As a sword, shouldn't you move as your master tells you?"

"I'm sorry." The dust on the floor sparked. The air burned wherever Jung
Heewon's sword passed through. "This sword is selfish."

Jung Heewon activated Hell Flames Ignition. "I will decide who I cut."

The Sword of Judgment aimed at Han Sooyoung.

"Now your mischief is over, Han Sooyoung. Bring out all your power."

[The character 'Jung Heewon' has requested the activation of Judgment
Time!]




I watched the black flames and hell flames filling the screen and sighed.
"… That's why they are fighting."

I thought it was time. Han Sooyoung's identity had been concealed for a
long time but there was no way it could be maintained forever. Rather, it
might be fortunate that the secret was revealed before going to the 47th
scenario. This scenario didn't mean anything unless they were honest with
each other. The hidden secrets exposed to the dokkaebis would become
materials on the screen.

Yoo Joonghyuk asked, "Aren't you going?"

I could intervene using Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint. Jung Heewon's
confused voice was heard from the screen.
[Some constellations of the absolute good system have opposed the
request.]

[The activation of Judgment Time is cancelled!]

I glanced over and Yoo Joonghyuk was watching me. "…I can't leave it
alone."

Of course, I didn't intend to interfere in the fight between the two of them.
However, I wanted to prevent their battle from spreading to their
constellations.

[The demon king 'Demon King of Salvation' doesn't want the constellations
to intervene in the fight between incarnations.]

[The constellation 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' is dissatisfied with your
intervention.]

[The constellation 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' is reluctantly convinced.]

[The constellation 'Scribe of Heaven' agrees with your thoughts.]

There was no answer from Uriel. She wasn't allowed access to this channel
yet.

Yoo Joonghyuk said. "One of them could die."

"No, that won't happen."

"You don't know the past three years. The relationship between the two of
them is really bad."

"Yes, I can see."

I was unconcerned and Yoo Joonghyuk frowned. "Do you want your
colleagues to die?"
"No."

"Or did you see the future through the power of prophecy?"

"I don't have the power of prophecy. Do you still believe in something like
that?"

I watched Jung Heewon and Han Sooyoung fighting on the screen. Then
Yoo Joonghyuk coldly replied, "It is a situation where future information is
actively used to calculate everything. There is no room for the faith of
humans to intervene."

It had been a while since he spoke so much. Certainly, my current
appearance looked like I had no countermeasures.

Thinking about it, I had a similar conversation with Han Sooyoung of the
1863rd round. Han Sooyoung used Anticipation Plagiarism and collected,
calculated and read the future while collaborating with the 1863rd round
Yoo Joonghyuk. I had asked Han Sooyoung,

「 "It doesn't make sense no matter how I think about it." 」

Anticipation Plagiarism was a good story and Yoo Joonghyuk's knowledge
was useful. Even so, it was impossible to save everyone up to the 95th
scenario, including Kim Namwoon. Numerous variables would've occurred
from changing the story and unexpected things would've happened.

No matter how great Han Sooyoung and Yoo Joonghyuk were, they weren't
the writers of Ways of Survival. Not everything could be absolutely
controlled. Failure was expected.

「 "How did you get here? Tell me honestly. Is there another secret?" 」

Han Sooyoung looked at me like she was either pitying me or laughing at
me.
「 "I believed." 」

「 "What?" 」

「 "I believed in the characters I created. That's all." 」

This was the answer of the plagiarist write, although I couldn't remember it
well. I told Yoo Joonghyuk.

"Yoo Joonghyuk, I believe in humans."

The sword and fist collided and the flames melted everything around them.
I watched Jung Heewon and Han Sooyoung bleeding, shouting and rushing
at each other. I looked at them and had a faint understanding of the secret
behind Han Sooyoung reaching the 95th scenario.

"I believe in the story they had built."

There was another deafening roar from the screen. The two people gasped
in the series of clashes. They rolled in the dust pit, striking the other
person's abdomen or cutting hair. Their blood clotted as their expressions
changed.

–You must be very upset about me.

–It isn't just that.

I seemed to hear their thoughts without using Omniscient Reader's
Viewpoint. It was the history of the two people who fought together until
now. The party members had survived unharmed for the past three years.
They wouldn't survive those three years without cooperation.

Dealing with the sasquatch in the 28th scenario. Catching the 'algonkin
snake' in the 35th scenario. The two people must've protected each other's
backs to survive. They saved each other's lives many times, pulling up each
other with tired hands.
Jung Heewon and Han Sooyoung also knew this.

–Just…

Jung Heewon was strong. Even if all the incarnations in the world were
counted, there were few incarnations who could surpass Jung Heewon.
However, her opponent was Han Sooyoung. In a situation where Judgment
Time is blocked, the outcome of this match was almost set.

–Please apologize properly to the children…

Jung Heewon staggered and fell forward. The hot temperature of the room
gradually cooled down. Han Sooyoung looked down at Jung Heewon's
fallen body and carried Jung Heewon on her back. She seemed to mumble
something but I couldn't hear Han Sooyoung's voice. Perhaps it was Han
Sooyoung's last pride.

There was a star glowing white at her feet. Han Sooyoung stared at the star
and kicked it with her feet.

[The scenario's time limit has ended.]

[Incarnation Han Sooyoung and Incarnation Jung Heewon have
demonstrated their 'trust'.]

Han Sooyoung raised her head and looked in my direction.

–…Is it fun to steal a look?

I turned my gaze towards other screens.

–Lee Gilyoung… do you surrender?

–I don't want to! Shin Yoosung, you surrender!

Lee Gilyoung and Shin Yoosung had entered a room and were crying while
pinching each other's arms. I turned my head again and saw a room with an
unusual landscape. Lee Jihye, Lee Seolhwa and Lee Hyunsung were
together.

–This room isn't fun. Right unni?

–…Yes.

–Hyunsung ahjussi! Stop picking your nose and get up. The time was up.

No one touched the star and it was just a shining decoration. It was so
peaceful I doubted it was a scenario.

[I'm sorry Constellations. I made a mistake when distributing the rooms…]

The misplaced room seemed to be over there.


[Incarnation Shin Yoosung and Incarnation Lee Gilyoung have
demonstrated
their 'trust'.]

[Incarnation Lee Hyunsung and Incarnation Lee Seolhwa have
demonstrated
their 'trust'.]

[All members of the nebula has met the scenario clear conditions.]

[Main scenario #46 - Context of the Constellation has been completed.]

[None of the nebula members have harmed each other.]

[Compensation for the clearance is prepared.]

No one had the same story. Everyone lived a different history and
understood things using different contexts.

There was a dazzling light and the party members were summoned. Shin
Yoosung, Lee Gilyoung, Lee Hyunsung, Lee Seolhwa, Lee Jihye, Han
Sooyoung, Jung Heewon…

They were the people who came here with me. The faces of the party
members changed as they saw us covered with wounds.

"Dokja-ssi."

"Unni, are you okay? How…"

The party members supported each other. Jung Heewon smiled faintly
while Han Sooyoung tapped the ground with her feet. I could see Han
Sooyoung smiling.

I raised my head and saw the sky opening. Someone sighed. "Ah…"

The sky of the Star Stream had unfolded. It was a marvellous cosmic scene.
At the overwhelming landscape, some people trembled. It was a deep
darkness with no end. The thing that couldn't be filled up was waiting for
us.

Shin Yoosung grabbed my right sleeve and Lee Gilyoung grabbed the
fingers of my left hand.

They were followed by Lee Jihye, Han Sooyoung, Lee Hyunsung and Jung
Heewon. Finally, Lee Seolhwa and Yoo Joonghyuk formed a circle around
us.

"…Isn't this similar to that squid in the past?"

There was fear in Lee Jihye's voice. I smiled and said, "That's right."

The next moment, a small star shone in the night sky.

「 Between salvation and the demon king. 」

With this light, several planets started to shine together.
「 Between the demon and judgment. 」

「 Between the steel and master. 」

「 Between the abyss and black flame dragon. 」

I saw the white lines connecting the empty universe. The stars, that seemed
like they would never meet each other, were facing each other. At this
moment, I understood the context of the modifiers. Perhaps the party
members felt the same way.

Shin Yoosung spoke. "Pretty."

There were stories between the stars.

[The nebula 'Kim Dokja's Company' has broken through the 46th scenario!]

There were still vacancies in the constellation of the nebula. One of the
vacant places belonged to Yoo Sangah.

I spoke to the people. "Let's go."

Our bodies rose into the air and we soon became light. The numerous stars
of the Star Stream passed by and the vast landscape of an interstellar city
was seen in the distance. It took me a long time but I eventually ended up
here.

Olympus. Vedas. Papyrus. The grudges were piled up in me. I hadn't
forgotten. Not at all.

Shadows were swaying in places where the blinding light diminished.
Surprisingly, someone was waiting for us at the entrance to the interstellar
city. A huge shadow swaying in the light spoke to me.

[Father.]
          Chapter 313: Ep. 59 - Kim Dokja's Company, IV


…Father? If I wasn't mistaken, the giant shadow's word was definitely
directed this way. The party members were staring at me with eyes full of
disbelief. I looked back at the shadow with bewilderment.

[Baat?]

The faint light coming from the entrance of the interstellar city revealed the
shadow.

[No, not that! Try again. 'Father'.]

[Baaaat?]

[No, it is Father. You really…]

The giant shadow wasn't a single creature. To be precise, there was a
creature the size of a soccer ball on the huge shadow.
"What are you doing?" My words caused Bihyung to look this way.

[…Uh. You're already here?]

The giant shadow was Bihyung, who had inflated his body like a giant. The
stronger the dokkaebi, the larger the body became. The fact that Bihyung
was this big showed he had reached a significant level in the bureau.
Wait… the reason for Bihyung's presence and the soccer ball…

"Biyoo!"

The cotton candy Biyoo flew through the air.

[Baaat!]

Biyoo came into my arms and rubbed against my cheeks. Something was
forming in her small eyes. I couldn't believe the child the size of a baseball
had become a soccer ball. Biyoo had grown up since the past.

"Did you wait long?"

A small hand popped out from the cotton candy and slapped me in the
cheek. I left her alone in front of the dimensional gate and deserved this
much punishment. I silently endured the ticklish touch. Tears fell as Biyoo
once again dug tighter into my chest. The children ran to me and touched
the fluffy Biyoo.

[Hum hum.]

I turned my head to see Bihyung waiting for me. I opened the dokkaebi
communication and spoke to Bihyung.

–What were you doing here?

–I have been waiting. A dokkaebi to take you to the 47th scenario zone was
needed.
–What is with your body size?

Bihyung ignored me and spoke to the party members.

[Everyone of Kim Dokja's Company. Do you know who I am? I am
Bihyung, branch manager of the

Korean Peninsula branch.]

Bihyung banged on his chest like he was showing off his thick muscles. He
made a production out of this.

[It seems like yesterday when the Korean Peninsula scenario first
began… now you've already come to the 47th scenario area.] Bihyung's
face was full of emotions.

[As you might know, the scenarios after the 47th scenario don't have to be
carried out in order. After entering the interstellar city, you can selectively
perform scenarios 48 to 65.]

Shin Yoosung raised her hand. "We can choose the scenario?"

[It is the so-called autonomous selection system. Hahaha!]

Nobody laughed. Bihyung shrugged. [Hum hum, anyway. It is up to you
which of the scenarios up to number 65 will be done first. You can do the
65th scenario at once or go through the scenarios to build up your 'status'.
In any case, you need a certain level of status to enter the scenario area after
number 65.]

Lee Hyunsung asked, "Then what will happen after the 66th scenario?"

[There will be a new explanation at that time. You can't go there now so
don't worry.]
It was a cold tone but Bihyung's expression to the party members wasn't
cold.

[Well, it took four years to get here… I don't know how much time it will
take in the future. Ah, not all of you went through the same four years.]
Bihyung grinned at me as he spoke.

[Let's go to the interstellar city. It will take around 10 minutes to complete
the transmission. Please prepare yourself. An amazing world is waiting for
you.]

The moment Bihyung;s words were over, Biyoo shouted. [Baaat!]

A gorgeous beam of light wrapped around our party members. We started
to fly towards the interstellar city. For safety reasons, the movement speed
was slower than expected. I didn't know when Biyoo would emerge from
my arms. Jung Heewon watched this scene and opened her mouth.

"Dokja-ssi. I have something to ask."

Jung Heewon's expression towards me was strange. The other party
members glanced at me like they knew what she was going to say.

"Where have you been in the past three years?"




During the journey to the interstellar city. I told the party members about
what happened in the 1863rd round. Of course, I didn't tell them everything
and only picked the points I could explain. As expected, the party members
noticed and were startled.

"Really? I survived to the 95th scenario?"
"…I can't believe it. That subway boy survived."

The excited Lee Jihye and Lee Hyunsung faced each other. Yoo Joonghyuk
listened silently to the story while Lee Gilyoung and Jung Heewon seemed
a bit sullen. It was natural for the people who didn't exist in that round to
feel so. It was Han Sooyoung who reacted the most.

"I was in that world?"

"Yes, you were. You were the leader."

"No, why…"

Something seemed to come to her and Han Sooyoung promptly sent a
message with Midday Tryst.

–Do you mean the Avatar I talked about before…

I nodded and Han Sooyoung made an expression of amazement. It would
be absurd for Han Sooyoung. The avatar split from her found a different
world line.

Jung Heewon looked closely at me and asked, "By the way, Dokja-ssi's coat
has changed a bit… did you take it from the 95th scenario?"

"Correct."

The only thing I took from the 1863rd scenario was this coat. Han
Sooyoung, who was staring at me carefully, put her hands into my coat's
pockets. Come to think of it, Han Sooyoung of the 1863rd round was like
this.

"Crazy… what did you bring back? Doesn't this violate probability?" Han
Sooyoung checked the items and her mouth dropped open. "…Hey. Can
you give me a few of these?"

"You're looking at it."
There were many different items that the 1863rd round Han Sooyoung
packed in the coat. Most of the items weren't needed yet in this round but
some items were useful enough. By the way, there was an unexpected item.

"What is this smartphone?"

It wasn't my smartphone. I turned on the smartphone and a photo with a
strange phase appeared on the main screen.

– Namwoon ♡ Jihye.

It was a photo of the smiling Kim Namwoon and frowning Lee Jihye. I
realized the owner of this smartphone. That reminded me, Kim Namwoon
once stole this coat and wore it.

Lee Jihye asked me with the same expression as herself on the screen.
"Ahjussi, what is this photo?"

"Uh, this… it was used by the child of that world. I must've brought it here
by mistake."

"Were we dating in that world?"

"No, he one-sidedly liked you."

"Phew, I see." Lee Jihye took the smartphone from my hand and opened the
gallery. "Wow, this photo is pretty good?"

…Photo? This time I was surprised and looked at the smartphone with the
party members.

"Look, Seolhwa unni and I… uh? There is also Han Donghoon? Isn't he in
the Ulsan Alliance?"

"Here is Hyunsung-ssi. However, it is cut off at his neck."
It was a group photo of the 1863rd round people smiling brightly. Lee
Seolhwa, Kim Namwoon, Lee Jihye, Han Donghoon, Lee Hyunsung… and
the emotionless man in the center.

Lee Jihye told me, "This is Master in that world? His face is injured? Isn't
he cooler than the one here?"

Everyone in the photo was smiling apart from the 1863rd Yoo Joonghyuk.
Yoo Joonghyuk was already looking over.

[The 'Fourth Wall' is shimmering faintly.]

No one here knew the life that Yoo Joonghyuk of that world had lived.

[The constellation 'Secretive Plotter' is looking at you.]

…No, there was one person. I looked up at the place where Secretive
Plotter would be watching among the stars of the Star Stream.

I still didn't know why Secretive Plotter made such an Outer World
Covenant. I didn't know why he reacted like that to my choice. I guessed a
few things but everything was just a hypothesis.

[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' is looking at you.]

[The constellation 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' is looking at you.]

The interstellar city 'Context of the Constellations' was a transit station that
led to the worlds of other constellations. I felt that my physical distance
from the constellations was gradually getting closer.

[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' is welcoming you.]

The punishment seemed to finally be released and Uriel also sent an
indirect message. In the midst of a brilliant light, our bodies entered the
city.
[You have entered the interstellar city 'Context of the Constellations'.]

[A new main scenario is waiting.]

The place we landed was a huge city square. Some incarnations glanced
this way but none of them paid attention to us. This city's scale was
different from where we had stayed so far. It was natural.

I spoke to the people, "Everyone knows why we came here?"

From now on, the enemies we were dealing with were thousands of years
old. Jung Heewon nodded and wondered, "We came to play with Olympus
right?"

"Do you have a separate plan? Perhaps a full-scale war…"

I answered Lee Hyunsung's question. "I'm not thinking of a full-scale war.
Olympus is one of the biggest nebulas in the entire Star Stream.

The odds of Kim Dokja's Company winning in a head-on confrontation
against Olympus was almost zero.

"I want to visit Olympus. They have to take responsibility for making Yoo
Sangah that way. There will definitely be a way to save her."

Currently, Yoo Sangah was stuck in the flow of consciousness. After three
months, all the stories would disappear from Yoo Sangah's body and her
empty soul would disappear into the void. Prior to that, we had to find a
way to save Yoo Sangah. Perhaps Olympus had one of those methods.

Then Yoo Joonghyuk opened his mouth. "Not everyone needs to go. Lee
Seolhwa and I will stay here."

"Where are you going?"

"I have no obligation to report to you."
In fact, the place where Yoo Joonghyuk wanted to go was obvious. Context
of the Constellations was an interstellar city where all nebulae converged.
In other words, we weren't the only incarnations who would come here.

I advised him, "Watch out. As you know well, that woman isn't easy."

"I will take care of it."

Yoo Joonghyuk turned around and started walking somewhere. Lee
Seolhwa smiled softly at me and followed behind Yoo Joonghyuk. Lee
Seolhwa in this round was more 'good' than any other round. It was
unreasonable for anyone to have complete control over Yoo Joonghyuk but
she would be able to reduce some unnecessary conflict.

Yoo Joonghyuk disappeared into the alley and I moved with the party
members towards the portal in the center of the square. Context of the
Constellations contained a 'portal' that connected to almost all the world.

It was a portal that allowed me to visit past scenario areas as well as the
residence of other nebulae. I planned to make a formal visit to Olympus
using the portal. I entered the destination for the portal.

"Mount Olympus."

Olympus, a huge nebula with all types of legends and adventures. It was
Mount Olympus where the 12 main gods of Olympus resided. Finally, the
time had come to check their home.

The portal swirled at my feet and faint mythological scenes came to mind.
The next moment, an unexpected message came back.

[Olympus is currently refusing all visitors.]
          Chapter 314: Ep. 59 - Kim Dokja's Company, V


Along with the message, the swirling of the portal quickly subsided. The
party members waiting were confused. Jung Heewon was the one who
raised the question first. "…Entry was refused? What is this?" I once again
called out the destination.

[Olympus is currently refusing all visitors.]

[The Olympus scenario will open after seven days.]

After seven days? At this point, something flashed in my mind.

[A small nebula is quite ambitious, actually thinking about going to
Olympus.]

The true voice came from a constellation sitting at the fountain next to the
portal. Based on his calm but violent pressure, he was a warrior who had
struggled for a long time before becoming a constellation. His body was
bigger than Lee Hyunsung and there was a long spear on his back… wait, a
spear?

[Hrmm, your impressions are familiar… where did you come from?]

I replied on behalf of the party members. "Earth."

[Hoh, I'm from there. It's a pleasure. Where on Earth? It it on the continent
side?]

"The Korean Peninsula."

"Neighbourhood friends! There seem to be some decent ones there.]

I became more convinced after hearing the constellation's easy laugh. A
large one-handed spear resembling the head of a snake…

The man rose from the fountain with a grunt and walked away. Han
Sooyoung came to be side and said, "Hey, that constellation? The battle of
Changban?"

"That's right."

A historical-grade constellation who was one of China's greatest warriors
along with Guan Yoo and Xiang Yoo. He was arguably the tiger official of
the battle of Changban, Zhang Fei.

Lee Jihye was surprised by the overheard whisper and asked, "Really? Is he
that Zhang Fei guy?"

I nodded. The expressions of the party members were spectacular. They
didn't show this much reaction when they met Surya…

I could see the status of the Three Kingdoms in South Korea. Even Lee
Hyunsung was flustered as he hurriedly took out a soldier's handbook.
"Excuse me Dokja-ssi. I'm a big fan of the Three Kingdoms. Can I get his
autograph…"

"You will often experience this in the future. Many of the historical figures
we know have become constellations."

I looked around the square with the party members. The previously quiet
square was already crowded with constellations and incarnations.

[Recruiting participants for the 53rd scenario!]

[Looking for an incarnation to be a tanker to obtain the story.]

Crude true voices were heard from all over the place. It was possible to
build up full-fledged stories after the 47th scenario. Therefore, historical-
grade constellations would often organize small parties to target the
scenario. Jung Heewon spoke like she couldn't believe these beings had
sponsored us so far.

"All of a sudden, the dignity of the constellations has fallen off."

"In fact, most of them are low-grade. They haven't fallen. It is just that our
status has risen."

"We'll have to break those scenarios after saving Sangah-ssi?"

"As Bihyung said, we don't have to clear them all."

I stared at the flashing scenario billboard in the sky.

–We invite you to battle against the giant gods in Gigantomachia of
Olympus.

Among the scenarios after the 47th scenario, there were many large
scenarios created by the direct intervention of the nebulae or bureau. One of
the representatives of this was Gigantomachia, which was regularly run by
Olympus.
Some of the constellations saw the advertisement and mumbled, "Is it real
this time? Will the ancient giants be released from Tartarus?"

"Hey, you said that a dozen years ago but they didn't."

"This time is different? The atmosphere is very suspicious. There is talk of
internal conflict in Olympus."

"Are they pretending to be fighting?"

I listened to the conversation and saw the ensuing commercial. It was a
video showing Olympus having a brilliant battle with the giants. A trident
split apart the sea, the ranks of the giants were crushed and the soldiers
commanded by the 'Atrocious God of War' rushed towards the bodies of
the giants. The 'Spokesman of Justice and Wisdom' cut the neck of a giant
and the Goddess of Love and Beauty made finger hearts. The end of the
advertisement was Dionysus raising his glass in celebration of the war. –
The best scenario in the Star Stream will start after a week!

–Three of the scenario participants will be selected to receive a 'limited
edition' weapon made by the Volcanic Blacksmith.

–Scenario admission: 100,000 coins.

Lee Gilyoung watched the advertisement to the end and asked me, "Dokja
hyung, I have to pay an admission fee to clear that scenario?"

"Yes."

"A scam!"

"Well, it's a business. Olympus gets income from the Star Stream by
providing scenarios. The dokkaebis advertise it and redistribute the
income."
Jung Heewon laughed in a dumbfounded way at my words. "It is a hustle.
So desperate…"

"We will make them desperate."

Jung Heewon made a stiff expression and nodded. "What will we do now?
Should we wait a week? Won't the Olympus scenario start in a week?"

I shook my head. The remaining time was three months. It was important
not to waste any time.

"Gigantomachia is a giant story scenario and we need to be thoroughly
prepared to challenge it. For now, Yoo Sangah's situation is urgent and we
should find another way."

The flow of consciousness was rare but other incarnations had suffered
from it. If it wasn't Olympus then it was likely that a nebula of a similar
level would know how to treat Yoo Sangah.

I pondered carefully before making various plans. There were two major
things to be gained here.

"We will split up the party here. Han Sooyoung, take the others to the
auction. Maybe Yoo Joonghyuk will be there too. The party member's
equipment should be changed. Buy some clothes for the kids."

"What if I don't have enough money?"

"Here are some coins."

Han Sooyoung quickly stretched out her finger. I touched Han Sooyoung's
index finger and exchanged coins. Han Sooyoung's eyes bugged out when
she saw the number of coins.

"You know, you are really rich."

"Use it sparingly. I didn't give you a lot."
"Hey kids, let's make Kim Dokja's Company go bankrupt!"

Shin Yoosung and Lee Gilyoung shouted with excitement and followed
Han Sooyoung. I spoke to Lee Jihye and Lee Hyunsung. "Go with them.
There are many star relics available at the constellations' auction site."

"T-Then we'll follow!"

"Thank you ahjussi!

Lee Jihye and Lee Hyunsung ran like the wind and chased after Han
Sooyoung. I grabbed Jung Heewon's shoulder as she was about to follow.
"Heewon-ssi, remain here. There is a place you should come with me."




After a while, I took Jung Heewon to a department store. It was one of the
branches of the Dokkaebi Mart in the Context of the Constellations city.

The moment we entered, a large dokkaebi blocked our way. [I'm sorry but
only platinum members can enter.]

Perhaps it was due to our shabby appearance but there was slight contempt
in the dokkaebi's eyes. Rather than arguing, I opened the Dokkaebi Bag to
confirm my rating.

[A diamond member?]

The flustered dokkaebi compared my modifier to the list of customers and
his eyes widened.

[I-I'm really sorry! Is this your first visit to the store? Hey, call the manager
and staff members! If there is any inconvenience in your shopping―]

"There is no need. Don't call them because it is a hassle."
I refused and passed the dokkaebi. Jung Heewon spoke in a thrilled manner.
"Dokja-ssi is like a third-generation chaebol¹."

"I am the company's boss."

"By the way, what is this department store?"

I quickly scanned Jung Heewon. She wore an old uniform and had the
Sword of Judgment hanging from her waist. The clothes had been stained
with blood thanks to countless battles over the past three years and the
sword was much sharper and redder than before.

"How can a company that makes fun of an employee's welfare succeed?"
"Well, I deserve that."

We stood in front of a display stand in a corner of the store. They were
masterpieces of the Mass Production Maker's first generation products.

I observed the products with cautious eyes and took out two neat suits. It
was an SSS-grade armour with a practicality that wasn't bad for the 47th
scenario. However, Jung Heewon was confused. "Why do you want to
dress up all of a sudden?"

"We have to go somewhere pretty formal."

We each changed into the suit. The suit became the right size the moment
we wore it.

Jung Heewon wore the suit and looked like a presidential bodyguard. By
the way, I didn't know what type of person Jung Heewon was before the
destruction.Character List didn't give such information and she was barely
in the original Ways of Survival.

"What was Heewon-ssi's previous job? Can I ask?"
"Well, the last thing I did was a bartender. It was just a part-time job. If it is
a job… then a regular person who switches between part-time jobs?" Jung
Heewon shrugged while scratching her head. "I used to exercise."

"Exercise?"

"I did kendo in middle and high school. I quit competing due to injuries.
What about Dokja-ssi?"

"I was a contract employee with a gaming company. I was destined to soon
be fired."

We were silent for a moment. The man and women stood in front of a
mirror dressed in suits. I could see some constellation's incarnation bodies
glancing at us as they passed. The Jung Heewon in the mirror asked,
"Dokja-ssi, are you happier now then you were before?"

"If you're saying that the story is better now, it is true."

It was an honest answer and Jung Heewon laughed. "It is the same for me."

We paid in coins and went upstairs using the escalator. Jung Heewon asked
curiously, "Dokja-ssi, where are we going? This is the roof."

"It is a portal."

The roof door opened and a panoramic view of the interstellar city could be
seen. Jung Heewon gave a short exclamation of admiration but there was no
time to admire it.

I took Jung Heewon to the railing of the roof. "Do you trust me?"

It was a short exchange. I jumped from the rooftop while holding Jung
Heewon's hand. Despite falling down, Jung Heewon maintained her mind.
By the time we were halfway to the ground, I glared at the air.
[The constellation 'Demon King of Salvation' is looking at the hidden
portal.]

[The portal requires a password.]

"Everything that falls down has wings."

A portal appeared in the air and swallowed our bodies.

[The nebula has allowed your entry.]

I felt my feet touching the ground. The wind that gave off a seemingly
primal breath grazed the tip of my nose. It was a clear wind I had never
encountered before. An idyllic meadow stretched out endlessly and a white
castle was built beyond it.

Jung Heewon was making a stupid expression. "Dokja-ssi, don't tell me this
place…"

"Correct."

This was the nebula of the mighty archangels. It was cumbersome to
enter this way but it minimized the time required for entry. I looked up at
the air and muttered, "They probably figured it out by now…" Then a
cold alarm sounded in my head.

[…Demon king?]

It was an incredibly cruel voice for an archangel. It wasn't the voice I
had been waiting for. It seemed that an unwelcome visitor had appeared.
[Your boldness has grown. How did a demon king come here?]

The power of the narrative-grade constellation caused the body to shrink
back. Even the brave Jung Heewon had a pale complexion.
[The constellation 'Demon King of Salvation' is opening his 'status'.]

This allowed Jung Heewon to take a breath. I was about to look for the
owner of the voice but a hand seemed appeared in front of me and grabbed
my chin.

[Demon King of Salvation?]

Only my chin was grabbed but it felt like power was slipping away from
my body. The status was too enormous for me to withstand.

[How does a demon king have the modifier of salvation? There has only
been one owner of that modifier in the past 1,500 years.]

I barely managed to turn my head and saw a blonde-haired man staring at
me. They were slightly shining purple eyes. I instantly realized the identity
of this constellation.

[The constellation 'Saviour of Corruption' is looking at you with crazy
eyes.]

There was only one existence in Eden with the modifier of both 'good and
evil' and he was the strongest of all the archangels in Eden.

…Dammit, it was the worst opponent. I couldn't believe he was in Eden
right now. The purple eyes of the man curved like a crescent moon.

[I don't know what you are but I don't like sharing my modifier. Then you
need to die.]

The moment that the man's hand holding my chin glowed with a purple
light…

[■■. Take off your hands, Michael. Unless you really want to go to hell.]

It was the voice of the archangel I had been waiting for.
[1] Chaebol – a large family-owned business conglomerate.
          Chapter 315: Ep. 59 - Kim Dokja's Company, VI


I could hear the roaring sound of flames and a wall of hot fire appeared
between me and Michael. The frowning Michael stepped back while
shaking his hands.

[…What are you doing?]

[Get lost.]

Michael stared at Uriel for a moment before smiling.

[Uriel, you must've gone crazy after quitting demon hunting.]

A purple energy started to overflow wildly in Michael's body.

[The constellation 'Saviour of Corruption' is preparing the 'Demon King
Slayer' story.]
Demon King Slayer. It was the same story that Yoo Joonghyuk of the
1863rd round had.

The green meadow was dyed with purple waves. The grass withered and an
eerie sensation rose from my feet.

Demon King Slayer was a story that had a near invincible power against
demon kings. I could never win against Michael as long as he had this
story.

Michael's status aimed at me but someone blocked it.

"Archangels are basically ruthless?" Jung Heewon was standing in front of
me with the Sword of Judgment. Her shoulders were faintly trembling and
her spirit was shrinking back. Nevertheless, Jung Heewon was brave. The
will of a human withstood the pressure in front of the archangel's killing
intent. Behind such a Jung Heewon stood Uriel.

There was a blazing glow in the background. Hellfire rose and the fields of
Eden were filled with sparks.

I gulped as the situation reached the bursting point.

Uriel was one of the top five strongest archangels. She had the highest
voice in Eden among the constellations of the absolute good system.

Even so, her opponent was Michael. An unmatched archangel with all types
of combat abilities. In Eden, there was no archangel beyond Michael in
pure combat power alone.

[The constellation 'Friend of Justice and Harmony' is dissuading 'Saviour of
Corruption'.]

[The constellation 'Guardian of Youths and Travel' is looking at the
'Saviour of Corruption'.]
[Constellations of the absolute good system are criticizing the 'Saviour of
Corruption'.]

Michael didn't back down despite the messages pouring from the sky.
Rather, he seemed to find it funny.

[Yes, it's time to show who is the strongest in Eden.]

At the same time, Michael's purple and white aura simultaneously formed
around his hands. The force swirled around both hands. The aura soon
turned into a two-handed sword. Sweat flowed down my body. This jerk,
where did he get this star relic…?

[The constellation 'Scribe of Heaven' is warning the 'Saviour of
Corruption'.]

A huge storm broke out and the sparks in the surroundings were instantly
extinguished. This was the power of Eden's highest constellation, Metatron.
At the very least, this huge pressure couldn't be countered in Eden. The
violence created silence as Michael belatedly dispersed his momentum.

Michael stared up at the sky for a while before grumbling, […Even you?
Eden seems to be gone now.]

Michael turned around and started to move away. The heads of demon
kings were hanging from his waist like fruit.

[Head of Grand Duke Semida.]

[Head of Grand Duke Graphio.]

Goosebumps covered my body. Some of the grand dukes were equivalent
to lower-grade demon kings. Yet he hung their heads like they were toys.

Once Michael completely disappeared over the hill, Jung Heewon sighed
and put away her sword.
I turned my head and saw Uriel looking this way.

Archangel Uriel. She was different from when I had seen her at the
Constellation Banquet. She wore Eden's uniform with cross earrings and
looked elegant. The usual mischievous feeling couldn't be found as nobility
overflowed from her body.

[Kim Dokja…]

She stared at me with complicated eyes before suddenly making a startled
expression. Then she turned towards Jung Heewon like she was avoiding
my gaze.

[It's nice to see you. Is this the first time you've met me like this?]

Jung Heewon's lips were slightly parted as she faced Uriel. Perhaps it was a
type of excitement. Indeed, this was the first time Jung Heewon had seen
Uriel. The Uriel in front of us right now was in a shape where her
incarnation body and her true self were united. The archangel in front of us
was the true nature of the Demon-like Judge of Fire.

[Come along, the scribe is waiting.]




"…How long do we have to wait?"

Jung Heewon and I were immediately taken to Eden's palace. Eden was a
lot more modest than I expected. I was familiar with the depiction from
Ways of Survival but it was certainly different from the other magnificent
residences. There were small decorations that didn't give any feeling of
pretenses. The murals and statues decorating the monotonous white gave
off a curiously humble feel. The problem was that such modest made my
wait even more boring.
–Wait here. A guide will soon come.

Uriel left me here and disappeared somewhere with Jung Heewon. I wanted
to see Eden as well… I was feeling a bit disappointed.

…Perhaps it was because of what happened in the 1863rd round. I left
Uriel's colleague, Jophiel there. It was unavoidable if I received blame.

[Kim Dokja, you came?]

I raised my head with blank eyes and an angel sitting on a cloud was
looking down at me. The appearance was in the early teens with curly hair.
The angel looked down at me with half sleep eyes and I got up. "Are you
Raphael?" Raphael nodded.

Guardian of Youths and Travel, Raphael. This world's Eden seemed to be
in good shape. After Uriel, I was glad to see Raphael. By the way… was
this the archangel who really repelled the fearsome Asmodeus?

[How did you find out about the secret portal?]

"I was told by Jophiel."

[How does it feel to be in Eden?]

"Good."

[You look sleepy?]

I hurriedly changed my expression and smiled. Raphael guided me through
the corridor from the parlour. As we walked through the outer corridor, the
scenery of the garden could be seen through the window. The sheep that
were grazing on the grass cried out as they looked up at me. I watched the
sheep and wondered,
"There really are lambs in Eden." [Yes,

they're good when you can't sleep.]

"…Are you saying you count them?

[You've probably seen it too. They are the one who appear when you
close your eyes and think of sheep before you sleep.]

I was surprised because it was a story that didn't appear in Ways of
Survival. Were they really the sheep that people counted before going to
bed?

[I was lying.]

"…"

I stared at Raphael in a dumbfounded manner. Raphael laughed and started
talking again.

[Do you know? Originally there were no sheep in Eden.]

"Are you lying again?"

[This is real. The sheep were brought by Uriel.]

Uriel? Why?

[One day, the scribe gave Uriel a sub scenario.]

The archangels of Eden received missions through the Scribe of Heaven.
Understandably, every mission was reduced to a scenario. I was curious
because this wasn't in Ways of Survival.

"What scenario was it?"

[Bring 10 lambs.]
Many scenarios in the Star Stream took the form of metaphors. In Eden, the
metaphor of the sheep was obvious. In a nutshell, Metatron wanted Uriel to
bring 10 worshippers.

"…Uriel brought real lambs?"

[Yes. It was 10 at first but they reproduced and grew too much.]

It sounded like something Uriel would do.

The angels who managed the sheep could also be seen. The angels feed or
shaved the sheep's fur. Everything was beautiful as described in Ways of
Survival. Some of them looked to this side and chatted with each other.
One, two, three… the numbers went up more and more. Someone
improvised a placard out of shaved fleece and started to wave it this way.

…What did it say?

[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' is making a stern expression.]

The angels hurriedly scattered. I could see Uriel and Jung Heewon waving
in the distance. Raphael clicked his tongue. [An angel is fond of fallen
humans.]

"Can you speak while moving?"

[Go in. The scribe is waiting.]

I was standing in front of the scribe's office. I took a deep breath before
opening the door and entering.

The first thing that came into view were piles of books stacked up to the
height of a person.

The pile of books was impossible to read in my lifetime and I involuntarily
took a liking to the owner of the room. Anyone who liked books couldn't be
a bad person.
I was careful not to destroy the pile of books as I stepped into the office.
Beyond the mountains of books, the table of the office could be seen. Then
I saw a grey-haired archangel sitting in front of me with a tired face.

[You came.]

It was a godly voice that couldn't be compared to any constellation I had
seen before. Metatron pushed up the frame of his glasses and smiled at me.

[Welcome, Demon King of Salvation. I am the Scribe of Heaven.]




I came to Eden for two reasons. One was superficial and the other was a
real errand.

[I would like to hear what happened in the other world line.]

I nodded and started to explain. It went from the agreement with Secretive
Plotter to the 1863rd round world, meeting the people there and leaving
Jophiel behind.

I told the story. Some parts were honest, some were summarized and some
things I didn't say. Metatron listened to my story. Some stories were heard
earnestly and some calmly. Some stories he listened to curiously.

[Secretive Plotter…]

"Do you know him?"

Metatron smiled lightly.

[There are probably no constellations in this world who don't know him.
However, they don't know who he is.]
I closed my mouth. My story ended here.

[Thank you for telling me the story, Demon King of Salvation.]

"No problem."

[In the future, Eden will indeed be destroyed.]

His voice was very casual for speaking about the destruction. It was a face
that didn't show the slightest agitation. I looked at this Metatron and asked,
"Why did you call me? It isn't just to hear the story."

The Scribe of Heaven. He recorded everything in Eden and was the number
two benevolent person in Eden. Metatron's smile widened.

[Why do you think I called you?]

This was Metatron's conversational style. He listened to his desires through
the mouth of another person. I thought for a moment before replying.
Perhaps this was a chance for me.

"I think you want to use me as a tool to stop the destruction."

[You? What is useful about you?]

My figure was reflected in Metatron's transparent eyes. Kim Dokja in one
eye had white wings while Kim Dokja in the other eye had black demon
wings.

"I am a demon king who hasn't chosen an alliance."

I became the demon king of the 73rd Demon Realm through the selection.
It was a position that had been vacant for thousands of years. Such a place
was occupied by a newborn constellation.

I opened my last message log.
[The demon king 'Black Mane Lion' is inviting you to his demon realm.]

[The demon king 'Immeasurable Austerity' is inviting you to his demon
realm.]

…

They were messages that had accumulated from the moment I became a
demon king.

"The destruction of Eden is triggered by the war with the Demon Realm.
You're trying to use me as a mediator."

It was natural to get attention from other demon kings. Then what about
Eden? Eden had shown an unusual interest in me before I became a demon
king. I received the favour of the archangels, starting with Uriel. Based on
the attitude that Eden normally took towards evil alignment constellations,
their treatment of me was unusual.

"You need me. In the history of the Star Stream, I am probably the first
person to receive the attention of the Demon Realm and Eden at the same
time."

I deliberately raised my voice. Considering future negotiations, I couldn't
be pushed back by Metatron here.

Metatron didn't answer and stared at my face for a moment. The next
moment, I realized that something was wrong. Along with an intense
pressure, a bright light emerged from behind Metatron. It was a light gaze
that I had felt someone before. I felt a dangerous force penetrating my
essence.

[The exclusive skill 'Fourth Wall' is strongly activated!]

Sparks covered my eyes as I took a few steps back with a groan. The sparks
gradually became smaller and Metatron expressed his admiration.
[…As expected, you are also a chosen being of the 'Fragment of the Last
Wall'.]

"What…"

[The 'Wall Dividing Good and Evil' is looking at you with surprise.]

I stared in front of me with surprise. Behind Metatron was a silver 'wall'.
There was no doubt.

[The Fourth Wall is baring its teeth towards the Wall Dividing Good and
Evil]

Wall Dividing Good and Evil. Archangel Metatron was the owner of a
'wall', just like me.
                Chapter 316: Ep. 60 -Taste of Ruin, I


「 Twi sted guy. 」

The Fourth Wall seemed to know this wall. There was also a brief mention
of it in Ways of Survival. Like Jang Hayoung's Unidentified Wall, it was
one of the walls that had a strong power but whose origins were unknown.

[Wall Dividing Good and Evil is measuring your goodness and evil.]

[The Fourth Wall is snorting.]

[Wall Dividing Good and Evil is confused on how to judge your existence.]

Wall Dividing Good and Evil was the standard for dividing good and evil in
this world. The power to distinguish between good and evil in the Star
Stream responded to Metatron's rational doubt. If the skill named someone
evil, the constellations belonging to the absolute good system had the right
to vote on that decision and the result would be reflected immediately. Jung
Heewon's Judgment Time was a power that shared the probability of this
wall.

[Why are you confused? It isn't the first time you've seen the owner of a
wall.]

"I didn't know you would bring it out of all a sudden. Then are you going to
define me as an 'evil' person? I know the decision was withdrawn in the
past."

[I don't think so. As you said, you are useful.]

I didn't know Metatron's exact thoughts. The only thing certain was that he
intended to use me to prepare for Eden's future destruction.

[The wall on which all the ■■'s are written. You have read about Eden's
destruction there. Isn't that right?]

I was a bit surprised. Metatron of this time seemed a bit different from the
Metatron I knew. He knew the existence of Ways of Survival. He also
called the wall by the 'Last Wall'. The moment I was about to answer, the
Fourth Wall interrupted.

「 Kim Dok ja, don't spe ak non sense. 」

I closed my mouth. Metatron said. [The wall seems to have made you
silent.
As expected from the largest fragment of the Last Wall.]

"Do you know what the Last Wall is?"

Metatron made an unknown expression at my question.

[Are you asking because you are curious or do you have another purpose?]
I stared into Metatron's eyes without speaking. Metatron smiled wryly. […
Okay. Instead, turn off the channel. They should've seen plenty of Eden.]
The next moment, indirect messages exploded from the sky.

[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' is scratching his
head.] [The constellation 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' is emitting light
from his fingernails.]

[The constellation 'Bald General of Justice' is impressed by the heavenly
scene.]

[Some constellations are pleased with the tour of Eden!]

[50,000 coins have been sponsored.]

Just like the Underworld, there were many constellations wondering about
Eden. Biyoo made a sound and closed the channel.

Metatron touched a thick stack of books and started talking. [The Last
World is the wall that constitutes the essence of this world. It has existed
for a long time and crumbled, leading to a broken wall.]

Metatron touched a book so old it felt like it would fall apart with one
touch.

[The Wall Dividing Good and Evil is one of the fragments of this wall.]

"How many have these walls?"

[I don't know exactly. I didn't hear it from 'him'. Just…]

I wondered who Metatron was referring to with 'him'. In fact, it was a
foolish thought. There was only one being who would be called 'him' in
Eden.
Metatron continued speaking. [Every wall has a meaning. Some walls
distinguish between good and evil while others control communication.
Some walls can also change the future of a given world.]

Metatron stared at me and spoke in a serious voice. [I think you are the key
to change the 'set' destruction.]

Metatron's expectations for me were so clear that it was a bit burdensome. I
deliberately spoke with confidence. "Scribe, you must be making 'A Single
Story'."

[…Yes.]

"I am currently a newcomer who is only in the 'succession' stage. Do you
think I can do this?"

[No one knows which story will be chosen at the end.]

Metatron turned his gaze towards the window of the office. The sun coming
into Eden shone on Metatron's beautiful face. Some parts were covered in a
dark shade while others became abnormally bright. In the unequal light,
Metatron's face seemed strangely distorted.

[We can only carefully choose the method of worship from a category we
can understand.]

Perhaps this was the story that Metatron thought of. I quietly watched
Metatron and opened my mouth. It was time to get to the main point. "It
doesn't matter what you use me for. Instead, I have one condition."

[You have come here to save Incarnation Yoo Sangah.]

In any case, it was good that the story was fast. Metatron seemed to have
already grasped the details of Yoo Sangah through the broadcast.
[The flow of consciousness is a very dangerous disease and investing
probability recklessly can cause a big loss. They will be swept away by the
rapids of the exiting stories.]

"Is there no solution?"

[There is. If you believe and practice the great words like other archangels
in this garden…]

"It means I have to join Eden. That isn't possible."

[For now, it is best to strengthen the incarnation body to the limit to
alleviate the disease. It is recommended to obtain items to do this. It
shouldn't be things like the Great Return Pill made by the humans of
Murim. Instead, it should be Star Relic Fruits or star fluids that contain the
miracle of a giant story.]

Star Relic Fruits and star fluids…

Metatron read my expression and smiled.

[Eden has some leftover nectar but it can't be used for your purpose. Eden's
Star Relic Fruit is a bit special.]

I already knew. There was no one on Earth who didn't know the identity of
Eden's Star Relic Fruit. "…Then there is no way."

I was a bit discouraged. I thought it was possible for Eden but I guess I was
thinking too much. Then Metatron added, [I mean, there is no way in
Eden.]

The door of the office opened. A man walked into the office, collapsing the
high stacks of books. I looked at the body covered with a dazzling light and
unknowingly invoked my status.

[It has been a long time, Demon King of Salvation.]
Jung Heewon had an excursion through Eden. The angels were mostly
friendly and some asked her questions. Most of them were questions about
Kim Dokja and Yoo Joonghyuk but she thought that was natural. The two
people were currently the most popular on the Korean Peninsula.

Rather, if something was bothering her then it was her sponsor
repeatedly losing her soul. "Uriel."

[Yes, Heewon.]

"I understand."

[Yes, Heewon.]

"You aren't listening to me, are you?"

[Yes, Heewon… ah?"

The surprised Uriel glanced between the list of ranks engraved on the slab
Jung Heewon was holding and the palace.

[W-Well… Ah, right. I was explaining the order of the angels. So our ranks
are…]

"If you're so nervous, why don't you go see for yourself?"

Jung Heewon talked about going to the office in the palace and Uriel
became pale.

[T-that. No. I should distinguish between business and personal matters…]

"You can give the explanation to Eden later. He will be thankful that you
came to meet him."
Jung Heewon saw the terrible Demon-like Judge of Fire flustered like this
and laughed. It was a sponsor she couldn't hate. Uriel touched her cross
earrings and bit her lips before looking up. […Can I go see Kim Dokja?]

"Of course."

Uriel's expression lightened up at Jung Heewon's permission. Then next
moment, Uriel thought of something and her eyes became sullen.

[No, I can't.]

"Why?"

[That…]

Uriel rolled her eyes and wriggled her fingers. She was so cute that Jung
Heewon laughed. Her sponsor felt like a big sister. Jung Heewon glanced at
Uriel's gloomy expression and asked, "If you like Dokja-ssi so much, you
should go see him. What are you hesitating about?"

Uriel turned red at the question, made gibberish gestures and bowed her
head with a sigh.

[I'm shy.]

"Why are you shy? You always send him indirect messages."

[A fan letter is different from talking to the person directly.]

"Didn't you meet him last time? At a banquet or something."

[It was just an incarnation body then. Now I'm different. It is like meeting
an online game avatar in person.]

It was an analogy suitable for a constellation.
[I don't mean that the time I spent with you is like a game! I mean, in a
figurative sense…]

Jung Heewon smiled at the struggling Uriel. Perhaps this was the difference
between her sponsor and other constellations. It might be the reason why
Kim Dokja wasn't vigilant towards Uriel.

Jung Heewon was about to answer when her lips stiffened. A bad feeling
went down her spine. In the distance, someone turned a corridor in the
palace and headed for the scribe's office. It was in Kim Dokja's direction. It
was an extremely high' status' and Jung Heewon was horrified when she
saw the person.

"Uriel! That constellation…!"

Jung Heewon knew this existence. There was no way she couldn't know. It
was because he was the person who made the last Demon King Selection a
nightmare. She turned her head and saw Uriel staring at her with a hardened
expression.

"I want to go see."

Uriel nodded.




The sound of a huge train leaving the tracks filled my ears. It felt like
memories were revived just by facing them. This was Eden and the
constellation couldn't attack me. Even so, my instincts remembered it and
my status reacted violently.

There was a sublime voice reminiscent of sunlight. [You aren't as polite as I
thought you would be. Are you still reflecting on the past story?]
"I would be hit in the back of the head in the Star Stream if I didn't
remember it."

[You might be a constellation but you haven't escaped from the mentality of
a human. A constellation doesn't dwell on such trivial history.]

Four arms attached to a body. The third eye looked down at me softly. The
miserable battle during the Demon King Selection still gave me chills.

[Surya. Did the demon hunting turn out well?]

Metatron spoke and Surya passed by me like he wasn't interested. The
heads of a grand duke demon were hanging from Surya's waist. Surya
pulled off the heads and placed them on Metatron's table.

Metatron examined the state of the heads and said, [The rewards will be
sent via the nebula.]

Perhaps Surya had received a contracted sub scenario through Eden. Like
Michael and Uriel, the Supreme God of Light was a nightmare for demons.

[No, I'd like it now. I don't have much of a relationship with my nebula
these days.]

Surya glanced at me as he spoke. Metatron replied. [Come to Eden…]

[Stop joking about that. The matter is over so I'm leaving.]

Surya headed to the exit of the office with this remark. Metatron stared at
Surya's back with a faint smile. I was taken aback. I felt nervous but he
didn't come here because of me. Then Surya's footsteps stopped in front of
the door.

[Demon King of Salvation, I was told that one of your colleagues has a
special illness.] Surya spoke without looking back. [If you want, I can
help.]
At this moment, information from Ways of Survival quickly passed through
my head.

「 Surya is one of the eight Lokapala of Vedas. 」

「 He and the Lokapala are the origins of the star fluid of Vedas, the
Soma.」

Vedas' star fluid, the Soma. Then it was likely he could improve the
condition of Yoo Sangah. I looked over at Metatron. He smiled faintly at
me with a shifty expression.

This scribe knew from the beginning that Surya would come here. Yet it
wasn't even possible for this schemer to stop the destruction of Eden… I
realized that the fate of the Star Stream was harsh.

I asked without looking at Surya, "What do you want?"

Soma was a drink that could only be enjoyed by a few privileged gods in
Vedas. He wouldn't give me such a gift without strings attached. The
Supreme God of Light slowly turned his head. A demon-like smile was on
Surya's face.

[I want Olympus ruined.]
                Chapter 317: Ep. 60 -Taste of Ruin, II


Surya approached and stood in front of me. He was at least 20cm taller than
me. I opened up more of my status to counteract the pressure he was
emitting. The office was suddenly flooded with Surya's energy.

The conversation from now on was between constellation and constellation.
"The ruin of Olympus… is that your meaning or Vedas' meaning?"

[Is it important?]

"It is important."

I expected the troubles between big nebulae to be in full swing by now.
They pursued cooperation with me in order to ruin each other but
originally, Vedas, Olympus and Papyrus weren't solid alliances. All big
nebulae were in a potentially competitive position when pursuing 'A Single
Story'.
Surya thought for a moment before replying. [I don't like Olympus and
Vedas. Is this enough for an answer?]

It was a vague answer. Yet in a sense, it was the answer I wanted. Based on
the original Ways of Survival, Surya was definitely a heretical constellation
of Vedas. "It is an answer."

[I have enough authority to give one Soma. Don't you know who I am?]

Surya was the source of Soma, an immortal beverage. If I got his promise
then obtaining Soma definitely wouldn't be a problem. By the way, this…
things had become interesting.

Metatron's finger moved like it was pleasant to hear our conversation. I
watched the finger moving like a metronome and spoke, "I still have one
question left. The ruin of Olympus is precisely―"

[The 60th scenario, Gigantomachia.]

"That is just a theme park event. They will summon a few giants to hunt
and…

[If they aren't serious, you would make them serious.]

…Since when had he been listening to me? Did he subscribe to Biyoo's
channel?

[Olympus won't suddenly be destroyed because of the scenario. However, it
is possible to provide a stepping stone to the ruin.]

"How?"

[Haven't you already thought about how to do this?]

The third eye on Surya's forehead was white. I gazed at his eyes. Indeed, I
couldn't step back and pretend ignorance.
"It is absurd with my power or the power of my nebula. Of course, this
didn't mean I had no way."

Metatron's finger stopped moving at my words. I watched Metatron.
"Scribe.
Take responsibility for calling this person here."

[What responsibility do you mean?]

"Be a witness for this agreement."

Metatron made an intrigued expression. His wait and see expression was
transformed into a schemer.

[What are the benefits of being a witness?]

"I will give you a stake in the giant story I will obtain this time."

A stake in a giant story. No matter the scenario, the giant story was a
temptation that couldn't be ignored by a nebula. In addition, the archangels
of Eden needed an enormous number of giant stories because incidents
occurred every day and they needed to diffuse the probability storm.

Metatron nodded with satisfaction.

"Naturally, your mouth can't be empty."

[What do you mean? It is enough to stand witness…]

"You want to take a stake in a giant story with just that? Where did an
archangel's conscience go?"

[The Fourth Wall is nodding.]

[The 'Wall Dividing Good and Evil' is looking closely at its master.]
Faint embarrassment crossed Metatron's face. Sometimes justice would
devour its master.

Surya shook his head and muttered. [Truly a demon king.]

[…Demon King of Salvation, is there anything you want in Eden?]

I nodded. There were many things I wanted. It was because one or two
preparations wasn't enough for the future Gigantomachia.

「 Kim Dokja recalled the 1863rd round. 」

I wouldn't lose anyone.

「 In Kim Dokja's mind, the information of Ways of Survival appeared and
disappeared. 」

From now on, it was likely that high ranking constellations would join the
battle. It wasn't just Surya but the other Lokapala of Vedas and some of
Olympus' 12 gods could participate in the scenario.

Was that all? It might be possible to encounter senior demon kings like the
Demon King Selection. Maybe Michael as well.

…Michael.

「 Finally, Kim Dokja made a decision. 」

I looked at one of the items arranged on a shelf behind Metatron. "Give me
one of Eden's star relics."
A few minutes later, Kim Dokja finished his contract with Surya and stood
at the entrance of a portal. Unlike when he came in, this was the front door.
Several angels came to see him off.

[…Already?]

Uriel was full of regret as she grasped Jung Heewon's hand. Jung Heewon
looked at Uriel and hugged her tightly.

[Uh…?]

The initially embarrassed Uriel soon hugged Jung Heewon back. Her face
was full of emotions.

[The constellation 'Lily Blooming in Aquarius' is looking at Incarnation
'Jung Heewon'.]

Gabriel's indirect message came from somewhere. Kim Dokja looked at the
sky as if thinking about something. Then he told Jung Heewon, "I'm sorry
to interrupt the emotional farewell but Heewon-ssi will stay here for
another week."

"Huh?"

"Don't worry, I already spoke to the scribe."

Uriel's eyes widened at the words. [Really? Is that possible?]

"Of course. Instead, please train Heewon-ssi. You've been absent for the
past three years."

[Yes! Leave it to me!]

Kim Dokja turned away from the widely smiling Uriel towards Jung
Heewon. "Heewon-ssi, I'll meet you a week later in Olympus."

"…I understand. I'll be sure to become stronger when I go back."
A short handshake later, Kim Dokja disappeared into the portal. Some
angels looked disgruntled while others sighed.

The brief event ended and the angels returned to their positions. Gabriel
watched from a distance.

[Gabriel.]

[Scribe.]

Gabriel bowed towards Metatron who appeared behind her.

[Why didn't you meet him and talk?]

Gabriel didn't answer.

[Jophiel's matter isn't your fault.]

[But…]

[Jophiel is strong. She is doing her job properly. Her choice will be the first
step in preventing Eden's destruction.]

Gabriel's clear eyes shook at the word 'destruction'. Her lips opened like she
wanted to ask something.

[A message has arrived.]

In the sky, a message for Metatron arrived. Surprisingly, the sender of the
message was Commander of the Red Cosmos.

–This is a report on the identity of the outer god, Secretive Plotter.

Metatron spoke while reaching out for the report. [Soon, the real war will
begin.]
It was a bustling street reminiscent of a battlefield. On the way to the
auction house, countless merchants were selling all types of items.

Yoo Joonghyuk spoke behind him. "Go quickly."

Despite his harsh words, Yoo Joonghyuk was constantly concerned with
Lee Seolhwa's movements. He blocked the front of her like he was worried
she would be hurt by the passing incarnations and constellations. Some of
the incarnations cursed him but Yoo Joonghyuk didn't care.

"You should be avoiding us…"

"Pedestrians first."

Yoo Joonghyuk's shamelessly was so high that Lee Seolhwa laughed. Yoo
Joonghyuk asked, "…Why are you laughing?"

"Joonghyuk-ssi said that you are a regressor."

"That's right."

"Then did you meet me in your previous life?"

Yoo Joonghyuk had no answer for a moment. "No."

"…I see."

An awkward atmosphere formed between the two people. Lee Seolhwa
glanced sideways at Yoo Joonghyuk. He was someone who seemed to be
walking in the far distance, despite being by her side.

Lee Seolhwa smiled bitterly. "Slow down a little bit. There might be items
or skill books that you want to buy."

"There's no time for that."

"I already bought one?"
Lee Seolhwa smiled and waved the skill book in her hand.

[Skill — Preserve Humidity].

Yoo Joonghyuk confirmed the skill book and narrowed his eyes. "You
bought a useless skill."

Lee Seolhwa was already using the skill as her cheeks and lips were
moistened. It was harder to find the daily necessities after the scenario
began and these life skills were gaining huge popularity, regardless of
gender. Lee Seolhwa glanced at Yoo Joonghyuk's face and spoke,
"Joonghyuk-ssi, don't you need it? The back of your hand and your lips are
dry. This city's temperature is low overall so your skin becomes dry
quickly."

"You don't need skills that aren't for combat.

"But Dokja-ssi has this skill as well?"

Yoo Joonghyuk's eyebrows twitched. "Kim Dokja has this skill?"

"Yes, he said this is required if you want to be popular with
constellations…"

"That guy wants to be an idol." Yoo Joonghyuk gritted his teeth and kept
moving.

Lee Seolhwa looked at Yoo Joonghyuk like he was funny. She didn't know
why but this cold-hearted man became angry whenever he heard Kim
Dokja's name.

Yoo Joonghyuk's eyes shifted towards a stand.

–50% discount on skill books.

Lee Seolhwa couldn't help laughing. "Do you want to buy one?"
Yoo Joonghyuk's steps stopped. She wondered if he liked an item but
something was wrong. His fists were trembling. Anger overflowed from
Yoo Joonghyuk's eyes and dominated his expression.

"…Yoo Joonghyuk-ssi?"

The entrance to the auction house could be seen in the distance. A group of
incarnations was entering it. A girl with blonde hair. Lee Seolhwa felt her
heart sink. Yoo Joonghyuk couldn't control his killing intent as his hand
moved towards the Black Heavenly Demon Sword.

"Joonghyuk-ssi, wait!" Lee Seolhwa instinctively grabbed Yoo Joonghyuk's
arm. She knew the identity of the blonde girl.

Asgard's prophet. She remembered the story. Yoo Joonghyuk of the last
round died after being betrayed by her.

"No. This place… the other members…!"

Her heart was in a hurry. No matter how strong Yoo Joonghyuk was, this
place was the auction house of constellations. It was a place where
lowgrade and historical-grade constellations gathered. Moreover, Yoo
Joonghyuk's enemy wasn't alone. If he rushed over now…

"I thought it would be like this." There was a sarcastic voice and Han
Sooyoung was standing there. "Have you forgotten? Kim Dokja told you
not to get into trouble."

Han Sooyoung clicked her tongue like he was pathetic and flicked a coin
around her fingers. Yoo Joonghyuk replied in a cold voice, "This is none of
your business."

"None of my business? Aren't we companions?"
"Companions?" Yoo Joonghyuk's expression distorted. "You aren't."

"This is the bottom line… hey, you might be the protagonist but…!"

"Sooyoung-ssi."

The words of the latecomers caused Han Sooyoung to touch her forehead
and mutter. "Sigh… I can't live because of Kim Dokja and Yoo
Joonghyuk…"

"Anna Croft should be removed here."

"Well, Kim Dokja doesn't want that."

"It has nothing to do with Kim Dokja."

"You just want to deal a blow to her?"

Yoo Joonghyuk paused and glanced at Han Sooyoung. Han Sooyoung
stared back at Yoo Joonghyuk for a moment before turning her gaze to the
entrance of the auction house.

"What if I have a good idea?" There was an item in Han Sooyoung's hand.

Yoo Joonghyuk's eyes shook. "That…?"

"I sneaked it out from Kim Dokja's coat." A wicked smile formed on Han
Sooyoung's face. "Let's test it once, the prophecy ability of the prophet."
               Chapter 318: Ep. 60 -Taste of Ruin, III


The auction house was one of the few places where it was possible to
obtain items that were difficult to find on the Dokkaebi Bag or General
Exchange. Prophet Anna Croft had a few items to obtain here.

Anna Croft spoke the constellations of Olympus behind her. "The guards
aren't a problem?"

[Of course. Originally, this auction house is under the legal authority of our
Olympus. In this Context of the Constellation, no one can touch you.]

"Thank you." Anna Croft bowed and the shadow of the constellation
protecting her disappeared. Anna Croft spoke towards Selena Kim. "Then
let's go in."

"…Yes." Selena Kim replied in a dark voice.
As they moved through the corridor of the auction house, Anna Croft
glanced at Selena Kim's expression. Selena Kim, who was always smiling
and kind to everyone, wasn't smiling anymore.

"Selena."

"Yes."

In fact, Anna Croft knew when this change happened. The Gourmet
Association. It was after meeting the Demon King of Salvation.

"…It's nothing."

Selena Kim lowered her head and looked forward again. Anna Croft felt
strangely alone, even though she had 'predicted' it to some extent. She
couldn't properly cope with some things even if she knew the future. This
was particularly true for human emotions.

[The 8611th Constellation Auction will begin!]

However, now wasn't the time to be focused on such things. Anna Croft
saw the constellations and incarnations filling the seats and reaffirmed her
commitment. There was no one with an easy 'status' no matter where she
looked. They were all deadly enemies.

[The first auction item!]

A senior dokkaebi stood at the podium of the auction. Anna Croft and
Selena Kim took the seats they preempted in advance and participated in
the auction. Several items were sold in an instant and Anna Croft bought
some of them.

'A manticore's teeth'.

'Scales of an Ancient Dragon'.

'Old Yeti's leather'.
Her main purchases were rare material items. All her items were identified
through Future Sight and there were no errors on the list.

'I need these items to make a giant soldier'.

Some incarnations participated in the bidding competition but she already
confirmed their highest bid price through Future Sight and there was no
problem winning the items. Anna Croft finished checking the list and stood
up on the spot. "It is roughly over. Then let's…"

[Now, we have a special product today!]

Anna Croft turned at the voice that came from the stage. Selena Kim saw
Anna Croft's reaction and asked, "What's wrong?"

"It's nothing."

Anna Croft stared at the auction house with a stiff expression.

[This is an item called the 'Old to New Toad'!]

[Haha, isn't it cute? Since this item is a star relic…]

–I'll give a new house for an hour house. [It really knows how to talk.

The auction product hasn't finished the appraisal yet but it is definitely of
immense value―]

'…There was no such item in the prophecy?'

The auction list had been confirmed through Future Sight. However, no
such item had been seen anywhere in the short film of the future. There was
the intervention of a variable that shook Future Sight. Anna Croft glanced
at the constellations of Olympus. Some constellations nodded as if to
reassure her.
She didn't hesitate to case the Great Demon's Eye towards the stage. The
eye glowed with a red light. After a few moments, the hidden features of
the Old to New Toad were seen in Anna Croft's retinas. "I have to buy
that."

"Anna?"

[The first auction price is 500,000 coins!]

The moment the dokkaebi spoke, Anna Croft immediately made a bid.
"600,000 coins."

[600,000 coins have come out! The bidder… Incarnation Anna Croft!]

It was a larger amount than she thought but the Old to New Toad was worth
it.


  This item has a legendary story The item eats 'old items' and replaces
  them with 'new items' of the same rating.


The feature itself was simple. Eat old items and spitting out other items of
the same rating. The words were simply but the application was infinite.

"Contact the nebula and collect as many coins as possible."

"Why this item…"

"With this, we can get the items we want at any time."

The other constellations and incarnation didn't seem to know the usage
of this toad yet. Thus, she had a chance to win the bid right now. [The
highest bid is currently 600,000 coins! If there isn't any more…] At this
moment.

"700,000 coins."

Someone made a bid.

[Ohh! 700,000 coins have come out!]

There was a light from the other side of the audience that showed a bid. A
demon sword that absorbed the sunlight.

Anna Croft's expression hardened.

[The bidder is Incarnation Yoo Joonghyuk!]




Yoo Joonghyuk emerging after Anna Croft caused a small turmoil in the
auction house. Both of them were famous incarnations of Earth.

"Anna, if things go wrong…"

"This is fun. I never thought the Supreme King would be here."

Anna Croft was laughing. She raised her hand and cried out, "800,000
coins!"

[Incarnation Anna Croft has bid 800,000 coins!]

"900,000 coins."

[900,000 coins! 900,000 coins have come out!]
Yoo Joonghyuk didn't give up. It was an auction war they had to stick to.
The atmosphere of the auction house started to heat up after the amount
exceeded one million coins. It was a climb that could cause a price bubble
but Anna Croft was relaxed.

'You can't beat me'.

Dizziness occurred along with a short headache. A part of the future
emerged in Anna Croft's retinas. She used Future Sight and succeeded in
reading the maximum amount Yoo Joonghyuk could pay.

"1,280,000 coins."

[Incarnation Anna Croft has bid1,280,000 coins!]

Yoo Joonghyuk was silent at Anna Croft's bid. It was as expected.

[Now, if there are no further bids…]

Anna Croft smiled. 1,280,000 coins was a huge amount but it was hard to
see it as a loss. The Old to New Toad was a worthy item and if she obtained
it…

"2 million coins!"

The voice of a woman was heard from right above her and Anna Croft's
body whipped around. She wasn't the only one who was shocked. [D-
Did she say two million coins? Suddenly such an amount…]

"It is the emergence of Han Sooyoung, a newly rich person."

[Who…]

"Don't you know? Black Flames Demon Ruler Han Sooyoung, the leader of
the Han Sooyoung Corporation and the real power of Kim Dokja's
Company."
Lee Hyunsung, sitting beside Han Sooyoung, asked with surprise,
"Sooyoung-ssi, is that true? Since when…"

Anna Croft stared at Han Sooyoung with wide eyes. The Black Flames
Demon Ruler of the Korean Peninsula. It was a name Anna Croft knew
well.
"What trick is this, Black Flames Demon Ruler?"

"I just want that toad."

Anna Croft once again used Future Sight. It might be a short-term
prediction but using Future Sight so many times in one day placed a huge
burden on her body. Still, it couldn't be helped. This had already become a
showdown of pride.

The maximum amount of money that Han Sooyoung would pay appeared
before Anna Croft's eyes. How long had it been? Anna Croft wiped the
nosebleed that occurred from her overloaded body and opened her mouth.
"…I bid 3 million coins."

"Anna!" The startled Selena Kim shouted.

However, Anna Croft was adamant. "I must buy it."

Anna Croft's Future Sight showed that Han Sooyoung's amount of money
was 2,999,999 coins.

[3 million coins has come out!]

The dokkaebi was dancing with joy. Large cheers filled the venue.

[As expected of the prophet!]

[I heard she was shrewd and cunning but she was a big person!]

The audience was wowed but Anna Croft wasn't the least bit excited.
"Anna, 3 million coins is unreasonable. This is too much damage!"

"I can get a dokkaebi loan."

"Going so far…"

"It is a loss but in some senses, it isn't a loss. I can't concede it to them and
that is enough to make it not a loss."

"What…"

"The fact that they made such a large follow up bid shows they are
desperate for this item."

Anna Croft glanced at Han Sooyoung and Kim Dokja's Company. The fact
that they had come here showed they were likely to participate in
Gigantomachia. If they were going to meet one day, she needed to break
them now.

In fact, Han Sooyoung was raising both hands like she lost. "This… I can't
afford it. We lost. Completely and 100% lost."

"…"

"This is why the world is unfair. We can win against a golden incarnation."

…Something was weird. Anna Croft clearly won the bid but why did they
look like they were enjoying it?

[Those who have won the items, please come down to the stage.]

Anna Croft turned to the stage at the dokkaebi's call. The feeling of
discomfort still hadn't disappeared. She viewed the faces of Han Sooyoung
and the expressionless Yoo Joonghyuk. She wanted to use Future Sight but
she had already reached the limit for today.

'Wait, don't tell me?'
Anna Croft stood in front of the auctioneer and reflexively asked, "This
product, who is the contributor?"

[That… Kim Dokja's Company.]

"I won't buy it."

[Huh?]

The dokkaebi looked surprised.

[We can't refund products that have already been sold. If you do not pay the
amount―]

"This is obviously a scam. Thus, I won't buy it."

[A scam?]

Anna Croft pointed at Kim Dokja's group. "They induced an artificial price
competition. They had no intention of buying this item in the first place."

Han Sooyoung clicked her tongue at Anna Croft's claim. "What are you
saying? I really wanted to buy it."

"Even if you wanted to buy it, this auction is invalid. They are the
contributors of this product. Isn't it forbidden for contributors to participate
in the auction?"

In the end, Han Sooyoung and Yoo Joonghyuk glanced at each other. The
senior dokkaebi spoke [That… it is correct. It is certainly forbidden for
contributors to participate in the auctions of their own products.]

Anna Croft nodded like she knew it. "Please check the contributor. The
contributor will surely be one of them."

[Okay. Please wait a moment.]
The members of Kim Dokja's Company were making troubled expressions.
On the other hand, Anna Croft's expression was filled with relief and
triumph.

It was a pretty good trap. She was the prophet yet she almost got hit. By the
way, the dokkaebi checking the contributor cocked his head.

[Strange. None of them are the contributor.]

"Huh?"

Han Sooyoung laughed. "Didn't I tell you? Ah~ I really wanted that toad…"

"Then the contributor is…"

At this moment, the door of the auction house opened wide. A dazzling
light entered from outside the auction house and the white coat was shaken
by the wind.

The man in the white coat walked passed Han Sooyoung and Yoo
Joonghyuk. The man who came up to the stage was someone Anna Croft
knew well. The man smiled and held out his hand like he was asking for a
handshake.

"3 million coins."

It was Kim Dokja.
               Chapter 319: Ep. 60 -Taste of Ruin, IV


I was able to come here thanks to the message sent by Han Sooyoung. I
already knew that Han Sooyoung took the Old to New Toad. It would be
odd if I was ignorant of her stealing an item.

–I want to screw with the prophet. Will you come?

I was just going to check the auction house so it didn't take long. Anna
Croft had moved as I expected.

–You came.

–You came at the right timing?

Messages came from the Midday Tryst at the same time. There was
temporary confusion and Yoo Joonghyuk and Han Sooyoung glanced at
each other.

"…What?"
"I should say that. You have Midday Tryst as well?"

I couldn't help smiling at the two snarling people. I looked ahead and saw
Anna Croft's completely lose expression. I formed a fist and provoked her.
"What are you doing? 3 million coins please."

It was our first meeting after the Gourmet Association. Selena Kim stood
next to Anna Croft and nodded lightly to me. Anna Croft furrowed her
brow and asked, "Demon King of Salvation, you are the contributor of this
product?"

"That's right."

"No… you shouldn't be able to acquire this level of item. It is an item
that can only be obtained in the late scenarios."

She was still denying reality. I glanced at the dokkaebi instead of
answering. The dokkaebi spoke,

[The contributor is Constellation Demon King of Salvation, who belongs to
Kim Dokja's Company. The confirmation result is correct.]

Anna Croft became paler once the dokkaebi testified to the fact. 3 million
coins. At the present time, there wasn't a single incarnation with such a
large number of coins in the Star Stream. It was a lot of money and was
also a burden for some narrative-grade constellations.

In the distance, Han Sooyoung twitched.

–Hey, you will give me a share of the 3 million coins, right? You wouldn't
have received this money if it wasn't for me.

Anna Croft's fist trembled. She glanced at Selena Kim before turning back
to me. "I'm sorry but I can't give you the winning bid."
Anna Croft's expression gradually returned to normal. "Rather than
receiving the item, I will pay the penalty."

The prophet made a choice. It was currently difficult for her to obtain three
million coins. Moreover, her desire to buy the item disappeared after
knowing the 3 million coins would enter my hands.

[Your understanding of the character 'Anna Croft' has increased!]

I nodded and said, "Well, do as you please."

Han Sooyoung glared at me.

–Hey, are you crazy? It is 3 million coins!

–This is good for us.

As Anna Croft mentioned, the Old to New Toad was a very useful item,
especially when I thought about the upcoming Gigantomachia. It was better
to have an item than three million coins.

The senior dokkaebi spoke, [The penalty is 500,000 coins, which is the
initial bid.]

Besides, I received 500,000 coins without giving anything. I was grateful.
Anna Croft thought of something for a moment before slowly pulling out
the coins. However, she took out one million coins, not 500,000 coins.
"Demon King of Salvation, do you want to make a bet with me?"

"A bet? I don't want to."

"…I heard that you like to bet. It is disappointing to hear you refuse so
easily."

I laughed at the childish provocation. This was suddenly funny. Anna Croft
continued speaking, "If you win the bet, I'll give you one million coins,
which is double the amount."
"One million… then if you win?"

"This story never happened and we will each go our own way. You won't
lose any money."

I saw Anna Croft's red eyes and recalled a sentence from Ways of Survival.
Anna Croft was a gifted gambler. Long before the scenario began, she was
called the 'Prophet of Las Vegas'.

I opened my mouth. "Why should I if I don't lose anything? I will get
500,000 coins even if I do nothing. Why should I agree to a strange
gamble?"

"You must be afraid to lose. Well, you will get a 'Losing Story' if you lose
to me."

…Look at this.

[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' is paying attention to
your choice.]

[The constellation 'Secretive Plotter' is focused on your choice.]

[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' wants you to refuse the bet.]

Anna Croft's smile widened like she heard the indirect messages in the
channel. "Demon King of Salvation. Your constellations are watching."

[Many constellations are curious about your choice.]

[Some constellations are condemning your cowardice.]

She was a clever woman. In the period before Gigantomachia, the opinion
of the constellations was important. I could make allies, reinforcements or
enemies depending on my actions. By the way, this provocation…
I grinned and opened my mouth. "I'm not afraid. I just don't like the betting
conditions."

Anna Croft's eyes widened.

[The constellation 'Dragon Lying Down' is interested in your words.]

"Conditions. Do you want to add more to the bet?"

"The coins are only that much. I would like to add one more condition."

"One more condition…?"

"If I win, release the Lord and Vassal Pledge hanging on Selena King."

[The constellation 'Friend of Justice and Harmony' is shocked by your
words.]

[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' is nodding at your words.]

Selena Kim's eyes shook. Perhaps Selena Kim had been bound during the
Proof of the Stars before coming to the Context of the Constellations. There
was no way Anna Croft would have someone beside her that she couldn't
control.

Anna Croft looked confused. "Demon King of Salvation! That…"

"Can't you free Selena Kim if you borrow the probability of Asgard?"

It would be a significant burden on Anna Croft to liberate the lord and
vassal relationship formed during Proof of the Stars. The fact that she made
the lord and vassal relationship in the first place was evidence that she
didn't fully trust Selena Kim. Anna Croft struggled for a while before
replying, "… Okay."

Selena Kim stared at me with surprised eyes. Then Biyoo's voice was heard
from the air.
[Baaat!]

[A number of constellations are requesting the 'bet' scenario.]

[The request of the constellations has been accepted.]

[A new sub scenario has arrived!]


  [Sub Scenario ― Entertainment of Ruin]
  Category: Sub

  Difficulty: ???

  Clear Conditions: Anna Croft and the Demon King of Salvation have
  made a bet. The subscribers and incarnations can make a bet on who
  will win.

  Time Limit: ―

  Compensation: Dividends will be distributed based on your percentage
  of the winning bet.

  Failure: ―


[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' has bet 50,000 coins!]

[The constellation 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' has bet 50,000 coins!]

[The constellation 'Bald General of Justice' has bet 1,000 coins!]

Interestingly, this scenario was a scenario where beings other than Anna
Croft and myself could participate. The startled Han Sooyoung spoke
through Midday Tryst.
–Hey! What are you thinking?

–Just bet some coins.

–To who? You?

I spoke towards Anna Croft. "Tell me about the bet."

"It's simple."

Anna Croft threw the coin that read 'one million' into the air. The coin rose
to over 30 meters in the sky and stayed there. "You just need to grab the
coin with your hand."

The constellations were shocked when they heard the contents of the bet.

[The constellation 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' is surprised.]

[The constellation 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' is asking for his coins to
be returned!]

Han Sooyoung frowned.

[The constellation 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' is avoiding the gaze of
Incarnation 'Han Sooyoung'.]

The coin had a floating skill and hovered in place. At first glance, it was a
simple and easy bet. I just had to jump using my skills and grab the coin.
However, the simplicity of the bet meant there was a pitfall.

Han Sooyoung told me,

–Hey, Kim Dokja. It is a trap! Don't make the bet!

I knew it already. This Anna Croft would never make a losing bet.

"Do you agree with the bet contents?"
"Okay."

[The formation of the bet has been completed!]

I looked at the coin spinning in the air. In a situation where many
constellations were watching, she couldn't have done anything strange to
that coin. This meant the coin itself wasn't the trap and the trap was
elsewhere.

[The exclusive skill 'Bookmark' is activated!]

[The exclusive skill 'Way of the Wind Lv. 11 (+1) is activated!]

30 meters was quite high and it was almost impossible to grab that coin
with my bare hands if I was an ordinary constellation. However, since the
scenario started, I wasn't an ordinary person.

I used Way of the Wind and jumped lightly, my body springing towards the
sky. The remaining distance to the coin was 10 meters.

At this moment, someone interrupted me.

[The probability of the nebula 'Olympus' is responding to you!]

It wasn't one person. A powerful status came from all over the audience.
The incarnation bodies of some constellations stood before me.

[Demon King of Salvation! Cancel your skill right away.]

I felt their status from the true voice. The ones standing in my way were
from Olympus. There were three historical-grade constellations and one
narrative-grade constellation.

I spoke in a cold voice, "What are you doing?"

[It is forbidden to use combat skills here. Don't you know?]
A familiar doll popped out from among the constellations. It was a
constellation with meteorites swirling overhead. I knew this person's
modifier. It was because this boy was obviously a constellation of
Olympus.

'Wandering Terror'.

Someone in the audience shouted, [Wandering Terror, Phobos! It is Ares'
son!]

The son of one of the 12 main gods of Olympus, Atrocious War God. The
god of terror created by war. This was Phobos who was called Wandering
Terror.

I looked down at Anna Croft. It seemed this guy was the backer that Anna
Croft believed in.
               Chapter 320: Ep. 60 -Taste of Ruin, V


"King of Salvation, what are you doing? Go and take the coin." Anna Croft
spoke provocatively. "Or maybe it wouldn't be too bad to admit defeat
neatly.

I slowly looked around at the constellations in the audience and then
Phobos in front of me. The information of Ways of Survival passed through
my head.

「 The nebula that exerts the greatest power in the Context of the
Constellations is Olympus. The nebula maximizes its power in certain areas
and the most representative one is the auction house. 」

This was why Anna Croft could be so relaxed. The biggest event that could
be reached through the Context of the Constellations was Gigantomachia.
Thus, the organizer Olympus was the force with the strongest influence.

"You seem to have misunderstood something… I have no intention of
fighting."
[Once again, you can't use skills here. Return to your seat. Otherwise,
you will be bound by the authority of the 'legal zone'.] He was a person
that wasn't easy to talk to.

[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' admires Olympus'
stubbornness.]

If I used a skill to retrieve the skill, the constellations would exercise the
authority of the 'legal zone'.

In other words, Anna Croft knew from the beginning that I couldn't use
skills and made this bet. I spoke to Phobos, "It is Anna Croft who used a
skill first. Shouldn't you punish her first?"

[Incarnation Anna Croft has already received permission to use skills from
Olympus.]

"Then give me permission."

[You can't.]

"Why?"

[I can't tell you the details. The auction is over and you should leave here
with your party.]

Anna Croft was looking at me with a peculiar smile. There was no laughter
in my mind.

…Yes, she had calculated up to here?

Han Sooyoung heard the story and cursed. "What is this dog?! Are you
joking right now?"
Yoo Joonghyuk also pulled out the Black Heavenly Demon Sword. The
bear Lee Hyunsung made a threatening sound as he banged his gloves
together. I warned Han Sooyoung.

–Stop the party. Don't move at all.

–What? Hey, this is ridiculous. If we don't move now… –

If we fight here, we will be doing what they want.

–You are going to play her game?

–Can't I?

I waved my hand in a reassuring manner and looked back at Phobos. "Then
I'll take the coin as scheduled."

[What?]

At the same time, I used a skill.

[Giant Story 'Demon Realm's Spring' has begun!]

I suddenly opened the giant story and the complexion of the constellations
turned white. He didn't know I would open this and the startled Phobos
shouted. [Demon King of Salvation. I don't know what you're thinking but
you're making a mistake.]

"A mistake? What mistake?"

[This is the 'legal zone' of my nebula. Don't you know that when you start a
riot, you will be bound by probability?]

I took a breath and immediately replied with my true voice. [So? What do
you want to say?]

I activated Electrification through Bookmarks.
[Don't you know how much I've been holding back in the meantime? It has
been from the time you messed with my fate.]

Phobos was the son of Ares. Perhaps this guy helped make my nasty fate.

[What…?]

[Try to stop me, if you have the ability.]

The story of the Demon Realm added to the magic power of Electrification.
The white magic power and black magic power spread like a gradient.

Phobos was still unable to grasp the situation and shouted. [You! You dare
to be hostile to Olympus!]

[Tell this to the 12 gods.]

I swung my fist as hard as I could towards Phobos, who was raising his
status.

[Kim Dokja's Company, I'm going to aggressively grow the company.]

There was an explosion in the center of the auction house and Phobos'
bloody body flew through the air. There was a bombardment of
Electrification and Phobos' incarnation body screamed terribly as he was
buried deep into the ground.

[Many constellations are astonished by your actions!]

[The nebula 'Olympus' has noticed your actions!]

I looked down at the groaning Phobos. Wandering Terror was still a
narrative-grade constellation. He wasn't an easy opponent to hit. However,
he was careless because I was a constellation in a small nebula and this was
the result of his neglect.

[Where is the legal zone you were talking about?]
The dejected constellations of Olympus stared at me and stepped back.

[You have committed a criminal act in Olympus's legal zone!]

The probability restraint didn't act immediately. I activated Way of the
Wind and jumped into the air, snatching the coin.

[1,00,000 coins have been acquired as a scenario reward.]

At the same time, system messages poured out.

[The sub scenario ― Entertainment of Ruin has ended.]

[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' is cheering!]

[Some constellations are applauding your courage!]

[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' is concerned about your
safety!]

[The winners of the bets have sponsored you 100,000 coins!]

I gained 1.1 million coins with one blow. It was a very profitable business.

[Grab that bastard! Do it now!]

Some of the constellations shouted but none of the Olympus constellations
came forward. It was due to the power of the giant story that I showed.

Anna Croft was watching me from the ground. "Your body is light
compared to the power you have, Demon King of Salvation." She lost a
million coins but she wasn't disappointed. It was because she knew what
would happen next.

"Now you'll be trapped in Olympus' prison." The constellations who
disturbed the legal zone were imprisoned in Olympus. "It also means you
won't be eligible to participate in Gigantomachia.
I laughed as I watched Anna Croft.

[I know that much.]

Maybe Anna Croft didn't know. I was aiming for this from the beginning.

[The probability of the nebula 'Olympus' is binding you.]

[Your incarnation will be transferred to the court of justice in Olympus.]

A bright light poured out and someone started to swallow me. Han
Sooyoung shouted, "Kim Dokja! Where are you going again? You crazy
bastard!"

The probability of the legal zone finally started to work. All the troubles
that occurred in this auction house would be handled according to the will
of the local jurisdiction.

I smiled at Han Sooyoung.

–I'll be back!

"You deliberately…!"

–I'll see you in a week. Remember what I said? Prepare well.

I could hear Han Sooyoung shouting something. They were mostly curses.
The next moment, my body disappeared in the light. There was a short
dizziness from the forced dimensional movement. I opened my eyes with a
small groan and saw that I was thrown into a dim darkness. By the way… I
didn't come alone.

"…Why did you come?"

I turned to see Yoo Joonghyuk holding onto my shoulder.

"I can't just watch you do your crazy plans again."
As expected, this guy knew what I was going to do. "Those crazy plans
have saved you so far."

"Where do you plan to die alone?"

I stopped talking because something appeared in the silent darkness. I
turned my head and a small staircase appeared in front of our eyes. On top
of this staircase were two thrones. Two dolls were hanging on the throne.
My skin got goosebumps just by looking at this. Even the mighty Yoo
Joonghyuk couldn't endure it and grasped the hilt of his sword. In
particular, one of the two dolls contained a great status that we couldn't
measure.

[Demon King of Salvation, did you have to do this?]

The woman sitting on the throne sighed. The woman seemed to lift the
darkness just by walking.

I bowed towards her. The woman who descended the stairs was
Persephone, Queen of the Darkest Spring. "…It's been a while. Your
appearance has changed again."

Persephone smiled faintly at my words. [I'm interested in Eden these days.
You seem to like this constellation, right?]

"Yes, I like her but…"

[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' likes your words.]

[By the way, there is someone who is very angry with your rudeness. Do
you know?]

"I know."

「 Anyone who has committed a transgression in Olympus' legal zone will
be placed in front of the most terrible judge of Olympus. 」
Originally, it would've been one of the judges of the Underworld greeting
me, not Persephone. Perhaps I would be jailed for a short time in Tartarus
under a proper verdict. Nevertheless, I met Persephone instead of a judge.
Maybe it was because Persephone interfered.

"I'm sorry, there was no other way. All portals to Olympus were blocked."

[…Huhu, you are really cocky to shoot at the sky.]

The air in the area froze. The darkness solidified because of the sound.
Breathing became more and more difficult and it was hard to move even a
finger. It was amazing that someone's will could have such power by itself.

[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' is making an
interested expression.]

[The constellation 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' is filled with a
competitive spirit.]

[The constellation 'Maritime War God' truly feels admiration.]

[The constellation 'Bald General of Justice' can't close his surprised mouth.]

The constellations in my channel reacted violently. Perhaps it would be
difficult to find anyone with a stronger status in all of the Star Stream.

[I'll introduce you, Demon King of Salvation.]

I turned and saw a faint light in the darkness. There was someone in the
center of the rich darkness. How could I describe it in words? A man who
looked like darkness itself. The obsidian eyes embedded in pure white skin
seemed to penetrate into my existence.

[Giant Story 'Underworld' has begun.]
One of the oldest myths in the world was looking at me. It was always
mentioned together with the myth of Olympus but in fact, it didn't belong to
Olympus. The loneliest and most solitary constellation in all of Ways of
Survival. In order to pass through this Gigantomachia safely and to save
Yoo Sangah…

I had to surely borrow the hand of this constellation. I took a deep breath
and slowly opened my mouth. "King of the Underworld, Father of the Rich
Night."

The night of the Underworld looked down at me. The creepy air pressured
me but I couldn't be pushed here. It was because I was here as the
representative of Kim Dokja's Company.

"Do you want to try making the real Gigantomachia with me?"
              Chapter 321: Ep. 61 - Gigantomachia, I


The atmosphere was scary. Hades was silent for a long time and it was
unknown what he was thinking. I tried to hide my nerves.

「 Kim Dokja thought: This is the first hump. 」

The surrounding air became increasingly heavy as Hades opened his mouth.

[The real Gigantomachia… Do you know the weight of those words?]

"I know."

The Gigantomachia hosted by the great nebula Olympus. It was the festival
of the Star Stream where five or six sub-giants trapped in Tartarus were
released and hunted in order to enjoy an old victory.

Hades spoke, [The war ended long ago. The gods won both Titanomachy
and Gigantomachia.
Hades was right. The real war was already over thousands of years ago.

[It is already a predetermined history. What is the point of recalling it? Why
are you trying to recreate Gigantomachia?]

"…That is what I want to ask you. Why do the constellations of Olympus
continue to make fake Gigantomachia?"

[…?]

"Why do you call that scenario Gigantomachia, summoning and killing the
giants and reenacting the old battles?"

My knees involuntarily quivered in front of Hades' furious status. The
distant Persephone was upset and alternated looking between me and
Hades. The moment Persephone opened her mouth, I shook my head at her.

I shouldn't receive help here. With my own strength, I had to endure it
without kneeling.

[Giant Story 'Demon Realm's Spring' is protecting the best narrator.]

It wasn't comparable to Hades' Underworld but we also had a story. The
story we had accumulated with our power. I used the power of this story to
oppose Hades. "In fact, it is because of fear."

The big nebulae were filled with fearsome and powerful beings. They were
also the most cowardly in the Star Stream.

"You are afraid that the giants will rise again. Thus, you will take out the
soul of the dead and trample on them, giving a reminder of the ugly
triumph."

There were many ways to make the 'real' disappear. One way was to create
countless 'fakes'. Worthless and common fakes. The desperate battle
became a play that was replicated countless times. A story that was a
laughingstock to everyone. Gigantomachia lost its authenticity long ago. It
became a scenario that no constellation was truly afraid of.

I looked up at Hades and asked, "Father of the Rich Night. How long will
you let Tartarus be Olympus' toy?"

He didn't belong to Olympus but was considered to be one of Olympus'
three great masters. I suddenly recalled his setting in Ways of Survival.

「 Hades supplied a number of giants to Gigantomachia but never
participated in the scenario. 」

The king of the Underworld had watched the suffering of the giants trapped
in his prison for a long time.

「 Hades knew the sorrows of the prisoners and understood their pain. He
was like a prison guard educated by the prisoners. 」

"The last time I visited, I saw a giant soldier in the underground of Tartarus.
Haven't you been preparing for this time?"

[…That is speculation.]

To the 12 gods of Olympus, Hades would've explained the existence of the
giant soldier in a different way. It was in case the giants once again made a
war. However, I knew Hades' real idea.

"I know that you hate the 12 gods."

[…]

"Despite being one of the three heads, to them you are just a guard taking
care of troublemakers."

The oldest guard in the world might be no different from prisoners. Hades
quietly looked down at me.
[Gigantomachia is a terrible war.]

"I know."

[Once the real Gigantomachia starts, it isn't only the giants who become the
toy of the scenario. Everyone there will become part of the giant story.]
Hades spoke with distant eyes that seemed to see destruction.

[The dokkaebis will run wild and there will be an upheaval in the Star
Stream. The dynamics of the nebulae that have lasted for a long time will
collapse.]

"I'm also aware of that."

[What do you want to gain from displaying that terrible pain to the world?]

It wasn't me who answered.

[The story 'King of a Kingless World' has started the story.]

[The story 'Person who Opposes the Miracle' has started the story.]

[The story 'Demon King of Salvation' has started the story.]

[Giant Story 'Demon Realm's Spring' has started the story.]

All the stories I accumulated answered for me. There was also a story I saw
for the first time.

[The story 'Life and Death Companions' has started the story.]

All the stories flowed towards the proper ending.

[…A little human has very amazing dreams.]

"The smaller you are, the bigger the dream."
[You know about Stage Transformation.]

I nodded. I already knew what Hades would say.

[The 12 gods aren't the problem. Once the war begins, the ancient heroes
who led Gigantomachia to victory will reappear. The moment they
encounter the giants, Stage Transformation will begin and the tragedy of
history will be repeated.]

"There are also heroes on this side. The stage will be smashed."

Yoo Joonghyuk glanced at me and frowned. Hades opened his mouth again.
[There still remains one decisive problem.]

"The main characters of the stage."

I looked down at the ground. In the underground of this old prison, the
protagonists of the old Gigantomachia will be waiting for me.

[Do you think they want Gigantomachia?]

"The beginning is Gigantomachia but the end will be different."

I smiled and answered, "If they don't want it, I have to make them want it."




After Kim Dokja disappeared, Han Sooyoung was busy appeasing the party
members. "Shit, am I some type of babysitter?"

Lee Gilyoung and Shin Yoosung were sitting blankly in their seats while
Lee Hyunsung's huge body was crouched down in the middle of the
children as he muttered something. Han Sooyoung sighed and pressed the
party members "Hey! Everyone, wake up. This time, he went with Yoo
Joonghyuk.
Of course, it didn't work.

"Dokja hyung… Dokja hyung again…"

"I should've locked him up at that time…"

Lee Jihye and Lee Seolhwa tried to soothe the children while Han
Sooyoung was thinking about the problems she faced now. Kim Dokja and
Yoo Joonghyuk were taken away so she had to take care of the preparations
for the rest of the week.

"Now is the real Han Sooyoung's Corporation…"

[A message has arrived via the Unidentified Wall.]

It was from Jang Hayoung.

–Hey. Han Sooyoung, are you well?

Han Sooyoung became wide awake as contact was finally made. It was
time for the transcendent party to return.

–Where are you now?

–I am about to return to Earth.

–Why didn't you come sooner?

Since there was no other place to confide in, Han Sooyoung started to vent
her accumulated anger through the Unidentified Wall. The things that
happened in the meantime, what happened to the party members…

Han Sooyoung, who usually didn't talk much, strangely had a lot of words
when using the 'wall'. It was the feeling of receiving a consultation.

–In summary, Kim Dokja came back and is gone again.
The window widened and the message window of the wall became a
screen. On the screen, Jang Hayoung and the Breaking the Sky Master
could be seen.

–Hey! Why are you telling me now? When did Kim Dokja come back?

–That isn't important right now…

The next moment, there was a strong noise from the screen and the subject
of the conversation changed. At first, she thought there was a bug on the
screen and wiped it. However, the bug looked good and started talking.

–Has my disciple returned?

A small man sat on the head of the barking Breaking the Sky Master and
shouted in a stern voice.

–Show him right now. The guy who left and didn't find his teacher when
coming back must be severely punished!

The next moment, someone pulled the bug from the screen. Then a small
mountain appeared on the screen. No, looking closely, it wasn't a mountain.
It was someone's nose.

–Where did that guy go?

…It was the Breaking the Sky Sword Saint. Han Sooyoung summarized
what happened as much as possible. The Breaking the Sky Sword Saint
listened to the story and thought about something for a moment.

–If he was taken from Olympus' legal zone… he must be trapped in
Tartarus. Then there is no need to worry.

Han Sooyoung was a bit surprised by the unconcerned voice. Before she
could say something, the giant nose looked somewhere and muttered with a
nostalgic voice.
–I don't know if they're doing well.




Yoo Joonghyuk and I were thrown to the first floor of Tartarus.
Persephone's face was playful as she patted my head and told me.

[Demon King of Salvation, it won't be easy to convince the giants.]

"Somehow you look happy."

"It has been a long time since this type of incident happened in Olympus. I
can secretly help along with my husband, but that wouldn't be fun, would
it?]

"No, it would be good if you help―"

[I pray for the blessing of the story, Demon King of Salvation.]

I was expecting her to help me. The Underworld shouldn't officially
participate in this scenario. If the Underworld participated in
Gigantomachia, the scale and probability of this war would be out of
control.

Therefore, this war should be in the form of a 'rebellion' that proceeded
under the tacit approval of the Underworld.

We crossed the first floor of Tartarus. The prisoners working on the first
floor were still pouring their energy into the giant soldier. Some of them
glanced at us but none of them were very interested. It seemed they were
new prisoners.

"Do you think you can convince the giants?"

"I don't know. I'm going to see now."
In the dungeons of Tartarus, those beyond imagination were trapped. It
wasn't just the giants but also the constellations and transcendents who had
committed all types of evil actions against Olympus. They were monsters
that Yoo Joonghyuk and I could never deal with at the moment.

"It will be tough. There is only a week."

"Somehow it will work out. By the way, don't you have someone to meet
here?"

Yoo Joonghyuk stared at me as he wondered how I knew. If my memories
were correct, it was the existence who taught Giant Body Transformation to
the former Yoo Joonghyuk.

"I have someone to meet. I have to recruit him as a colleague."

Colleague?"

"Originally, I would've never made him a companion but I changed my
mind."

We stopped at the same time. We had to stop. Something huge was
blocking our way.

"…By colleague, do you mean the one talking to the dog?"

The entrance down to the second underground floor. There was a giant dog
that blocked it. The three-headed monster dog, the cerberus.

I looked up at the dog. To be precise, I looked at the giant soldier stroking
the dog's head. One of the cerberus' heads was biting the giant soldier's
upper arm.

[Hahaha! Yellowy! Bite!]

Yiiiip!
[I won't be hurt by this much!]

The gloves were made of a tough metal. In the original novel, it was a story
weapon that Hades himself used.

"Hey." I waved my hand and the giant soldier looked over. He trembled as
if surprised and soon answered in a loud and jubilant voice. […Subway
grasshopper? Hahaha! You finally came to hell? Right?]

I smiled wryly. In order to win Gigantomachia, I needed the help of this
gundam otaku. "I came to pick you up, Kim Namwoon."
                Chapter 322: Ep. 61 - Gigantomachia, II


[…Pick me up? Why?]

"I need you."

Kim Namwoon stared at me like I was speaking nonsense. Speaking of
which, I felt strange. I also didn't expect that I would say this.

I recalled Kim Namwoon of the 1863rd round. A man with white hair who
liked Lee Jihye and had a good relationship with his colleagues. The guy
who was immature, didn't care for his surroundings and was deeply
selfabsorbed.

「 Kim Namwoon is an evil person. There is no changing this fact. 」

I saw Kim Namwoon's possibilities but my prejudice against him hadn't
completely reversed. I decided to use Kim Namwoon because of a
conversation with the 1863rd round Han Sooyoung.
–You won't be able to reach the 95th scenario with that mindset.

Han Sooyoung, Yoo Joonghyuk and I were different. However, if we
agreed on one thing, it was that every story pursued a moment of efficiency.

[The constellation 'Secretive Plotter' is interested in your choice.]

[The constellation 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' is interested in
Incarnation 'Kim Namwoon'.]

I didn't see Uriel's message so she must be busy teaching Jung Heewon. If
she knew I was here then Jung Heewon would be furious again. I was glad
she was left in Eden.

Kim Namwoon opened his mouth. [I don't want to. Why should I help
you?]

I thought he would say this. "You don't have to if you don't want. Let's go,
Yoo Joonghyuk."

I approached the cerberus with Yoo Joonghyuk.

[What? Where are you going?]

"Downstairs."

[Ahaha, are you joking? Now Yellowy is staring at you!]

As if to prove it, the half-dozing cerberus raised its head and bared its teeth
at us. At this time, Yoo Joonghyuk used the Breaking the Sky
Swordsmanship. Previously, it would be hard to deal with the cerberus on
the first underground floor but now it was different.

"…You aren't gentle at all."

"There is no time to waste here."
The cerberus was hit by the blow and collapsed on the ground with its
tongue lolling out. The prisoners were surprised by the violence and alarms
rang out everywhere. Normally the judges would run over but there was a
tacit agreement with Hades. We would be safe for the time being.

We walked past the collapsed cerberus and down towards the second
underground floor.

[Crazy… crazy guy!] Kim Namwoon's baffled voice was heard.

Yoo Joonghyuk glanced at me.

–…Are you just leaving? The giant soldier is useful.

–Just watch.

We started down the circular staircase towards the second underground
floor. The end of the circular staircase wasn't in sight. According to legend,
the depths of Tartarus was so great that a dropped anvil fell for a long time.

[Wait, I'll come along!]

Kim Namwoon hurriedly followed after us. The body of the giant soldier
was reduced to around two meters. Pluto was a giant soldier that could
scale to fit the user's convenience.

I teasingly asked him, "Why are you following us when you said you didn't
want to help?"

[That… I'm a bit bored.]

The smiling mouth couldn't hide his feelings.

[By the way, what are you going to do? Where are you going? Huh?]

"I'm going to meet the giants."
[What?]

Kim Namwoon made a blank expression for a moment before shouting,
[Kuhat… uhahaha! Hey, subway grasshopper! I saw it at the time but
you are really crazy. Do you know what the giants are?] Of course, I
knew.

[Once you meet those ■■, a hole will be punched through your ■■ in a
moment…]

[The prisoner filtering is activated!]

[The contents have been filtered to ensure the correct language usage in
Tartarus.]

[Prisoner 'Kim Namwoon' has received one penalty point.]

[This sh■!]

[Prisoner 'Kim Namwoon' has received two penalty points.] Even if I didn't
hear Kim Namwoon's curses, I knew what the giants were.

The giants. A race that dominated in the early days of Olympus. There was
a dizzying roar and I involuntarily stopped. Down in the distance, the giants
had already noticed our existence and were reacting. It was only some of
the 'status' but it was enough to cause goosebumps.

[Crazy. This is crazy…]

I ignored Kim Namwoon's words and called out to Biyoo. Then Biyoo
popped out from my chest.

[Baat?]

"Is the channel well controlled?"
[Baaat!]

"Since all broadcasts of the Underworld are off the record, only let the
constellations who have vowed not to reveal the information into the
channel."

Biyoo nodded and started to manipulate the channel. Some of the
constellations complained but now was the right time to do this. The less
exposure there was from now on, the better it would be.

Not long after, some constellations sent messages.

[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' is grumbling and
accepts the agreement.]

[The constellation 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' isn't satisfied but agrees to
make a pledge.]

[The constellation 'Secretive Plotter' says he already made a vow.]

I watched the pouring messages and Kim Namwoon expressed his
admiration.

[Wow, this channel…]

Kim Namwoon died before even choosing his sponsor so he might be
surprised by the indirect messages of the constellations. All the way down
the stairs, Kim Namwoon continued to talk loudly.

[By the way, the Underworld King sent you all the way down here? That
ahjussi is really stern.]

"…Shut up. Open your mouth one more time and I'll cut it off."

[What? Do you want to fight? You want to play?]
Yoo Joonghyuk's gaze towards Kim Namwoon was complicated. Yoo
Joonghyuk already knew Kim Namwoon. In the last round, Kim Namwoon
was also Yoo Joonghyuk's companion.

"Yoo Joonghyuk. Don't waste power here. Don't you know?"

Kim Namwoon smacked his lips when he saw Yoo Joonghyuk raising his
sword. He looked like a child as he breathed with excitement. A child who
hadn't received attention for a long time and was alone.

In response to my question about why she used Kim Namwoon, Han
Sooyoung of the 1863rd round replied:

–No one is born a bad person from the beginning. It is all set up by
the writer. The writer gave the narrative to be a bad person. I didn't
like this.

I also agreed with Han Sooyoung's words to some extent. However, Kim
Namwoon of this world pressed the wrong button first. He instigated the
worst crime by inciting the people on the subway.

[My heart is pounding. It is the first time I've felt like this since my father
and mother abandoned me.]

"What do you feel?"

[It feels like a new adventure is waiting for me.]

Obviously, Kim Namwoon was created. Should I blame the writer of Ways
of Survival? Or should I blame myself for not stopping Kim Namwoon
properly at the time?

I opened my smartphone and a new message was floating.

[The 'fourth revision' update is currently in progress.]
…I knew it would update soon. There were many things going on that it
would be strange if this was quiet. As I headed downstairs, I opened Ways
of Survival and read the necessary parts. It was best to read Ways of
Survival when my mind became uneasy.

「 Kim Dokja thought: The third round I am living no longer resembles any
of the original rounds. 」

Still, I might be able to find a similar part. There were many scenes about
the Underworld in the original Ways of Survival.

The 47th round, the 211th round, the 397th round… there were many.
However, the Underworld had never appeared at 'this point' in those rounds.

「 We have to gather all the information available. 」

「 We can't win Gigantomachia if we don't persuade the giants. 」

There were remnants of Olympus throughout the pages of Ways of
Survival. The sea was parted with a single gesture. Trampling on
transcendents and constellations. The 12 gods of Olympus brutally
destroying planets. Once I left here, I would have to face them head on.

Many pieces of information passed through my head regarding things that
could be used and things that couldn't be used.

"Kim Dokja."

"What is it?"

Yoo Joonghyuk gazed at me quietly before speaking in a low voice. "It's
nothing."

What was with this bastard? Suddenly speaking out of the blue. I
immediately used Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint and was exposed to Yoo
Joonghyuk's thoughts.
「 You don't seem confident. 」

I felt like I had been stabbed. Maybe I showed my feelings on my face
more than I thought. I deliberately opened my mouth and spoke in a loud
voice.

"There are two things I need to get in the Underworld. "One is the giant
god's armour and the other is the giant god's oath."

"…Neither will be easy."

"I guess so."

"The harder it is, the better the rewards."

I smiled while listening to Yoo Joonghyuk's words. Not long after, the
entrance to the second floor of the Underworld appeared. As expected, the
cerberus was guarding it. It was bigger than the one on the first floor. The
moment Yoo Joonghyuk pulled out his sword, Kim Namwoon cried out.
[Wait! Don't hit Yellowy!]

"Get out of the way. There is no time."

Kim Namwoon stroked the cerberus and spoke. [I know the location of the
track elevator that the judges use.]

The track elevator. There were clearly such things in Tartarus. A hidden
transport mechanism that only the judges could use. However, the exact
location of the elevator wasn't explained in Ways of Survival.

I asked doubtfully, "How do you know that?"

[I've been sneaking downstairs with it.]

"How many floors?"

[The 77th floor.]
I was startled. The 77th floor gained the gateway to the lowest floor.

[Follow me. It's this way.]

Kim Namwoon walked forward confidently and Yoo Joonghyuk and I
glanced at each other.

Surprisingly, this guy was helpful.

…As expected, I should've kept him alive? No, this time he was helpful
after dying so I did a good job of killing him.




The track elevator was really fast. The second underground floor, the third,
the fourth underground floor… the elevator descended in an instant and
along the way, we could see the terrible scenes of Tartarus. The prisoners
attacked each other and the demons in the terrible brimstone fire shouted at
us.

"Newcomers!"

"Hey! What are you staring at? Lower your eyes!"

Among the laughing prisoners, transcendents could be seen. They had
committed crimes in Olympus' legal zone like me or were held captive due
to the 12 gods. Some of them would become food at the Gourmet
Association's dining table.

Then the elevator stopped and we got off at the 77th underground floor.
The 77th floor was a prisoner-free floor. A space reminiscent of a large,
hollow cavity and its width couldn't be measured. The center of the space
contained a generously sized door.
[There is no Yellowy on the 78th floor. They are useless.]

A cerberus couldn't stop a giant. It might be possible for a campe.

Kim Namwoon hesitated before stating. […I've never been there before. I
put my hand into it previously but this was what happened.]

I looked at the scar left on the shoulder of the giant soldier. It was almost
healed now but the damage seemed enough to tear off the arm.

It wasn't perfect but Pluto was a terrible weapon capable of exerting power
equivalent to a narrative-grade constellation when there wasn't a passenger
on board. Yet this weapon received such damage.

I approached the door. The door was over 30 meters in height and there was
a pattern similar to a human face.

Yoo Joonghyuk said, "There must be an offering to enter."

Kim Namwoon was surprised by Yoo Joonghyuk's words. [How do you
know that?]

I ignored Kim Namwoon and replied, "I know. I'm ready."

"If your offering is too powerful, you will call the ancient giants."

"I'll have to meet them eventually."

"…Not now. We will die if we meet them now" There was tension in the
expression of the prideful Yoo Joonghyuk.

There were different types of giants in Tartarus. One type was the rulers of
Olympus who caused Titanomachy, the ancient giants called the titans. The
other type was the gigantes who caused Gigantomachia. If I had to divide
them by levels, it was the difference between a myth-grade constellation
and a narrative-grade constellation. The ones I dared to call were the
gigantes.
"Don't worry. A titan-grade giant won't emerge unless there is a high-grade
item among the star relics…"

At this moment, an earthquake occurred.

[The configuration of Tartarus is becoming unstable!]

The moment I realized something was wrong, the door suddenly opened
and a huge hand grabbed Yoo Joonghyuk.

"Yoo Joonghyuk!"

I reached out for Yoo Joonghyuk as two more hands emerged from inside
the door. I hurriedly dodged using Electrification but Kim Namwoon wasn't
lucky.

[Uwaaaack! Save me!]

The next moment, more than 10 hands covered me. My body became a
mess in the closed space created by the hands and by the time I came to my
senses, I was hanging upside down in the air. My shaky vision could see the
huge hand that grabbed me.

[The exclusive skill 'Fourth Wall' is strongly activated!]

Sparks bounced and the 'status' was so full that it filled the surroundings. I
felt like my existence could burst apart at any moment. A huge, blunt
finger was tapping my ass. [There is a cute fly.]

A huge eye resembling the Breaking the Sky Sword Saint stared at me.
              Chapter 323: Ep. 61 - Gigantomachia, III


[Little child, who are you?]

Three of the countless arms that stretched out from the gods were holding
me, Yoo Joonghyuk and Kim Namwoon. I hung in the air and stared at the
giant with disbelieving eyes.

The door opened so easily? I couldn't understand it. The door that sealed
the place below the 77th floor originally couldn't be opened from the inside.
It was the same in the 47th round and the 211th round. That's why I
prepared the offering in advance…

[Um… the probability is difficult. It's getting worse these days.]

There was a sound and sparks of probability appeared around the bodies of
the giants. The giant pulled off one of its fingers and threw it at the door.
The sparks rushed like they had been waiting and melted away the finger.
Then the sparks slowly faded away. It was an unbelievable sight.
The probability was replaced with one finger? Such a thing wasn't possible
in any of Yoo Joonghyuk's rounds. An aura rose faintly from the giant's
body. The depths were hidden by an enormous 'status' that was
unfathomable was sleeping inside the giant.

One of the oldest existences in the world. Myths accumulated over the
years. My heart trembled just counting the years on the surface. This was a
titan. It was unmistakably a titan. The myths that stirred in the giant's body
were worn but still alive. It was much different from the original novel I
knew.

「 The energies of the ancient giant that Yoo Joonghyuk met was on the
verge of death. 」

It was strange. All the giants relied on the giant stories of Titanomachy and
Gigantomachia. As the influence of the myth weakened or the distortion of
the traditions grew, their power weakened as well. Due to the habitual event
of Olympus, their giant stories should've been considerably weakened by
now.

[Boy, aren't you going to answer? I am confident in waiting because my
patience is as deep as the sea. I have already been waiting a long time but
there is no reason I can't wait longer.]

However, there was an unbelievable vitality coming from the giant in front
of me. Thoughts passed through my head.

「 Maybe it is because I came to the Underworld too early? 」

Gigantomachia hadn't happened yet and perhaps the decline of the giants
hadn't exceeded the threshold.

The giant continued speaking. [However… I don't know if my other friends
will be the same. It has been a while since children as delicious as you
entered.]
Kim Namwoon was shaking and didn't even think of answering. The giant
stroked Kim Namwoon's cheek like he was cute.

[You are a child with deep sin. A child like you is delicious to eat. The
body of a giant soldier itself… were you the one torn last time?]

The prisoners who crashed underground while trying to escape Tartarus
were usually fed to the giants. Kim Namwoon struggled and would already
be foaming at the mouth if he was human.

The giant's gaze turned to me again. [You have many good smells. A
constellation, angel, demon, human… there is even an outer god. What type
of stories are these?]

I didn't answer. Sometimes this was a clearer answer than words. The
opponent might be an ancient god but I couldn't be intimidated from the
start.

[The status of a 'demon king' is released!]

I emerged from the grip of the giant and the giant's appearance became
clearer. The size of the giant was beyond my imagination. It was almost
100 meters in height… in the first place, I couldn't fight this existence.

[I'm going to eat this child.]

[Let's tear him in half.]

Voices came from all over the place. I opened my mouth and gave a cold
warning. "We aren't prey."

"We have come to negotiate." Yoo Joonghyuk also contributed.

Yoo Joonghyuk released his transcendence and also escaped the giant's
hand. However, the giant replied in an unconcerned manner. [It isn't your
decision.]
I knew it would be like this. The destruction of the giants ultimately derived
from this arrogance.

I used my true voice without further delay. [It is nice to meet you. The great
'Hundred-Handers, the three Hecatoncheires brothers.]

At my words, 300 eyes simultaneously opened in the darkness. These eyes
belonged to only three giants.

The three giants spoke at the same time.

[Interesting. You came here knowing about us?]

50 heads and 100 arms, the Hundred-Handers. I knew the names of these
titans.

The strongest storm, Briareus.

The rushing stone, Cottus.

The changing limbs, Gyges

They were living myths who had experienced both Titanomachy and
Gigantomachia. All the stories of Olympus were accumulated in their
bodies. If they were 'books', I felt like I could sit here for decades reading
them.

[The Fourth Wall is greedy for the taste.]

Perhaps this was a myth. The oldest story in the world. Things that had
been passed down to mortals and finally formed a worldview.

The appearance of the three gods was the same but their eyes were different
colours. Briareus had blue eyes, Cottus had brown eyes and Gyges had
green eyes. I gazed at the hundreds of eyes and opened my mouth again.

[I have come to liberate all the giants from Tartarus.]
My true voice echoed and spread. Perhaps it was enough to be heard by all
of Tartarus, not just the Hecatoncheires. In the darkness, the sound of some
giants moving their bodies was heard. However, nobody opened their
mouths.

It was because the titans in front of us didn't say anything. The reactions of
the Hecatoncheires to my words were different. Cottus was grumpy while
Gyges looked tired. Only Briareus was different.

[What a funny joke. I want to eat you even more.]

I didn't back down despite the intimidating threat and smiled. "As you can
see, I'm too small for you to taste. You will have to eat more than me."

I looked over at Yoo Joonghyuk. As if he had been waiting, Yoo
Joonghyuk's muscles started twitching. Soon after, Yoo Joonghyuk's body
started to grow. 2 meters, 3 meters, 4 meters… Yoo Joonghyuk's height
increased rapidly as he held the Black Heavenly Demon Sword while
gazing at Briareus. Half of the many eyes were filled with doubt.

[…Giant Body Transformation? How do you have that skill?]

"I learnt it from you, Briareus."

The power of the Breaking the Sky Swordsmanship filled the Black
Heavenly Demon Sword. Like a little hero going against the myth, Yoo
Joonghyuk growled out. "To be exact, it was the you of the last 'round'."




Technically, Yoo Joonghyuk's teacher was only the Breaking the Sky
Sword Saint. The source of the power he possessed was the Breaking the
Sky Swordsmanship trained through countless regressions.
However, Yoo Joonghyuk didn't learn only one skill. Through numerous
regressions, Yoo Joonghyuk had learnt various techniques from various
beings.

Giant Body Transformation was one of them. It was gained through the
stigma Transmission. In particular, Briareus who taught the Giant Body
Transformation had a small connection with Yoo Joonghyuk. The evidence
was the blue eyes that resembled the Breaking the Sky Sword Saint.

[A little while ago, a young giant visited here. I heard a story in exchange
for awakening that child's 'destiny'… I wanted something but it was about
you.]

In the First Murim, I promised to send the Breaking the Sky Sword Saint to
Tartarus in exchange for her help. Perhaps Breaking the Sky Sword Saint

told him about us at that time. I didn't know what the stubborn transcendent
had said but I thought the story might be resolved well.

[…The singularity mentioned by the constellation.]

[The presence moving a giant wagon…]

[The scenario is really heading towards ■■…]

There was an unknown tiredness in the voice of the giants who wanted to
eat us a while ago. No, it was a voice close to resignation rather than a
sense of liberation.

[I am interested in you. Then how do you want to liberate us?]

"I want to create Gigantomachia."

I cut to the chase. I had ended up meeting the titans and it wasn't good if I
couldn't get the job done.
The three Hecatoncheires brothers were the protagonists of Gigantomachia
and Titanomachy. With these three, it wouldn't be impossible to overturn
Gigantomachia. "This side is ready. If you try―"

[I refuse.]

I was a bit hesitant at the decisive answer. "Why?"

[Young child. You won't understand.]

Funnily enough, his words were true. I couldn't understand why they would
refuse the offer.

The three Hecatoncheires brothers and the giants were detained for a long
time here in Tartarus. They hated this prison more than anyone and had a
deep grudge against the 12 gods. Why did they refuse to be liberated?

「 Kim Dok ja's head is ba d. 」

I quickly recalled the contents of Ways of Survival but couldn't come up
with the correct insight.

The information f the giants wasn't described in detail in Ways of Survival.
As the contact with the giants increased in the second half of the novel, Yoo
Joonghyuk would rather pull out his sword than talk. I mean… just like
now.

–Stop. We were really screwed if he moved his sword here.

I saw Yoo Joonghyuk release the hilt and looked back at the giants. I had to
remember. How could I convince these lumps that were tens of thousands
of years old?

Unexpectedly, Briareus opened his mouth first. [Young child, how many
Gigantomachias do you think there are in the world?]
At this moment, letters appeared on the faces of the giants. The stories of
the giants were started to speak. The sentences contained very old feelings.

[The effect of the 'Scenario Interpreter' is activated!]

[Your understanding of the story has increased sharply!]

I was able to glimpse the memories of the giants through these sentences.
The history of the long-ago Titanomachy and Gigantomachia.

[The result of all scenarios is fixed. We are just a part of that scenario. We
have already fought in numerous Gigantomachias that you don't know.]

The 60th scenario, Gigantomachia. In that scenario, the giants were
trampled on. Olympus won the war and periodically reopened
Gigantomachia. The giants were brought to war again and again. They were
dressed in ragged clothing and equipment and were hunted by hundreds of
armed constellations and incarnations. The bloody wounds were false and
their bravery mocked.

[We were defeated.]

It happened 10 times.

[We lost.]

100 times.

[Another defeat.]

It repeated over 1,000 times.

[Now you are telling us to stand on the battlefield again.]

Just like the regressor Yoo Joonghyuk.
[How long will you call out the spectres of the past? How long will you
turn over the dead shells of the myth and insult them?]

The giants were 'regressors' in a different sense than Yoo Joonghyuk.
Finally, they were exhausted by the 'regressions'.

[Child, we don't want liberation. We are no longer curious about the story.]
              Chapter 324: Ep. 61 - Gigantomachia, IV


Over the years, the giants had forgotten the anger from the first
Gigantomachia. The repeated scenarios took away their will and tarnished
the glorious days.

Now the 60th scenario, Gigantomachia was merely a festival
of constellations where several giants were conscripted.

[Please go back.]

Rather than resisting the world, the giants chose to be forgotten from the
world. Their despair was so huge that I was speechless for a moment. It
would've been nice if Yoo Sangah was here right now. She was better at
convincing people than me.

"The commanders of a mythical era… they aren't a big deal."

It was a uniquely rude tone. Surprisingly, Kim Namwoon was the first one
to open his mouth.
"Lumps, you aren't dead like me."

Despite the terrifying status of the giants, his small mouth was still moving.
Kim Namwoon shouted in a strangely heightened accent, as if it was his
end and he wanted to have no regrets. "Those who are alive can change the
future. Yet you're already giving up? They say that gods are greater than
humans and have enormous mental strength? ■king bull■! Whining after
losing a few times…!"

A bloody aura rose from the giants. I quickly moved in front of Kim
Namwoon to stop him. "You can still change. This Gigantomachia is
completely different from the ones before."

[History doesn't change.]

"Have you already forgotten that you were betrayed by the God of
Lightning? Have you forgotten how you fell to the abyss of Tartarus after
helping him win Titanomachy?"

Yoo Sangah wasn't around but I remembered what she told me. Yoo
Sangah was excellent in world history and mythology. I recalled the time
when she persuaded King Heungmu the Great with her words. "How was it
during Gigantomachia? It was a fight you could win. It was a fight you
could win if it wasn't for the help of human heroes. Do you want to be
recorded as a myth that was forever defeated?"

[Cheeky child. You don't understand…!]

"I understand. Your despair, I understand it all."

It was a lie. It was because I didn't know about them. However, it also
wasn't a lie.

"I know someone who was in the same position as you but he didn't give up
to the end, unlike you."
We could only understand the other person through our stories.

"I knew a man who was desperate thoughts of times in front of a world
greater than him, yet never gave up."

Yoo Joonghyuk and Kim Namwoon looked at me. Briareus asked, [Whose
story are you talking about?]

"The story of a hero I know. I can tell you if you like."

Briareus laughed at my words. The deep distrust was filled with ridicule.

[Hidden behind the wall.]

…The presence behind the wall. At this moment, I heard the world
creaking.

[I know that you have a fragment of the Last Wall. You are hiding behind
it and avoiding the attention of other constellations.] It was true.

[Do you think there is any authenticity in the words from such a coward?
You can't persuade us.]

Funnily enough, I couldn't refute the words. It felt like he pointed
out something that I had ignored for a long time. [The Fourth Wall
is indignant!]

[The Fourth Wall is saying not to listen.]

Unexpectedly, it was the constellations who helped me.

[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' condemns the
weakness of the giants!]

[The constellation 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' thinks the 'Strongest
Storm' is pathetic.
[The constellation 'Secretive Plotter' is shaking his head.]

Briareus was surprised by the sudden burst of indirect messages.

[You have great sponsors in your channel… spectres of the scenario. You
still remain? I wonder what the story is that you are chasing after this little
boy.]

I stared at the indirect messages pouring from the air and worried for a
moment. I didn't take long to make a decision. "I'll release the wall."

[The constellation 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' is looking at you with
astonishment!]

[The constellation 'Secretive Plotter' is watching you with serene eyes.]

"Then will you listen to my story?"

「 Kim Dok ja can't do th at. 」

There were intense sparks around me as the Fourth Wall spoke.

「 I can't d o it. 」

'Just once. It is okay even for a moment'.

「 It wi ll be dan ge rous. 」

The Fourth Wall stood firm.

[The 'Fourth Wall' is shimmering faintly.]

In fact, I wasn't confident either. I wondered if my mind could fully endure
it once this wall was completely gone. Still, I had to do it.

「 Ab so lute ly not. 」
'I will forcibly turn it off if you don't listen'.

The Fourth Wall shook more strongly at my threat. The Fourth Wall
that always protected me. I didn't want to fight it. Eventually, the first
one to yield was the Fourth Wall. 「 No t every thing… 」

'Then?'

「One pa rt on ly. 」

The moment I was about to answer, I heard the sound of the sky collapsing.
There was an artificial crack in something that was snugly wrapped around
me. My head became cloudy and my calm heart suddenly became uneasy.

[Part of the Fourth Wall is opened.]

I started to feel like I was going crazy. My vision turned red and my heart
jumped quickly. I was dizzy.

Some of my stories released their voices.

[The story 'Hell of Eternity' has begun.]

[The exclusive attribute 'Scenario Interpreter' is activated!]

The things I had been through in the 1863rd round were floating around in
my head. I looked out and letters were pouring out from me. It was the
story of Ways of Survival that I had read. In the feast of fascinating stories,
I lost my breath for a moment.

There was Yoo Joonghyuk. It was Yoo Joonghyuk of the original novel that
no longer existed. Some of the rounds I remembered became fragments and
they were passed on to the Hecatoncheires. I started retching.

「 I killed him. 」
「 It shouldn't be like this. 」

「 I could've stopped it. 」

Even so, I didn't lose my mind. I was obliged to tell this story. Only I
remembered this story.

「 "I won't give up. One hundred times, a thousand times. I will go back a
few times and surely kill all of you." 」

There was Yoo Joonghyuk fighting against Olympus.

The 150 eyes of the giants widened in unison.

「 "I will kill all of you without leaving a single thing left." 」

Yoo Joonghyuk's rounds were flowing out. Yoo Joonghyuk fought. In the
211th round, he killed one of the 12 gods. In the 325th round, he killed two
of them. In the 438th round, he killed four. The number of rounds suddenly
exceeded four digits.

「 "I told you. You will die." 」

He declared. He swung his sword. He put his words into practice. In the
meantime, there were the Gigantomachia scenarios where the giants were
defeated. Yoo Joonghyuk held the heads of the 12 gods and laughed.

「 "You can't survive forever." 」

The eyes of the giants were amazed as they looked at the heads of the gods.
There was Yoo Joonghyuk who kept fighting and fighting. In the 1863rd
regression, Yoo Joonghyuk slaughtered the constellations.

Every time Yoo Joonghyuk killed, the fists of the giants shook. In the eyes
of the giants, something long lost was waking up again. In the end, the only
way to convince someone was the story.
The lost sensibility was woken up. Their old willpower was being
rekindled. They were being told that life was possible. It was just a story.

[The exclusive skill 'Fourth Wall' is activated!]

The story was soon cut off. I lost strength and collapsed, only for somebody
to help me. They were Yoo Joonghyuk and Kim Namwoon.

The giants were looking at me.

[So…] The giants asked me. [What happened next in the story?]

[What happened next?]

I was well aware of the desire seen in these eyes. "Do you want to know?"

While hating the scenario, they were curious about the next scenario.

[…I want to know.]

"Find out for yourself."

At my words, the eyes of the giants shook again. The chapped lips that
declared they weren't curious about the next story were twitching in unison.
The answer came back after a long time.

[…Do you think you can win?]

I knew what they were asking and answered confidently. "I can win."

300 eyes were looking at me. How long had it been? The number of eyes
started to increase. 300 became 400 and then 500. In the darkness, countless
Gigantes appeared around the three Hecatoncheires brothers.

[Giants, listen.]

The feet of the myths descended.
[We… will fight in Gigantomachia.]

There was an earthquake along with the sound. All the giants in Tartarus
started swarming. One by one, the giants started stomping their feet.

Kung. Kung. Kung. Kung.

The sound of the feet unceasingly moved to the beat. The giants rose in
unison and a grand spectacle unfolded.

Kung. Kung. Kung. Kung.

A step towards ruin. I barely breathed as I watched the giants rising like
waves in the darkness.

It was pretty hard but it was successful. At this time, Persephone's true
voice was heard in the air.

[You better hurry, Demon King of Salvation. Olympus has already taken
out the 'giants' to join Gigantomachia.]

"…Why have they already pulled out giants?"

[You don't know. Gigantomachia has already started.]

"What do you mean? There is still a week."

[Have you forgotten that time flows differently in the Underworld?]

I made a mistake. The moment I was about to ask for the time outside, I
heard the voices of the giants.

[How many were taken to Gigantomachia?]

[This year, there are four.]

…Four?
"There is no way. There should be five giants in this scenario."

The giants gazed at me and answered, [Four.]

I quickly opened the smartphone and checked Ways of Survival.

「 There are five giants in this year's Gigantomachia. 」

There was no doubt. According to Ways of Survival, there should be five
giants in this year's war.

Yet only four were pulled out? At this moment, I got shivers.

I glanced back and saw that Yoo Joonghyuk had a serious expression. "Kim
Dokja."

All the giants in the Star Stream were trapped in Tartarus. Apart from one.
Apart from the half-giant we knew.
              Chapter 325: Ep. 61 - Gigantomachia, V


"Hah, it is really Earth…"

Jang Hayoung sighed as he crossed the portal and swept back his blond
hair. Gwanghwamun unfolded before him. He had returned home after a
long journey. "Are you happy about coming home after a long time?"

Jang Hayoung looked back and the Breaking the Sky Sword Saint was
exiting the portal. The Breaking the Sky Master moved through her legs.
Kyrgios Rodgraim was sitting on the Breaking the Sky Master's head. It
was the transcendent party who left to train in a different dimension.

"Not so much…"

"Are you Jang Hayoung?"

Jang Hayoung's words were cut off by a stranger's voice. They turned
around and a man was looking at them. Based on his clothes, he wasn't
Korean.
"Yes."

"Then is the giant behind you the Breaking the Sky Sword Saint?"

"That's right."

The Breaking the Sky Sword Saint replied and the man expressed his
admiration. "Hah, it is a great person. I've been waiting for you. I am called
Flying Fox."

"A Murim person. What do you want?"

"Young Mister Kim said to wait for you here."

"Young Mister Kim? Are you talking about that skinny guy?"

"If that skinny guy is referring to Kim Dokja then yes." Flying Fox kept
speaking, "'The Returnees Alliance will soon invade Seoul'. That's what he
said."

"…Cheeky student. I told him to come back quickly."

Kyrgios spoke with a frown. They also knew about the Returnees Alliance.
In particular, the Breaking the Sky Sword Saint had heard separate stories
from Kim Dokja and Yoo Joonghyuk.

"The Returnees Alliance… in the other world line, I was killed by them."

Not all returnees chose the virtuous path like Flying Fox. The Returnees
Alliance was a representative group that chose the path of violence and
domination. "It looks like you neglected training in that world, Breaking the
Sky Sword Saint."

"The opponents were the Heavenly Demon and Blood Demon. You can't
look down on them."

"Whoever comes, you won't die in this world. We will fight together."
The Breaking the Sky Sword Saint laughed lightly at Kyrgios' assertion. "I
don't think I'll die either. If I die here, I can't hit by cute student's butt."

The Breaking the Sky Sword Saint clenched her fists as she spoke. She
didn't know how strong she was in the other world. However, she was
certain that now she had stepped into another realm.

The Breaking the Sky Sword Saint was reminded of the battle with
Indescribable Distance three years ago. She couldn't measure the end of that
outer god. The Breaking the Sky Sword Saint never forgot the terror of that
day when she faced a disaster beyond the constellations.

She preserved the First Murim and gained a giant story, before visiting
Tartarus to open the fate of a 'giant god'. The enemy she couldn't deal with.
In the last three years, the Breaking the Sky Sword Saint had been training
for a rematch with the outer god.

Then a strange feeling was felt in the distance.

"Something is coming."

Along with Kyrgios's words, Jang Hayoung and the Breaking the Sky
Master also took their places. At this timing, it must be the Returnees
Alliance.

The Breaking the Sky Sword Saint quickly issued a command. "Kyrgios
and
I will take care of the Heavenly Demon and Blood Demon. Hayoung and
the
Breaking the Sky Master will protect the civilians of Seoul…"

The next moment, the body of the Breaking the Sky Sword Saint was
surrounded by a bright light.

[The destiny of a 'giant' is found in 'Namgung Minyoung'!]
"What?"

[The forced scenario transfer has begun!]

[The stigma of myth can't be rejected.]

"Master!" The startled Jang Hayoung screamed but the Breaking the Sky
Sword Saint's body had already disappeared somewhere. Even the calm
Kyrgios couldn't stop his shaky eyes. Then in the sky, dark clouds started to
gather.

Kyrgios' expression hardened. "They are really coming this time."

The army of the Returnees Alliance was advancing towards Seoul. A great
feast of returnees.

The nervous Flying Fox muttered as he moved, "This is dangerous."




"Wait a minute, Yoo Joonghyuk!"

"There is no time. Kim Dokja, haven't you noticed?" Yoo Joonghyuk's
distorted face was angry. "The fifth giant is obviously the Breaking the Sky
Sword Saint."

"I know."

Originally, the Breaking the Sky Sword Saint wasn't a sacrifice of
Gigantomachia. It was because she didn't visit Tartarus, meet her kin and
awaken her destiny.

「 It is because of me. 」
This had happened because I twisted the deployment. "Teacher will be in
danger if we don't help right away. Didn't you hear that Gigantomachia
started?"

I gazed at Yoo Joonghyuk's face and shook my head. "She isn't in danger.
Rather, she is safe for the time being. Rather, it is someone other than the
Breaking the Sky Sword Saint who is in danger."

"What nonsense are you saying? If Teacher is designated as the 'giant' of
the scenario…"

Yoo Joonghyuk stopped as he noticed something. He also realized it. In
Gigantomachia, the 'giant hunting' event was designated as the last order.
Before the start of the hunting event, the giants were given absolute
protection in the scenario. If Breaking the Sky Sword Saint was really
taking part in Gigantomachia, she would be safe for now.

The problem was Earth, where the Breaking the Sky Sword Saint had
disappeared from.

"By now, the Returnees War would've begun."

We might've passed the 45th scenario but not everyone on Earth was the
same. The 45 scenario was still in progress and by now, the march of the
Returnees Alliance would've begun. Originally, the Breaking the Sky
Sword Saint was supposed to deal with the Returnees Alliance along with
the others.

Yoo Joonghyuk thought for a while before spitting out, "Seoul is in
danger."

Of course, Earth was powerful even without the Breaking the Sky Sword
Saint.
There were Jang Hayoung, the Breaking the Sky Master, Kyrgios, Flying
Fox, my mother and the wanderer forces. Gong Pildu and Han Myungoh on
the north side would also help.

However… the only ones who could cope with the Heavenly Demon and
Blood Demon were the Breaking the Sky Sword Saint and Kyrgios.

Yoo Joonghyuk struggled for a while before stating, "I will go to Earth.
You will take part in Gigantomachia alone."

"Is it okay?"

"There is no other way."

I threw the item I was holding in my hand to him. "Take this."

It was the Giant's Armour that I just received from Briareus. It was the main
armour used by Yoo Joonghyuk in the mid-to-late scenarios. Yoo
Joonghyuk grabbed it without a word and escaped from Tartarus with
Persephone's help.

Kung. Kung. Kung. Kung.

The giants preparing for war kept stomping their feet.

[Sub scenario - Myth Subversion has begun.]

[The possibility of a new story is germinating!]

Once this ceremony was over, the real Gigantomachia would begin. I gazed
at the giants before calling out to Persephone. "Your Majesty, I'd like to go
out as well."

[You can't go out.]

"Huh? Didn't you send out Yoo Joonghyuk?"
[He isn't a 'prisoner'. However, you…]

I glanced at the message floating in the air.

[You are currently imprisoned for committing a criminal offense on the
legal zone.]

[Remaining confinement time: 4 hours.]

[Rules are rules.]

I frowned. There were earth-shattering roars from the giants. If I waited
quietly for four hours in a place where I didn't know the time rate, I
wouldn't be Kim Dokja.




"Hey, did we come here to play?" Lee Jihye spoke with a blank expression
as she looked around.

[Welcome to the theme park, Gigantomachia!]

[Olympus' 12 work experience is in progress!]

The bustling group of incarnations and constellations were busily moving
somewhere.

[Experience Capturing a Wild Boar.]

[Experience Hunting a Namea Lion.]

…

Shin Yoosung and Lee Gilyoung were running around while wearing rabbit
ear headbands. "I've never seen a place like this!"
"Is this really the outfit that Heracles wore?"

It had been eight hours since the group entered the 60th scenario,
Gigantomachia. In these eight hours, the party members had watched a dull
video of Olympus, watched a poor fourth-grade monster that was called a
mythical wild boar and even saw a small hydra, less than 5 meters tall,
howling while trapped in a cage. "This is just an amusement park…"

Lee Hyunsung was able to get a lot of apples by participating in the Golden
Apple Farm event. The children were preoccupied with playing and the
soldier they believed in was like this.

Lee Seolhwa spoke, "The 60th scenario can't be like this. Stay focused."
She said this but a star-shaped headband that she bought as a souvenir was
flashing.

Lee Jihye looked at Han Sooyoung with a stricken expression. "Everybody
isn't sane… Sooyoung unni, say something!"

Han Sooyoung was sitting on a bench and eating candy. As the distracted
group played in the amusement park, Han Sooyoung was looking at the
progress of the scenario with sharp eyes.

[The next of the 12 tasks that incarnations and constellations will
participate
in…]

In particular, Han Sooyoung's eyes were focused on the most important
place in the center of the theme park. A man who seemed to be an event
helper at first glance was wearing ancient Greek armour and trinkets.

'There is a thick cover over his heel'.

There was only one hero in Olympus who had to be careful of his heels.
Troy's sorrow, Achilles.
He was yawning because the progress of the event was tedious. How much
time passed?

[Eh, they've seen enough so let's go to the point.]

The relaxed man's tone changed for the first time.

[Gigantomachia is an event that has been hosted by our Olympus for a
long time. Experience the greatest myth in the Star Stream personally.]
The gazes of the raucous incarnations focused in an instant.

[As you know, this scenario is designed for incarnations and constellations
who are about to enter the mid-to-late scenarios. Through this scenario, you
have an opportunity to be chosen by the 12 gods of Olympus.]

Han Sooyoung watched the ancient hero speaking like a dokkaebi and
smiled bitterly.

'They won't use a dokkaebi for the reputation of the nebula'.

Of course, they couldn't exercise the authority of a dokkaebi by doing this
but the performance was enough to stimulate the participants.

[Is that all? You can also gain a stake in the giant story thought the 'giant
hunting' event.]

'Some incarnations and constellations cheered at the words 'stake in a giant
story'.

Achilles laughed and declared. [Then let's start the game.]

At the same time, the main hall of the theme park started to open. The
sealed sphere opened and a pale light poured from the air.

[Introducing the first giant!]
The light disappeared and the figure of a legend was revealed. However,
the appearance of the giant was smaller than expected. The giant was only
around three meters tall.

[Haha, I see some people are disappointed. The first giant is smaller
because she is a mixed-breed. However, there is no doubt that she has the
story of the giants. So everyone, please start hunting!]

Han Sooyoung and the party members were watching the giant. Lee Jihye's
mouth was open in a trance as she rubbed her eyes. Then she exclaimed,
"That person…!"

Lee Hyunsung, Lee Gilyoung, Shin Yoosung as well. Everyone knew the
identity of the giant. It was because the giant was a colleague who had
fought with them. The party members' eyes widened as they faced the giant.

[Main scenario #60 ― 'Gigantomachia' has begun!]

[The first game has been decided.]

[Hunt the giant 'Breaking the Sky Sword Saint, Namgung Minyoung']

The first prey was Yoo Joonghyuk's teacher, the Breaking the Sky Sword
Saint.

[Why are you all still? Are you scared?]

No one moved despite the scenario starting. Thus, Achilles flew through the
air.

[It seems that everyone is afraid since this is the first time you're
experiencing Gigantomachia… it isn't a big deal. I'll give you a
demonstration.]

A star relic, the Ash Spear was held in Achilles' hand. A legendary spear
that killed numerous armed men in the Trojan War.
The incarnations cried out. Achilles was a hero of Olympus. There were no
giants who could go against him.

Han Sooyoung untied the bandage around her arm. The scenario was
important but they couldn't lose the Breaking the Sky Sword Saint here.

[Look. Being afraid of this―!]

Han Sooyoung rushed forward as Achilles's spear aimed at the Breaking the
Sky Sword Saint's heart. Then Han Sooyoung stopped. Achilles's charge
stopped in the air. The cheers of the incarnations ceased. The Breaking the
Sky Sword Saint's enormous hand was holding Achilles' head.

[Whether it is Murim or Olympus, giants always get the same treatment.]

Achilles hung in the air like a worm and struggled. The more he struggled,
the more the muscles on the Breaking the Sky Sword Saint's hand became
larger. A voice was heard from somewhere.

[You want to hunt giants?]

The Breaking the Sky Sword Saint's eyes were cold as she stared at the
incarnations and constellations.

There was a loud sound and Achilles' head was crushed.

[Then give it a try.]
              Chapter 326: Ep. 61 - Gigantomachia, VI


The ceiling of Tartarus was opening.

[Cracks have occurred in some areas of Tartarus!]

[Someone is trying to break out of jail!]

Along with the warning message that appeared in the air, the whole of the
Underworld was shaking.

[The judges of the Underworld have noticed the actions of the Demon King
of Salvation!]

Persephone warned in a sharp voice.

[…It is only this time. Please keep this in mind, Demon King of Salvation.]
Earthquakes occurred and a faint portal started to be made on the wide-
open ceiling of Tartarus. Persephone had opened an exit to the ground.
Briareus watched the scene and asked,

[What did you say to make the queen of the Underworld help you?]

"It was just some threats."

30 minutes ago, I sent the following message to Persephone.

–If you refuse to cooperate, I will spread the footage of Tartarus all over the
Star Stream.

Tartarus had many secrets of the Underworld, whether it was the secret
recruits they trained or the institutional facilities that were concealed. It
wasn't good if the hostile forces to Olympus received a secret report on
Tartarus.

Then Briareus shook his head. [Her Majesty was threatened by that?]

"She is on our side. She just needed a pretext to release me. It is an excuse
when things go wrong in the future.

If this Gigantomachia failed and Olympus picked up on what happened in
the Underworld, the Underworld would be in a difficult situation. Perhaps
my current blackmail would be a bit of a defense for the Underworld.

Of course, this was a story for when Gigantomachia failed but I didn't
intend to let that happen.

Briareus spoke, [You don't seem to know the king and the queen well.]

"Huh?"

Briareas gave a knowing smile instead of answering.

[You have received the Giant's Oath.]
[You have acquired a new semi-myth story!]

[The story 'Giant's Liberator' has been acquired.]

[This story is attributed to 'A Single Story'.]

Giant's Liberator. This was the first story I should obtain from this Olympus
war.

[Giant's Liberator. Soon the giants of this place will enter Gigantomachia.
Is there anything you specifically want?]

"There is no such thing. Just do what you want."

[…I'm becoming curious. Why do you want to reach ■■? No other
constellations have every built up achievement like you. Are you dreaming
of a 'perfect story'?]

A perfect story. Some people called 'A Single Story' by such a name. A
story that never existed before and was made up of stories that never
existed.

"I just want to see the end with my colleagues. Together without losing
anyone."

[It will be the hardest story in the world. There has never been such a

story.] It was true. A myth without any sacrifices didn't exist in this world.

[The probability of the Star Stream always moves in a way that forces
sacrifice. Fate won't easily let you go.]

"I won't know without trying. In addition, fate has already been overcome."

I remembered the damn fate given to me by fucking Olympus. Even now, I
gritted my teeth remembering it.
However, Briareus' expression was grave. [Have you overcome fate?]

Something suddenly flashed through my mind. According to Ways of
Survival, all titans were born with the power of prophecy.

[Liberator, 'fate' is a much broader concept than you think. The fate given
to you by Olympus is only a speck of dust in the world. The real fate is
inevitable. If you avoid it, probability must be distorted.

That twisted probability must be resolved by someone. That is why there is
no 'perfect' story.]

"I won't know if I don't try. I will do it if possible. My colleagues also aren't
weak enough to succumb to fate."

I jumped into the portal and declared, "Then let's meet in Gigantomachia."

Briareus nodded. [I wish you the blessing of the story.]




"Kyrgios."

"Yes."

"Maybe we need the story's blessing." Jang Hayoung muttered as he
watched the returnees approaching like cattle.

"There is no need if you have good training."

A sword scattering a silver-white light emerged from behind Kyrgios.

[Pure White Paradox.] It was a sword made by the masters of Peace Land,
Kyrgios's home for decades. It was Kyrgios' weapon that travelled with him
through numerous battlefields and had the same performance as a star relic.
The fact that Kyrgios, who rarely used a weapon, pulled out the sword
proved that the opponents weren't easy.

Two figures were flying at the head of the returnees. There was a
middleaged man in a gorgeous red uniform and one in a black and white
uniform engraved with the symbol of his school.

"Strange. I heard the Breaking the Sky Sword Saint was here."

''Are you mistaken again?"

"find the Breaking the Sky Sword Saint!"

The voices of the middle-aged men were profound. Kyrgios shot into the
air. The Murim people were surprised by the 'status' that filled the air and
instantly stopped.

Kyrgios opened his mouth. "You are the Heavenly Demon and Blood
Demon."

"Who are you?"

Kyrgios raised his aura instead of replying. Lightning poured from dark
clouds and part of it nestled in Kyrgios. Kim Dokja's flagship technique,
Electrification was now emitting a sublime aura from the founder.

"You can't know my name." The astonished returnees stepped back. "You
will die soon."

The white-blue lightning filled the sky. Anyone from Murim would know
the name.

"Is this Paradox Baekchung?"

Kyrgios' sword pointed towards the sky. As the probability ran wild,
Kyrgios's status clashed with the returnees. There was a vast wind pressure
and Jang Hayoung and the Breaking the Sky Master were pushed back.
The center of the sky contained the Heavenly Demon, the Blood Demon
and Kyrgios. Every time an attack poured out, the space screamed like
thunder. It was hard to believe that this fierce battle was a confrontation
between humans.

Jang Hayoung was ecstatic as he watched the battle. 'Someday, I can be
strong like this'.

–Jang Hayoung! Protect the industrial complex with the Breaking the Sky
Master's group!

Jang Hayoung came to his senses due to Kyrgios' sound transmission and
moved with the Breaking the Sky Master.

With the exception of the Heavenly Demon and Blood Demon, there were
approximately 1,000 returnees remaining. Among them were the 10 masters
of Murim.

A small storm raged around Jang Hayoung's fist. "Kuaaack!"

Some returnees were caught in the wind pressure but dozens of returnees
used their bodies as the jumping point. There were too many of them.

"Evacuate towards the industrial complex!"

Their side contained Jang Hayoung, the Breaking the Sky Master, Flying
Fox and other returnees. Apart from Kyrgios, only a few incarnations were
able to confront the transcendent returnees.

In the northern part of the industrial complex, a huge fortress approached
while firing.

Jang Hayoung's face became rosy. "Gong Pildu!"
Magic shells poured out from the fortress towards the returnees and victims
instantly appeared. However, the returnees soon maintained their ranks and
defended against the shells.

"Smash that fortress!"

Gong Pildu's Armed Fortress was suitable for defense, not attack. 200
returnees gathered and proceeded to Gong Pildu's Armed Fortress. The
number of returnees remaining was 400. The returnees crossed the walls
and entered the interior of the industrial complex.

Then as if waiting, the wanderer forces dedicated to defending the
industrial complex moved. Cho Youngran used the power of the First
Spiritualist of Joseon. Lee Boksoon fired her sniper rifle. Jeon Woochi's
techniques filled the air and bullets pierced the returnees.

"Kuaack!"

"The shaman! Kill the shaman!"

The innocent people were killed like fish caught in the waves. Cho
Youngran and Lee Boksoon started to be injured by the bombardment of
the returnees. The wanderers were pushed back and some returnees
shouted. "Listen up, leader of the Seoul area! If you give uour life, no more
meaningless sacrifices will occur!"

The key to the Returnees War was to defeat the leader of each force. The
core goal of the scenario that the returnees who invaded Seoul received was
to defeat the leader.

A moment later, a glowing light emerged from inside the industrial
complex. Cho Youngran's complexion paled as she kept defending.

"No! Sookyung!" The moment Lee Boksoon cried out, a woman emerged
from the industrial complex.
The Wanderer King declared, "I am the leader of Seoul."

In one hand, she was holding the broken Eight Beaded Bell and in the
other, she as holding a bronze dagger. A few returnees staggered back from
the aura that emerged from the Heavenly Symbols she was holding.

"There is no need to be afraid. She can't use the power of her sponsor!"

The returnees shouted and Lee Sookyung smiled bitterly. In the battle of
Dark Castle, most of the Founder's Mother's status was destroyed. Even so,
she had a way to fight.

「 Establish the center and become the wind. 」

The bronze sword Lee Sookyung was holding gave off a bright light.

[The constellation 'King Heungmu the Great' is surprised by the actions of
incarnation 'Lee

Sookyung'.]

[The constellation 'One-eyed Maitreya' is warning that it is dangerous!]

[The constellation, 'Seo Ae Il Pil…]

All the constellations of the Korean Peninsula warned her at the same time.
She knew. She was already familiar with what would happen if she did this.

Lee Sookyung glanced around the industrial complex. The image of the
sleeping Yoo Sangah blurred the window.

She thought of the children going to Olympus for Yoo Sangah's sake. The
upright soldier Lee Hyunsung, Jung Heewon who didn't tolerate injustice,
the fierce but brave Lee Gilyoung, the calm and gifted Shin Yoosung. She
also remembered Lee Seolhwa, who was warm-hearted and took good care
of the party members and Han Sooyoung, who often grumbled but had a
keen sense of humour.
Then she was reminded of her child. The time for that child to live. The
story she long dreamt about. The time she couldn't protect him.

The light from the bronze sword was as bright as the sun. Lee Sookyung
muttered very quietly. "Emperor of Heaven and the Wind God."

There was a constellation associated with each of the star relics of the
Korean Peninsula. The bronze sword Lee Sookyung was holding right now
was one of the Heavenly Symbols.

[The constellation 'Wind God of Heaven' is looking down at Incarnation
'Lee Sookyung'.]

Wind God of Heaven. One of the three constellations who held the highest
rank in Hongik. Now Lee Sookyung was making her last bet with her life as
collateral. "Come, Pungbaek!"

The sky opened and a blue aura roared around the dagger. The returnees
blinked at the blinding light. Lee Sookyung looked at the sky and the sky
looked down at Lee Sookyung.

'Just a moment. Please lend me your strength'.

Then the sky gave a warning. Blue-black lightning struck and Lee
Sookyung responded to the warning.

'It doesn't matter'.

The next moment, the sparks of probability appeared around Lee
Sookyung's body. Her bones were crumbling and her skin was burnt.
Amidst this pain, the hand holding the sword became heavy.

The force of wind that a human couldn't endure was nestled in her right
hand. This was one of the strongest constellations on the Korean Peninsula,
the power of Pungbaek.
From left to right, Lee Sookyung swung her sword. Then the space was
split apart. It was as if the world was split in half from the beginning.
Everything around her was torn by the absolute wind pressure that followed
the trajectory of her sword.

"Wh, at…?"

10, 20, 30… the number of returnees who died quickly surpassed 100. All
the returnees who crossed the walls were falling through the air with their
waist cut. Their faces showed they didn't understand the source of their
death.

Lee Sookyung held her trembling right hand and took shaky breaths. In one
blow, most of the returnees were destroyed. Of course, it wasn't everyone.

There were returnees who noticed the danger in the short time and moved
out of range. They were masters from the Third Murim and Fourth Murim.

"It's over. Kill her."

Lee Sookyung glanced at the masters rushing towards her and smiled. She
did everything she could. Dozens of swords rushed towards her as she fell
through the air. There was the sound of flesh being pierced and Lee
Sookyung sensed death.

However, she didn't feel the pain of being stabbed. She opened her eyes to
see someone's back. It was a very wide back.
             Chapter 327: Ep. 61 - Gigantomachia, VII


"Lee Sookyung."

Yoo Joonghyuk was there. The image that followed was the masters' necks
being pierced. The lifeless bodies crashed to the ground.

"…I didn't expect to get your help."

Yoo Joonghyuk ran with a blank expression and Lee Sookyung on his back.
Lee Sookyung didn't say anything but she could see where he was heading.
Perhaps he was looking for the medical staff of this industrial complex.

"Thank you."

The words spilled out and Yoo Joonghyuk replied indifferently. "Don't say
anything that isn't in your heart. I know you dislike me."

"Of course, I dislike you. I hate you. You are the person who took my role."
"I don't know what that means."

In Lee Sookyung's head, time flowed slowly. She heard that it should move
quickly… then why? Was it because it was hard and difficult?

"…I've known you from a long time ago. That kid often talked about
you. He came to visit his mother in prison and only talked about this." –
This time, he challenged the 12 gods of Olympus.

The young face of Kim Dokja as he talked happily. Many thoughts had
floated on this child's face.

Yoo Joonghyuk spoke like he felt Lee Sookyung's heart rate slowing down.
"Lee Sookyung. Don't let go of your mind."

Lee Sookyung barely maintained her blurring consciousness. She continued
to be drowsy on Yoo Joonghyuk's back. "In any case, at least once… I
wanted to thank you."

"You are saying things that I can't understand."

The back that was now carrying her had actually carried her son. The
middle school Kim Dokja and the high school Kim Dokja. He was the
support. He raised the child she couldn't carry. He made the child live.

–I thought that I wanted to be like him.

However, she was the one who wanted to be the owner of that back, more
than anyone else.

–Then… what did Yoo Joonghyuk do next? Are you curious Mother?

Her son's words continued throughout the visitation that only lasted 10
minutes.

–Yes, I'm curious.
The two people spoke and listened with a wall between them. A story with
adventure and life. The story of someone who wasn't related to her or her
son, but who lived hard. It was like talking through a wall.

The two people talked about Ways of Survival during those days. The
fictional story was their only possession. Now that story had become reality
and was carrying her.

Lee Sookyung murmured in a soft voice, "I was finally living my life…"

"Don't tell me."

Yoo Joonghyuk's back was wet with blood. Lee Sookyung's complexion
was gradually fading. There were still sparks of probability around her. In
her damaged flesh, the stories she had accumulated were evaporating. In
order to conceal it, Lee Sookyung purposefully asked about things she
knew. "Where are your parents?"

"I was told they died in an accident."

"You don't sound sad."

"I can't grieve what I can't remember."

Lee Sookyung knew. He didn't remember because it wasn't in the original
novel. Everything about Yoo Joonghyuk was just a character setting. From
the beginning, Yoo Joonghyuk's parents didn't exist.

Lee Sookyung hesitated for a moment. "Yes, humans are like this. Do you
think I remember all my childhood?"

"…Is it memory loss?"

"Everyone gets memory loss. Little by little, we will forget our memories
and one day, we will forget everything."
Lee Sookyung knew that her words wouldn't reach Yoo Joonghyuk. A
regressor who had lived three rounds. For an immortal man who would live
an unknown amount of time in the future, her words would be lighter than
the weight of dust.

Yoo Joonghyuk spoke, "Sometimes I remember things. I remember
someone watching me."

It was the first time Lee Sookyung heard this story and she wondered, "…
Who was watching you?"

"I don't know either. There was a gaze watching me for a long time. There
were times when I often felt the gaze."

After Yoo Joonghyuk's words were over, Lee Sookyung didn't talk for a
long time. There was a long silence before Lee Sookyung laid her hands on
Yoo Joonghyuk's head and spoke in a gentle voice.

"Maybe it was your parents."

Lee Sookyung stared up at the sky. Numerous constellations were watching
them. Her flesh was breaking. She felt the stories gradually pouring away
from her body. Her vision was blurry as Lee Sookyung kept trying to watch
the sky. It was as if she was trying to find a star somewhere.

"Lee Sookyung?"

Lee Sookyung's answer was no longer heard.




There was a bloody wind blowing in the theme park where the Breaking the
Sky Sword Saint appeared. Since Achilles' head was blown off as a
demonstration, several constellations rushed forward in succession but
received the same fate.

The Breaking the Sky Sword Saint's fists were covered in red. [You want to
recreate Gigantomachia with just this?]

The scared participants hesitated when the Breaking the Sky Sword Saint's
voice rang out.

Han Sooyoung and the party members watched the Breaking the Sky Sword
Saint from the fortress they were hiding behind. Lee Jihye spoke, "We don't
need to help."

"Can't we just hide here?" Lee Gilyoung added.

Han Sooyoung murmured while chewing on candy. "This doesn't make
sense. Can a giant be so strong in Gigantomachia?"

It was an indisputable fact that the giants were strong. However, this was
Gigantomachia, a scenario where the giants were defeated. In this scenario,
the giants weren't able to use their strength due to the influence of Stage
Transformation. Furthermore, against a hero like Achilles…

[…I underestimated this half-breed giant.]

The forgotten Achilles, whose head had been destroyed, was waking up.

[The constellation 'Troy's Sorrow' has invoked the Immortal Hero stigma!]

His crushed head was restored and the blood pouring from his body
stopped.

「 Achilles won't die until Achilles' heel is cut. 」

This was the strongest skill of the hero Achilles. The regenerated Achilles
was larger than before. His height reached over three meters and the
surrounding incarnations muttered. "…Giant?"
Achilles' body became as big as a giant. The Breaking the Sky Sword Saint
asked, [Are you a giant half-breed?]

[…]

[How funny. A person who inherited the blood of the giants became a
servant of Olympus?]

[I'm not a giant. I am Olympus' hero, Achilles!]

Han Sooyoung watched the collision between the two giants and
understood why Stage Transformation hadn't activated yet. Achilles was a
hero of Olympus but he wasn't a source of Gigantomachia in the past.
Moreover, he was a mixed-blood giant like the Breaking the Sky Sword
Saint.

A shockwave created by the clash between giants shook the theme park.
Achilles touched the palm of his hand like he couldn't believe it.

[Why does a half-breed have this power? I've never heard of your name.
What type of story do you have…?!]

The Breaking the Sky Sword Saint stared at the sky without speaking.

[My distance blood is said to have been castrated by the sky.]

She was transcendent. Unlike other constellations, she only had a few
stories because she pursued the highest strength. There was only one path
she had ever walked.

[The story 'Path of Breaking the Sky' has started!]

It was the power to break the sky, which gave her the name of Breaking the
Sky Sword Saint. An indirect message was heard as stories flowed steadily
from the Breaking the Sky Sword Saint.
[The power to break through the sky is favoured by the 'Breaking the Sky
Sword Saint'.]

[The strength of Breaking the Sky is opened!]

Achilles was astonished by the message.

[A giant who breaks the sky? Don't tell me…!]

The Breaking the Sky Sword Saint opened her mouth.

[You will have the same fate.]

There was a terrible aura flowing from the Breaking the Sky Sword Saint's
body. It happened the moment the faltering incarnations stepped back. A
large horn sound was heard from somewhere.

[The nebula 'Olympus' is in full swing!]

In the distance, a ship was coming from the sea. It was Argo.

[Giant Story 'Fellowship of Heroes' has started!]

The incarnations discovered a giant ship moving across the water and
screamed. It was because they knew who was riding the ship.

"The heroes! The real heroes are coming!"

"The constellations of Gigantomachia!"

The real heroes who fought in Gigantomachia, unlike Achilles, were
coming. There were also constellations flying in the sky.

The narrative-grade constellations of Olympus. It was a power that was not
comparable to Achilles.

[The Star Stream has announced the opening of the new stage.]
Finally, the Stage Transformation was going to begin. The momentum of
the Breaking the Sky Sword Saint started to rise sharply. Achilles regained
his courage and laughed at the Breaking the Sky Sword Saint.

[Hahaha! Young giant. You don't know the calamity you have brought!
You…!]

However, he couldn't finish his words. It was because someone popped out
from another portal and destroyed his head. Achilles collapsed to the
ground after his head was burst twice in a row. The man knocked down
Achilles and didn't hesitate to cut his heel.

[The constellation 'Troy's Sorrow' has died in pain.]

Achilles' giant body dispersed. Han Sooyoung laughed as she saw the white
coat blowing in the wind. "Shit, you should've come quicker."

Kim Dokja had returned from the Underworld. Kim Dokja sighed lightly
and looked at the party members. "Kim Dokja's Company. Are you ready?"
Kung! Kung! Kung! Kung!

Heavy footsteps were heard from somewhere. There was a deafening roar
from the ground as countless mountains appeared in the sky. The giant
mountains sprang up and destroyed the theme park.

On the edge of a mountain, Kim Dokja declared, "Now, let's start the real
Gigantomachia."
                 Chapter 328: Ep. 62 - God's Enemy, I


[The Star Stream has confirmed the possibility of a new giant story.]

[The interpretation of old stories is possible!]

[The characters who appeared in the myth are reconstructed!]

[Based on past myths, Stage Transformation will occur.]

After seeing the indirect messages popping up one after another, the great
dokkaebi 'Noksu' was silent. Originally, the 60th scenario Gigantomachia
wasn't relayed by the dokkaebis. They only had channel and airing rights
while the actual progress was done by the sub-heroes of Olympus.

However, the situation had changed. There was an explosion on the screen
and roars as the giants emerged from the ground.

–Where the hell did the giants appear from?
–The Underworld! What is going on in the Underworld?

–Shouldn't they be trapped in the underground prison?

Now Gigantomachia was a completely different story.

"…Who will relay it?" Noksu turned and asked two advanced dokkaebi.

"I'll do it."

"No, I will."

They were the director of the Korean branch Bihyung and the director of
the Japanese branch Dokgak. The two gazes met and currents filled the air.

Dokgak exclaimed, "Great Dokkaebi! Bihyung can't do this. He has been
broadcasting Incarnation Kim Dokja for too long."

"I'm familiar with him so I can broadcast it better. In addition, since when
will you still call him incarnation? He is a constellation."

On the screen, the incarnations of Kim Dokja's Company were seen
fighting the heroes. Their appearance of taking precise formations and
releasing their status was reminiscent of glittering constellations centered
on a single star.

The sound of chewing popcorn was heard from somewhere. [Very noisy.
Do dokkaebis normally talk like this?]

The red wine in the glass was sucked into the man's mouth. Then one of the
heroes of Olympus died on the screen.

[The constellation 'God of Wine and Ecstasy' is cheering!]

[The constellation 'God of Wine and Ecstasy' has sponsored 3,000 cons to
the 'Demon King of Salvation'.]
At this absurd sight, Bihyung asked, "Aren't you a member of Olympus?
Can you be sitting her leisurely?"

[What do you know? I'm not really close to them. In addition, aren't you the
ones who said I can take a tour today?]

Like any supporter on the street, Dionysus had a flag with his team on his
back. The flag was covered with 'Olympus is doomed'.

Dokgak's eyes narrowed. "The 12 Gods of Olympus would've gathered at
Olympus Temple by now."

[I want Kim Dokja to win.]

"Huh?"

The dokkaebis were in an uproar from the remark that was like a bomb.
Dionysus laughed heartily. [What are you so surprised? I can support
anyone. In addition, you shouldn't react like this. Don't you only need a
'fun' scenario?]

It was true, making the dokkaebis frowned at the words. Dokgak opened his
mouth. "The thing you are expecting won't happen."

Dokgak's words caused Bihyung's expression to darken. In fact, Kim
Dokja's Company fighting against Olympus was ridiculous. Breaking a
rock with a quail egg had more of a chance than this. In addition, it
overlapped with the Earth side.

Bihyung watched Gigantomachia with one eye while the other saw Yoo
Joonghyuk running with Lee Sookyung on his back. At this moment,
Dionysus opened his mouth again. [It is unknown if the story is a tragedy or
a comedy until this is over.]

"…Isn't it obvious? Gigantomachia is such a scenario."
[Gigantomachia is just one of the many giant stories that Olympus had. You
might belittle them as long as they're not there but you can't afford to
overlook the lucky punch.]

"The probability of it happening is close to 0%."

[That probability will happen. Isn't that why I'm here?]

Dionysus watched the screen while shoving popcorn in his mouth.

[The key is… how to make the 'dizzy fish' come out…]




More than half of the 12 Gods had gathered. They were in the form of
symbolic objects that represented themselves. The first one to speak was a
trident.

[The distinguished Lightning Throne didn't come this time and… Dionysus
is missing?]

[That's correct.]

The waters around the temple boiled up like the sea was furious. Some
symbolic bodies looked at each other nervously and the trident kept
speaking,

[Then why did the giants wake up again?]

[It is a group that broke out from Tartarus.] The one who answered with a
constellation with the symbol of a pair of swords.

The trident asked again, [Hades let them go?]

[It was said they performed the myth ritual.]
[The myth ritual? They must've sacrificed a great probability… did
'Everybody's Mother' wake up?]

[No. It was the three Hecatoncheires brothers who moved.]

[All three of them went out?]

[It is Briareus alone. It is said he lost half his Hundred-Handers.]

[They were probably lacking probability for all three to leave.]

It was silent. Then the blazing sun spoke, [We can't sit idly by. Kim Dokja's
Company? The small nebula is provoking us.]

[We need to severely punish them.]

Then a winged shoe with numerous data windows around it spoke. [It won't
be easy. Like the three chiefs, the master of the nebula has received the
indication of the end ■■ hint.]

[…Is that true Hermes?]

[Yes.]

[Huh, it is funny. The master of the nebula is building a 'story' on the same
level as the Lightning Throne?]

There was a stir in the group. 'A Single Story' was a sensitive topic for the
12 Gods. The constellations were all seeking the ultimate story. There was
no one who wasn't interested in the hint of the end. It was the trident who
arranged things. [Quiet. Everyone is busy and there is a lot of work to do.
We will start the vote.]

Everyone in the place fell silent. The reason why so many gods gathered
was due to the 60th scenario.
[In response to the provocation of Kim Dokja's Company, I, as chairman,
am calling for the deployment of the story weapon.] Then the voting began.

[The constellation 'God of Marriage and the Home' declares abstention.]

[The constellation 'Organizer of Agriculture and the Seasons' declares
neutrality.]

[The constellation 'Spokesman of Justice and Wisdom' declares that we
must withdraw the justice the humans don't know about.]

[The constellation 'Atrocious War God' wants to fight the giants.]

[The constellation 'Almighty Sun' wants to burn a petty nebula.]

[The constellation 'Volcanic Blacksmith' wants to make a weapon to fight
against the giants.]

[The constellation 'Pure Hunter of the Moonlight' rejects a meaningless
war.]

[The constellation 'Goddess of Love and Beauty' says she will abstain from
this superficial vote.]

[The constellation 'Master of the Skywalk' says the issue shouldn't be
approached so simple. The big data should be examined, the nature of the
case reviewed and the patterns of the enraged giants…]

[Hermes, just say it.]

[The constellation 'Master of the Skywalk' is against the war.]

Several constellations were surprised by the declaration.

[You are a coward, Hermes.]

[He always goes against the will of the temple…]
Hermes didn't say anything. Meanwhile, the result of the votes came up.

[Agree: 4 votes]

[Disagree: 2 votes]

[Abstain: 3 votes]

There was only one last vote left. Of course, it was the chairman's vote.

[The constellation 'Spear that Draws the Boundaries of the Sea' is
demanded the release of the weapon.]

[Agree: 5 votes]

[All seats have voted apart from the non-attendees.]

The gods nodded. [Apart from those who abstained, more than half are in
favour and I am declaring the release of the 'story weapon'.]

A hammering sound rang through the temple while an ominous foam rose
from the sea. The direction of the foam was the theme park Gigantomachia
where the giants were gathering.

[We need a commander to lead the weapons. The historical-grade
constellations will go together but they can't deal with the giants alone.]

[Who will you send?]

[I will approve some gods to move. You will be in an incarnation body and
I hope you assist them without hesitation.] Then somebody raised their
hand.

[I will go.]
After Achilles' incarnation body collapsed, the incarnations fell into a
panic. Several incarnations fled when the saw the mountains of giants rising
everywhere. In the chaos, several incarnations shouted, "Why are you doing
this?"

"You! What the hell is this?"

The astonishment and resentment of the incarnations were soon directed
towards me. I asked in return, "Why are you doing what? What did I do?"

"We missed the chance to get a star relic because of you!"

"It was a chance to get a story about catching a giant!"

"I was going to catch the eyes of the 12 Gods and join Olympus!" Now
because of you…!"

Gigantomachia. With a participation fee of 100,000 coins, they got a
chance to gain hidden pieces and if lucky, a piece of a giant story. That
opportunity was now disappearing into a handful of dust in front of their
eyes.

I watched the incarnations and wondered, "Do you really think that
Gigantomachia is such a naive event?"

Perhaps they were right. There actually were incarnations and
constellations who were strengthened through Gigantomachia. In addition,
many of them likely became members of Olympus.

"Let's say you join Olympus. Then what will you do?"

"What?"

"In a nebula already occupied by the 12 Gods and the ancient
constellations, what can you do?"
Through Ways of Survival, I saw the words of countless incarnations who
had joined Olympus. The incarnations were bound by unusual contracts and
collected crude stories as they were used in the long-term for various
scenarios.

"All the incarnations of last year's Gigantomachia climbed to the top
scenario! They…!"

"Are you talking about them?"

The people turned their heads in the direction I pointed. There were
countless ships crossing the sea, including Argo. Among the ships'
passengers, the participants of last year's Gigantomachia were also seen.

"W-Why are they…?"

Gigantomachia. The myths recorded it as a fight between the giants and the
gods and heroes of Olympus. However, most incarnations weren't aware of
how the heroes who participated in the war were made.

[Many constellations are excited!]

The gods were afraid of the giants and mass-produced heroes from humans
for Gigantomachia.

[Constellations of the nebula 'Olympus' are showing hostility towards you.]

Even after the end of Gigantomachia, it was unknown how many
incarnations were being mobilized for this re-enactment war. It was a
scenario that ate and produced itself, like a snake biting its own tail.
[A number of constellations have entered the channel!]

[A large number of constellations can't hide their excitement for
Gigantomachia!]
The constellations who hated the scenario, reached the end of the scenario
and enjoyed the scenario. They desperately climbed the ladder of the
scenario, mocked the incarnations and kicked the ladder towards the top.
The victim of the tragedy became the subject of the tragedy.

I declared towards the horror-stricken incarnations. "I want to break the
scenario."
               Chapter 329: Ep. 62 - God's Enemy, II


"Break the scenario? What are you saying…"

The people made expressions that showed they didn't understand. It was
natural. There was no way they thought they could break the scenario. The
scenario had become a condition of life for them.

[You are a splendid constellation! Do you think you can contend with
Olympus?]

I turned after hearing someone's voice and saw a familiar big man. He had a
bushy beard and held a long spear. It was a constellation I knew. "That's
right."

[Mwahaha! If you don't mind, I'd like to ask for your name.]

"I am the Demon King of Salvation."
Demon King of Salvation. Some of the incarnations and constellations who
heard my modifier immediately responded. "Is it the Demon King's
Selection…?"

"T-The demon king who knocked down Surya!"

The man with the big spear came forward and said. [I am called 'Protector
of Changban.]

"Protector of Changban! It is Zhang Fei!"

Zhang Fei struck his massive chest. [I want to help you. I didn't want to
play this childish game but now I'm getting heated up!]

He threw away the items harvested from Olympus' theme park. It was the
head of a young hydra, a golden apple and fake golden fleece.

I nodded and said, "Good."

If Zhang Fei had this equipment, he would definitely be a big power.
However, it wasn't enough.

[The hidden scenario 'Myth Subversion' has affected the main scenario.]

I glanced around at the other incarnations and constellations and stated,
"Now, choose."

The incarnations looked between me, the terrible giants and Argo crossing
the sea.

"Do you want to be stuck to the back of a giant nebula and be their limbs
for a lifetime? Or do you want to be the master of a new 'myth' along with
the mythical giants."

[The contents of the 'main scenario' that you and your nebula received will
be updated!]
  [Main scenario #60 ― Gigantomachia]

  Category: Main

  Difficulty level: SSS+
  Clear Conditions: The ancient giants have come to the Gigantomachia
  battlefield. You can join the battlefield by taking the side of the 'giants'
  or 'Olympus'. Cut the neck of the enemy leader and declare the advent
  of a new myth to the Star Stream!

  Time Limit: ―

  Compensation: A new giant story, ???

  Failure: Partial disappearance of the 'giant story'.

  * If the enemy's incarnation body is destroyed, the
  correspondingscenario will end.

  * Each faction has two leaders.



The moment the scenario updated, a green arrow flashed over my head.

[You already belong to a force.]

[You are one of the two leaders in charge of the 'giant' forces.]

The incarnations around me were silent. They had probably received the
updated scenario.

[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' is delighting in this
spectacle.]
[The constellation 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' is delighting in your
suffering.]

[The constellation 'Secretive Plotter' is wondering about your strategy.]

Then the bombardment started from the sea. Han Sooyoung's voice was
heard behind me. "Kim Dokja! How long are you going to stand there? Do
you want to just watch?"

I drew my sword and descended from the shoulder of a giant. "Let's start."
"How are we going to fight? Our power is overwhelmingly lacking."

Han Sooyoung's words were true. I wouldn't say it was 'overwhelming' but
less than 10 giants had passed through the portal with me. Furthermore,
Briareus of the Hecatoncheires was a core power but he hadn't yet appeared
on the field. Perhaps he was the other 'leader'.

[Kill the giants.]

A true voice emerged from somewhere and the human heroes leapt from
Argo to attack the giants.

[The Stage Transformation of Gigantomachia is occurring.]

There were sparks and the surroundings changed. The ancient battlefield. It
was the land of massacre where the first Gigantomachia occurred.

The constellations of Olympus came flying through the air. Most of them
were historical-grade but once they joined forces and attacked the giants,
the situation suddenly tilted.

「 The supreme giants will kneel down to the combined forces of the
heroes and gods. 」
The giants were kneeling down one by one before the combined efforts of
the constellations and heroes. My group tried to help the giants but we were
blocked by the shells coming from the sea.

Lee Hyunsung exclaimed, "I think we have to do something about that story
weapon!"

The story weapon, Argo. The ship of the Olympus heroes was launching
shells that contained enormous magic power. It was difficult to even
approach the sea. Of course, it was expected. "Have you forgotten? Who we
have."

I stared at a girl standing among the party members. "…Me?"

To be exact, I looked at the constellation behind Lee Jihye.

[The constellation 'Maritime War God' is looking at you.]


Lee Jihye shouted, "…Are you crazy? You want me to deal with that?"

Olympus' Argo was much bigger than Lee Jihye's Ghost Fleet. It was the
size difference between a patrol ship and a destroyer. It was natural to think
it was impossible.

"You can do it."

I knew. Lee Jihye could indeed do it.

"You can definitely do it if you are with your sponsor."

As the constellations of the Korean Peninsula watched, the Maritime War
God was looking up at the sky. A constellation who had been confined to
the Korean Peninsula for a long time. He had to carry the name of the
country on his back. The constellation who had to remain a symbol of the
nation he dedicated his life to.
One day, Goryeo's First Sword had said: Among the historical-grade
constellations of the Korean Peninsula, only the Duke of Loyalty and
Warfare can compete with me.

Then why did Yi Sunsin remain at the historical-grade despite Goryeo's
First Sword become a narrative-grade constellation?

[The constellation 'Maritime War God' is looking at his fellow people.]

It was because he refused to be narrative-grade.

[The constellation 'Seo Ae Il Pil' wants 'Maritime War God' to fight for
himself.]

it was the moment when a historical-grade constellation became
narrativegrade. The moment when a single constellation left his nation and
moved towards his own path. A dazzling radiance emerged from Lee
Jihye's body.

[The constellation 'Maritime War God' is opening his status.]

The Duke of Loyalty and Warfare released himself, as if revealing
everything about him.

[The Star Stream is staring at the constellation 'Maritime War God'.]

The sky of the scenario looked down at the Duke of Loyalty and Warfare.
Like a seasoned actor who had been hiding his capabilities, the Duke of
Loyalty and Warfare under the sky was magnificent and bold. It was a spirit
that didn't retreat or feel fear.

[Many constellations are surprised by the status of the Maritime War God!]

After a long time, the Duke of Loyalty and Warfare was finally leaving the
Korean Peninsula.

[The Star Stream has accepted the promotion of Maritime War God.]
[The constellation 'Maritime War God' has become a narrative-grade
constellation.]

"Jihye." The opening of Gigantomachia started with the promotion of the
sea admiral. "Smash it all."

Lee Jihye was surrounded by the spirit of the Maritime War God and raised
her sword.

[The character 'Lee Jihye' has activated the stigma 'Ghost Fleet Lv. 10!]

[The status of the sponsor has risen and the destructive power of the Ghost
Fleet is rising rapidly!]

12 ships appeared at the shoreline. The ships had already grown to the size
of a destroyer.

「 Those who seek death shall live. Those who seek life shall die. 」

The cannons of the 12 ships fired simultaneously. The number of enemy
shells that never ceased firing slowly started to change. The front of Argo
was crumbling. The number of shells dropped sharply and there was the
sound of the hull exploding.

The solid Argo was shaking.

We equipped ourselves to defend against the shells and moved our feet. We
cut down the Olympians running towards the giants and moved forward.
Maybe they thought this couldn't continue anymore and the heroes of Argo
came out.

[Everybody land!]

The intense true voice was heard from Argo's expedition leader, Wind
Expedition King. Argo' expedition leader, Jason.
[The giants can't stop humanity and gods from joining together! The winner
of this war is already fixed!]

The army poured out along with this shout. I took the lead while speaking
to the faltering group members. "There is no need to be afraid. We aren't
giants."

We weren't giants. In other words, Stage Transformation didn't have an
influence on us.

The large Jason came this way and a man on our side ran towards him.

"I'll take this big one."

It was Lee Hyunsung. Lee Hyunsung collided with Jason with a
tremendous amount of force and bellowed as they had a battle of strength.

"Haaaaaap!"

Jason was surprised by the tremendous strength that forced him to be
pushed back. In the latter half of Ways of Survival, Lee Hyunsung wasn't
pushed by an incarnation or constellation in strength.

[Synchronization with the constellation 'Master of Steel' has increased!]

Lee Hyunsung's upper body was covered by a shell of steel. The level of
Lee Hyunsung's Steel Transformation was extremely high. His body wasn't
touched at all despite being punched by a hero.

In the sky, Shin Yoosung and Lee Gilyoung were flying on the dragon.
Shin Yoosung avoided the heroes with dragon slaying stories and fired a
breath. The sea was instantly poisoned and the enemies were cut by Lee
Gilyoung's insect kings. Lee Seolhwa used poison against the heroes while
Han Sooyoung used the black flames and blocked the constellations of
Olympus.
Now they all had the ability to deal with historical-grade constellations. The
10 or so nebula members were fighting against the constellations of a
mighty nebula.

The incarnations observing the situation in the back were shocked.

"What? Olympus seems to be pushed…?"

"By that small nebula?"

This was the effect I had intended. The battle was still in its infancy. I had
to appeal with strength to bring in reinforcements. However, the god of
victory still wasn't on our side.

…It finally appeared. I looked at the 20 meters high monster filling my
field of view. It wasn't a human, no matter how I looked.

Gleaming golden armour. A cloak made of lion leather wrapped around it.
Those who knew Greek mythology couldn't not know his name.

Some of the giants shrieked at the majestic appearance. [Heracles…!]

The hero's 'status', that even the 12 Gods were reluctant to go against,
dominated the entire battlefield.

I looked up as a dark shadow covered the surrounding area and smiled
bitterly. If I wanted to deal with this monster then I had to call a monster as
well.

It took me so long to get here. Naturally, I wouldn't withdraw from here.

"The sword designed to cut a sleeping giant." I quietly stated. "Now,
descend upon this place."

Come, Kim Namwoon.
               Chapter 330: Ep. 62 - God's Enemy, III


A swirling portal appeared in the sky.

[The constellation 'Queen of the Darkest Spring' is looking at you.]

Pluto's license was obtained from Hades. I could use Pluto freely in the
limited time Gigantomachia was held.

[Hahaha, grasshopper man! You memorized the starting change despite not
liking it?]

It was Kim Namwoon's mischievous voice. However, the giant soldier
didn't appear immediately. There was only the darkness of the abyss visible
beyond the swirling portal.

[By the way, can you wait 10 minutes? The summoning circle is damaged
and I can't go straight away. The giants stomped their feet too many
times…]
…Dammit. Heracles was emitting a white light and looking my way with
blank eyes.

It couldn't be helped. I had to buy as much time as possible. I stepped
forward and shouted, "Heracles! Hero of the 12 Tasks!"

Heracles stared at me. The red arrow above Heracles' head was flickering.

[The constellation is a 'leader' of Olympus.]

As expected, he was one of the two leaders of Olympus. According to the
myths, Heracles was a man who killed the leader of the giants in
Gigantomachia. Many constellations in Ways of Survival spoke about him.

「 "As long as Heracles is present, the winner of Gigantomachia won't
change." 」

Numerous incarnations cheered when they saw Heracles.

"Ohhhhh!"

"Heracles! Heracles!"

Heracles, the hero of Olympus who left countless myths and folklore.
Despite the many stories that resonated through the Star Stream, the
number of constellations who actually saw Heracles could be counted on
one hand.

He was a demigod, a mix between a god and human. He had a body of
steel. The stories of the protector of Olympus circulated around him.

[The story 'Man Who Strangled the Lion of Nemea' has begun.]

[The story 'Man Who Beat up the Giant Boar' has begun.]

[The story 'Man Who Overpowered a Cerberus with Bare Hands' has
begun.]
…

A tremendous amount of stories were shining in Heracles' body. At first
glance, they seemed like crazy stories. Every one of them was at the very
least, legendary grade stories. The scale of his 'giant stories' was
incomparable but I didn't start the game without knowing this.

"Once again, rumours in the Star Stream can't be believed." I spoke in a
provocative voice and Heracles' fist flew towards me.

[The exclusive skill 'Bookmark' is activated!]

Miniaturization and Electrification were activated. Heracles' fist passed
over the top of my head and made a crater in the ground where I had been
standing. I was swept back by the ignorant power but I didn't stop the
provocation. "Your punch is only this much. I don't know if this was
enough to overpower the giants.

An angry cry seemed to burst from Heracles' body.

"I know many stories about you. You caught the lion of Nemea, killed a
hydra, hunted a Stymphalian bird… they are incredible stories for 'one
person' to accomplish in a short period of time."

Finally, a true voice burst out from Heracles' body. [That's right. That is
me, Heracles!]

It was creepy hearing the voice. It might be equivalent to the 12 Gods but
as a result, I was even more convinced.

"I heard a rumour that you were born for Gigantomachia. Your 12 tasks
were trials for the victory of Gigantomachia."

[Some constellations are interested in your words!]

[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' is worried about you.]
I didn't know how he took my words but Heracles banged on his chest. It
was a spectacular sight to see a monster over 20 meters tall doing such a
thing.

I kept speaking. "Then one of my close colleagues heard your story and
raised a question."

I suppressed my boiling anger.

"The original Heracles was born after the 'Great Disaster Period'. Then how
could he participate in Gigantomachia which occurred before that?" It was
none other than Yoo Sangah who said this.

A stir occurred among the constellations in the channel. Heracles' eyes
gleamed angrily as his true voice rang out.

[Arrogant guy! Are you saying this Heracles is a lie?]

"Yes. Not just you but all of the 12 gods." Heracles was silent at my
answer.
"You made many false stories. You did this by manipulating them."

Heracles clearly looked embarrassed.

"I was surprised as well. If you kept talking and talking nonsense… it might
someday become a 'real' story."

One thousand years, two thousand years. The lies were repeated for tens of
thousands of years.

"Once it becomes a story, it can be said to originally exist. Isn't it
amazing?"

[I am Heracles! Heracles of Gigantomachia and the symbol of Olympus!]

"Yes, perhaps in another world line. Somewhere in another world, you
really killed Nemea's lion and the hydra."
[The constellation 'Secretive Plotter' is making an interested smile.]

I stared up at the sky as I spoke. I moved through the 1863rd round and
remembered the countless rounds that Yoo Joonghyuk went through.

"However, that isn't the case in this world. In this world, a hero like
Heracles doesn't exist."

[You!]

"It is because Heracles is the name of the story weapon you created."

Zeus, the god of lightning, had sowed his seed in preparation for
Gigantomachia. As always, the 'seed' here was a metaphor. Zeus feared the
giants and collected miscellaneous hero stories from across the world.

「 Nemea's Lion. 」

「 Golden Horned Deer. 」

「 Bull of Crete. 」

「 Hydra of Nine Heads. 」

…

Stories were gathered and created a single character. This character was
soon shaped into a story weapon. It was created to fight against the giants,
using human souls as power. A weapon that brought the fear of massacre to
numerous battlefields in the Star Stream.

"Giant soldier Heracles."

[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' is surprised.]

[The constellation 'Bald General of Justice' resents the atrocities of
Olympus.]
[The constellation 'Queen of the Darkest Spring' has a cold expression.]

[The constellation 'Spokesman of Justice and Wisdom' has shaky eyes.]

[Many constellations are shocked by the identity of Heracles!]

Perhaps most constellations were unaware of this story. It was natural. It
was a truth that only I, who read Ways of Survival, and a few of the 12
Gods who made Heracles knew about.

[Many constellations have entered channel #BY-9158!]

The constellations in the channel suddenly increased and Biyoo cried out
tearfully.

[A large number of constellations are questioning the identity of
Gigantomachia!]

The stage I wanted was finally going to be completed.

[Heracles's mythical identity is shaken.]

[The identity of Heracles has influenced the reproduction of Stage
Transformation.]

I stared at Heracles.

[The exclusive skill 'Reading Comprehension' is activated.]

[You have learnt about the other person's composition of stories due to the
attribute effect!]

「 He is a god of war born only for war. 」

「 Holding 'fear' in the right hand and 'anxiety' in the left hand. 」

「 He left discord every time he walked through a 'fight' in front of him. 」
The stories of a constellation flowed through Heracles' giant soldier. They
weren't Heracles' stories.

Heracles was a giant soldier. If so, there was someone riding him and I
knew who that person was.

I cried out in my true voice. [Atrocious War God! Are you a coward who
fights behind a giant soldier?]

A huge storm of wind blew around Heracles' body. The heroes and
constellations fighting in a bloody manner around him were pushed back
dozens of meters. I would've flown to the horizon if I hadn't used Way of
the Wind through Bookmark. Ares opened his mouth.

[In the past, many people who spoke bad words to Olympus didn't have a
good fate. Oedipus and Prometheus as well. No one was an exception.]
Unlike the fierce outburst, Ares' true voice was unexpectedly calm.

[You have spoken more words than anyone I've seen.]

It happened the moment Heracles aimed a fist at me. 10 minutes had
passed. Pluto appeared in the sky and blocked Heracles' fist. I literally flew
through the air and entered Pluto's cockpit.

[The Giant Soldier Pluto has confirmed your boarding.]

[The Giant Soldier Pluto has confirmed the master's constellation.]

[Your story will be assimilated with Giant Soldier Pluto.]

I was comfortably embraced by the giant soldier's body. It was like soft
muscles were wrapped around my body and I could see the vision of the
'giant soldier'. The power of the story weapon enveloped my entire body.
This was one of the strongest story weapons of Ways of Survival, Giant
Soldier Pluto.
[…Ugh! Eek! Eeek! I feel like there is a parasite in my stomach!]

As Kim Namwoon was making a fuss, Han Sooyoung spoke through
Midday Tryst.

–Hey, can you do it? This is the giant soldier Heracles. You only have Kim
Namwoon.

The rating of the giant soldier was determined by the quality of the 'soul'
used as the material of the giant soldier. In addition, the soul used for the
original Pluto wasn't Kim Namwoon. In other words, the current Pluto was
much weaker than the original Pluto.

–Kim Namwoon is pretty good.

–The situation is completely different from when you smashed the factory
in the Demon Realm!

–Do you think I don't know that? He can do it.

–You're serious?

–Perhaps it would be impossible originally but… I learnt something from
you.

–…From me?

I rushed towards Heracles. Heracles amplified his body volume to match
Pluto and also headed

towards me. Four hands collided and the fierce wind pressure created a
whirlpool in the sea. Ares was surprised when Pluto showed a strength
comparable to Heracles.

[A giant soldier? Where did you get it?]
"I scammed it from someone, just like you."

From the start of the Demon King Selection to the 1863rd round. I had been
preparing for Gigantomachia. It was a chance for a new nebula to establish
a solid position and an opportunity to properly warn the big nebulae.

「 Kim Dokja read and read Ways of Survival. 」

I changed the original novel and the future became uncertain. However, it
was impossible for me to use Anticipation Plagiarism like Han Sooyoung of
the 1863rd round. It was possible for writers like Han Sooyoung to 'create'
possible developments of the future.

To such a me, the 1863rd round Han Sooyoung stated:

–What are you talking about? You're a reader.

Reader. A person who read and appreciated the writer's words.

–Author, don't you think the research into the 12 Gods is a bit lacking?
Ares is more violent and looks down on humans more than depicted… –
Besides, the probability that the 12 Gods can use individually…
I was the one who made the story along with the writer. Heracles' fist
slammed into Pluto's head and Pluto's fist struck Heracles' chest. In the
ensuing melee, the feelings I felt while reading Ways of Survival flowed
through me.

–I think the constellations who descended to the sub-scenario are too
unfavourable…

I wasn't a writer. I couldn't do it like Han Sooyoung. However, more than
anyone else, I was aware of the loopholes in the original work. Perhaps
even more than the author who wrote the novel.

[The game ends here.]
The momentum around Heracles' body changed. The strength that shattered
a lion's head was concentrated on both arms of the giant soldier and
Heracles' star relic, Heracles' Club was summoned.

I had also prepared for the day when I would confront him.

[Giant Story 'Demon Realm's Spring' has begun!]

[The status of a 'demon king' is released!]

The power of a demon king mixed with Electrification. On top of that, the
giant story of Kim Dokja's Company was placed. I exploded all the stories I
had hidden. The stories I released were amplified to an enormous level due
to Pluto's buff effect.

Ares was greatly astonished. It was natural to be surprised. In fact, I was
overdoing it. My status was still lacking to confront one of the 12 Gods but
after going to the 95th scenario, I couldn't be compared to incarnations or
constellations of the same grade.

At the very least, I exceeded the limits of the 60th scenario.

[Your status is going beyond the limit of this scenario!]

Since the 60th scenario, the probability storm that occurred couldn't be
compared to before. If I made a mistake, I might suffer a disaster where my
incarnation body was destroyed.

I endured the sparks with gritted teeth.

The nebula Olympus has used too much extra probability on me. Therefore,
the probability allowed for large-scale scenarios such as this Gigantomachia
was almost gone. Indeed, Ares' status didn't rise above a certain level.

[Stupid fool! If you do that, you will die!]

[I might die.] I looked over at Ares and declared, [But you will die first.]
I looked down at Pluto's empty right hand. The power of the giant soldier
was so high that an ordinary weapon couldn't withstand the shock. At the
very least, I needed a weapon comparable to Heracles' Bat.

In fact, I had such a weapon. It was a weapon I have been saving for a
long time, just for this moment. [Come, Steel Sword.]
               Chapter 331: Ep. 62 - God's Enemy, IV


The noise of the battlefield died down for a moment at my cry. The struggle
between Giant Soldier Heracles and Giant Soldier Pluto. Even the
constellations in the channel seemed nervous at the summoning of the
weapon.

[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' is wondering what
your weapon is!]

[Many constellations are curious about 'Steel Sword'!]

My empty hand still wasn't filled.

…Why didn't it come? I looked back and reflexively activated Omniscient
Reader's Viewpoint. It was to grasp the situation of the battlefield. Then I
heard the thoughts of characters with a high level of understanding.

「 Steel Sword? I seem to have heard that somewhere before. 」
「 A person who uses the sword… 」

…What?

「 Kim Dok ja is an i diot. 」

The Fourth Wall's mocking words were heard in my head. I belatedly
noticed. Lee Hyunsung's nickname was still 'Pure Steel'.

「 Steel Sword… nice name. It was called by Dokja-ssi. He must be a great
person. 」

Lee Hyunsung was looking this way while fighting Jason. I shouted
towards
Lee Hyunsung, [Hyunsung-ssi! Come quickly!]

"Huh? You were talking about me?"

"Hurry, you idiot! I'll cover this place!"

Han Sooyoung shouted and Lee Hyunsung gave up his showdown with
Jason. The stigma Great Mountain Push was triggered and Jason flew
backwards.

…No, use it earlier if he had that power.

I didn't know how much stronger Lee Hyunsung had become in the last
three years but he was more useful than expected.

"However, I'm not Steel Sword…"

[You will be called that from today.]

"W-What should I do?"

I quickly grabbed and swung Lee Hyunsung.
"Kuaaaaaack!"

Ares regrouped and swung Heracles' Bat. It was a tremendous blow that
combined Giant Soldier Heracles' story mixed with Ares' story. It was a
destructive force that could crush Nemea's lion in one blow.

I swung Lee Hyunsung at Ares.

"Dokja-ssi! Dokja-ssi! It isn't possible!"

[It's fine! Trust yourself!]

Along with the sound of waves, particles of water turned into fog. In the
fog, Lee Hyunsung slowly faced the bat.

[Look, you can do it.]

"Uh, uhhh, uweeeoh…"

Steel was growing all over Lee Hyunsung's body. It grew, grew and grew
again. He soon became a sword.

Ares was noticeably baffled. If Yoo Joonghyuk was here, he definitely
would've said:

「 "This is the reason why Lee Hyunsung got the nickname of Steel
Sword."
」

Steel Sword. The reason he was called Steel Sword wasn't because he could
control a sword well.

[The character 'Lee Hyunsung' has used the stigma 'Steel Transformation
Lv.
10'.]
Steel Transformation. It was the stigma of a constellation from a distant
place in the universe.

As the stories piled up, it became harder than any metal and had the
advantage of being capable of regenerating if broken. Lee Hyunsung was
no different from a living 'strongest sword'.

[The constellation 'Master of Steel' is frowning at your cruelty.]

Perhaps it was because this was his first time being a sword but Lee
Hyunsung was still in an insecure state. I deliberately spoke in order to
inspire Lee Hyunsung's morale. [Hyunsung-ssi, do you see the shield that
Heracles' is holding?]

"Ye… y-yes, what is that?"

[It is the original version of 'Heracles Shield' that I gave you before.]

In the past, I had given the replica version of Heracles' Shield to Lee
Hyunsung. It was the shield that Lee Hyunsung kept cleaning.

[I'll give it to you, Hyunsung-ssi.]

"…Really?"

[Of course.]

Lee Hyunsung completely adapted and integrated himself into the hand of
the giant soldier. It was a perfect grip like a handshake.

I started running. A large amount of probability was consumed as I once
again clashed with Ares in Heracles.

[The Star Stream is paying attention to you!]

[The bureau is doubting your probability!]
[Overusing this probability will endanger your body!]

Steel Sword and Heracles' Bat firmly collided. Ares was surprised by the
force and took one step back.

[…Damn crazy!]

We struck, struck and struck each other again. Part of Heracles' Bat flew
away as debris and Lee Hyunsung's Steel Transformation had cracks all
over it.

We were desperate because it couldn't be a long-lasting battle. Lee
Hyunsung, Kim Namwoon, me as well.

[Giant Story 'Demon Realm's Spring' is continuing.]

There wasn't the Stage Transformation like when we fought Surya but this
story was protecting us.

A stage where Lee Hyunsung and I were together. Kim Namwoon, who
was once an enemy, was now part of the story.

「 The most despicable soul in the world, a man born from steel. 」

Finally, the blade of the Steel Sword cut at Heracles' right shoulder.

Ares growled out, [Why are you trying so hard? Olympus has always been
merciful to you!]

[Merciful? Is that why you placed the fate on me?]

[Just because of that small that?]

[…It is small?]

[You survived it anyway! You should be thankful about successfully
passing the trial!]
That wasn't my only enmity.

[My colleague is dying because of you guys.]

[Colleague?]

The sword and the club hit each other again as Ares seemed to remember
something.

[The incarnation who used to the the singularity watcher.]

[It isn't an incarnation but 'Yoo Sangah'.]

[We didn't make the incarnation do that. She brought that misery onto
herself.] Ares laughed.

[The mortal tried to access Olympus' database. It is natural to suffer.]

I shouted through gritted teeth, [It is you who gave her that strength. You
brought about such a situation.]

[God is watching. Everything is a human choice.]

[Do you think you can use 'choice' for a predetermined cause?]

Ares laughed. [This is the scenario.]

Cold anger settled deep in my chest. Yes, this was a constellation. They had
a desire for stimulating scenarios and enjoyed the fall of incarnations. They
made 'good and evil' on purpose. A god waiting merrily for humans to
break the taboo.

Sparks that I couldn't afford started to appear around Pluto's body. A
brilliant magic power storm occurred around the junction of bat and steel.

Ares exclaimed, [This crazy bastard…!]
「 Kim Dokja was angry. 」

「 Apart from that anger, Kim Dokja's sense of reasoning was still as cold
as ever. 」

In fact, it was almost impossible to defeat Ares in a frontal showdown but
now the story was different.

「 Kim Dokja thought. 」

This was the 'sea' where Ares couldn't exert enough power. It was a sub
scenario where he couldn't release all his status. Crucially, Ares' Heracles
was an early model of the giant soldier.

Heracles' Bat broken Pluto's left arm and at the same time, the Steel Sword
penetrated Heracles' waist.

Ares hurriedly cried out, [If you do this, you really will turn all of Olympus
into an enemy…!]

[Ask anyone to come.]

However, they wouldn't come. The 12 Gods were all cowards.

[Zeus, Poseidon or anyone else.]

Heracles was pushed back by the Purest Sword Force. Even to the end,
Ares didn't fully release his status. Not all narrative-grade constellations
were like Surya.

It had been a while since the real Gigantomachia. The 12 Gods had
forgotten their lives. The same was true for Ares, a fierce warrior.

He seemed more courageous than anyone else but he was actually more
cautious about his life than anyone else. He flaunted his bravery in
Gigantomachia but now he was a constellation who feared the aftermath of
opening his status in the scenario.

Ares shouted angrily, [Aren't you afraid of probability?]

[I'm not afraid.]

Lee Hyunsung, Kim Namwoon, me as well. There was no such thing as
fear.
It was because we had been living through the aftermath the whole time.
Rather, it took courage to be weak.

Along with the bubbling sea foam, I thrust the steel sword into Heracles'
cockpit.

[You have knocked down Giant Soldier Heracles!]

[You have acquired a new story!]

[The star relic 'Heracles' Bat (Damaged)' has been acquired.]

[The star relic 'Heracles' Shield (Damaged)' has been acquired.]

[The star relic 'Heracles' Spear (Damaged)' has been acquired.]

Then a tremendous explosion occurred.

"Kim Namwoon!"

I emerged from Pluto's cockpit at the moment of the explosion. Pluto had
exceeded the limits of probability and was breaking down.

[This dog…!] Kim Namwoon sounded happy.

After a while, Pluto's body couldn't withstand the probability storm and
collapsed. It was the result of taking the probability on my behalf.
Fortunately, the power supply seemed safe. It was just that more fighting
would be difficult.

In the haze of the smoke, I saw Ares who escaped from the cockpit like me.
Ares was wounded all over his body and he was roaring furiously.

The game hadn't ended yet. Heracles was a type of protective sphere. The
moment Ares opened his status, I would have to deal with him head on.
Still, it didn't matter. In the first place, my purpose was to make him fall
from Heracles.

"Yoo Sangah-ssi told me something about you."

As Ares had mentioned, Yoo Sangah used Hermes' system to investigate all
types of future information. Among them were things about Olympus.

"I heard you were once hit by Heracles' spear."

Yoo Sangah had told me that Ares fought Heracles and was stabbed in the
thigh with his spear.

–If 'fake' can be 'real', can I make this story real? If the weapon could be
obtained…

Ares' eyes were shaken as he glared at me angrily.

"I was curious. Heracles is the creature you have created. Then is this myth
real or fake?"

Ares rushed towards me as I kept speaking.

"How much power can a fake story exert in the Star Stream? Aren't you
curious?"

[The story fragment in Heracles' Spear is responding to you!]
[The story 'Natural Enemy in War' has begun.]

The story started talking.

「 With one penetration, the spear neutralized the god of war. 」

I held the spear with all my strength. It was such a heavy spear that I
wondered if I could throw it by myself.

Ares was now in sight. I should throw it properly. If it fails, I would die
here. At this moment, the weight of the spear lightened. Someone was also
holding onto the spear from behind me.

It wasn't Lee Hyunsung but there was no need to think. Only one
incarnation in all of Ways of Survival could take on the weight of this spear
lightly. In the first place, this incarnation was an ally.

"Kim Dokja, there is only one chance."

It was an eternal 'once'. A 'once' made with the countless failures of the
regressor.

"It has always been 'once' for me."

Thus, this one chance couldn't fail. We threw the spear at the same time.
                Chapter 332: Ep. 62 - God's Enemy, V


The spear flew away with a dark blue light. The power and status of the
spear weren't at a level that Yoo Joonghyuk originally was capable of.
Perhaps the 3rd round Yoo Joonghyuk's understanding if the spear had
sharply increased after he went through Hell of Eternity. I watched the
flying spear and asked, "You came back faster than I thought? What
happened to the returnees?"

"…I'll explain later."

Ares gritted his teeth and tried to avoid the flying spear. He might not be
able to move freely in the air like Hermes but it should be enough for Ares
to move the spear. At least, if there wasn't a story in the spear.

「 The spear that left the fingertips was inevitable. 」

Could a story have feelings? No story expert was able to give a definitive
answer. The only certainty was the situation currently unfolding in front of
my eyes.
[The fragment of the story 'Enemy of the War God' is showing hostility to
Atrocious War God.]

The Heracles in this world line was fake but over time, fake became real.
The created story had its own will. The moment Ares quickly turned in the
air, the spear turned at the same speed. Ares hurriedly took a defensive
posture but the spear ignored it.

There was a terrible amount of blood and Ares gave a pained scream when
his thigh was pierced. One of the great 12 Gods, the God of War fell into
the sea while bleeding.

"I'll subdue him!" Lee Hyunsung, who had been waiting on the ground after
releasing Steel Transformation, struck Ares' body with Great Mountain
Smash while Yoo Joonghyuk opened his transcendence and trampled on
Ares' incarnation body. It was fortunate that Yoo Joonghyuk came back at a
good timing.

"The Earth side is all sorted out?"

Yoo Joonghyuk didn't answer. Ares struggled and his face twisted as he
was trampled on by a pair of boots. No matter how much he struggled, the
spear in his thigh was restraining his status. The story of Heracles was
persistent and stubborn. At the very least, it was strong enough for the 12
gods to be neutralized in the 60th scenario. It was something all the 12 gods
inflicted on themselves.

[T-This Hephaistos like bastard!]

[The constellation 'Volcanic Blacksmith' is frowning.]

I saw the red arrow floating over Ares' head and pulled out Unbroken Faith.
In order to win this scenario, the two leaders on Olympus' side had to be
killed. Ares was one of them.
The Ares in front of me wouldn't really die because he was an incarnation
body. However, the loss of the incarnation body would be huge damage to
the 12 gods. Then Yoo Joonghyuk's thoughts entered my mind.

「 There is no time… I can save it if I hurry. Nectar is required. 」

Yoo Joonghyuk aimed the Black Heavenly Demon Sword at Ares' neck
and opened his mouth. "Ares, do you have nectar?" I was baffled by Yoo
Joonghyuk's sudden words.

…Nectar? I knew the identity of this item.

「 If Vedas has the star fluid Soma, Olympus has Nectar. 」

This jerk, was he still greedy to enhance his body? At this time,
constellations who entered the channel sent indirect messages.
[A number of constellations have entered the channel!]

[The constellation 'King Heungmu the Great' is warning you!]

[The constellation 'One-eyed Maitreya' wants to tell you about the crisis on
Earth…!]

There was a beep and the indirect messages disappeared.

[The constellation 'Secretive Plotter' is warning everyone to shut up.]

I looked up and saw Biyoo making a restless expression.

[Baat, baat…]

–Biyoo, what's going on?
There was no answer from Biyoo. She was trying to avoid my eyes.
Everything was uncertain. It wasn't another dokkaebi hiding from me, it
was Biyoo.

Then Ares opened his mouth. […You are a time-defying being. Why does
the man who received the blessing of immortality need Nectar?]

"I have no obligation to respond to you. Once again. Give me the Nectar."
[Is one of your colleagues in danger? Is that why you need Nectar?]

Yoo Joonghyuk's Black Heavenly Demon Sword lightly touched Ares'
neck. There was the sound of blood falling. The particles of blood would
have all the stories he built up contained in the red and white blood cells.

Ares seemed to think of something and opened his mouth. [I don't have it
on my now. However, if you pull this spear from me, I can go and get
Nectar for you…]

"That won't happen. Then die."

Yoo Joonghyuk's Black Heavenly Demon Sword stabbed Ares' heart. Ares'
incarnation body emitted a faint light and he started to turn to grey. He was
recovering his incarnation body from the scenario. The enraged Ares
exclaimed, [I will repay this debt, puppet of the Oldest Dream!]

There was a loud sound and Ares' incarnation body completely disappeared.

[The constellation 'Atrocious War God' has left the battlefield.]

[One of the leaders of Olympus has abandoned the scenario!]

[You have defeated the Atrocious War God!]

[The legendary story 'One Who Defeated the War God' has been acquired!]

[You have obtained 400,000 coins as compensation.]
[Major contributors: Constellation Demon King of Salvation, Incarnation
Yoo Joonghyuk, Incarnation Lee Hyunsung.]

There were huge rewards as the messages continued.

[A new story has been added to the existing Gigantomachia!]

[Some of the items on the incarnation body of 'Atrocious War God' will be
distributed to the main contributors.]

After the system messages, indirect messages were sent to the battlefield.

[The constellation 'Wind Expedition King' is shocked!]

[The constellation 'Spokesman of Justice and Wisdom' is astonished!]

[The constellation 'Almighty Sun' distrusts his eyes.]

The battlefield became a crucible of confusion. It was the same for the
heroes fighting in Olympus' camp and the giants fighting against them.
Even those watching the battlefield were included. The fact that the war
god of Olympus abandoned the scenario was a big shock.

[Hahahahaha! This time Gigantomachia is really interesting!] Zhang Fei's
true voice rang out as he crossed the battlefield and dealt with the heroes.

Yoo Joonghyuk didn't care about the turmoil and was searching through the
rubble of the dead Ares. "He really doesn't have Nectar. Then I must kill
Hebe…"

"Yoo Joonghyuk, you crazy bastard!" I grabbed Yoo Joonghyuk by the
collar and shouted.

"What are you doing? You would've killed him if I hadn't."

"Why kill him straight away? I could've received one more star relic from
him by threatening him!"
Of course, I agreed that we should kill Ares. However, in a situation where
his incarnation body was held hostage, I could've received more items…

"This isn't the time to be leisurely."

"Why are you asking for Nectar? You don't need it, do you? I am going to
get Soma from Vedas…" A sinister hunch filled me. "Yoo Joonghyuk.
What happened on Earth?"

"…"

"Perhaps Yoo Sangah…"

"Earth is safe. Don't think futile things and concentrate on finishing
Gigantomachia." Yoo Joonghyuk spoke in a determined voice. "The war
isn't over yet."

Yoo Joonghyuk looked around the battlefield. Ares' Heracles had collapsed.
However, one thing to keep in mind was that the Heracles ridden by Ares
was just one of numerous giant soldiers.

"…More dirty ones are coming."

Countless Heracles were running to this side along the sea route Argo had
created. The mass production type Heracles. In these long years, Olympus
had prepared many giant soldiers for the war against other nebulae.

[Kill the giants!]

Their fierce momentum was enough to shake the waves. Previously, it
wouldn't be strange if the giants ran away in fear. However, now it was
different.

[It is the time of liberation!]

[Companions! Heracles is fake!]
Another leader on this side suddenly tore through the portal. Briareus. He
used to have 100 arms and now only had 50 due to probability, but he was
still enough to compete in the battlefield.

[Don't be fooled by what you see! Believe in yourself, not the myths
already recorded!]

The giants roared after hearing his true voice. Yoo Joonghyuk spoke,
"You've changed the myth."

The power of the myth was determined by those who believed in it. The
protagonist of Gigantomachia was Heracles. The fact that Heracles was a
fake had a direct impact on the giants. The shaky Stage Transformation was
the evidence.

On this broken stage, a new stage was being made. On the pages of the torn
script, another script would be used. However, Yoo Joonghyuk's expression
didn't relax. "This isn't the end. "The gods will come."

Ares was only one of the 12 gods. If the contents of the original were the
same, there would be at least two more of the 12 Gods fighting.

One was Spokesman of Justice and Wisdom, Athena. The other was
Almighty Sun, Apollon.

Yoo Joonghyuk glanced at the broken Pluto. "You can't go with the gods
with the weary and broken giant soldier."

"There is still a long time before you can fight one on one with the 12
Gods."

"I won't know without trying."

These words were spoken but it was impossible for the current Yoo
Joonghyuk to go head to head and win against the 12 Gods. In my case, it
was possible because I was lucky with the tricks I used.
"After witnessing Ares' defeat, the 12 gods will come in different ways.
Even with your status, you are likely to have to sacrifice some probability."

"It doesn't matter. That will make it taste better."

"You deal with Spokesman of Justice and Wisdom. It will be difficult alone
so I'll give you one more person. Then you'll be able to stop her somehow."

"Who are you going to add?"

"You'll know soon."

I saw Athena and Apollon flying in the distance. They had a terribly 'status'
that could be felt from this distance. It would definitely be different from
the battle with Ares.

Yoo Joonghyuk adjusted the Black Heavenly Demon Sword and asked,
"Will you deal with the Almighty Sun?"

"There is a separate constellation for him."

"…I will trust your tricks this once." The moment he spoke, Yoo
Joonghyuk ran into the sky. He disappeared using Red Phoenix Shunpo,
leaving a beautiful trail behind him. Yoo Joonghyuk's early stage of
transcendence was now perfect.

There was the sound of the Black Heavenly Demon Sword splitting through
the air. It stopped before Athena and a collision of red magic power
occurred almost simultaneously.

[Get out of the way. Or die.]

Spokesman of Justice and Wisdom, Athena. The daughter of the master of
lightning who ruled Olympus and the most respected war god in Olympus.
[You might be proficient in mythology but I am different from Ares.]
They might both by 'war gods' but Ares and Athena were different. Both
gods fought in many proxy wars but he had never won against Athena.

Athena spoke, [I don't hate you. My purpose is to return the giants
to Tartarus. But if you continue to disturb―] Cold anger filled her
expression.

[In the name of justice, I am forced to punish you.]

Athena was a god who always fulfilled her words. If she truly lifted her
spear and shield, there were few people who could prevent her wrath in all
of Olympus. There were sparks as someone's true voice came from the sky.

[You are still using that line, Athena. Whenever we cut the ■ing demons
together… nothing has changed.]

I was barely breathing as I looked up at the sky. Athena was a constellation
with one of the strongest combat power. However, it was limited to
Olympus.

「 If there was an Athena of justice in Olympus… 」

Brilliant flames appeared in the air and a new incarnation entered the
battlefield. The pure white flames subsided and I saw a person I knew well.

「 There is Jung Heewon in Kim Dokja's Company. 」

The strongest sword I had finally appeared on the battlefield.

[It's been a long time, Athena.]

Uriel unfolded pure white wings as she descended into Jung Heewon's
body.
                Chapter 333: Ep. 62 - God's Enemy, VI


Jung Heewon emitted a pure white light as she pointed the Sword of
Judgment at Athena.

Athena spoke, [Uriel… I didn't hear that Eden was coming?]

[I'm not here as part of Eden.]

[Then?]

[I'm just helping my incarnation.] Uriel continued speaking. [Athena. Up to
here, haven't you done a lot for Olympus so far? How long are you going to
worry about Gigantomachia? Are you going to keep creating it with the
bureau?]

[I'm concerned. It is very serious, Uriel. We are just trying to recall the tale
of encouraging good while punishing evil. Good wins and evil is defeated.
It is right to emphasize this a few times.]
[Encouraging good while punishing evil…]

[As the good story increases, the constellations will consume good
scenarios. The more this happens, the cleaner the Star Stream will become.]

Uriel's eyes shook when she heard the words. Carrying out many good
stories and scenarios would make the world better. Certainly, there was a
time when she believed so.

[Then is the Star Stream better now? Do the constellations love the good
stories?]

[It isn't enough right now. But someday―]

The angel's wings flapped and moved.

[Athena, you are usually on the side of the weak.]

Uriel looked down at the giants fighting on the ground. To be precise, she
was watching the smallest giant Breaking the Sky Sword Saint.

[I want to ask you, Spokesman of Justice and Wisdom.] Uriel's tone
changed and Athena's expression became stricter. [Is that 'giant' evil?]

Athena looked down at the Breaking the Sky Sword Saint. The Breaking
the
Sky swordsmanship smashed the sky and tore at the constellations.
The Breaking the Sky Sword Saint was small but strong. Perhaps she
was stronger than the giants who had been idle in Tartarus. However,
she wasn't strong from the beginning.

「 Go away! Get away from me! You unlucky girl! 」

「 Cursed girl! You ruined my family! 」
「 The blood of the giants. It is said that if you eat that girl's heart, you will
gain the strength of a tiger. 」

The suffering that the Breaking the Sky Sword Saint experienced were
narrated and entered Athena's eyes. It was a bitterness she had to bear just
because she was born as a giant or because she had a different appearance.

Athena bit her lips. [All giants are dangerous. Their nature is fierce and
they can bring about another terrible disaster.]

[Disaster? Who will they bring the danger of disaster to?]

Athena firmly grasped her spear but she was avoiding Uriel's gaze.

[Of course, to humans…]

[Humans? Since when does Olympus care about humans?]

[Uriel! You better be careful with your words―]

[Athena, you know it as well.]

Athena's mouth half-closed and Uriel continued.

[The thing you are trying to create right now is a fake 'encouraging good
while punishing evil. It is a fake myth that arbitrarily designates 'evil' and
'good'.]

Athena's eyes shook.

[So what if it is fake? Even if it is fake…]

[Athena, did you forget? The scenario of 'encouraging good while
punishing evil' because of the rampant 'fakes'.] Uriel's voice quivered as she
remembered the time of 'demon hunting'. [Athena. In this scenario, there is
no good or evil. There is only our desire to see the story.]
Uriel stared up at the sky and a light shone. [I… don't want to see this story
anymore.]

Archangel Uriel was staring at the Star Stream.

[Now I want to see 'real evil' being broken.]

Athena's eyes widened. Her trembling voice flowed out. […That story has
disappeared a long time ago.]

[No, it hasn't.] Uriel smiled as she watched me. [That's why I came here.]

The Sword of Judgment and Athena's spear pointed at each other.

[There is no more room for compromises.]

The archangel of Eden collided with the goddess of Olympus. Athena's
onslaught went beyond the probability. Jung Heewon seemed to be pushed
at
first but the situation soon stabilized thanks to Yoo Joonghyuk's
participation. It wouldn't be impossible to stall Athena while the
synchronization with Uriel lasted.

[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' is rejoicing in the
bloody battle between constellations!]

[The constellation 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' wants both to die!]

[The 'absolute evil' constellations are cheering for the collision between
'absolute good' constellations.]

A huge admission fee was pouring into the channel through Biyoo. Biyoo
shook a bit.

[Baat…]
I looked at the other side of the sky. The problem was that red-headed man
flying over there. He was riding a huge carriage with a red sun behind him.

The Almighty Sun, Apollon. Just like the myths, he had a very handsome
face. It was almost enough to slap Yoo Joonghyuk's cheeks once… no, it
would be twice.

[The constellation 'Almighty Sun' is directing intense anger at you!]

He was one of the 12 Gods and too much for me to handle alone. Pluto was
broken and the body parts hadn't fully recovered. Maybe my incarnation
body would turn to ash after being hit once or twice by the sun.

However, I wasn't worried. It was because I wasn't the one who would fight
the Almighty Sun.

In the distance, I heard something like a locomotive horn. There was the
sound of train wheels. At one time, I didn't know how scary this sound was.

[The constellation 'Almighty Sun' is confused.]

If there were 12 main gods in Olympus, there were eight Lokapala in
Vedas. The Lokapala that appeared was one I knew well.

[Surya, why are you here?!]

The sun carriage and sun train collided, creating a blinding explosion. The
lacking probability meant Surya's train wasn't as big as before but it was
enough to match Apollon's carriage.

[Surya… Can I accept this as Vedas' meaning?]

[I have no relationship with Vedas. I left it a while ago.] Surya laughed. [I
just came here to determine who the best sun god is.]

A blazing sunlight filled the air. It was a showdown between Surya and
Apollon. The arrows containing Apollon's light power covered the sky like
a waterfall and Surya's third eye disrupted the trajectory of the arrows. The
myth and myth were crashing together. It was enough to leave Apollon to
Surya.

I looked around the rest of the battlefield.

"Dokja-ssi! I like the new shield!"

Lee Hyunsung, who held Heracles' Shield, was crossing the battlefield
while knocking down heroes and giant soldiers. Han Sooyoung precisely
managed her magic power and handled the mass produced Heracles one by
one.

Once Stage Transformation started to collapse, the balance was slightly
leaning towards us. The powerful Gigantes pushed the heroes and Lee
Gilyoung and Shin Yoosung controlled the chimera dragon, using its breath
to turn the beach into a sea of fire.

Lee Jihye was constantly firing shells at the mass produced Heracles. I had
increased Lee Jihye's magic power in preparation for this day.

[A new myth is emerging in Gigantomachia!]

The myth of Kim Dokja's Company was being recorded in real time.
Everyone was fighting well and nothing was wrong.

「 Nevertheless, Kim Dokja was strangely nervous. 」

It was a very small hunch. I subtly felt that something was wrong. There
was nothing wrong when I checked calmly. Uriel and Surya participated in
a timely manner and Yoo Joonghyuk returned safely from Earth's crisis.
Then why?

「 Actually, Kim Dokja knew the reason. 」

No.
「 Look around. 」

The one I was looking for didn't exist. Athena, Jason, Apollon, Achilles…

There were many gods and heroes who made a name for themselves in
Olympus but none of them was Olympus' leader.

If the scenario was correct, there should be one more leader other than
Ares. I had to kill them in order to end this scenario.

Perhaps it was the Volcanic Blacksmith Hephaistos who hadn't appeared
but he didn't directly participate in Gigantomachia in the original novel or
the revised versions. Then who the hell was the other leader of Olympus?

「 At this moment, a hero entered Kim Dokja's eyes. 」

[Stop! You have to stop!]

I looked at the hero. A beautifully tanned, muscular body and eyes full of
dizziness. The 'status' I felt from him was similar to Yoo Sangah.

The Hero of the Labyrinth, Theseus.

[This fight has no meaning!]

Theseus was trying to stop the fight.

[We have to stop here! There is no need to fight the giants! Doing this won't
help Olympus! Athena! Apollon! Don't you know?]

I couldn't figure out what the hell was going on. In the past
Gigantomachias, Theseus had never appeared and done such a thing. It
wasn't an impossible story but…

[Please! Stop! At this rate, Olympus will…!]
It happened at this moment. A red arrow flashed over Theseus' head. It was
an arrow stating he was the leader of Olympus.

Then Theseus grabbed his head and groaned with pain.

[T-This… no, no. No, Father!]

Something went wrong.




Dionysus, watching the scenario on the sofa of the Administrative Bureau,
jumped up. The popcorn box rolled across the ground.

The surprised Bihyung was going to open his mouth when Dionysus
exclaimed. [Damn! Why is Theseus there?]

Dionysus shouted at the dokkaebis. It was as if he was the Dokkaebi King.
[Quickly prepare the 'probability plausibility screening'. Or everyone in that
scenario will die!]

The next moment, there was an explosion on the screen.




I couldn't tell what was happening. My ears rang and my vision turned
completely white. I was caught in the explosion and flew through rock
walls into a cave.

[Your incarnation body is severely damaged.]

[The damage to your incarnation body is serious. You need urgent
treatment!]
I bandaged the wounds to stop my stories from escaping. I staggered up and
looked outside the coastal cave.

A battlefield strewn with blood. The foam reached the tip of my toes and
the sea breeze soaked my lips. In addition, no one could be seen on the
battlefield.

There was no Shin Yoosung and Lee Gilyoung flying in the sky on a
dragon. Lee Jihye directing the phantom fleet as well. In addition, Lee
Seolhwa and Lee Hyunsung who had just been protecting the party.

"Yoosung! Gilyoung!"

I couldn't see Yoo Joonghyuk fighting Athena in the sky or Han Sooyoung
destroying the mass produced Heracles. There wasn't even Uriel or Surya.

"Han Sooyoung! Yoo Joonghyuk!"

My shouts echoed inside the cave where the sea breeze was blowing. My
heart sank. What the hell happened?

After a while, something huge emerged from the water. An immeasurable
and inscrutable being to human cognition.

I thought as I faced it, 'This is a god'.

It felt like all the constellations I previously saw were fake. It was an
existence that could only be described as a 'god'.

[I am the Spear that Draws the Boundaries of the Sea, Poseidon.]

The mythical father of the great hero of Olympus, Theseus. The moment
his true voice rang out, my heart throbbed and blood poured out. It was just
like the first time I met an outer god a long time ago.

My fingertips shook like I had palsy. Why did Poseidon descend? It wasn't
possible. Poseidon had never intervened in any period of Gigantomachia. If
the myth-grade constellation like him intervened, not only would the odds
of Olympus be seriously damaged, the entire scenario would be blown
away.

Nevertheless, he appeared here. What the hell? What was he thinking? My
hand kept shaking. Then after a while, I realized that I wasn't the one
shaking. The smartphone that I subconsciously held tightly was vibrating.
               Chapter 334: Ep. 63 - End of the Myth, I


「 (You will die like this.) 」

This was the screen of the vibrating smartphone. I felt the rising waves
against my toes and raised my smartphone.

「 (Originally, the fourth revision should've been sent… I think something
went wrong.) 」

I knew who was talking. The librarians of the library inside the Fourth
Wall. Perhaps they were the ones who sent this.

「 (This is all I can do to help. Even if it is only partly.) 」

There was light interference and sentences rose from the LCD screen. It
was as if the contents of the book were summarized.

.
.

「 This place again… 」

It was obvious whose monologue the sentences belonged to. This was
clearly the contents of the Fourth Revision.

「 There were too many mistakes in the third round. 」

「 The appearance of Poseidon was unexpected. 」

「 I should've thought more about the issue of probability. 」

「 I should've considered the relationship between myths… 」

The sentences were filled with regret as always. Perhaps we failed even in
the fourth revision.

「 If I had saved Lee Sookyung, not Yoo Sangah at that time… 」

.

.

…What? I stiffened and no longer scrolled down the screen. Lightning
struck the screen and all the flowing sentences were erased.

I hurriedly shouted, "Wait a minute! Show me again! What did you mean
by those words just now?" There was no reply.

「 (Kim Dokja, fate can't be changed. However—)

「 Shu t up Nir va na. 」

[The exclusive skill 'Fourth Wall' is strongly activated!]
The power of the Fourth Wall obstructed Nirvana's voice. The sentences
disappeared and my fast heartbeat rapidly calmed down. My irritated head
cooled down like a sophisticated clock.

This composure, I didn't like it. I couldn't rage when I wanted to rage. I
couldn't be sad when I wanted to grieve.

"Fourth Wall."

[The Fourth Wall is looking at you.]

"Tell me honestly. Is my mother in danger?"

The Fourth Wall didn't answer.

…Shit, sometimes I wondered if this guy was on my side or not.

I looked up at the air. "Biyoo."

[Baat…]

Biyoo, whose body was transparent, looked down at me with sad eyes. I
opened my mouth to ask before closing it again.

[The exclusive skill, 'Fourth Wall' is shaking!]

Biyoo was crying.

All types of thoughts passed through my head. Some of the confusing
puzzle pieces were slowly fitting together. Yoo Joonghyuk had returned too
quickly and he looked like he was hiding something.

Somehow, I thought it was strange. The reason why the constellations sent
strange messages and why Yoo Joonghyuk was seeking the Nectar. Maybe,
all of this was due to the same reason.
[This friend. Don't worry, your mother isn't dead yet.] A voice was heard
behind me. […Tsk, it was information that shouldn't be leaked.]

Sparks emerged from the darkness and it was a constellation I knew well.
"Dionysus."

[It has been a while. Is this the first time since the last banquet?]

Dionysus approached my side and gazed outside the coastal cave, his left
hand charred from the probability. This place contained one of the three
chief gods of Olympus, the ruler of the sea. Sea God Poseidon.

Poseidon didn't move but there was an ominous silence hanging around
him. Like a predator waiting for the chance, Poseidon was silently staring at
the sea. It was as if he was seeing where he came from.

[The 'probability plausibility screening' has begun and Uncle won't move
too much. However, don't do anything rash. He is looking hard for you.]
"You are saying this while spamming your true voice near me."

[It's okay because I'm hiding here using my power. He can't hear me.]

I saw that entrance of the cave was covered with a wine glass. Maybe this
barrier was hiding Dionysus and I. Dionysus gazed at Poseidon and spoke.
[Isn't it great? The third chief gods… that is a myth-grade constellation.
They are high constellations that ordinary constellations can never reach in
their life.]

Certainly, I could only say he was great. If I was Poseidon, I would be able
to stop the nameless fog that had once destroyed the Demon Realm.

「 The place where his spear reaches will soon become the boundary of the
sea. 」
Poseidon's gaze soon reached the sea. All the mountains under the sea were
shuddering before his sublime presence and prostrated themselves, praying
for an error they probably hadn't committed. The depths of my heart were
roaring.

[…You are really amazing.]

"What are you saying?"

[There are no signs that you are truly afraid when looking at him. Why?]

Of course, I was afraid. My legs trembled and I was dizzy. But more than
that…

「 Kim Dokja was really impressed. 」

I watched the majestic Poseidon for a long time before answering, "I
couldn't imagine this."

[Imagine? Haha, you truly are a funny person.]

"Why are you helping me? You are part of Olympus."

[It is my heart.]

"What happened to the other party members?"

Dionysus flicked his fingers and a screen appeared. The party members
were gathered in the distant sky. They were tied by Ariadne's web and
floating in the air using Hermes Walking Method. No one was missing. Of
course, the narrative-grade constellations Surya and Uriel were also safe.

Indeed, it was a clever escape. The sky was the domain of Zeus. Poseidon
might draw the boundaries of the sea but he couldn't reach into the sky.

Dionysus sipped from a glass and said, [Rest assured. None of them were
hurt. Ariadne and Hermes made it just in time…]
"Can I give a punch?"

[…To who?]

I glared silently at Dionysus.

[Me? Why?]

"Don't you know?"

Dionysus was quick to notice and replied, [Ah, it's because of that
incarnation. Yes, I'm sorry. You can hit me if you want to. Instead, do it a
bit softly… you are a constellation so it will be quite painful.]

I didn't hit him. Instead, I asked, "Why did you do that to Yoo Sangah-ssi?"

[…The story is complicated.]

Dionysus sat at the edge of the coastal cave and laid down his glass. He
took some time to choose his words.

[In this world line, the Moira three sisters received a peculiar prophecy.]

"Peculiar prophecy?"

Dionysus glanced at me and replied like a Greed-era orator. [The 'end of all'
will soon come.]

"What does that mean?"

[I don't know. The obvious thing is that Olympus can't get away from it
either. Thanks to this, Olympus has been busy for a while. All the scenarios
will come to an end one day but we had to know how it ended.]

Dionysus continued speaking. [In the process, we found some singularities
related to the predicted 'end. One of them was the 'regressor' with you.]
"You chose Yoo Sangah to keep an eye on Yoo Joonghyuk?"

[Honestly, yes.]

My anger increase but I endured it. Dionysus' words hadn't finished.

[Then while spying on him, we came to know of your existence.]

"…"

[An incarnation who hates fate, hates constellations and doesn't believe in
the Star Stream. He became a constellation on his own without choosing a
sponsor and he is even a constellation we can't see the identity of. A
singularity I have never seen before. We found you and made up our
minds.] Dionysus laughed. [Hide you and use you.]

There were remnants of dim stories in his tone. Some scenes in the past
where I thought I was 'lucky' passed through my mind. The Even Bridge
that unfolded at the first Oksu Station ― 「Deus Ex Machina. 」. There
was the probability that helped whenever I was in danger.

[We wanted to use you to stop the destruction. Thus, I wanted to help you
by using Incarnation Yoo Sangah.]

[It is different from Ares' words. He wants to get rid of me.]

[There is already internal conflict among the 12 Gods. I don't know if
you're aware.]

A golden aura rose from Dionysus' body as he got up. This was the
grandeur of the lineage of Zeus, king of the sky.

[The present Olympus is a fake.]

Dionysus' golden eyes gazed at me like he was looking down on his vassal.

[Just as human priests created gods to establish their authority, the gods of
Olympus created myths to maintain their power. Fake myths such as
Gigantomachia and Heracles… and this is the result.]

[The constellation 'God of Wine and Ecstasy' is looking at you.]

[I want to end this era. Then I want to make a new Olympus.]

[The story 'King of a Kingless World' is responding.]

The story sleeping inside me reacted to his story. The Dionysus in front of
me was one of the candidates to replace Zeus in the future.

[Anyway, that was the plan… now this place is haunted by the fish uncle
and there is nothing you can do. Perhaps the scenario will end this way.]

If the probability plausibility screen begun then there was a high probability
this scenario would fail.

The participants would receive compensation according to their
combination but Gigantomachia wouldn't occur. Perhaps Poseidon had been
aiming for this. At the expense of his own status and nebula probability, he
was trying to defend Olympus.

"No, there is still something I can do."

[What?]

"I think we can overturn Olympus in this scenario. Instead, give me a
Nectar in exchange for my help."

[Nectar? I have a bit here.]

I took the Nectar from Dionysus. I placed a few drops on my tongue.

[A star fluid has been ingested for the first time!]

[The star fluid 'Nectar' has responded to you!]
[The probability of Olympus has restored your broken body!]

[All your stats and skill levels have increased slightly.

Was this the star fluid I had only heard about in words? I received an effect
even though my average stats exceeded 200. Dionysus watched me put
away the remaining Nectar and asked, [Hey, did you forget that one blow
before? Yet you want to fight again?]

"Will you help?"

[Are you crazy? Even if I help you, no… it is impossible to change the
situation even if half of the 12 Gods help. Don't you know how strong that
fish is? Are you still out of your mind? The end of this scenario is
already―]

"The end of the scenario is fixed. Is that what you want to say?"

As Giant Briareus stated, fate couldn't be averted. Ares had also said it.
This scenario was just the development of a causal event that was
scheduled. Yes, that's right. Perhaps their words were correct.

"If the end is fixed, is there any meaning in the process?"

[It must be meaningful but that is just being romantic. As a result, it is
recorded as a failed story.]

"Are all failed stories meaningless? Even if you know you will fail, isn't the
story of those who have fought to the end worth it?"

[Constellations like those stories but those who do so are bound to die.]

"It is a possibility. Then what about this? Someone who is influenced by
the story tries to challenge the same story again." At this moment,
Dionysus opened his mouth.
"10 times, 100 times, 1000 times. What if many constellations and
incarnations are affected by the story and live such a story again?"

Failure might be scheduled but the countless beings built up a story of
courage as they confronted the given fate over and over again. What if they
accumulated stories about challenges and challenged them in another way.

"Then are the failed stories useless?"

Stage Transformation wasn't absolute. It was because the myth was just a
creation. Dionysus was speechless.

In the end, the probability of the Star Stream was a law that flowed towards
the 'desired flow' that many beings wanted. The story that many beings
desired would be realized someday.

Dionysus barely managed to open his mouth but he was oddly incensed.
[Then are you going to be the first? You will be the first victim and
overthrow the torch of the scenario?]

"Nope." I smiled. "I will be the last torch."

[What?]

"It is because numerous people have already failed before me."

I knew. I needed hundreds or thousands of attempts to defeat this
Poseidon. Just like… the current existence running towards Poseidon…
Dammit.
             Chapter 335: Ep. 63 - End of the Myth, II


Yoo Joonghyuk was rushing to Poseidon, who even narrative-grade
constellations avoided.

Dionysus asked, […Are you talking about this crazy guy?]

I activated Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint. Yoo Joonghyuk's thoughts
were pushed into my head.

「 The period while the probability plausibility screening is happening is
the only opportunity. 」

「 Poseidon is a myth-grade constellation. There is almost no way to
subdue him through Stage Transformation. 」

「 The only useful thing is this branch. 」

I noticed the branch in Yoo Joonghyuk's hand.
[The constellation 'Spokesman of Justice and Wisdom' is astonished!]
Perhaps the branch was a stolen star relic from Athena. Strictly speaking, it
was a sacred star relic.

[Athena's Olive Branch]. The reason why Poseidon was so scary was that
despite living for many years, he had very few 'losing stories'. Poseidon had
lost once and it was in the best he made with Athena.

I had some memories from Yoo Sangah.

–A long time ago, Poseidon and Athena competed in a city. People decided
that the god who gave the better gift would be the guardian of the city. At
the time, Poseidon struck a rock with a trident, causing the sea to rise.
Meanwhile, Athena grew an olive tree filled with rich fruit.

–Sea water is very common… did Athena win?

–Yes, Athena won the competition and became the patron god. Thus, the
city was called Athens. Ah… I'm sorry. Am I talking too much? Dokja-ssi
should know this as a fantasy expert…

–…

Of course, I had no idea. I wasn't as knowledgeable in myths as Yoo
Sangah. Yet this damn Yoo Joonghyuk knew the story.

「 If there is a slight blow, I can get rid of it. 」

…The olive branch. If there was a losing story, there was a losing story.
Perhaps Poseidon would only vomit a bit of seawater after being struck by
the branch.

[The constellation 'Spokesman of Justice and Wisdom' is warning you that
this isn't enough!]
However, I could understand Yoo Joonghyuk's choice. If the scenario was
going to be forcibly terminated by the probability plausibility screening, it
wasn't too bad to do a bit of damage to Poseidon. If he was lucky, he might
be able to get the story 'One Who Changed the Boundary of the Sea a Bit'
or 'One Who Went Against the Owner of the Sea.

…This was only if he was lucky.

I prepared to jump forward in case of an emergency. Dionysus grabbed my
shoulder. [Don't go. You will die.]

"Huh?"

Dionysus' expression hardened. Then…

[The 'probability plausibility screening' has ended!]

[There is no problem with the probability of the scenario.]

I looked up at the system messages in the air. The indirect messages poured
out in succession.

[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' is questioning the
bureau's judgment!]

[The constellation 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' is cursing!]

[Many constellations are suspicious of the bureau's judgment!]

Anyone would be shocked. It was impossible. A myth-grade constellation
had appeared in the 60th scenario yet there were no problems with the
probability?

A giant trident appeared in Poseidon's hand as he slowly rose. The star relic
Triaina. The spear that drew the boundaries of the sea, a fearsome weapon
that turned everything it touched into blood bubbles of the sea.
"Yoo Joonghyuk!" I shouted but Yoo Joonghyuk was already right under
Poseidon's nose. Even Yoo Joonghyuk would die if he received one blow.

I couldn't bear it as I moved away from Dionysus and invoked Way of the
Wind. However, Yoo Joonghyuk was too far away and the Triaina Spear
was close.

Sparks of probability appeared like lightning in the air. The recoil naturally
pushed Yoo Joonghyuk back. There was a mild spring scent along with a
black aura. Someone was blocking Poseidon's way.

[Poseidon, why are you fighting with kids?]

In the spot where the sparks disappeared, there was a goddess with a
beautiful appearance. Half her face was covered with a folding fan and
there was a black silk cape around her body. Her face was unfamiliar so I
didn't recognize her for a moment.

Dionysus screamed, [No, why is this old lady here?!]

The glare, that could only bloom in the darkest underground, blocked
Poseidon's spear.

[Persephone.]

The sea seemed furious and a fierce sea breeze shook her collar.
Persephone glanced at me and smiled.

I was thankful but my feelings were complicated. Why did Persephone
appear? I thought the Underworld wouldn't directly intervene in this…

Perhaps… was it to gain a part of the giant story? Things would be very
complicated if that happened.

[Persephone, why are you blocking me?]
[I am telling you to stop here. Look, it's too much. Your Majesty's parents
are all terrified.]

Persephone pointed to the sea where countless life forms were trembling.
Some aquatic species turned belly up and died. Even the kraken, the giant
2nd grade monster, was breathless.

[The constellation 'Pure Moonlight Patron God' is deploring the death of
life!]

[The constellation 'Goddess of Love and Beauty' is dissuading the 'Spear
that Draws the Boundaries of the Sea'.]

[The constellation 'Mistress of the Hearth and Benevolence' is talking to the
'Spear that Draws the Boundaries of the Sea'.]

The neutral constellations were trying to dissuade Poseidon. Persephone
continued speaking. [This isn't the stage for a myth-grade constellation.
Leave the children to fight among themselves.]

[This is no longer a problem for children.]

[It isn't a matter for children?]

[My son was attacked.]

In fact, there was a small arrowhead in Theseus' left arm, who Poseidon had
descended for. Persephone narrowed her eyes.

[Just because of this… Then you should punish those who attacked
Theseus.
Do you know who it is?]

[It must be a giant.]

[You don't know that.]
[The giants will kill everyone.]

The stubborn attitude caused even the valiant giants to tremble with fear.

[Those who burrow deep underground. You will regret coming up to the
ground today!]

The power of Triaina caused all the nearby creatures to scatter. Yet
Persephone didn't back off. I was worried. She might be 'Queen of the
Underworld' but it was impossible for her to stop Poseidon, a myth-grade
constellation.

[Get out of the way. You might be my brother's wife but I will kill you.]
Persephone didn't back down from the threat. Poseidon's Triaina didn't
hesitate. The light moved and Athena and Apollon, watching the scene
from the air, flew forward.

[No, Poseidon!]

[Spear that Draws the Boundaries of the Sea!]

It was too late. The moment the waves hit, Poseidon's spear was already
stuck into Persephone's heart. Then looking closer, the spear didn't hit
Persephone but a giant hand. A hand made of dense darkness gripped
Poseidon's spear.

It was a feast of probability so bright that I would probably never see it
again in my life. I understood why the bureau had passed the 'probability
plausibility screening'.

Dionysus laughed while shivering. [Haha, if things go wrong today, the 12
Gods will die.]

A story of darkness was released into the air. The darkness that had kept
silent for a long time was awakening.
[Giant Story 'Underworld' is coming to the sea.]

One of the three chief gods of Olympus, Father of the Rich Night.
Underworld King Hades had descended to Gigantomachia.

[Poseidon. You are making a fight between children into one between
adults.]

In the original novel of Ways of Survival, the myth-grade constellations
had fought several times. Yet such a thing had never happened in the 60th
scenario of Ways of Survival. If I remembered correctly, in the 75th
scenario where Poseidon of Olympus and Shiva of Vedas collided, all of
North America flew away. There were times when the surrounding
asteroids were destroyed and… there was something else.

[Stop! You must stop!]

Spokesman of Justice and Wisdom Athena, Almighty Sun Apollon, Master
of the Skywalk Hermes and God of Wine and Ecstasy Dionysus. There was
also Briareus of the Hundred-Handers.

The moment the clash between the two myth-grade constellations occurred,
all of the constellations were thrown out like toys. The constellations were
thrown into walls and Briareus lost half his remaining arms.

No one was able to stop the struggle between the two myth-grade
constellations. The nearby Yoo Joonghyuk was also shocked and flew this
way. I moved quickly to his body.

King of the Underworld and King of the Sea. Two myth-grade
constellations were staring at each other. They were able to shake their
world just by making eye contact. Poseidon was the one to open his mouth
first.
[Hades, why did you emerge from the Underworld? You have no
justification to intervene in this situation. Even if the scales of probability
are aligned, you shouldn't be here.]

Justification. It was necessary for a major being such as a myth-grade
constellation to descend to the sub scenario. The right justification would
allow them to pass the plausibility screening. In Poseidon's case, his
justification was his son Theseus. Then what about Hades?

[Who says there is no justification? We came to protect our successor.]

The one who answered was Persephone. Poseidon asked casually,
[Successor? You don't have children.]

Poseidon's words were right. Unlike Zeus and Poseidon, who had numerous
children, Hades had no children. It wasn't because Persephone and Hades'
conjugal harmony wasn't good.

[Of course not. We don't want to have children and use them in the
longterm war. My husband's brain isn't his crotch like you.]

Poseidon's expression hardened and Persephone continued,

[Isn't it strange to think of raising a child in this damn world of scenarios in
the first place?]

[I don't intend to attack your crooked values. Answer me bluntly. How do
you have a successor without children?]

The cold voice was like the temperature of the deep sea. Poseidon's Triaina
cried out roughly.

[If you don't answer correctly, you and your husband will die horribly in the
aftermath of the probability storm.]
Persephone laughed silently. Persephone slowly turned and looked this
way. The moment I encountered the strange gaze, the pages of Ways of
Survival flipped in my head. I looked down at the unconscious Yoo
Joonghyuk.

Perhaps it was like this. Suddenly, several things were understood. In the
481st round, Hades was very interested in Yoo Joonghyuk and said the
following words:

「 "I want you to be the successor of the Underworld King." 」

Come to think of it, the Underworld was especially friendly to Yoo
Joonghyuk i.e. Kim Dokja's Company. It was impossible for this cold
couple. Everything could be understood if the Underworld was planning to
use Yoo Joonghyuk as their successor.

They invited me and Yoo Joonghyuk to the constellation banquet, invited
me to the Gourmet Association, sneaked the Breaking the Sky Sword Saint
into Tartarus…

By the way…

Didn't it seem like I received more benefits? The next moment, the darkness
of the world spoke to me.

[The constellation 'Father of the Rich Night' wants to make you the
successor of the Underworld King.]
             Chapter 336: Ep. 63 - End of the Myth, III


…What? I looked at the message with blank eyes. What did it say?

[The constellation 'Father of the Rich Night' wants to make you the
successor of the Underworld King.]

I wasn't mistaken. I gazed at Persephone, who was smiling this way. Rather
than Yoo Joonghyuk, who was supposed to be the successor, I was chosen
instead. Still, I didn't understand. Why me?

Poseidon spoke, [You are crazy. You are going to make your successor
someone who doesn't have divine blood?]

[Isn't it past time to get over the disgusting old-fashioned notion of blood
descendants?]

[Someone who hasn't even performed the task of succession…]

[He performed the 'task'.]
I wondered what Persephone was saying. I completed a task for the
succession? Something flashed in my mind.

–I'll give you a task. You want to show me an interesting story? If you
succeed, I will let you find the soul you want.

–Your task is to cut off the head of the serpent.

Certainly, there was this incident. The test that I did to regain the soul of the
41st regression Shin Yoosung. At the time, I cut off Yamata no Orochi's
head to complete Persephone's task. That wasn't an ordinary task but a task
for succession? Since when had this queen planned…

[Hades! Are you serious? You want that trivial constellation to be your
successor? Poseidon cried out fiercely and Hades glanced at me.

Come to think of it, Hades had always been favourable to me. Father of the
Rich Night. He seemed strict and scary but never once did he do anything
to harm me. It was strange when thinking of the many characters who went
to the Underworld in the original novel.

Persephone's eyes deepened.

–Demon King of Salvation, it is better to decide quickly.

Becoming the successor of the Underworld. It suggested that in future
scenarios, I might be able to borrow the probability of the Underworld.
Furthermore, I was qualified to become the master of the Underworld after
succeeded Hades.

「 Kim Dokja thought. 」

If I accepted their proposal here, the Underworld would formally be able to
participate in Gigantomachia. In return, they would get a part in the giant
story of Gigantomachia. If I refused the succession proposal, the
Underworld would suffer a great loss and be locked underground again.
Then their relationship with me would be completely severed.

…Really clever, queen of the Underworld. The Underworld would get the
right to participate in Gigantomachia. I would prepare for the overthrow of
Olympus. If I refused this offer, Poseidon was the only one to benefit. In
such a situation, what was there to think about? In order to return to Earth
as soon as possible… in order to revive my mother, this was the best way.

"…I will be the successor of the Underworld. However, I have a condition."

I swiftly told her my condition. I also said that I couldn't accept the
succession if the condition wasn't met. After a while…

[The constellation 'Father of the Rich Night' has accepted your condition!]

[The constellation 'Demon King of Salvation' has become the successor of
the Underworld.]

The moment I made the declaration, the probability of the Star Stream
moved. Many stars looked down on me. Some were jealous of me, some
felt admiration and some were genuinely pleased. Then the Underworld
King spoke.

[Spear that Draws the Boundaries of the Sea.]

The tone was thicker than any voice I had ever heard. [We

of the Underworld came here to protect our successor.] It

was a dependable tone. I really wanted a father like this.

[The Star Stream is convinced of the cause suggested by the Father of the
Rich Night.]

[The Star Stream has accepted the probability of the Father of the Rich
Night entering.]
A huge scale was now moving. It was on a level I had never seen before.
The two myth-grade constellations climbed on their respective scales,
released their status and destroyed the ecosystem of the scenario.

[The bureau has built a wall of probability to prevent the destruction of this
scenario!]

[Many constellations are focused on the collision between two myth-grade
constellations!]

[Many constellations are shouting the modifier 'Spear that Draws the
Boundaries of the Sea'!]

[Many constellations are shouting the modifier 'Father of the Rich Night'!]

.

.

[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' is keeping a close eye
on his rivals.]

[The constellation 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' is excited about the 'real'
confrontation.]

[The constellation 'Secretive Plotter' is silently watching the situation.]

[Many constellations are praising the 'Demon King of Salvation' for the
confrontation!]

[700,000 coins have been sponsored.]

This was the moment I realized how big a deal my actions were in the Star
Stream.

Dionysus made a despondent laugh and said, [You really… you don't know
what you have done.]
"No, I know."

Then both constellations moved. In the darkness reminiscent of a giant
mountain, a black sickle appeared. Meanwhile, Triaina emerged from the
waves that rushed like a tsunami. There was a collision as the waves surged
in front and a cloud of dust was created in the air, reminiscent of a nuclear
explosion.
Then Hades' body disappeared. Poseidon exclaimed, [Dammit, it is Kynee!]

If Poseidon had the star relic Triaina, Hades had the golden helmet 'Kynee'.
A star relic made by the three cyclops brothers of Olympus and a helmet
that could hide the existence of the wearer from the world.

[This is a cowardly method of fighting, Younger Brother!]

[…You are still trying to claim that you are the hyung.]

Every time the wind struck, water vapour swept through the area and the
fish that died in place of Poseidon were blown away. The enraged Poseidon
pushed Triaina towards the possible position of Hades' defense.

The stormy waves swallowed the darkness before the darkness once again
broke out from the waves.

It was a game regarding the pride of the myths. In the duel between
mythgrade constellations, neither of them retreated.

[Giant Story 'Underworld' is continuing!]

[Giant Story 'Supreme Ruler of the Open Seas' is continuing!]

Their main stories struck and Dionysus desperately started to protect the
cave. The stories that the myths had been accumulating since birth were
intersecting. The collision of the myths caused some sentences to disappear
and some sentences to be born. The living stories of Poseidon and Hades
were being rewritten here.
I watched the scene like I was reading a novel.

「 A new wave was pouring in from where the night and the sea met. 」

It was a scene that had never been seen in Ways of Survival. It was
beautiful. The battle itself was spectacular, tremendous and marvellous.

I pulled out my sword.

Then Dionysus' surprised voice was heard. [What are you doing now?]

"I can't just watch."

If the fighting of the two people continued, all the beings here would be
wiped out from the aftermath. The giant story of Gigantomachia would be
reconstructed around the influence of these two.

In addition, they might be even now but the stage of this battle was the 'sea'.
Therefore, it was obvious who the god of victory would side with.

"I have to help Hades. Let's try whaling."

[Didn't you see Athena disappearing into the horizon? If you get hit like
that, you will die.]

"It is because she was trying to catch the father whale. Then what about the
baby whale?"

I was pointing at Theseus. The great Greek hero, who accepted Poseidon's
descent, was releasing stories in the midst of the waves.

「 Stop… 」

「 Now, stop, please… .」

Dionysus' expression distorted. [You want to send Poseidon back by
defeating Theseus?]
"It is cowardly but it is the best method."

[It isn't cowardly. Still, do you think that fish will allow you to do so? It is
impossible for a narrative-grade constellation to break through those
waves.] "Yes, if I am only trying with a single story. However, what if I'm
holding the sacred torch?"

At this moment, Dionysus' expression changed. [Don't tell me… you want
to create a sacred torch? Will you collect the stories to pierce through Uncle
Fish's barrier?]

"It is similar."

A sacred torch. The flames that burned when many beings gathered their
stories.

Dionysus asked, [Who will carry that fire? You?]

"I have to wear the fireproof suit first."

I looked at the broken Pluto near the cave. Pluto was completely ruined in
the previous battle with Ares. I pulled out the Old to New Toad. The toad
sang. "Give me an old house and I'll give you a new house."

"I'll give you two. Instead, fix this with the new one."

"Go od."

The real power of the Old to New Toad wasn't simply exchanging items
with new items. This toad had the special power to replace broken items
with the same 'new items' if the sacrifice was available. There was a reason
Anna Croft wanted this toad at the auction house.

I fed the toad with some low level star relics from the battle just now and
Pluto's body. The toad opened its mouth unusually wide and swallowed the
metal Pluto. After a while, Pluto was vomited out.
[Uwah, shit. What? I'm alive?]

Pluto, who was smaller at two meters in size, came out while covered in
sticky fluids. It looked perfect without any scratches.

Dionysus looked somewhat surprised but his expression was still dark.
[How are you going to make the sacred torch? Do you think the other 12
Gods will help you? In addition, the 'torch' needs to borrow the power of
the sun…]

I knew. However, there was a later matter. There was something more
urgent right now. Someone rose from beside Dionysus. He looked terrible
as soon as he woke up.

"You woke up?"

"…Poseidon?" Yoo Joonghyuk held his head like he had a headache and
frowned. Thankfully, it wasn't a big hit.

"He is fighting over there."

"…The opponent is Hades."

Yoo Joonghyuk read the battlefield at once. A great battle between
mythgrade constellations. The probability was vibrating uneasily. Perhaps
he was thinking the same thing now.

"It is a great opportunity to deal a blow to Olympus. Don't you know?"

"…We have to hit them now."

"To do so, we need the cooperation of the woman you hate."

"A woman I hate?"

I silently stared towards the depths of the cave. Then from deep inside the
cave, something like a torch turned on one by one.
The woman walked slowly through the light. I stared at her and asked with
a smile, "Anna Croft, will you help?"
             Chapter 337: Ep. 63 - End of the Myth, IV


"Why should I help you?"

"Or you will die too."

There were more than 10 incarnations in the darkness. They were Anna
Croft, Selena Kim and other party members. As expected, they also fought
in Gigantomachia.

"We can escape before that happens."

"Then you'll receive damage. Wouldn't it be a good experience to clear it to
the end as long as you're in the middle of the scenario?"

Anna Croft stared at me as if to test my true intentions. "What do you really
want?"

"King Lycomedes' Leather Gloves. Don't you have it? I didn't see it at the
auction house, no matter how hard I looked."
Anna Croft had used Future Sight. She probably knew the value of the
items she purchased beforehand. Anna Croft read my intentions and then
smiled. "I can't give you that. It is a material for my giant soldier."

"Are you trying to create a model capable of Stage Transformation? You
should know it is impossible with your strength alone."

"I'll only know after trying."

One of Anna Croft's party members stepped forward with hostility. Then
Yoo Joonghyuk stepped forward to confront him.

"There's nothing to say." There was the clear sound of the sword being
pulled out. "She is a woman I need to kill anyway."

A transcendent status filled the cave and the other side obviously became
tense. I could use Yoo Joonghyuk to take away items. The problem was that
the opponent was Anna Croft.

I raised my hand to restrain Yoo Joonghyuk and Yoo Joonghyuk stared at
me with a dreadful expression.

[The character Yoo Joonghyuk is using Three Restraints Lv. 10.]

Restraining oneself three times to avoid killing a person… I couldn't
believe I was seeing Yoo Joonghyuk use this skill in front of my eyes. It
was difficult for me to tell how much of a grudge Yoo Joonghyuk had
against Anna Croft, even after reading Ways of Survival.

I was struggling to make a decision when someone spoke. "Anna, give him
the gloves. Now is the time for us to yield."

Anna Croft's expression hardened at Selena Kim's words. Selena Kim
turned her head and sent a sound transmission to me.

–I am thankful for last time, Demon King of Salvation.
Previously, I had released the pledge on Selena Kim through the bet with
Anna Croft at the auction house. In other words, Selena Kim no longer had
to listen to Anna Croft's commands. Anna Croft's expression when her
greatest power opposed her opinion was worth seeing.

Since Selena Kim threw out these words, it was my turn to finish it. "It
won't be for free."

"Then?"

"I will buy it with coins."

Anna Croft paused at the mention of coins.

"How about 500,000 coins? You probably lost some money at the auction
house."

Anna Croft's eyes narrowed. She seemed to be thinking about the losses she
had suffered. After a while, Anna Croft opened her mouth. "I will consider
it for one million coins."

"It originally cost 200,000 coins. Isn't that too expensive? 600,000 coins."

"900,000 coins."

"700,000 coins. I can't compromise any further."

"I'll give it to you for 800,000 coins."

Indeed, she was a formidable woman. 800,000 coins wasn't a small number
but the deal had to be made. The King Lycomedes' Leather Gloves was an
indispensable item for this whale hunting.

[King Lycomedes' Leather Gloves has been acquired.]

[You have paid 800,000 coins to Incarnation Anna Croft.]
The deal was over and I smiled. "There is no harm to each other."

"No harm to each other? Have you already forgotten that you took one
million coins from me?

There are still 200,000 coins…"

"Come to South Korea once. You can enjoy a 200,000 won course meal."

Of course, 200,000 won and 200,000 coins were different. Anna Croft
gritted her teeth angrily. "Do you really intend to fight with Poseidon?"

"You have seen it with Future Sight so you will know."

"That…"

Of course, I knew she didn't know the future. Her Future Sight couldn't see
the futures associated with me.

I brushed past her and added in a small voice. "Maybe this time will be
pretty fun. You will go to a future that you can't read."

I watched Anna Croft's quivering small head and felt a strange sense of
triumph… I didn't know why I wanted to bully this person every time I met
her.

"I hope you won't die a dog's death."

"If you really want that, ask Asgard to add some probability."

After finishing the conversation, I glanced at Yoo Joonghyuk. He was still
glaring at Anna Croft and seemed on the verge of swinging his sword
straight away. The moment I was about to open Midday Tryst, Yoo
Joonghyuk unexpectedly sent me a message first.

–That woman's neck belongs to me. No matter when it happens.
–Do whatever you like.

Of course, at that time, I didn't intend to stop it. However, at least until
then, Anna Croft was a person we needed.

Dionysus raised his hand. [What do I do?]

"Don't do anything."

[What?]

I left Dionysus and glanced at the giant soldier.

Pluto was raising his body in the seawater. I asked him while nodding
towards Yoo Joonghyuk, "Can you pick up two people?"

[You're not satisfied with one and want me to do two?]

"Can you do it?"

[…Will you care if I say I can't?]




As the two myth-grade constellations clashed, the true voices of the
constellations came from the sky. They stopped fighting and voiced their
opinions on the current situation instead of pointing their weapons at each
other.

[I didn't think Hades would show up here…]

[How can we stop them? Athena, haven't you won a fight with Uncle
Poseidon before?]
[Isn't that another story? I just planted an olive tree… how can I win against
a myth-grade?]

[I don't know if the Lightning Throne or Mother Earth appears…]

The expressions of the 12 Gods were dark. The Lightning Throne neglected
the work of the nebula after entering the top-level scenario while Mother
Earth hated Olympus and was unlikely to interfere in this incident.

[Hermes, what about using the giant stories of Olympus?]

[They are the chief narrators of our giant story. Do you think it will work?]

[…That's true.]

There were comments here and there but a solution didn't come out.

Lee Seolhwa observed the conversation between constellations and
whispered in Lee Hyunsung's ears. "…I thought narrative-grade
constellations would be great but they're more ordinary than I thought."

"Yes."

"Then what should we do now? If the constellations are like this…"

There was no confidence in Lee Seolhwa's voice. In the meantime, Kim
Dokja's Company worked hard. It was natural to become confident after
training and progressing. However, now they weren't dealing with
historicalgrade or narrative-grade constellations. The stories they built
couldn't even compare to the toes of these enormous beings.

Shin Yoosung muttered in a small voice. "It was really had to beat that sun
ahjussi last time…"

Surya had two eyes closed and was watching the scene through the Third
Eye on his forehead. Even Surya, the strongest sun god, remained silent
without interrupting. He was also unable to confront the myth-grade
constellations.

Shockwaves spread. The clashes between Poseidon and Hades became
more frequent and cracks spread in the sky. The space itself was collapsing
from the collision. In addition, the more serious thing…

[Uncle Hades will lose.]

[It can't be helped. This stage is the 'sea'.]

Complicated expressions appeared on the faces of the 12 Gods. Poseidon or
Hades. No matter who won, Olympus would fall into the crucible of
confusion.

At this moment, Surya opened his mouth. [Something is coming.]

Someone had penetrated the expanse and was quickly approaching this
way. It was a giant soldier made of the skin of a black dragon.

Lee Gilyoung shouted, "Dokja hyung!"

There was a loud exhaust sound and the giant soldier stopped. Kim Dokja
emerged from inside Pluto. "Everyone. I'll explain it briefly."

Kim Dokja slowly looked at the constellations and incarnations. "I'm going
to make a sacred torch. For that, I need your help."

Suddenly, the 12 Gods glanced at each other. A true voice burst out.

[A sacred torch relay!]

[Indeed, why didn't I think of that?]

The voices spoke until Kim Dokja once again opened his mouth. "The 12
Gods, please don't do anything."
[What? What do you mean?]

"You belong to Olympus and have no way to resist Poseidon's giant story.
If you participate in the torch relay, it can be counterproductive."

Kim Dokja's words were true and some constellations nodded. However, it
wasn't everyone.

[If we don't help, how can we turn on the sacred fire?]

In the first place, the sacred torch was a light that came from the sun. In
order to start the sacred light, the help of the sun was needed.

Then Surya quietly stood up. Kim Dokja gazed at him. "Surya, sit down
too."

Surya sat down again.

[How will you make a sacred torch without the sun?]

"The sacred fire is about sanctification. It isn't turned on only by the sun."

[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' is shrugging.]

Looking back, Jung Heewon's body was held tightly by Lee Hyunsung who
had triggered Steel Transformation. Lee Hyunsung's cheeks were red,
although it was unknown if this was due to embarrassment or the flames of
Hell Flames Ignition.

"Too hoooooooot!"

"I'm sorry. Please endure it a bit more."

Surya nodded at the sight. [The flames of Eden are enough to replace the
sun's heat. However, the flames made from that sanctification will find it
hard to pierce through Poseidon's waves.]
"I know. Thus, it is time for you to step up."

Surya rose from where he was sitting. [Interesting.]




I needed more time before Lee Hyunsung was heated enough by the flames
so I sat on the giant soldier's shoulder and gave some instructions to the
group members. Then I looked around and saw Han Sooyoung dangling her
legs while sucking candy.

I scolded Han Sooyoung, "Is it delicious?"

"Strangely, I've been craving something sweet lately. Do you want to eat?"

Han Sooyoung didn't wait for my answer and shoved the candy she was
holding into my mouth.

It had a lemon flavour. I ate the candy and Han Sooyoung looked at me
quietly. "By the way, that's what I was eating."

"So?"

"…You are really no fun."

Han Sooyoung slid down from the shoulder of the giant soldier and landed
on its palm. I looked around and everyone also had a candy in their mouths,
even Yoo Joonghyuk.

Lee Seolhwa said, "Sooyoung-ssi gave them away. I heard it has a relaxing
effect."

That's why they were all biting one. I nodded in a convinced manner and
Lee Seolhwa asked, "Can we win?"
I looked up and slowly gazed at Lee Seolhwa. Lee Seolhwa was looking
back. I just smiled because I had no answer.

Victory or defeat, I didn't know such a thing. Just.

"No one will die."

Finally, the Steel Sword was preheated by the sacred flames and the 'torch'
was held in Pluto's hand.

I opened my mouth while boarding Pluto.

[Please gather together.]

One by one, the scattered party members gathered. People born in different
places and had different perspectives were gathered here. Thus, they
became a constellation of people.

[Giant Story 'Demon Realm's Spring' has begun!]

All the narrators of Kim Dokja's Company started their story.

「 It is a story originating from a reader. 」

「 The strongest and loneliest man in the world held his sword. 」

「 The steel sword bore the inferno of hell and soared towards the high
expanse. 」

The history that we accumulated was gathering in the flames of the sacred
torch. Our story was a giant story from outside Olympus. Thus, it was
impossible for Poseidon to not be hurt by this force.

From a distance, Poseidon noticed the message and looked this way.
He laughed and covered the air with waves, like a barrier. He was confident
that the barrier made with the power of a myth-grade constellation couldn't
be pierced.

It was possible to know just by facing him. Kim Dokja's Company couldn't
pierce that barrier with our current power. We needed more power and a
faster speed. A momentum strong enough to break through that wall.

Finally, there was an assistant to provide that momentum to us.

[Giant Story 'Demon Realm's Spring' has expanded.]

The sound of a train horn was heard from somewhere.

[Stage Transformation has occurred!]

「 Thus, the bright sun illuminated their way. 」

The train that was once our enemy was now rushing through the sky to pick
us up. The sun train emitted a dazzling golden aura and the party members
looked up with ecstatic eyes.

It was possible. If it was like this, it was clearly possible.

"Let's go, Kim Dokja's Company."
             Chapter 338: Ep. 63 - End of the Myth, V


At this time, all 'temporary bureau' members set up for the 60th scenario
were looking at the same screen. The battle between myth-grade
constellations was transmitted in real time. From low-grade to higher grade
dokkaebis, they gathered regardless of their grade, forgetting their own
channels scattered around various regions.

Hades vs. Poseidon.

In the past few years, the number of times constellations fought such a
bloody battle could be counted on the fingers of one hand. Of course, there
were cases of powerful constellations confronting each other but as always,
it was about the story of the battle.

A battle to defend their successors. Hades made a surprise declaration,
when he didn't have a successor for thousands of years, caused the
constellations to explode.
[The vast majority of constellations are enthusiastic about the battle scene!]
The vast majority. Even the advanced dokkaebis like Bihyung had never
seen such a cluster of constellations.

[The demon king 'Ruler of the East Hell' is enthusiastic about the battle!]

[The demon king 'Devil of Principles' is burning with the motivation to
participate in the scenario.]

[The constellation 'Saviour of Corruption' is watching the battle with mad
eyes!]

[The constellation 'Scribe of Heaven' is looking at the battlefield with
terrible eyes.]

The rumour spread quickly and the constellations started to gather together,
no matter if they were good or evil.

[The constellation 'Great Mother God Who Created Man out of Earth' is
watching the battle.]

[The constellation 'God King of Thunder' is interested in the war of
Olympus.]

[The constellation 'Founder of Reincarnation' is rejoicing.]

From the nebula Emperor to Vedas and Goddess Island. The constellations
of China, India and Ireland were gathered together to observe the battle of
myth-grade constellations.

The subscribers of the channel skyrocketed and the bureau was busy
capturing the remaining probability to sustain the scenario and maintain the
channels. There was no way the bureau could miss such an opportunity.

As the balance slowly tilted, the reaction of the constellations became
hotter. It was predicted that one myth would end here today. In the place
where one myth fell, a new story that never existed would bloom like a
flower.

Unlike the other dokkaebis who were full of excitement and passion,
Bihyung was in a state of uneasiness.

'…That bastard, what the hell is he doing?'

On the screen, Kim Dokja was moving. Giant Soldier Pluto was holding the
Steel Sword who had been heated up. The steel sword shone like a giant
torch in the sun of ancient Greek.

Dokgak opened his mouth. "Crazy. They're trying a sacred torch relay."

All the dokkaebis were streamers. A curious dokkaebi asked Dokgak. "A
sacred torch relay? What is it?"

"Do you know the torch that burns with flames in the myths?"

"I know."

"The sacred torch relay is the ceremony of 'peace' and 'victory'. They are
declaring that they will end this war through that fire."

After Dokgak's explanation, the dokkaebis opened their mouths.

"Crazy. Joining that battlefield now…"

The Demon King of Salvation was also famous among the dokkaebis. The
master of the new nebula, Kim Dokja's Company. The beloved demon king
of archangels, the rule of the 73rd Demon Realm. A 'returnee' who survived
the fight against the Indescribable Distance, received the favour of an outer
god and even crossed to another world.

"Even if it is him, this time…"

"He is a foolhardy man."
In the middle of this, one dokkaebi was laughing. "Haha, hahaha…"

It was Bihyung. Some of the dokkaebis looked puzzled but Bihyung
continued to laugh. He had a thought.

Perhaps none of the dokkaeb is here would understand his feelings. The
members of Kim Dokja's Company who carried the torch of revolution.

They were perceived as moths flying towards the flames.

However, he knew the stories they had accumulated. The difficulties given
to them had varying sizes but they were always in the realm of
'impossibility'.

"Yes, this is Kim Dokja!"

Bihyung watched the constellation drawn by Kim Dokja's Company and
was reminded of a history not long ago.

The first time he met Kim Dokja on the subway. The moment he made the
exclusive contract with Kim Dokja, who was weak but calm.

The stories piled up like snowflakes. There was something unbelievable. It
was something he saw for the first time. A trivial human who built up his
stories and became a constellation, finally reaching the starting point of A
Single Story.

Streamer Bihyung had watched it all.

Dokgak opened his mouth. "He will fail this time."

"Maybe so."

"You are composed. Isn't this the constellation you contracted with?"

"He used to be but not anymore."
Bihyung laughed. He didn't know if Kim Dokja's strategy would succeed or
not but strangely, he had a streamer's hunch. Kim Dokja's story wouldn't
end here.

[Giant Story 'Demon Realm's Spring' has expanded!]

Along with the system messages, the dokkaebis' eyes widened. A golden
train was flying through the sky. It was Surya's golden train.

"That…!"

If they were told about what would happen in the 60th scenario, who
would've believed it?

"If it is this… Maybe…!"

The cooperation between humans and gods. A Single Story, the torch of
sanctification was leading the way to success. The train descended like a
yellow dragon and the dokkaebis gulped.

Why? They watched the reckless, absurd and impossible challenge. Yet
why were the streamers' hearts burning?

Perhaps Dokgak was right. The attack might fail and this nebula might
become dust in the Star Stream. Nevertheless.

[The great dokkaebi 'Halong' is watching the 60th scenario.]

[The great dokkaebi 'Holong' is watching the 60th scenario,]

[The great dokkaebi 'Baram' is watching the end of the 60th scenario,]

At this moment, all dokkaebis were thinking the same thing.

「 I also want to make such a scenario. 」

The story of the constellations was growing on the grounds of the scenario.
The constellations who grew up eating the stories dreamt of another story.
This was the power of the Star Stream.

The overwhelmed Bihyung exclaimed, "They! They are the ones I raised!
Do you all know?"

What made a good story? What scenario was a good scenario? There was
no dokkaebi who knew the answer. If anyone knew, it would be the
Dokkaebi King.

However, the dokkaebis knew one thing. It was the fact that perhaps their
king would also be watching this story.




The head of the falling train finally crashed into the waves. The surprised
Poseidon's eyes widened. The status of the narrative-grade constellation
advanced and entered into Poseidon's waves. Even so, the walls of the
waves were still rough and thick.

"Next is me."

「 The woman who dreams of another apocalypse is staring her story. 」

Han Sooyoung moved along the edge of the train and released her bandages
to create black flames.

Han Sooyoung's formidable black flames took the form of a dragon.

She had already reached such a point. The shape of the dragon moved
forward and tore through the waves.

Lee Jihye followed.
「 The wounded swordsman raised her sword to protect her relationships.
」

The key ring on Lee Jihye's sword shone as she raised it like a commander.
At almost the same time, a fleet appeared on the wall of waves. The Ghost
Fleet fired through the passage made by the black dragon.

Poseidon called his flagship as Yi Sunsin's bombardment prevented the
waves from filling back up.

However, Poseidon couldn't afford to worry about this. Hades had regained
his momentum and aimed for his neck with the scythe of the Underworld.

Behind the bombardment, Giant Soldier Pluto took a sprinting posture in
the rear of the train.

Shin Yoosung declared, "Depart, ahjussi!"

The inertia of the train added to Pluto's speed. The wind attribute of the
chimera dragon amplified the speed even further.

"Go, Dokja hyung!"

Along with Lee Gilyoung's cheer, Pluto started the dash. Pluto held the
Steel Sword in both hands while Jung Heewon supplied hellfire to it.

"Haaaat!"

Lee Hyunsung bellowed and Pluto flew through the sky.

[Giant Story 'Demon Realm's Spring' is continuing the story!]

[Giant Story 'Supreme Ruler of the Open Seas' is continuing!]

Stories and stories clashed and Pluto's gloves were torn off. Kim Namwoon
screamed with pleasure despite the pain.
「 The steel giant, who returned from hell, swung his sword. 」

「 The flames of hell burned up the steel. 」

The sword that burned with hellfire and the stories of all the other
members. The flames of the torch vaporized many water walls at once. The
myth-rated barrier, that seemed impossible to penetrate, was being broken.

Beyond the broken waves, the defenseless Theseus could be seen. In the
situation where victory was in front of his eyes, Pluto didn't move. The
world shook like it was reversed and I vomited up blood inside Pluto.

In the meantime, Poseidon had thrown Triaina and it pierced Pluto's waist.
It was the exact place where I was riding.

"Dokja-ssi!"

Jung Heewon's voice was faintly heard.

[The power of the star relic 'Triaina' is fatally injured your incarnation
body!]

[The status is a power you can't afford!]

[The giant soldier 'Pluto' has offset some of your shock.]

This was the majesty of a myth-grade constellation. It could trample on a
narrative-grade constellation like me as if I was a worm.

The waves had been pierced but the flames of the torch were cooling down.
Lee Hyunsung seemed stunned and Jung Heewon's magic power was
almost running out. The waves were showing signs of recovery again.

Poseidon was still relaxed as he dealt with Hades. There was a faint smile.
Maybe he thought he won. Towards that Poseidon, I laughed. As always,
the protagonist was the last to attack.
"Yoo Joonghyuk!"

Behind the torch that was dying out, a man in a black coat was running with
everyone's stories on his back. The surprised Poseidon created a water spear
but Red Phoenix Shunpo quickly avoided it. Some spears that couldn't be
stopped pierced Yoo Joonghyuk's thighs and shoulders.

[The item 'Giant's Armour' is effective!]

The armour that contained the power of the giants barely protected Yoo
Joonghyuk from the sacred spears.

One step, two steps, three steps.

As the number of spears that stabbed it increased, the Giant's Armour
started to crumble. Then it shattered. With 10 steps left, Poseidon's status
rushed towards Yoo Joonghyuk.

Yoo Joonghyuk's expression hardened. This was a power that a regressor of
the third round couldn't afford. Just a bit more. Just a little bit further.
Theseus was right in front of our noses.

「 Kim Dokja. 」

Yoo Joonghyuk in my vision became a bit blurry. I knew from the
beginning that it was unreasonable. It wasn't possible for Yoo Joonghyuk to
go to the place where Theseus was located.

[The exclusive skill, 'Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint' has been activated!]

Then what if he wasn't the 'third round?'

[Your blurred consciousness has been partially liberated from the
constraints of your body.]
[Exclusive skill, Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint stage 3 has been

activated!] Once again, the landscape I saw had changed.

[The 1st person protagonist's point of view has been activated!]

It was the very landscape that Yoo Joonghyuk saw.

「 Kim Dokja? 」

Yoo Joonghyuk's thoughts seemed confused. Poseidon's spear was moving.
I felt time slowing as I turned over the pages of Ways of Survival in my
head.

The third round couldn't finish this. However, I eagerly imagined what
would be possible someday.

[The story 'Hell of Eternity' has begun.]

The 4th round, the 5th round, the 6th round… the 41st round… the 56th
round…

[This round can't be understood with your Reading Comprehension.]

Pain came over me and my bloodshot eyes seemed like they were going to
explode. The explosive stories were a mess in my head. Still, I didn't give
up.

[The Fourth Wall is protecting your spirit!]

[Your 'Reading Comprehension' is moving towards new possibilities.]

[The pages you can't read are opening!]

Countless curious eyes were on us. They weren't constellations. Yoo
Joonghyuk muttered, 「 This… 」
The 'Yoo Joonghyuk' of the other rounds were watching us. Some looked
envious while others had gloomy expressions. Finally, there was one with
an expression of intrigue.

「 Interesting. 」

I quickly moved through the pages and reached the maximum I could turn
over now. Thus, I finally used the future ahead of me.

[You have reached the maximum number of rounds you can read.]

[The maximum number of times you can read 'Yoo Joonghyuk' is up to the
'362nd round'.]

The 362nd round Yoo Joonghyuk. This was the last card I could bring out.
The 362nd round Yoo Joonghyuk wasn't strong enough to kill Poseidon. In
order to do that, the number of regressions must be 1,700 times.

[Thanks to the influence of 1st person protagonist's point of view, the talent
of 'Yoo Joonghyuk' of this round is passed onto others.]

[The talent of '362nd round Yoo Joonghyuk' is attracted to 'Yoo
Joonghyuk'.]

However, the 362nd round Yoo Joonghyuk was strong enough. It was
because the 362nd round Yoo Joonghyuk:

「 "It has been a while, Poseidon." 」

It was the Yoo Joonghyuk who fought against Poseidon for the first time.

「 "At that time, I killed your son." 」

Poseidon's furious roar was head. The 362nd round Yoo Joonghyuk moved
inside Yoo Joonghyuk of the 3rd round. It was a stance that he took a
million, ten million times.
「 "This is Palm Boxing." 」

Yoo Joonghyuk's Breaking the Sky Force Punch break through the final
barrier and pierced Theseus' body.

[Pluto was raising his body in the seawater. I asked him while nodding
towards Yoo Joonghyuk, "Can you pick up two people?"]
             Chapter 339: Ep. 63 - End of the Myth, VI


[The character 'Yoo Joonghyuk' has used Breaking the Sky Force Punch
Lv. ???!]

[The skill level of this person can't be converted to a numerical value!]

[The skill is strengthened abnormally due to the power of the story!]

Theseus' right arm was destroyed by Yoo Joonghyuk's Breaking the Sky
Force Punch and floated in the water. Theseus watched this with a blank
expression.

I felt sorry for him who didn't do anything wrong. However, as long as
Poseidon had descended into Theseus' body, getting rid of Theseus was the
only way to expel the myth-grade constellation from the scenario.

The next moment, sparks appeared around Yoo Joonghyuk's entire body.

[Some dokkaebis are doubting the probability of the story!]
[The incarnation body of the character can't bear the skill!]

…As expected, he might have the talent of the 362nd round Yoo
Joonghyuk but this was the body of the 3rd round. It was insufficient to
break Poseidon's barrier and destroy Theseus' flesh.

[The power of the item 'King Lycomedes' Leather Gloves' is triggered!]

There was an item that would bridge this gap. It was the very item I had
purchased from Anna Croft.

[Stage Transformation is triggered by the effect of King Lycomedes'
Leather Gloves!]

King Lycomedes was a figure known as the murderer of Theseus in
mythology. Theseus' complexion changed. Nevertheless, Theseus stepped
forward instead of retreating. He unfolded his arms as if begging to be
killed.

[…Theseus!]

The moment Poseidon's wrathful true voice was heard, Yoo Joonghyuk's
Breaking the Sky Force Punch struck again.

[The constellation 'Abandoned Lover of the Labyrinth' is grieving.]

I saw Theseus looking down at his heart and then looking at Yoo
Joonghyuk, or perhaps me. In the last moment, there was a relieved smile
on Theseus' face.

[The incarnation body of the constellation 'Hero of the Labyrinth' has
completely disappeared.]

It was just the death of the incarnation body and he wouldn't disappear
completely. Still, Theseus would be so damaged that he couldn't do any
scenario activities for the time being. Theseus threw his body to complete
this scenario, despite knowing all of that.

[Olympus' leaders have all died!]

[The scenario clear conditions have been met.]

[Calculating the contribution of individual incarnations and constellations!]

.

.

[1st person protagonist's point of view has been released.]

I coughed up blood as I returned to my body again.

Inside the broken Pluto, Kim Namwoon's voice was heard. [The calling has
stopped… grasshopper. Bye…]

Pluto's summoning time ended and he was returned to the Underworld. At
the same time, a massive storm of water swept over the area where Theseus'
incarnation body had died.

Poseidon who had descended in Theseus' body was running wild. In the
midst of the spraying water, the incarnations struggled for breath. A portion
of Poseidon's status was pouring towards the defenseless Yoo Joonghyuk.

It wasn't an attack that could be avoided by Yoo Joonghyuk, who was
seriously damaged and turned to rags thanks to the talent of the 362nd
round.

I shouted, [Hades!]

[I understand.]
Hades appeared in the air with Kynee, holding Yoo Joonghyuk in his arms.
Poseidon's spear only crashed into the depths of the deep sea.

This wasn't the end. Cracks spread rapidly around the area where Triaina
was stabbed. The cracks started to suck up everything around it like a
vacuum cleaner.

Unfortunately, I was also included in the things to be cleaned. My damaged
incarnation body didn't have the strength to resist this suction. I stretched
out my hand as I was being swept away by the torrents. However, there was
no one to grab my hand.

…That's what I thought.

「 Dokja-ssi! 」

「 You idiot! 」

Hair scattered beautifully in the water. Lee Seolhwa swam like a mermaid
and grabbed my left arm while Han Sooyoung followed her and grabbed
my right arm. The two people stopped my bleeding with Hit a Pressure
Point and pulled me up with all their strength.

I saw Han Sooyoung swimming desperately in order to get away from the
crack in the deep sea.

Shortly thereafter, we emerged safely from the water.

"Haaap!"

"Kim Dokja, you crazy guy!"

[The main scenario will close soon!]

Rather than replying to Han Sooyoung, I watched the currents. If my
prediction was correct, Poseidon lost his incarnation body and would be
forced to return.
[The constellation 'Spear that Draws the Boundaries of the Sea' is roaring!]

However, the situation went differently than expected. Poseidon's power
was becoming stronger instead of weakening.

"…Ahjussi?"

It seemed that the party members perceived something was wrong.

[The bureau is urging the 'Spear that Draws the Boundaries of the Sea' to
withdraw!]

Poseidon didn't disappear despite the bureau's recommendation. The
situation was obvious. In a scenario that already ended, there were no
justifications for his actions.

[The bureau is preparing sanctions for the 'Spear that Draws the Boundaries
of the Sea' to withdraw!]

Fortunately, the bureau seemed to be doing its job properly. I watched the
boiling and seething sea. The question was what Poseidon would do until
the sanctions were imposed…

A little further away, Hades and Persephone were watching this side.

[Many constellations are condemning 'Spear that Draws the Boundaries of
the Sea'!]

[Sh―ut―up!]

My mind seemed to go blank from the true voice. In the distance, a tsunami
was approaching. It was a wave hundreds of meters high.

"Crazy! What is that?"

"Poseidon is crazy!"
The incarnations belatedly tried to flee but it was too late. Some of them,
including the giants, were swept away by the first wave. It was a giant wave
of water that no one could resist.

I looked at Hades but Hades didn't move. The reason he didn't come
forward was obvious. Hades had exactly the same idea as me.

We simultaneously looked up at the sky.

「 No matter how disinterested you are in Olympus, you can't just watch
this time. 」

[The bureau is giving probability to someone.]

The next moment, the colour of the sky changed. A light that seemed to
paralyze sight and hearing filled the sky. The light seemed to make the
world disappear. It was a little while later that I realized it was a very large
lightning bolt.

The lightning tore through the waves. It was strong enough to split the sea
into two and burn the ground of the deep sea. I heard Poseidon's last roar
before he disappeared.

[The constellation 'Spear that Draws the Boundaries of the Sea' has exited
the scenario.]

It was an incredible sight. Nevertheless, it really happened.

[The constellation 'Lightning Throne' is looking down at Olympus.]

No matter how many of the 12 Gods there were, they didn't dare to face
him. The moment the indirect message came up, all the gods of Olympus
froze in place. It was the same for the insolent Dionysus and the virtuous
Athena and Artemis. The gaze of the sky slowly turned to the king of the
Underworld.
「 The underground and sky faced each other. 」

As if this conversation was enough, Hades wore Kynee and disappeared
from the scenario.

[The constellation 'Father of the Rich Night' has exited the scenario.]

Persephone disappeared while winking at me.

[We'll meet again soon, our cute son.]

Two of the three chief gods had disappeared but the tension wasn't
diminished. There was the sound of the world moving as the scales of
probability once again tilted.

It was clear who the bureau had given probability to. King of Olympus,
Zeus. The only one in Olympus who had reached the 'last scenario'. No
constellation other than Zeus could eject Poseidon and cause this reaction in
the constellations.

In fact, Biyoo's channel had a festive atmosphere.

[The dokkaebi of the bureau has recalled the probability given to the
Lightning Throne.]

[The bureau is recommending for the Lightning Throne to withdraw.]

A festival was called a festival because it was short.

If Zeus stayed in the sub scenario for a long time, he would harm the
balance of the Star Stream. It might bring about a disaster like Indescribable
Distance last time. Even so, Zeus was arrogant.

[Don't rush me. I didn't come at your request. I came to see my seeds.]

The sky of Olympus looked down at the 12 Gods. The 12 Gods who came
here were tense in front of Zeus' gaze.
[Yet they are still… only garbage.]

At Zeus' words, the 12 Gods sat down like they had received a great shock.
Dionysus' shoulders were trembling. He was a narrative-grade constellation
but Dionysus couldn't resist at all.

Some stories were like this. They accumulated for a long time and couldn't
resist ending.

The clouds in the sky were lifted and Zeus' status became blurred. Like a
farmer turning his back to barren ground, Zeus was leaving the scenario.

Some of the 12 Gods muttered, [Even his children…]

At this moment, a small stone flew towards the sky. It was the stone I
threw. The stone in the air was destroyed by the sparks of probability.

[The constellation 'Lightning Throne' is looking at you.]

I felt a powerful status surrounding my body but I just glared at the sky. In
any case, the probability allowed to Zeus was over.

[The constellation 'Lightning Throne' has exited the scenario.]

I looked back at the 12 Gods. "Why are you just listening to his words?"

[You…]

The moment Dionysus was going to spear, a message poured from the sky.
No, it wasn't a message.

Dionysus, the 12 Gods and even me. We looked up at the sky where Zeus
had disappeared.

White snow was falling like stars. The snow was irrelevant to Zeus, who
ruled the sky. It was the power of a constellation who existed perhaps even
longer than Zeus. It was the existence of light who ruled the first sky before
Olympus was made.

Like a lonely island, Briareus and the giants howled as they watched the
falling snow.

[Main scenario #60 ― 'Gigantomachia' has ended.]

[Sub scenario - Myth Subversion has been completed.]

[The compensation settlement will begin.]

The constellations of the world were watching me. Apart from the four
main constellations, there were constellations I knew and those I didn't
know.

Dionysus spoke. […You won, Kim Dokja.]

The Breaking the Sky Sword Saint and other giants used their big bodies
like ships to carry us.

Yoo Joonghyuk and Han Sooyoung were looking in at the sky in different
directions. Jung Heewon and Lee Hyunsung helped each other while Lee
Seolhwa clasped her hands tightly together. Lee Jihye was wiping her tears
while embracing Shin Yoosung and Lee Gilyoung. Maybe they were
listening to the system messages too.

[You have acquired a new giant story!]

[Three additional new stories have been acquired!]

It was a really long-prepared plan. I was able to see the things that would
happen in the future, as if I was reading a novel with a definite ending.
[Your second giant story has completed the 'success' portion!]
[The second condition of the hidden scenario ―A Single Story has been
fulfilled!]

Finally, the awaited 'success' greeted me.

[The nebula 'Kim Dokja's Company' has become well known in the Star
Stream.]

A system message celebrating our victory widely resonated in the universe.

[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' is raising his rod!]

[The constellation, "Black Dragon of the Abyss," is waving the bandages of
liberation!]

[The constellation 'Secretive Plotter' is nodding.]

[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' is proud of you.]

The constellations in my channel were congratulating me.

[Some of the constellations of the 'last scenario' are paying attention to

you.] Then beings of the 'last scenario' like Zeus started to notice me.

[The demon kings of the Demon Realm are paying attention to your
actions.] [The archangels of Eden are paying attention to you.]

[Unknown gods of another world are staring at your existence.]

[The 'Seekers of the End' are listening to your story.]

In the midst of the white and snowy sea, good and evil and those who didn't
belong to either side were watching the story. The end of the myth that had
long dominated the world. Those who made the story with me would find
me.
"Kim Dokja."

However, at this moment…

"…Kim Dokja?"

I already wasn't there.
         Chapter 340: Ep. 64 - A Road That Isn't a Road, I


Immediately after the collapse of Olympus in Gigantomachia, the
restrictions on the giants disappeared. They were freed from the old story
and would be reborn as participants in new scenarios.

[There is no desire to repeat the old battle. Do you agree?]

[I agree.]

Briareus, leader of the giants and Dionysus, interim representative of the 12
Gods, reached a dramatic agreement just before the end of the 60th
scenario.

[The Star Stream has acknowledged this 'myth collapse'.]

[A new story is blooming in the 60th scenario.]

In fact, they could've fought more if they wanted to fight. However, the
power of Olympus had been drastically weakened through Gigantomachia.
Many heroes and giants died, Poseidon's whereabouts were unclear and the
silent Underworld King announced his successor.

In such a situation, the existence of the nebula would be jeopardized if the
12 gods and giants were to keep confronting each other.

The downfall of the giant nebula, Olympus. At the center of this ridiculous
story, there was a small nebula.

[A number of constellations are shouting the name 'Kim Dokja's
Company!']

The story, which began with the struggle of a small constellation, was
finally coming to the end with a giant story. Despite this, the members of
the nebula didn't appreciate the giant story and were calling someone's
name.

"Dokja-ssi! Dokja-ssi!"

"Hyung! Don't mess around! Where are you hiding?"

Jung Heewon, Lee Hyunsung, Lee Jihye, Lee Gilyoung, Shin Yoosung…

They were looking for Kim Dokja on the small island made by the giants.
Someone sounded uneasy while another had an expression full of disbelief.
The only one who remained calm in this chaos was the one staring up at the
sky with an expressionless face.

Han Sooyoung stared closely at him and asked, "Yoo Joonghyuk, do you
know something?"

"…"

"Answer me. The kids are worried."

Yoo Joonghyuk slowly turned towards Han Sooyoung. The party members
noticed something and gathered behind Han Sooyoung.
"Master, what is it? Do you know something?"

"What happened to Dokja-ssi again?"

Yoo Joonghyuk was silent for a while before replying, "Kim Dokja has
returned to Earth."

"What? Without us?"

Lee Jihye belatedly discovered something and opened her mouth. "Ah…
don't tell me?"

In retrospect, Gigantomachia wasn't their real purpose. In the beginning,
participating in Gigantomachia was only a process. While everyone was
feeling excited by the joy of victory, only Kim Dokja was thinking about
the real purpose of this task.

Jung Heewon sighed with relief and smiled. "…Still, he didn't have to
quickly go back on his own."

"We'll go back too!"

Then a system message emerged.

[The region will be restricted for one hour to stabilize the scenario.]

Lee Seolhwa's eyes widened with surprise. "How did Dokja-ssi get out of
here?"

"He probably used a special method."

"A special method?"

"I don't know anything else."
Yoo Joonghyuk replied and stared up at the sky again. It was still snowing.
Snow was falling in summer weather. Based on Earth tie, it was snowing in
August.

Han Sooyoung stared into his eyes and asked him, "…Did Kim Dokja go
back first because of Yoo Sangah?"

There was a reason for asking what should've been obvious. Yoo
Joonghyuk's answer came back after the miraculous snow melted in the
sun.
"You'll know when you see it."




In the vehicle that ran in dimensions, I was lost in thoughts. During the time
when I was planning to overthrow Gigantomachia, I had contacted several
constellations. Perhaps all those with the slightest acquaintance received
my call.

Most of them were in a special relationship with Olympus or were in a
difficult position to participate in the 60th scenario. I could understand.
What constellation would want to be in a hostile relationship with a big
nebula like Olympus?

Nevertheless, there was one who made a unique suggestion.

–I can't help in Gigantomachia but if you fail, I can pave the way for you to
get away. Just, it can only be you.

The one who made the suggestion was now sitting in the driver's seat and
holding the steering wheel.

[…I didn't know you would take advantage of my proposal in this way.]
The owner of the Special Ferrarigini who could use the portals of the
scenario because of his probability and who had free access to the
dimension.

The Mass Production Maker laughed. [Originally, you were a type who
rarely asked for help from someone else.]

"My thoughts are a bit different after coming back from another world." I
smiled and added, "In addition, I accidentally left the X-grade Ferrarigini
behind. I haven't finished the instalment plan yet so I'm still crying
whenever I think about it."

[Haha, the car you bought from me?]

"Thus, in the future, I have decided to ride in other people's cars without
driving my own."

[It is a disappointing decision from a seller's position. This time a new
model came out and I was going to give you a free one.]

"…For free?"

[I'm lying.]

…I knew it. There was no way this constellation would see any losses. The
Mass Production Maker seemed to think of something as he held a cigarette
in his mouth. The scattered smoke was sucked into the vents installed
before it could reach me in the passenger's seat.

[I want to make a contract with your nebula.]

"Contract?"

[Do you know what you've done this time?]

I knew. I couldn't not know.
[Giant Story 'Torch That Swallowed the Myth' is flowing through your
veins!]

It was because even now, the result of what I had done was flowing through
the veins in my body.

Torch That Swallowed the Myth.

This story wasn't the 'One Who Erases God's Fingerprints' or 'Person Who
Closes the Door of a Myth' that I had originally intended to obtain. Still, its
essence was similar. The story of fighting against a great nebula and
overthrowing myths. This story would be a counter for the numerous
nebulae I would fight in the future.

[Many constellations have come to know of Kim Dokja's Company.]

"Yes."

[Some of them even claim that you should put your nebula in one of the 12
Great Nebulae.]

…The 12 Great Nebulae. I didn't realize I was already in a position to hear
this story. The 12 Great Nebulae dominating the Star Stream considered of
three strong, four medium and five weak ones. Olympus, who was located
between the three strong and four medium ones, was greatly upset this time
and someone had to fill that space.

"There are many hasty stars."

[They're always like this.]

"Then the Mass Production Maker wants to take advantage of this
opportunity to sign a contract with my nebula."

[That's right.]

There was no hesitation in the Mass Production Maker's answer.
[I'd like to leave this new product's advertisement to your nebula.]

"That's good. I will ask the members of my nebula."

[Great. The incarnation I want to appear personally is…]

I listened to the Mass Production Maker while staring out the window of
the scenes passing by the Ferrarigini. The seasons of the myriad of stories
flowed through the landscape. The seasons of numerous stories flowed in
the passing landscape.

That's right. Suddenly…

"It is fast." As I spoke, I subconsciously grabbed the bottle of star fluid in
my pocket. I had come this far faster than any of the original rounds. Yet
this speed was only a relative speed. I didn't know if this was fast enough.

The Mass Production Maker laughed and said, [This new product is a bit
faster. You will know if you drive it yourself but the driving sensation is
very…]

"The time is too slow compared to the driving speed. Are you doing this
intentionally to talk about the contract?"

[Hum, what are you talking about? I am going the fastest way. Look, it is
already the last intersection.]

As the Mass Production Maker said, there were three portals emitting a
white light on the other side of the dimension. I didn't ask but the Mass
Production Maker explained.

[One is the road to Earth and the other is the road to the Context of the
Constellations.]

"What is the last one?"

[A road that looks like a 'road'.]
The Mass Production Maker smiled significantly. It was much darker than
other portals and gave off a shady vibe.

[Do you know what is at the end?]

Of course, I didn't know. I might've read Ways of Survival but there wasn't
a description of all the portals in the dimension. In other words, this portal
was a road that didn't exist in Ways of Survival.

"What is it?"

[It's nothing. It is just a blocked road.]

The answer came back like it was obvious. Before I could say anything, the
Mass Production Maker continued. [The end of some roads. The road that
looks different from other roads, it is a road that no one walked or a road
that isn't even a road.]

The Ferrarigini sped past the dark portal. The sparkling navigation system
was showing the route to Earth. On the screen, the portal we had just gone
past was marked as 'no road'.

[Such roads are usually cut off in obscure places. The people who chose to
walk along the path believe it is the end.]

"What is your meaning?"

[Please choose your path well.]

The Mass Production Maker put out the cigarette and gave his distinctly
gentle smile.

[Sometimes the thing that looks like a road isn't a road.]

The next moment, the landscape of the dimension changed. I saw the
appearance of the blue planet and landed on the ground.
The Mass Production Maker told me, [We've arrived. Fortunately, this time
it is good.]




The moment I arrive in Seoul, I naturally headed to the Factory. It was to
the hospital ward where patients were admitted. The moment I stepped into
the ward, I heard a voice that was close to a true voice.

[You came.]

It sounded like a true voice but it wasn't a true voice. It was a voice where
the dignity of a transcendent could be heard. A blue-white magic power
filled the air. As expected, every teacher wanted to look good in front of
their student.

"This poor disciple is greeting you."

[There is no time. Leave the greetings for later. Go.]

Perhaps it was the aftermath of the returnees war but Kyrgios had bandages
wrapped around his body.

"The Heavenly Demon and Blood Demon…"

[I killed them. Don't talk to me and go quickly.]

I was amazed by the calm declaration. He survived the Heavenly Demon
and Blood Demon who killed the Breaking the Sky Sword Saint in a past
life. I didn't realize my teacher in this round was so strong.

Aileen found me in the distance and came running. She was the only Story
Expert in the Factory. If she wasn't here, two of the party members
would've already died.
I waved the star fluids and shouted, "I brought the star fluid!"

"Um, you haven't been told yet but…"

"I already know."

In the distance, two red rooms could be seen. One was the hospital room of
Yoo Sangah and the other…

"How is my mother?"

"Her symptoms are almost the same as Yoo Sangah."

"The severity of the symptoms?"

"More or less the same level…"

I knew that my mother had been overworking herself. The stigma 'Giant
Future' placed a great burden on the user's body. Moreover, the contract
with the nebula itself was in an obscure form and the burden increased even
more after my mother's sponsor lost strength.

Aileen took the star fluids from me and spoke in a dark voice. "I think it is
lacking."

"That's why I have two bottles. They are different types."

I didn't bring only one star fluid. There was the Nectar from Dionysus as
well as the Soma I was originally supposed to receive from Surya.

Aileen's expression glowed as she received the two bottles of star fluids.

"…Medical staff!"

The staff rushed at her signal towards the two hospital rooms. Someone
brushed past me and the wound in my side caused by Poseidon throbbed.
My vision blurred for a moment.
…I might need to receive treatment. No, it would be strange to be fine after
being hit by a myth-grade constellation. I worked hard to hide the pain from
the wound. My consciousness was unstable. The doors to the hospital
rooms seemed like the entrance to the portal that the Mass Production
Maker had shown me.

[Are you okay?]

Kyrgios flew through the air and asked me. I replied that I was fine. To be
exact, it felt like I answered but I lost consciousness for a while.

Once I woke up, I was lying on a chair in the ward. Aileen was standing in
front of me. I endured the pain and stood up.

"…What happened to the two people?" I immediately asked despite my
blurred consciousness.

However, Aileen's expression was strange. "…It isn't enough."

"It isn't enough? What?"

"The two of them worsened faster than I thought. I can barely cure one
person if I use both star fluids."

I couldn't understand the words. Aileen's words sounded like faraway
alien words, like she was an outer god. "That… what do you mean?"

"Demon King of Salvation."

Aileen formally called out my modifier. She only called me this when she
needed my orders.

The two rooms were wide open, like a portal waiting for me.

"You can only save one person."
        Chapter 341: Ep. 64 - A Road That Isn't a Road, II


All types of thoughts passed through my head.

[The 'Fourth Wall' is shaking violently.]

There were two doors and someone seemed to be whispering to me. I could
go inside one of them. However, if I chose one then I had to give up the
other one. I couldn't do that.

"Demon King of Salvation."

"…Yes."

"If you delay then you can't save either of them." There was no sense of
reality in Aileen's voice.

"Please wait a moment."
In my dizzy vision, the corridor across from the two hospital rooms was
seen. The words of the Mass Production Maker crossed my mind.

–It's nothing. It is just a blocked road.

The end of the corridor was dim so I couldn't see anything. Yet everyone
knew that there was nothing at the end of that corridor. In the first place, the
corridor was made to have nothing.

「 Kim Dokja thought: It isn't possible. 」

Stay calm. There must be a way. I had come all this way and now I had to
choose between the two people? Who should live and who should die? I
couldn't do that.

[The Fourth Wall is looking at you.]

「 But you ha ve al ready cho sen. 」

At the moment, the scene of the first scenario filled my head. The shaky
subway. The appearance of those who died. Maybe I could've saved
everyone there.

「 Th us, you can ch oose this ti me too. 」

…It was different now.

「 Wh at is diffe rent? 」

Rather than replying to the Fourth Wall, I asked Aileen, "How much time is
left?"

"Around 20 minutes… Lee Sookyung-ssi's side is more critical. After
that…"

20 minutes. It was short but there was enough time to try this and that. It
was too early to give up.
"If there is more star fluid, can you save both of them?"

"…There isn't a lot of possibility."

I immediately pulled out the Old to New Toad. The toad cried out, –

Give me an old house and I'll give you a new house.

I pointed to the half-filled bottle of Nectar and asked,

"Can you change this to something new?"

Then the Old to New Toad shook its head.

–It isn't old or new.

"This was half-eaten by me. Thus, it is old. I'll give you other items if you
fill up a new bottle…"

–The change… I can't help you.

As expected, such a trick wasn't possible with the star fluid. I had thought it
might be possible.

–Tired, don't call me.

Perhaps it was tired from swallowing the giant soldier earlier but the Old to
New Toad fell asleep.

I put it away and decided to try a second method. If I couldn't duplicate it, I
had to get a new one.

[The demon king 'Demon King of Salvation'…]

[The use of the indirect message is cancelled.]
[The indirect messaging function is currently disabled due to checking and
repairing certain scenarios.]

…What?

[The scenario being checked is the 60th scenario.]

It was an unexpected situation I hadn't thought of. I didn't think the
aftermath of the 60th scenario would reach this far…

I needed the help of other constellations to get new star fluids.

"Jang Hayoung!"

At my cry, Aileen's gaze moved to another place. The place where Jang
Hayoung was located was Yoo Sangah's hospital room. The moment I
stood on the threshold of the hospital room where the emergency light was
on, a cold sensation went down my back.

"You can't enter without permission!" Someone yelled at me.

The fragments of the story scattered from Yoo Sangah hovered in the air. I
tried to ignore it and turned to Jang Hayoung. Jang Hayoung was sleeping
in a corner of the hospital room. "Jang Hayoung! Wake up! Quickly!"

"Wait a minute! He is also in critical condition!"

The medical staff rushed over and pulled me away. Jang Hayoung had a
large number of story packs inserted in him and bandages were wrapped
around his body. He was seriously wounded in the Returnees War.
However, I needed Jang Hayoung's skill.

[The Unidentified Wall is looking at you.]

[The Fourth Wall is facing the Unidentified Wall.]
Sparks bounced as I felt the gaze of the wall. It was a coldness with no
sense of cooperation at all.

…It was going to be like this? I opened Bookmark. In the end, the
Unidentified Wall was also a skill. I still didn't have a good understanding
of Jang Hayoung and needed some luck but…

I started looking for Jang Hayoung's name in the list of Bookmarks.
Perhaps it felt uncomfortable due to my actions? The Unidentified Wall
warned, [The 'Unidentified Wall' says: You are not my master. Don't do
anything unnecessary.]

"I need your help." I told it honestly. It was urgent. "If you don't help me,
you have to wake up your master."

The wall was silent for a moment. It was a silence that showed it was
thinking about something. A moment later, a message from the wall came
back.

[The 'Unidentified Wall' says: …I'll help you.]

At the same time, a small partition of space was created around me. It was a
space reminiscent of a Mino Soft intern a long time ago. A large panel was
created in front of me and there was a familiar type of input device.

Perhaps Jang Hayoung had listened to the stories of countless constellations
in this small wall. Jang Hayoung listened to stories that were written on this
wall like graffiti and…

[The Unidentified Wall says: Do a good job'.]

…I had nothing to say. I looked down at the sleeping Jang Hayoung for a
moment before turning my head.

First of all, it was important to turn off the emergency light.
[The 'Unidentified Wall' has temporarily granted you a license.]

[Enter the destination to send a message to.]

The first constellation was Dionysus.

[The message can't be sent to the constellation.]

[At present, all communications with the nebula Olympus is paralyzed.]

I ran into a snag from the beginning. I quickly changed the receiver of the
message. Then a reply immediately came back.

–You need more Soma? I'm sorry but… I gave all the Soma I had to you.

The reply was from Surya. The situation here also wasn't easy.

–Is it difficult to request more from the nebula?

–I withdrew from Vedas and lost the Soma production rights.

–Is Dionysus beside you?

After a few moments, there was an answer from Surya.

–Recently, Olympus is suffering from the famine story and the supply of
Nectar is cut off. There is no more left to give you.

–I understand. Thank you.

–I'm sorry I couldn't help.

–No.

It was impossible to ask for anything further when I already received
Surya's help in Gigantomachia.
I thought about various types of star fluids that appeared in Ways of
Survival through my head. However, none that could replace Nectar and
Soma were available right away.

I desperately bit my lips. If treatment wasn't possible then I had to find
another way.

[Sending a message to constellation 'Queen of the Darkest Spring'.]

Since Persephone and Hades weren't members of Olympus, it was possible
to communicate with them through the Unidentified Wall. I didn't want to
use this method but it wasn't time to cover up cold water with warm water.

Nevertheless, the answer that came back from Persephone wasn't very
positive.

–Son, as you might know, a presence broken through the flow of
consciousness is… All souls of this world go to the Underworld but that is
a case when the soul is intact.

–…As expected, it is like this.

I actually expected it a bit. The flow of consciousness was a phenomenon
where the stories of the soul were broken.

A soul suffering from this disease wouldn't go to the Underworld. To be
exact, it didn't go anywhere. It just ended there. Just as everyone who
walked on the wrong road disappeared forever.

Persephone continued speaking.

–Son.

–It is a situation where the succession isn't properly established yet. Don't
call me that right now.
I responded quickly before disconnecting. I opened the smartphone and
then the file of Ways of Survival. There was still a method. There had to be.

[The Unidentified Wall says: You have done too many things that
went against probability.] …Shut up.

[The Unidentified Wall says: That probability was bound to come back to
you.] It is a law of this world.]

"I told you to shut up."

I quickly read Ways of Survival. I found several times when Yoo
Joonghyuk met similar challenges in Ways of Survival. For example, the
161st and 275th rounds.

In those rounds, Yoo Joonghyuk was in a situation where he could only
save one of his two colleagues. When told he could only save Lee Seolhwa
or Lee Jihye, Yoo Joonghyuk had replied:

「 "I will save both." 」

The same was true for the 275th round. Lee Hyunsung and Shin Yoosung.
In a situation where only one of them could be saved, Yoo Joonghyuk
declared,

「 "I will save both of them." 」

This was Yoo Joonghyuk's answer. Thus, Yoo Joonghyuk of the 161st and
275th round failed. He couldn't save Lee Seolhwa, Lee Jihye, Lee
Hyunsung or Shin Yoosung. Then he died himself. Yet every time, Yoo
Joonghyuk made the same choice and I would choose the same.

My right hand holding the phone trembled nervously and I gripped it
tightly.

「 Bu t Kim Dok ja isn't Yoo Joong hyuk. 」
Yoo Joonghyuk was able to make such a choice because he was a regressor.
A regressor different from me. An existence who could repeat life many
times.

On the other hand, I only had this one life. Therefore, this life didn't allow
me to make any mistakes.

If I made a mistake, someone would die. Thus, I couldn't make any
mistakes.

I had come all this way while taking the risk of twisting probability. Up to
this point, I thought I had done well.

Briareus had told me.

–The real fate is inevitable. If you avoid it, probability must be distorted.
The twisting of probability had to be resolved by someone.

I knew. I knew it very well. Just, I was dissatisfied. Why?

「 …ja-ssi. 」

Why… why should they be the ones to resolve it?

「 Dokja-ssi. 」

One drop, two drops. The voice that touched me was like a drop of water
through hard granite.

I looked behind me.

「 Dokja-ssi, I'm fine. 」

Through the curtains of the hospital room where Yoo Sangah lay, the
fragments of the broken story flowed out and spoke to me.

「 Save Sookyung-ssi. 」
No voice came from my half-open mouth. Yet she replied like she heard
my words.

「 I have a way to survive. I have already found a way through Hermes'
system. 」

[The exclusive skill 'Lie Detection Lv. 7' is activated!]

[You have confirmed that the statement is false.]

"Yoo Sang…"

「 Dokja-ssi. 」

It wasn't meant to call out to me. Yoo Sangah's voice was unbelievably
firm. One day, I remembered a time when I teamed up with Yoo Sangah.

Even then, Yoo Sangah was the same. Every time she insisted on
something she thought was right, she would never bend herself. Yoo
Sangah would speak in this calm but strong tone. It was like appeasing a
panicked little child.

「 Dokja-ssi, listen carefully to me. Please be calm and rational. 」

Why? Yoo Sangah's words were familiar.

「 I still have some time remaining. However, Sookyung-ssi wouldn't be
able to recover unless she is saved now. 」

Why did I feel like I was sitting in a subway seat and why did it feel like
this trembling hand wasn't mine?

「 It is like a game quest. A quest that can be cleared properly if we follow
the set route. 」

"…Yoo Sangah-ssi."
「 Dokja-ssi, it is time to carry out the quest properly now. 」

I understood Yoo Sangah's words. Perhaps I could understand better than
anyone in the world. However, I couldn't understand the Yoo Sangah
speaking right now. Perhaps I would never understand in this lifetime. Or I
should say that I didn't dare understand it.

[The 'Fourth Wall' has increased its thickness.]

Like the Yoo Sangah who stood up on the subway, I stood up and declared,
"Aileen."

Aileen noticed my intentions and nodded. The medical staff standing next
to Yoo Sangah rushed to the other side of the room. I also slowly turned to
the opposite side of the room. The moment I went beyond the threshold, I
couldn't help looking back.

「 Don't worry. I'll be waiting here. 」

Beyond the curtain, Yoo Sangah's silhouette had already scattered a lot.
Maybe, beyond that would be a Yoo Sangah I already didn't know. She
might be torn and scattered apart, something that was no longer
recognizable. I might be hearing the voice of Yoo Sangah, who was already
disappearing.

Nevertheless.

"Yoo Sangah-ssi. I don't know if you remember but I screened people's
lives in the first scenario."

I continued speaking towards the Yoo Sangah I remembered. "I only let
people I thought should survive, live. I thought I should've done it in order
to see the end of this world.

「 …Dokja-ssi. 」
"However, if this is the one way I can see the ending of this story, I would
rather not see the ending."

In order to revive someone, another person had to die.

"If there is a choice over lives, it is a bad story in the first place."

At my answer, the Mass Production Maker might say this: It is a road that
isn't a road.

[The Fourth Wall is looking at you.]

Nevertheless, this wasn't a choice. There was only one way from the
beginning.

[The constellation 'Demon King of Salvation' is looking at the Fourth
Wall.]

I wasn't Yoo Joonghyuk. Yet when it came to this issue, my answer was the
same as that guy.

"I'll smash that story. So that Yoo Sangah-ssi won't die. My mother too."

There was a dead-end wall covered in darkness in front of my eyes. It was a
hard and thick wall that I couldn't smash. I slowly reached out for that wall.
       Chapter 342: Ep. 64 - A Road That Isn't a Road, III


It was an hour later that Yoo Joonghyuk and his colleagues returned to
Earth. Yoo Joonghyuk, Han Sooyoung, Lee Jihye, Jung Heewon, Lee
Hyunsung, Shin Yoosung, Lee Gilyoung and Lee Seolhwa.

The first thing they discovered after safely passing through the portal was
the flashing sparks around the center of the industrial complex. The sparks
of probability were striking down on the center of the Factory like lightning
bolts.

Lee Jihye wondered, "…What the hell is going on?"

She asked but no one could answer properly. They got on the chimera
dragon and soon arrived at the Factory. The party members jumped over the
walls and ran straight to the hospital room.

Flying Fox waved when he saw the people rushing in. "Huh, you came back
already?"
Jung Heewon asked, "Dokja-ssi… no, where is Yoo Sangah-ssi?"

"He is over there, though I think you need to be treated as well…"

"We're fine. Just treat Hyunsung-ssi."

"W-Wait a minute! My skin is just a bit―"

"Shut up and lie down."

After throwing the burnt Lee Hyunsung onto a hospital bed, Jung Heewon
and the others headed to Yoo Sangah's hospital room. Obviously, they
thought Kim Dokja would first head there.

"Dokja-ssi! Sangah-ssi!"

"Hey, everyone! If you just come in…!"

Then the party members faced an unexpected sight after arriving. Han
Sooyoung muttered. "What is this situation?"

There was no one in Yoo Sangah's hospital room apart from the minimum
number of medical staff. Yoo Sangah's soul was still broken. Kim Dokja
couldn't be seen at all.

A black aura was released from Han Sooyoung's body. "I'm asking you.
What is this situation?"

The medical staff were daunted and spat out everything that happened,
from the Returnees War to Kim Dokja's return.

"…So, Lee Sookyung went to receive treatment first. Maybe by now, the
last step―"

Before the words finished, Han Sooyoung had already moved. It was so fast
that no one could stop her. Han Sooyoung jumped over a nearby chair and
grabbed the collar of a man taller than herself. "You son of a bitch. You
knew everything?"

"…"

"Why didn't you talk properly? If you knew this―"

"If I said it, could you change anything?"

Yoo Joonghyuk's cold voice rang through the room. Han Sooyoung's mouth
trembled. Could she change it if she knew? She didn't know. Han Sooyoung
couldn't answer the question.

Yoo Joonghyuk asked again, "I asked if you could change anything?"

"You bastard…!"

This time, Yoo Joonghyuk didn't yield. The moment when the pressure
around the two people was going to devastate the surroundings, Jung
Heewon stopped them. "Stop, both of you! Can't you see that Yoo
Sangahssi is present?"

[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' is furious!]

Yoo Joonghyuk shook off Han Sooyoung's hand and spoke to the medical
staff. "Where is Kim Dokja?"

Han Sooyoung also turned to the staff at the question. Rather than
answering, the medical staff glanced in one direction in unison. It was a
hospital room where Lee Sookyung's surgery was underway.

Han Sooyoung asked, "Kim Dokja is in that room?"

"That's right. Aileen said he is needed…"

The party members approached the operating room door quietly enough not
to interfere with the operation. Through the transparent glass, Aileen and
Kim Dokja could be seen conducting the operation in the room. Thanks to
the lighting, Kim Dokja's expression couldn't be seen but he definitely
didn't look good.

Kim Dokja's hand was trembling and his gaze was slightly lowered. It was
Shin Yoosung who opened her mouth first. "…Ahjussi's state is a bit
weird."




Once the operation started, the first thing Aileen said was, "You must come
with me."

"…Is there anything I can do to help?"

"Yes."

The moment I ended the room, I saw the fragments of my broken mother.
My mother, who defeated the returnees by summoning Pungbaek, was in a
state where all her stories were broken.

「 …Dokja. 」

Somewhere, I felt I heard these words. Maybe it was my mother's stories. I
thought in a reassuring manner to her. 'Don't worry. I didn't choose anyone'.

My mother's soul must be restored as quickly as possible. That way, I had
the time to save Yoo Sangah. From now on, it was the time of Aileen.

"Staff, begin to supply the magic power."

Aileen pulled out a small brush and started to collect the floating pieces of
stories one by one.
The surgery itself was simple. Collect the fragments of the scattered stories
and put them together in context.

It was to recover the meaning of the lost sentences. It was easy to say but
the number of people in Ways of Survival who could perform this type of
major surgery could only be counted on one hand.

The most remarkable one among them was Aileen Makerfield, the Story
Expert next to me.

[The story 'Person Who Repairs the Story' has started!]

「 Every word that reaches your fingertips restores itself. 」

The end of the story was ultimately a share of the story. Every time Aileen's
brush moved, the broken stories started to follow one by one. The star
fluids I gained were the adhesive holding the stories together.

[The item 'Soma' is working!]

[The item 'Nectar' is working!]

By the time 40 minutes passed in the surgery, Aileen's forehead was
covered with beads of sweat. The scene of Aileen's surgery also appeared in
Ways of Survival but this was my first time actually seeing it and I was
slightly impressed.

Once the overall story was repaired, Aileen took a sip of water. I asked
Aileen, "Is it okay if the fragments aren't in context?"

I was anxious when I saw that the story fragments Aileen put together
weren't perfectly neat.

Aileen lightly wiped her lips. "It's fine. This is what humans are like."

Certainly, her words might be true. In general, humans weren't tidy
existences.
By the way, Aileen's words weren't over. "However, there are some
sentences that can be serious if they aren't put together properly. For
example, these parts."

Aileen pointed to my mother's soul. Unlike the other restored areas, her
halfcollapsed heart hadn't been operated on. "In fact, Sookyung-ssi's
surgery was a bit late. Her thema is already damaged."

"Thema?"

The contents of Ways of Survival flowed through my head.

"Do you know that everyone's soul is made up of stories?"

"I've heard it before."

It was a story Persephone told me. Aileen continued speaking. "In every
soul, there is a core theme that penetrates it. The most important story that
forms the essence of the soul."

I belatedly recalled a mention of it in Ways of Survival.

「 Every story has a thema. Even a story without a thema, the thema is
'there is no thema'. 」

"Only the person who best understands this soul can touch the thema."

I hesitated for a moment. "Then the reason you said I should go in with
you…"

"That's right." Aileen nodded and continued, "The thema can only be
restored by the person who best knows the soul. You have to do this part
yourself. I'll share the story…"

I didn't hear the end of Aileen's words.
[The story 'Person Who Repairs the Story' temporarily dwells at the end of
your hand.]

I had to do it myself?

"There isn't much time left. You need to start now. Medical staff, be ready
to supply magic power!"

I stared at my mother's soul while holding the brush. My mother lay there
quietly with her eyes closed, like a person covered in a shroud. There were
wrinkles and wounds I didn't know about. She had stiff eyebrows and dry
cheeks.

Aileen said, "Think of it as a book. Imagine all the stories in front of you
becoming a book."

I looked at the difficult sentences floating in front of me and tried to show
my imagination. Just like I was rereading the book I read as a child, I closed
my eyes and stretched out my hand.

「 "Yes, do you want to read that book?" 」

I cleared the cover of the dust and opened it to see the first page that was
broken and worn out. I opened my eyes again and saw the floating stories
gathered at the end of my hand.

「 "Dokja." 」

Sentence by sentence, the fragments started talking to me. I slowly
moved the brush. I thought of my mother. I remembered my mother.
There was a stale smell as words were lifted from the well of old
memories. 「 "Dokja, what type of character do you like best?" 」

I remembered. The books I read with my mother for the first time. I
unconsciously moved the brush. The overflowing sentences were linked
through my brush.
「 "You don't seem to like the ending. However, not all stories can have
happy endings." 」

The person who gave me reasons to like books. For the sins I committed,
she went to jail. The person who wrote a book about our story. The person I
wanted to see. The person I resented. She was my mother but also the
person furthest from me.

「 "Dokja." 」

Blood in the living room and the feeling of the falling knife. My mother's
following words.

「 "Read it again." 」

The moment I finished, the brush stopped. Still, my mother's thema was
incomplete.

"Demon King of Salvation?"

My mother's story that I knew was up to here.

「 "…Sin. If it is a sin, it's a sin." 」

「 "Do all prisoners think this way?" 」

「 "It is funny, the justice of this world." 」

There were still numerous story fragments floating around me but they
didn't talk to me anymore.

The fragments had a context I didn't know. I couldn't hear them and they
were unknown sentences.

I was suddenly confused, as if thrown into the middle of the first book I
read. The only thing I knew about Lee Sookyung was Lee Sookyung as my
mother.
The hand holding the brush trembled. The trembling was speaking on my
behalf. I couldn't do it. This wasn't something I could do.

Belated regret flooded me like waves. I should've talked to her more. I
should've told her more.

I should've shared more with her.

The height of the hand holding the brush gradually lowered. My mother's
stories were crumbling again. My mother's unknown stories drifted like
they mocked me.

「 Maybe I'm not the only one. 」

The moment I had this thought, I felt something behind my back. Someone,
who wasn't me or Aileen, was holding a brush and staring into the air.

"This is what you said to me."

There was a middle-aged woman wearing a nice suit over a blue prison
uniform. It was Cho Youngran, who had the First Spiritualist of Joseon as a
sponsor. Another woman was holding a brush beside her.

"I can't believe I miss the days when we lined up for bread." Lee Boksoon,
who went with me to Peace Land, laughed.

There were several other wanderers in the room. They each held a brush,
applied the star fluid and started to attach the sentences. The stories that
were difficult for me flowed freely from them. The puzzles they filled up
were obvious.

All the wanderers were talking about Lee Sookyung.

My vision was blurred and I couldn't speak for a while. My mother's life
was drawn in front of my eyes. There were several things I should've
known but didn't. Even so, the wanderers didn't complete all the thema.
Some fragments still remained, searching for the owner. Then somebody
grabbed my hand. My hand holding the brush moved freely and attached a
sentence I didn't know. The moment I was about to express my confusion,
the owner of the hand cut off my words.

"Kim Dokja, you know you aren't a godlike person."

I smelt lemon candy from the grumbling voice. Han Sooyoung took the
brush from my hand in a frustrated manner.

"There are some things in the world you don't know about, you idiot."
       Chapter 343: Ep. 64 - A Road That Isn't a Road, IV


Sparks sprang around the broken soul and my mother's vitality was slowly
coming back. The busy wanderers attached my mother's story fragments
together as if they wouldn't tolerate a single error.

"This is what happened at the time. Do you remember?"

A single portrait was painted by a large number of people. It looked like a
banquet of artisans gathered to sculpt a single complete work of art. I was
amazed that so many people remembered my mother.

Some gazes killed a presence. After some scenarios started, the incarnations
died before the eyes of many constellations. They were exposed, peeped at
and forced to follow the constellations' desires. Now, these gazes were
saving someone.

"…Ah, I missed this time."
"I don't know what I would've done if Sookyung-ssi wasn't there. Right?"
The voices of the wanderers murmured. Perhaps the entire life we lived
became memories for one or two people.

[The constellation 'Scribe of Heaven' is showing pure admiration towards
the landscape of the accumulated story.]

[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' is greatly pleased!]

[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' is pulling his hair
with an unknown expression.]

[The constellation 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' is grumbling while
looking at his incarnation.]

Perhaps the channel inspection ended as the constellations gathered in
Biyoo's channel to watch the scene. My mother was finished in front of
everyone's eyes.

My mother, Lee Sookyung. The King of Wanderers, Lee Sookyung. Lee
Sookyung, a former prisoner. Lee Sookyung the essay writer. These 'Lee
Sookyung' gathered to make the whole 'Lee Sookyung'.

I stood still and Han Sooyoung poked me in the side. "Get out of the way,
you're disturbing us."

Certainly, Han Sooyoung had been with my mother for the past three years
and probably had a stake in her story.

I nodded and slipped out of the room. The restoration of the story was
almost finished and I didn't seem to be any more help. I was a bit nervous
but she was a writer… she probably wouldn't ruin my mother.

I heard Han Sooyoung's voice coming from behind me. "This… did you
mention it at the time? I didn't know. That's right, well…"
…Please be fine. I left the room and the party members were waiting for
me.

"Ahjussi!"

"Dokja hyung!"

I hugged the two children while looking around at my companions. Jung
Heewon, Lee Jihye and Lee Hyunsung tied to a bed… Everyone was
waiting for my answer. Everyone seemed to know the situation, even if I
didn't explain anything. Shin Yoosung asked me, "Grandmother? Is
Grandmother Sookyung okay?"

"I think she should be fine. It is entering the final stages."

Relief passed through the party member's faces at my words. Only one face
was different.

"Hey, why is Dokja hyung's mother your grandmother?"

"Ahjussi's mother is my grandmother."

"Dokja hyung isn't your father."

I quickly patted them on the back. "Now now, don't fight. You can both call
her grandmother."

"Really? Can I?"

"Yes."

I watched the red-faced Lee Gilyoung and Shin Yoosung and tried to say
something else, but quickly closed my mouth.
To these children, what had happened in the past three years? What did
these children hear, see and talk about as they passed through dozens of
scenarios without me? "…Hyung?"

I stroked Lee Gilyoung's head for a long time and Lee Gilyoung looked up
at me helplessly. Shin Yoosung, who was staring at the scene, grabbed my
hand and placed it on her head.

I held the two children in my arms and told them, "I'm sorry."

"…Yes? What for?"

"Just, for everything."

I knew that I couldn't ask for forgiveness, no matter what they told me right
now. Still, I wanted to say something. Maybe my mother's story had
influenced me. I didn't want to make any more tragedies that I couldn't talk
about in time. Nevertheless, the words didn't fall easily from my lips.

'You suffered, I'm sorry'. I wanted to say these words.

"It's fine." Shin Yoosung spoke. "We're fine, ahjussi."

Shin Yoosung raised her head and watched me. This was the person who
should be comforted but she was the one asking if I was okay. "Ahjussi…
are you okay?"

I wasn't able to answer so I avoided Shin Yoosung's gaze. I looked up and
all my companions were staring at me. Lee Jihye looked pained while Jung
Heewon was anxious.

I smiled while moving my lips. "Why are you looking like that? I'm fine.
My mother has also recovered." "Are you really okay?"

"I'm really fine. And…"
I carefully examined every party member. I felt the time that passed from
the wounds all over their body. The moment the giant story Gigantomachia
was over, they ran to this place first. It was without feeling the aftermath of
victory.

"Gigantomachia… you all suffered."

Perhaps my expression looked ridiculous. For some reason, Jung Heewon
burst out laughing.

"Are those words the bonus? Dokja-ssi really… we are working here
because it is good."

Lee Jihye nodded by her side. Jung Heewon kept speaking. "In addition…
why did you run away alone again? Do you really want to die? Or do you
want to be confined again?"

"That's because the Mass Production Maker told me―"

"You always have excuses."

I bowed to them. "I'm sorry."

This was the best for now. I could clarify things later. As I bent forward, I
could see the old combat boots. My gaze went up and I saw the man in the
dusty black coat. Suddenly, I felt refreshed. I knew that Yoo Joonghyuk
belonged here.

"Yoo Joonghyuk, you too―"

"There is no time for pathetic stories. It isn't over yet."

Yoo Joonghyuk walked towards the room opposite the corridor with
peculiar and terrifying eyes.

As expected, Yoo Joonghyuk was Yoo Joonghyuk.
"Everyone seems leisurely? Did you come for a picnic?"

The door to the hospital room opened and Han Sooyoung appeared. It
seemed she had consumed quite a lot of magic power and her expression
was tired.

"My mother?"

"It will take a while for her to wake up but her disease is healed. The rest
will be in the hands of time."

"You've worked hard."

"Yoo Sangah?"

"The medical staff are watching her progress. Aileen will start the treatment
as soon as she comes out. Isn't there a bit of star fluid left?"

Aileen had told me that only one person could be saved this time.

"Let's go straight away."

Aileen took the medical team and moved rooms straight away. By the way,
once we entered Yoo Sangah's room, we faced a strange sight.

"Seolhwa-ssi?"

I saw Lee Seolhwa in a white gown and taking care of Yoo Sangah. Was it
an illusion? I felt like the speed at which Yoo Sangah's story fragments
flowed out was reduced.

"What happened?"

"I used some medicine that Joonghyuk-ssi gave me."

"Medicine Yoo Joonghyuk gave you?"
Lee Seolhwa looked down at the small bottle on the table silently. It was a
disease that never occurred before. The moment I touched the glass bottle,
the item information came to my attention.

"…The Empty and Clear Stone Milk?"

I was startled. If this was the Empty and Clear Stone Milk that I knew, it
was a rare item that could compare to a star fluid. It was one of the greatest
elixirs that came from the veiled Zero Murim.

I had so many thoughts at once that I didn't know what to say.

"Where did you get this type of thing?"

"I heard he received it from the Breaking the Sky Sword Saint."

The Breaking the Sky Sword Saint hadn't yet returned to Earth. It might've
been delayed because she was reuniting with her kin for a while. By the
way, the Breaking the Sky Sword Saint had the Empty and Clear Stone
Milk… did she go to 'that island'?

Aileen examined Yoo Sangah and said, "A bit of time has been bought."

"How much?"

"Around 30 minutes."

"If we acquire more star fluid…"

"It has reached a stage where she can't be healed with the star fluid. She has
exceeded the threshold. Honestly, it's amazing the thema hasn't been
damaged yet. Her mental strength is really…"

The party members cried out at Aileen's words.

"Wait, what are you saying?"
"Sangah unni will die?"

The party members listened to the medical staff's explanation and grasped
the seriousness of the situation. Jung Heewon and the children were pale.
Lee Jihye looked frightened.

"Ahjussi, are you lying? Right?"

"…"

"Sangah unni will die… there is really no way? Really? Not at all? Then
what have we done so far…"

Lee Jihye staggered like a ghost and shook me. "Ahjussi has died many
times! If we get that attribute now―"

There was no way to get that attribute right now. Jung Heewon hugged Lee
Jihye from behind and asked me. "Perhaps… is it impossible to use that
previous method?"

The previous method. Nobody explained it but everyone was looking at
Biyoo in the air.

"It is hard."

"You are the successor of the Underworld. Can't you ask them for help?"

"I've already asked them."

In the meantime, several indirect messages were heard in the air. They were
the messages of constellations who wanted to take advantage of the
situation.

[The constellation 'Emperor Who Dreamt of Immortality' is making a
proposal.]
[The constellation 'Emperor Who Dreamt of Immortality' says he will
provide you with the 'Divine Grass of Immortality' right now if you sign a
contract with him.]

The Emperor Who Dreamt of Immortality… it was that 'king' of China. The
Divine Grass of Immortality' was definitely an item that could be compared
to the star fluids and Star Relic Fruit. However, the current Yoo Sangah
couldn't recover even if I used it.

「 Don't do it. 」

Everyone stared at one place.

「 If you borrow their hands, they will surely ask for a ridiculous price. 」

Yoo Sangah was talking. Her incarnation body had closed eyes but
everyone could hear her. The soul had more than half of herself scattered
and only her thema remained, yet she watched everyone here.

「 Everyone. 」

Yoo Sangah spoke to the party members.

「 I'm fine. So… 」

I didn't know who many times they heard the words 'I'm fine' today.
Everyone in this place knew what she meant by saying 'I'm fine'. To us, it
meant the time of hell had emerged.

「 Gilyoung, noona is fine. Don't cry. Yoosung too. 」

Yoo Sangah kept talking to the group. I held my throbbing chest and leaned
against the wall. Jung Heewon sat down on a chair.

「 Heewon-ssi. I really like Heewon-ssi. Do you know? 」

「 In addition, Jihye… 」
Tears were falling. Lee Jihye was weeping bitterly as she grasped the
bedspread. Her red eyes were gazing eagerly at me. From the side, I could
hear the sound of teeth grinding together.

"Kim Dokja, I will sign an Outer World Contract." Han Sooyoung grabbed
my arm and declared. "Then there might be a way. No, I will definitely
make the contract. I―"

「 Han Sooyoung-ssi. 」

Han Sooyoung's chin trembled.

「 You don't have to do that. 」

Han Sooyoung dropped my arm. She left through the door like she didn't
want to keep listening. Yoo Sangah continued speaking. She was a person
pouring out all her remaining words.

「 Hyunsung-ssi and Joonghyuk-ssi… I have something to tell you… but I
don't have much strength left. 」

「 Yes, I want to say, I will leave the others… 」

Then Yoo Sangah glanced at me. I leaned against the wall while my
wounds throbbed.

The world shook. Nevertheless, I had to hold on.

"Everybody."

The moment I spoke, pain filled my head.

[The Fourth Wall is warning you.]

「 N o. 」

I ignored it and carried on. "Everyone, please go out for a while."
They all seemed to have lost their souls despite Yoo Sangah being the one
who was dying. The first one to regain their senses was Jung Heewon. She
exchanged glances with me for a moment before raising Lee Jihye. With
her encouragement, the members left the room one by one. Finally, Shin
Yoosung and Lee Gilyoung left and I was the only one in the room with
Yoo Sangah.

I took a deep breath before opening my mouth. "Yoo Sangah-ssi. Do
you remember the words that you said on the subway?" There was no
answer from Yoo Sangah.

"You said you liked reading books." I kept speaking to Yoo Sangah.
"Murakami Haruki, Raymond Carver, Han Kang…"

I recited the names of the authors Yoo Sangah said she liked. I sensed Yoo
Sangah's expression changing slightly. Maybe it was a distant memory that
was disappearing.

"If you can survive… are you willing to read books that aren't from those
writers?"

A fleeting light returned to Yoo Sangah's soul.

「 …What book? 」

"For example, Lord of the Rings."

Yoo Sangah's soul body laughed. She recalled the old memory and smile
faintly.

「 …Okay. As long as I can read it. If it is possible… 」

These precious words, I remembered every syllable.

「 If I can live again, I will read the entire story. 」
I nodded. I didn't know if this method would work. In the original novel,
this had never been attempted. Still, this was the only method I could do.
There were huge sparks as the 'wall' appeared in the air.

I looked beyond the dead-end and stared at the Fourth Wall. Anyone facing
this wall at the end of the road would become desperate.

"Fourth Wall."

A thick and hard wall that couldn't be broken by anything. There was no
such artificial thing as the 'wall' in this world. It was a wall that someone
had made with an obvious purpose. I didn't know the exact purpose behind
the creation of this wall. Still, it was obvious that the 'wall' was built to
protect someone.

The moment I opened my mouth, the Fourth Wall also opened it. "Swallow
her. Don't leave behind even a single sentence."
        Chapter 344: Ep. 64 - A Road That Isn't a Road, V


Feeding Yoo Sangah's soul to the Fourth Wall. This method was conceived
based on the past incident where my mother was eaten by the Fourth Wall.
At that time, my mother had been eaten by the wall when her soul body was
damaged and part of her soul was restored when she was spat out again. In
addition, there was the 'library' inside the Fourth Wall so it was worth
trying.

「Don't wa nt to. 」

The Fourth Wall read my intentions but didn't listen to me. The Fourth Wall
watched the scattered Yoo Sangah and reacted furiously.

「 I won't ea t th at. 」

"Eat." The shock caused my body to shake. However, I didn't back down.
"If you won't eat then I'll turn off the skill."
This was my last threat. In any case, the Fourth Wall was a skill and I could
turn it off whenever I wanted. Based on previous incidents, the Fourth Wall
really hated it. Then this time…

「 Do it if you c an. 」

It sounded certain I couldn't do so.

「 If y ou tu rn me off, the wo man can't sur vive. 」

I bit my lips.

「 In addi tion, turn ing me off will let the con stella tions see your in for
mation. 」

[Many constellations are paying attention to you!]

[Some constellations are doubting the existence of the 'wall' you have.]

The Fourth Wall was well aware that I was reluctant to disclose my
information. In fact, I had no useful mental barriers apart from the Fourth
Wall. If a high-grade constellation stared at me the moment the wall
disappeared, I might be as helpless as a naked baby.

I stared at the wall for a moment. "Then I will break it."

「 What? 」

"I will break some parts of the wall and force you to eat her."

Originally, the Fourth Wall wasn't reality. However, now I was able to hit
the wall. I clenched my fists and dealt a blow to the wall in front of me The
whole room shook from the devastating impact. There was a short scream
and the sound of people rushing outside.

I swung my fist again. The wall still had no scratches.
「 It is use less. 」

"…"

「 It is too mu ch of a vio lation to sa ve Yoo Sang ah. 」

I thought about it. As I said earlier, the Fourth Wall wasn't reality. It was a
skill I implemented. Then…

I focused my gaze towards one part of the wall. Sparks flooded the room
and Lee Jihye, who opened the door, was thrown out.

「 N o! 」

There was a small crack on a corner of the Fourth Wall. It was as I
expected. Until now, I had been thinking of the skill as something that
could be turned on or off. Perhaps the 'skill' might have the appropriate
intermediate state. In other words…

What if I could turn off a 'part' of the skill? The wall rapidly cracked and a
small gap formed in an instant. There was an abyss that seemed able to
swallow anything.

Soon, the gap started to suck in the surrounding story fragments like a black
hole. The stories of Yoo Sangah were quickly sucked into the wall.

「 St op…! 」

Huge sparks hit my body and I let out a terrible groan. A probability storm
was blowing through the wall. I heard the voices of the party members and
my vision turned white.

In the darkness, Yoo Sangah came to her senses. She opened her eyes to
only darkness. In this scene that didn't allow even a point of light, Yoo
Sangah suddenly realized something.
She… wasn't dead? The last scene she saw flashed through her head.
There was a probability storm and Kim Dokja's shout as he tried to save
her. Then there was a memory of being sucked into somewhere… There
was nothing she could be sure of.

Yoo Sangah checked herself from head to toe. Eyes, lips, tongue, ears,
hands, feet, knees… there wasn't a single place where sensations could be
felt. it was as if her whole body was paralyzed and her sense of movement
had completely disappeared.

Perhaps only her soul was left?

Yoo Sangah tried to calmly accept the situation. In Haruki novels, it was
common for people to become ideas. This could be enough. The dead
becoming a soul…

…Scary. It was scary to be alone in the darkness. There were no sensations
in this state. She didn't know if she existed or not. Yoo Sangah tried not to
fall into the trap of thinking as she recalled the old proposition of
philosophy.

「 I think. Therefore I am. 」

This was René Descartes' maxim. It was such a famous saying that she was
somehow ashamed to quote it. Yet for Yoo Sangah, this was her only line
of salvation. At least, she knew she existed while she thought this. Then
soon afterwards, Yoo Sangah had a frightening thought. Then was there
anyone who didn't think? If she stopped thinking in this darkness…

Therefore, Yoo Sangah kept thinking desperately. In order not to disappear,
she remembered the things that she desperately wanted to avoid.

「 "Sangah." 」
A voice floated in her mind, followed by a face. It was a familiar face. Her
family members before the 'scenario' came. Her father, a judge, and her
older brothers who were doctors. Her mother who was born in a wealthy
family.

「 "Don't do anything conspicuous." 」

「 "People who aren't you will see what you have." 」

「 "What four languages? You just have to be a cute little girl." 」

Yoo Sangah watched the flowing words and smiled bitterly. To be exact,
she lost them before that.

「 "…You are going to join a game company? You aren't marrying the
president of the game company?" 」

Maybe she was living a 'scenario' even before the scenario started. No one
called it for a scenario but for her, it was a scenario. If a dokkaebi had
named the scenario, perhaps it would be 'Declaration of Independence'.

「 "I am a new employee." 」

After entering the game company and becoming independent at home,
his life changed a bit. She also met an interesting person. 「 "Yoo
Sangah-ssi. Do you have a mobile phone charger?" 」 The man with a
thin face who borrowed her charger.

「 "I am an important appointment at 7 o'clock and my battery is running
out." 」

A person who did the interview with her and who was uncooperative about
everything in the company.
「 "I will attend the ceremony but I must leave at 7 o'clock." 」

He was always the person to leave the company first once the work day
ended.

「 "I won't participate in the picnic. I hate climbing mountains the most."
」

The man who seemed like a ghost and didn't exist in other people's eyes as
he stared at his smartphone.

「"…Yoo Joonghyuk, that jerk died again." 」

Thus, she might've done something strange as well. She put things into the
food of the boss who took projects from his subordinates or mixed pepper
in the drinks of the manager who made them run coffee errands.

「 "Uwek! What is this? Why does the coffee taste like this?" 」

It was the birth of Mino Soft's historic event, which was later called the
'Break Room Incident'.

She poured pepper into the finely ground beans and felt a sense of
liberation. The company was turned upside down. It was a criminal who
couldn't even be caught by the surveillance staff.

「 Yoo Sangah, I still remember. 」

A company where everyone had left work. A smartphone light appeared
quietly from behind a cabinet in the break room.

「 Kim Dokja was clearly there. 」

No matter whether she put in pepper or salt, the light just stayed there and
tolerated her actions. It was as if the things that happened beyond the
cabinet didn't involve him.
「Maybe I should've talked to him at that time. 」

Why did he remain silent behind that cabinet? Why didn't he report what
she died and why did he say, "There is no one." Why did he turn the CCTV
away from the direction of the break room? Why… was he always looking
at the phone with a variety of expressions?

Her surroundings brightened and her senses started to gradually return.

[A powerful presence doesn't allow your 'story' to fall apart.]

[Someone who likes to be tidy doesn't deserve your story.]

A voice was heard from somewhere.

「 (Look, this is 'push and pull'.) 」

「(No. I think that after watching every movie that exists on Earth…) 」

「(Isn't it a desire to become one?) 」

Yoo Sangah slowly opened her eyes and found three beings surrounding
her. There was a squid-like creature wearing glasses. An elderly man with
grey hair and a bent back. Finally, a beautiful person who exuded a strange
atmosphere where the gender was unknown.

The moment she saw the last existence, Yoo Sangah shot up with surprise.

「 (You…? ) 」

「 (You woke up, new librarian,) 」

The neutral beauty, Nirvana smiled. Yoo Sangah didn't know what was
going on. Why was this person here?
Nirvana looked at her and spoke. 「 (It is a long explanation. You'll find
out soon. You are lucky. You are the first one to enter this library since I've
been living here.) 」

A combination of letters was overflowing behind the three beings.

[Welcome, new librarian Yoo Sangah.]

Yoo Sangah looked around. Dim light from candles illuminated the
darkness everywhere.

Library… There was an incredible number of bookshelves filled with books
that didn't seem to end. It had been a long time since she saw a library of
this size.

Kim Dokja's words popped into her mind. If she could live again, was she
willing to read books that weren't from those authors?

…Was this what he meant? She didn't know what this place was. She didn't
know why Kim Dokja sent her here or what he wanted. Still, she had a
hunch. If she read these books now, she might be able to solve many of her
questions.

「 (Will you read it?) 」

「(Yes?) 」

「 (If you read it, you might be sorry. It might be a truth you can't handle.)
」

Yoo Sangah's hand stopped as she approached the book. It wasn't because
of Nirvana's words. It was because a man she knew well showed up in the
darkness.
"She won't be a librarian."

Kim Dokja was there.




「 (…Dokja-ssi?) 」

I felt deep relief the moment I saw Yoo Sangah staring at me blankly. It
was a success. Somehow, I succeeded in preserving Yoo Sangah's soul. Her
soul body was still damaged but the power flowing faintly through the
library was restoring her soul.

I bowed to Yoo Sangah. "I'm sorry to have brought you to such a shabby
place. Please endure it a bit. I'll take you out soon."

「(What shabby place? Foolish man who doesn't know the spirituality of
truth.) 」

"It's been a while, Nirvana."

「 (How did you come here. The 'wall' shouldn't have allowed it.) 」

"I found a trick."

Nirvana's expression was unusual.

「 (I don't know what you're thinking but this is a really bad decision.
There is a reason you have the wall.) 」

"I guess so."

It wasn't talking to me right now but the Fourth Wall must be very angry
because of what I did. A sharp air current reached my skin and I could feel
its emotions. However, now wasn't the time to worry about it.
「 (If the wall wants, it can turn one or two librarians into the dust of the
story.) 」

"I told you. She won't be a librarian."

「 (What nonsense are you saying? If you sent her here then naturally…)
」

"I'll bring her out again."

Nirvana frowned like he heard something ridiculous.

「 (Do you think the wall will allow that? Even if it is possible, that
woman's body is already dead. There is no place to return when the body is
dead.) 」

I silently stared at Nirvana. Then Nirvana's expression became strange.

「 (Perhaps, you…) 」

He was now part of the Fourth Wall and might've read my thoughts. His
lips trembled as Nirvana shouted, 「 (No! Even if the wall allows it, I won't
do it.) 」

"Nirvana."

Nirvana would know. There were many types of 'attributes' in the world but
there were only two 'perfect immortality' attributes. One was Yoo
Joonghyuk's regressor and the other was…

"Where is your sponsor, Mandala's Guardian now?"

The first reincarnator. Now the time had come to meet the third protagonist
of the story.
                Chapter 345: Ep. 65 - Good and Evil, I


Mandala's Guardian was a mysterious constellation. Unlike other
constellations, he rarely showed up in a channel. Even if he entered, he
rarely sent a message. He chose an incarnation and gave the 'reincarnation'
attribute to the incarnation.

Nirvana in front of me was one of those reincarnators.

「 (You don't know how terrible reincarnation is. No more reincarnators
should be made.) 」

"That isn't a matter for you to decide."

At the same time, I glanced at Yoo Sangah. She hadn't grasped the situation
yet and her eyes were blank. Maybe she was examining the context of the
conversation in her head.

「 (…Doesn't this woman already have a sponsor?) 」
"Not anymore. I asked Dionysus to cut off the connection during
Gigantomachia."

「 (Is Olympus that passive? How did you pay for the huge probability?)
」

I shrugged. I couldn't afford to elaborate on the details of the deal I made
with Dionysus. "Read it through the wall later. You will read about
everything I do anyway. Before that, answer my question. Where is your
sponsor now?"

「 (I was absorbed by the wall and my ties with him broken. I don't know
where he is now. Just…) 」

Nirvana looked at me and continued,

「 (I think you might've suspected it already?) 」

In fact, it was true. My question to Nirvana was only to change my guess to
conviction.

"Yoo Sangah-ssi. Don't worry. These guys, they're not as bad as they
look―"

I couldn't finish my words. There was a feeling of my space shrinking as
my body was ejected from the library. The surprised Yoo Sangah reached
out to me but my body was already scattering into sparks.

「 Cheek y Kim Dok ja. 」

Those were the last words I heard.
「 "…Dokja-ssi still isn't awake?" 」

「 "Yes." 」

「 "It has been three days already…" 」

I slowly woke up and could hear distant voices. Uncomfortable sensations
that couldn't be expressed well pushed at me all at once. What should I say?

It felt like I was being tortured with electricity.

「 "The electric eel doesn't work… what the hell is this?" 」

「 "What about Sangah unni? Her body suddenly disappeared…" 」

Thanks to the faint voices, I roughly guessed what was going to happen.

…Dammit, I had been unconscious for three days. My consciousness
returned but my body didn't move at all.

[Your actions in preventing the death of your colleague have been caught in
a probability plausibility screening.]

[You are currently suffering from the aftermath of the probability storm.]

[For a total of five days, almost all your actions will be constrained.]

[Remaining constraints period: 2 days 3 hours 31 minutes.]

I tried to avoid it but I was caught in a probability storm. It was a miracle
that it stopped at this degree of damage.

[A message has arrived to you through the 'Dokkaebi Communication'.]

The message came from Bihyung.

–Kim Dokja, you crazy guy.
–Do you want to be eaten by Indescribable Distance again?

–If I hadn't put on the brakes in advance, a disaster would've come to Earth.
You keep getting lucky. Don't you know what probability is?

The messages from Bihyung continued for some time. In order to reach the
end of the scenario, it was necessary to accumulate the probability well and
not be hated by the Star Stream. Since when did this person have such a
nagging personality?

–At any rate, I let it pass this time but be careful next time. The will of the
Star Stream is paying great attention to this incident.

I didn't know that forcibly breaking some of the Fourth Wall and sending
Yoo Sangah in would bring about such backlash. It would be absurd from
the viewpoint of the constellations. It might feel like the actor on stage had
disappeared.

[The Fourth Wall is currently repairing itself.]

[A considerable number of constellations are questioning the probability of
your actions.]

[Many constellations are sad because they can't peek at your identity.]

[Several constellations noticed that you have a fragment of the Last Wall.]

The Fourth Wall responded quickly and the damage was minimized. My
feet might be tied for a few days but I saved my mother and Yoo Sangah, so
it was a cheap price.

Of course, in Yoo Sangah's case, it was a temporary measure and I couldn't
leave it alone. In order to revive Yoo Sangah, I had to meet the
constellation who was the king of reincarnators and the first reincarnation.
It was a little early but it wasn't too early. From Demon Realm's Spring to
Torch That Swallowed the Myth. I had achieved the 'initial' and 'success'
portion of A Single Story.

Thanks to the emergence of me and Kim Dokja's Company, the
development of the overall scenarios accelerated and there would be the
emergence of materials that should've appeared long after in the original
novel.

There were many candidates to get the giant story that would fulfil the 'turn'
section. For example, there was Ragnarok of Asgard and some giant stories
from the Emperor nebula. Unlike the previous two sections, the 'turn'
should be the climax of A Single Story. It was a scenario of a different
scale based on the stories that had been told so far. Without such a stage, I
couldn't reach the desired result.

Perhaps using the third giant story as a springboard, the island where the
first reincarnator stayed might be a good stage. In any case, I didn't know
when it would happen.

Three days had passed but I still had two more days… I wasn't sure how to
spend this boring time. If I sacrificed some of the giant stories, I might be
able to get rid of the aftermath, but it wasn't good to sacrifice my barely
collected stories here.

…If only I could read Ways of Survival.

「 Kim Dok ja. 」

'Fourth Wall?'

「 Wi ll y ou con tinue do ing it your own way? 」

Somehow, the voice felt childish. I wanted an opportunity and quickly
answered. 'I won't do it again'.
「 Li ar. 」

There was deep-rooted distrust in the words. I felt a bit sorry because this
was the first time I saw the wall expressing its feelings.

'Believe me, I really won't do it'.

「 Bah. 」

'…What happened to Yoo Sangah-ssi? Is she doing well?'

No matter how intelligent and adaptable Yoo Sangah was, the existences in
the library were far beyond most humans. One was an outer god, one was a
creation of the constellations and the last one was a reincarnator. In
addition, the owner of the library, the Fourth Wall was an unknown
existence.

'Please don't be too hard on Yoo Sangah-ssi. She is a good person'.

「 That de pends on Yoo Sang ah. 」

For now, I was forced to believe in Yoo Sangah. She might not have the
'Ways of Survival' cheat like me but she was someone who survived this
far. Thus, I was sure she would do well in the library.

'There is one thing I'd like to ask you'.

「 N o. 」

'Just listen to me'.

「 N o. 」

'…We used to be pretty friendly. Think about when we just arrived in the
Demon Realm. At that time, we talked to each other a lot'.

「 It wa s on ly that ti me. 」
'You can talk a lot in the future'.

「 Kim Dok ja does not ca re a bout what I say. 」

I felt the hidden meaning and was lost for words. Come to think of it, the
Fourth Wall always talked to me. There was the style it borrowed from
Ways of Survival and even the Fourth Wall's peculiar way of talking. Still,
it was true that I didn't respond properly to it.

「 Th at dokkae bi who can't talk is be tter than Kim Dok ja. 」

'Are you talking about Biyoo?'

The Fourth Wall didn't answer. It was a bit of a confusing situation for me.

'You…'

This guy also felt lonely. Did it feel joy, sorrow or pain? I never thought
about it this way before and suddenly felt strange.

'…In the future, I will talk to you more often. I'm sorry'.

「 Bah. 」

'Calm down. I promise'.

「 Real ly? 」

'Really'.

The Fourth Wall thought of something and said.「 But Kim Dok ja isn't e
nough. 」

'What?'

「 Gi ve me a frien d. 」
What did this mean? A friend, how to give the wall a friend…

I thought about it and something suddenly flashed through my mind.

…Don't tell me? As if to prove my feelings, the Fourth Wall opened its
mouth.

「 Kim Dok ja should ga ther the la st wall. 」




'I have to gather more stories'.

Yoo Joonghyuk stared at the sky, obsessively thinking about it while
munching on a lemon candy. He didn't like candy but there was no
substitute for it right now. It would be nice if there was dumplings but…
now wasn't the time to enjoy that type of taste.

'…No, the speed at which I gathered the stories is already fast enough. The
important thing is to train the stories themselves'.

Maybe it was time to go to 'that island' now. The island that Kyrgios and his
teacher had visited. Yoo Joonghyuk clenched his fists as he envisioned
future plans.

[Your sponsor is dissatisfied with your recent progress.

He suddenly felt his sponsor's gaze. Recently, his sponsor had been
expressing feelings more often. A sponsor who had been only nonexistent
in the last three regressions.

Yoo Joonghyuk asked with a frown. "What is there to complain about?"

[Your sponsor wants you to take proactive actions.]
The words touched something deep in Yoo Joonghyuk's mind. Certainly,
his life had changed a lot since the last round. Needless to say, it was since
he met Kim Dokja.

'…I don't know who he is'.

He founded a nebula with a man whose identity was unknown.

'Kim Dokja isn't a prophet'.

Yoo Joonghyuk was immersed in his thoughts, as if solving the homework
he had put off.

'Yet he knows information about the future'.

The more he thought about it, the stranger things were. Why wasn't this
person in the last round? He had an idea originally but now he wasn't
convinced. That calm and meticulous guy didn't even pass the first scenario
in the last round? The doubts started to multiply and overflow.

[An unknown power is putting a stop to your imagination.]

There was some dizziness and Yoo Joonghyuk frowned.

'…Again'.

Yoo Joonghyuk didn't know why but his head hurt whenever he thought
about Kim Dokja. In particular, whenever he wondered about Kim Dokja's
identity.

"Yoo Joonghyuk, what are you doing?"

He looked back and saw Han Sooyoung with a lemon candy in her mouth.

Yoo Joonghyuk asked, "Kim Dokja still isn't awake?"

"Not yet."
"He is a lazy bastard."

"…It is due to the aftermath of the probability storm so I wouldn't call him
lazy. It is strange that it hasn't happened until now."

The two people stood there leisurely and looked up at the sky of the
industrial complex. A cool breeze blew past their collar. It was peaceful but
not a peace that would last a long time.

One person collapsed and the life or death of the other person was
unknown… however, this time was uncommon for the industrial complex.

Yoo Joonghyuk spotted Han Sooyoung staring at a distance place with
halfhooded eyes. He suddenly wanted to ask something.

'Would this person know what I'm curious about?'

Just like Kim Dokja, she appeared as a variable in this round. Whenever
Yoo Joonghyuk saw her carrying on an unknown conversation with Kim
Dokja, he had a feeling that this woman and Kim Dokja― At this moment,
an eerie sensation swept down his back.

"Yoo Joonghyuk."

At almost the same time Han Sooyoung spoke, Yoo Joonghyuk pulled out
the Black Heavenly Demon Sword. Han Sooyoung was unwrapping the
bandages around her hand.

In the distant sky, something was flying here at a fast pace. It was the
presence of an uninvited guest. The presence left a dark glow in the sky as
it slowly sank to the ground.

Magic power flowed from Yoo Joonghyuk's tense right hand.

"Asmodeus. What is going on?"
The demon king Asmodeus laughed. [I came to meet the Demon King of
Salvation. Where is he?]

"Why are you looking for him?"

[I have a lot to say as a Seeker of the End.]

"…Seeker of the End? Talk to me and get lost."

[Ah, really annoying…]

Asmodeus might've been an ally for a short time but Yoo Joonghyuk
fundamentally didn't believe in him. Moreover, there was the grudge from
the last round.

Nasty air currents flowed as Yoo Joonghyuk and Asmodeus' statuses
collided with each other.

[Um? I didn't think you would be this strong…]

Asmodeus' eyes widened when Yoo Joonghyuk didn't budge a single bit.

Obvious malice lay below Asmodeus' playful expression.

[Regressor Yoo Joonghyuk.]

Asmodeus gave a demon-like smile as he came closer to Yoo Joonghyuk.
The painted red lips of the demon king opened as if to commit a taboo.

[Have you ever heard of Three Ways to Survive in a Ruined World?]
              Chapter 346: Ep. 65 - Good and Evil, II


Asmodeus continued speaking.

[Three Ways to Survive in a Ruined World. Among the incarnations, it is a
story known as the Revelation… have you heard of it?]

At Asmodeus' words, the pale-faced Han Sooyoung stepped forward. "You!
What the hell did you come here to do?"

Asmodeus just ignored Han Sooyoung and studied Yoo Joonghyuk's
expression.

[An unknown power is putting a brake to incarnation Yoo Joonghyuk's
imagination.]

Sparks once again appeared in Yoo Joonghyuk's vicinity. In fact,
Asmodeus' words sounded like this to Yoo Joonghyuk.

[Have you heard of Three ■■ to ■■■■ in a Ruined ■■■?]
Yoo Joonghyuk got a headache as he asked, "…What did you say?"
Asmodeus sighed. [Hmmm, you aren't yet allowed…]

"What are you talking about?"

[Well, it isn't a big deal. Then… based on the situation, the Demon King of
Salvation is still asleep.]

Asmodeus grinned and glanced at the Factory.

[Unfortunately, I will go back for today. Please tell this to the Demon King
of Salvation. Thanks to what he has done, the balance of good and evil is
shaken. Jackals will emerge to take advantage of that imbalance.]

"Wait, just wait!"

Yoo Joonghyuk pressed a hand to his temple and called out to Asmodeus,
who had turned around.

He replied without turning around. [Regressor Yoo Joonghyuk. Do you
want to know the truth of the world?]

"…The truth?"

[If you want to know, come to the Seekers of the End.]

With these words, Asmodeus' body disappeared. Han Sooyoung quickly
approached the staggering Yoo Joonghyuk. "Yoo Joonghyuk. Are you
okay?"

"…"

"Yoo Joonghyuk?"

Yoo Joonghyuk didn't answer. He seemed to be thinking about something
and was drowning in great anguish. Yoo Joonghyuk stared at the air for a
while before shaking off Han Sooyoung and staggering somewhere.
"Hey! Where are you going?"

Despite Han Sooyoung's shouts, Yoo Joonghyuk didn't answer. Han
Sooyoung shouted once again, "Kim Dokja hasn't woken up yet!"

"It has nothing to do with him."

Yoo Joonghyuk triggered Red Phoenix Shunpo and disappeared. The only
one left at the entrance of the Factory was Han Sooyoung. Han Sooyoung
looked around and was lost in thought as she chewed on the candy bar.

'Is it time for the filtering to be lifted and information about Ways of
Survival to begin?'

It happened while Kim Dokja wasn't present and Han Sooyoung couldn't
hide her nervousness. She couldn't guess what type of disaster would occur
if Yoo Joonghyuk learnt about Ways of Survival now. Moreover, how did
the demon kings learn about the existence of Ways of Survival?

Han Sooyoung watched the sky to the south and spat the candy on the
ground. Something had to be done before Kim Dokja woke up.




Yoo Sangah was able to fully enjoy the experience of being a 'newcomer' as
she organized the books.

In the last two days, Yoo Sangah learnt a lot from her three seniors. From
the identity of this library to the identities of her seniors.

「 (Please organize it slowly. Once Kim Dokja starts thinking unnecessary
things, it gets messy.) 」

The theatre master, Simulation.
「 (It will take a long time to clean up with only two hands. I wanted
a successor with many hands to replace me.) 」 The outer god,
Devourer of Dreams.

「 (Do you want me to teach you Thousand Hands of Avalokiteśvara?) 」

The reincarnator, Nirvana Moebius.

All the seniors were slightly odd but they were generally kind to her. It
would've been nice if they were part of Mino Soft's human resources team.

Shelves covered with countless books. They were all the books Kim Dokja
had read or forgotten. Most of the books were one 'novel'.

『 Three Ways to Survive in a Ruined World. 』

Yoo Sangah liked books and quickly identified her situation and the
processes of her new job. This was a place for Kim Dokja and what this
story meant to Kim Dokja…

Once she realized, Yoo Sangah felt faint despair and sympathy at the same
time. However, Yoo Sangah didn't show it. She knew that sometimes not
expressing it was a way of taking care of the wounded. Instead, she thought
about other things.

'If it developed like the original…'

The following Earth scenario could have several implications. Among
them, the most likely one…

「 Work har d Yoo Sang ah. 」

Yoo Sangah raised her head at the voice heard from the air.

「 (I will work hard.) 」
She felt like she was living a rented life but there was a possibility for her
to live again. Fortunately, the general manager of this place was a cute
boss.

「 (Thank you for the job. I really like it here.) 」

「 Bah. 」

「 (I'm serious.) 」

「 Yoo Sang ah li kes books? 」

「 (I like it very much.) 」

「 Wh at book? 」

「 (For example… Lord of the Rings…) 」

「 H oh. 」

Luckily, the cute boss seemed quite interested in her. She decided to ask
about something she was curious about.

「 (Then can I ask one question?) 」

「 Wh at? 」

「 (What exactly is the Fourth Wall?) 」

A giggle filled the entire library.

「 I pro tect Kim Dok ja. 」

「 (Protect him?) 」
「 Kim Dok ja would die with out me. 」 It

was a voice filled with conviction. 「 Th en

Kim Dok ja did some thing stu pid. 」 The

entire library trembled faintly.

「 It is hard er recent ly be cause of you. 」

「 (…Because of me?) 」

「 My work is leak ing out. 」

The sound of sparks pointed to a certain direction in the library. The Fourth
Wall was indicating to a hole bigger than Yoo Sangah's fist.

「 Ev en though I block ed it, it is de stroyed by Kim Dok ja. 」

The cover of an old book was blocking the hole. It seemed to be a
temporary action urgently carried out. Yoo Sangah carefully examined the
cover of the book.

「 (The hold, isi t going to the outside?) 」

「 Yes. 」

Yoo Sangah pondered the hole for a while before making a playful
expression.

「 (Fourth Wall. I have a good idea.) 」
I slept comfortably. It was as deep as when I had been forcibly confined. It
felt like fluffy feathers were wrapped around my head. Or maybe someone
came into my head and cleared up all the uncomfortable worries.

「 (Dokja-ssi, it is a big deal. Dokja-ssi.) 」

A mysterious voice rang in my head and I got out of bed in a startled
manner. A hospital room with no one inside. My skin was tanned after
being burnt by the sparks.

"Uh…"

I looked around but there was no one by the bed. None of the party
members could be seen. Then who woke me up?

I decided to check the situation. I was still weak from the aftermath of the
probability storm but I was capable of walking. Yet the feeling was strange.

An unpleasant aura was flowing through the corridor of the ward. There
was a foreboding feeling that something would break. A moment later, I
realized there was a loud commotion outside the Factory.

I opened a window in the corridor and people's shouts entered my ears.

"Free Seoul!"

…What?

"We will no longer be ruled by the demon king!"

"Dictator of the Factory, stand down! Open all the stigmas and skills to the
public!"

A crowd was gathered beyond the walls of the Factory. They were the
incarnations from Seoul and the surrounding areas. I saw the composition
of the forces that had come and immediately knew what type of people they
were.
Most of them were people who failed in the scenario. They were also some
key figures from the alliances.

"This is a legitimate struggle! Wake up the Demon King of Salvation and
the evil company, Kim Dokja's Company, who preempts the scenarios and
monopolizes the capital!"

Preempt the scenario and monopolize the capital…

They wouldn't say that if they knew how hard it was for us to get through
the scenarios. Inside the walls were the confused party members. The first
one I heard was Gong Pildu's voice. "Should I just shoot them?" "Ahjussi,
are you crazy? Most of them are novice incarnations!" "Everyone! Don't do
this! It is a misunderstanding!

Lee Jihye and Lee Hyunsung came forward to yell at the people but
communication wasn't possible from the beginning.

"Shut up! Open the gates! Share the items!"

"There is no such thing as items!"

"Share the coins!"

"We aren't gangsters…"

An 'incitement' of this level wasn't something that ordinary humans could
do. Every alliance on the Korean Peninsula was taken over by my party
members and the Gyeongi Alliance, which was the largest stumbling block,
was destroyed by Yoo Joonghyuk not long ago.

The fact that so many people gathered together meant it was likely that
someone outside had intervened. Then where were Yoo Joonghyuk and
Han Sooyoung? What caused this division in the Factory? It seemed there
were many things I didn't know.
[Many constellations are interested in what is happening in the industrial
complex.]

I had to stop this before it became bigger. I was calculating things in my
head and about to move towards the party members when I heard a
dokkaebi's voice.

[Revolution…! I am someone who advocates for democracy!]

An ominous feeling rushed through me.

[Since a probability of this scale has been gathered, it is possible to open up
a scenario?]


  [Sub Scenario - Seoul Revolution]

  Category: Sub

  Difficulty: ???

  Clear Conditions: Seoul is currently under the leadership of Kim
  Dokja's Company. Incarnations have emerged to resist the dominance
  of the nebula. Many constellations want both groups to fight for
  control of Seoul.

  Time Limit: None

  Compensation: 300,000 coins

  Failure: ―
The moment I read the scenario, I had a nasty feeling. Kim Dokja's
Company had accumulated two giant stories and was now well known in
the Star Stream.

However, the nebula's representative, Yoo Joonghyuk was absent. Someone
was deliberately trying to hit us.

"There is no failure condition! Should I try it?"

"300,000 coins! Let's make some money!"

Lee Jihye shouted with frustration. "Stupid… it isn't an amount large
enough to be divided!"

The moment I thought it wouldn't work, someone came forward. It was
Jung Heewon. Jung Heewon used the Speech Amplifier skill and her voice
was filled with great vigour. "Don't hide your representatives!"

The people climbing the walls were aghast at Jung Heewon's words.

"There will only be senseless sacrifices if you wage war here. Wouldn't it
be better to decide victory in a battle between representatives?"

Jung Heewon watched the people and continued. "If we lose, we will hand
over the Factory as you wish!"

"Heewon-ssi! Why promise such a thing…?!"

Lee Hyunsung stared at her with confusion while Jung Heewon calmly
explained. "These people, most of them haven't passed the 10th scenario
yet. What will happen if a real war occurs here?"

Lee Hyunsung shut his mouth at Jung Heewon's words. Rather than talking,
the party members stared at each other in silence. How much time passed?
One by one, they started nodding.

"…Heewon-ssi is right."
Lee Hyunsung, Lee Jihye, Shin Yoosung and Lee Gilyoung. Gong Pildu
looked unhappy but…

Everyone agreed this was the best way to minimize the sacrifice of the
citizens.

The dokkaebi saw the progress from the air and laughed.

[…Good. Will this event be a 'Representative Exhibition'?]

At the same time, the contents of the sub scenario were changed.

[Sub scenario - Seoul Revolution is updated!]

[Through the representatives of both forces, the owner of Seoul will be
determined!]

Jung Heewon yelled at the people beyond the walls. "The representatives,
come up now. This side is ready."

It was a confident smile. Maybe Jung Heewon's determination stemmed
from the faithful time she spent training.

The people who had been talking about revolution and the spring of Seoul
suddenly fell silent when Jung Heewon came out so confidently. Then their
shouts became louder.

"R-Representative! Where are you? Come out quickly!"

"Fight and win! Find our rights!"

Yet no one showed up. It was natural. Those who raised the crowd wanted
to take advantage of the irrational incitement. However, the meaning
disappeared if the story flowed like this.

The anxious incarnations cried out, "Who…!"
I was a bit thrilled when I saw the ranks of the crowd crumbling. It was
great to see who the party members had grown in the three years without
me.

Perhaps Jung Heewon aimed for this from the beginning. She learned to
maintain her sense of justice while being pragmatic.

She was already one of the strongest in Seoul. She had no chance of losing
in a one-on-one fight against an incarnation.

The dokkaebi in the air stroked his chin. [Kim Dokja's Company has two
representatives missing. Who will come forward?]

The party members raised their hands at the same time. However, Jung
Heewon was first. "I will do it."

"Heewon-ssi."

"Don't worry. You know that I'm strong."

Certainly, Jung Heewon was the strongest in our nebula apart from Yoo
Joonghyuk. Lee Hyunsung, Lee Gilyoung, Shin Yoosung and Gong
Pildu… none of them could surpass Jung Heewon when it came to
individual combat power. In addition, Jung Heewon seemed to notice
something. This was one of the reasons why Jung Heewon should be a
representative.

「 …I will go. 」

The reason for this was the three incarnations approaching through the
crowd. One of their faces was especially familiar.

…This guy. The man who passed over the walls opened his mouth. "I will
be a representative."
              Chapter 347: Ep. 65 - Good and Evil, III


The man with the imposing atmosphere was the one who confronted me
last time. He was the one who ran away from me during the last
'confinement'.

The leader of the Gyeonggi Alliance, one of the 10 Evils Cho Jinchul. In
this round, I thought that our party members had become too strong yet this
guy came back.

Jung Heewon smiled and pulled out her sword. "You?"

Despite saying this, Jung Heewon didn't relax her guard at all. It was
because she read the unusual energy flowing from Cho Jinchul's body. It
was demonic energy.

Jung Heewon's expression hardened and filled with killing intent. While
clearing Dark Castle, it was only in name but she was the one who cleared
the 10th scenario by killing the 'demon king'. There was no way she
couldn't know.
"You… were eaten by a demon king."

It was the aura of a demon king. The laughing Cho Jinchul already wasn't
Cho Jinchul. He was a man swallowed up by demonic energy.

[The demon king 'Monarch of the Snake Hell' has revealed his existence.]

Monarch of the Snake Hell. One of the Demon Realm's 72 demon kings. He
was the master of the 72nd Demon Realm, Andromalius. In addition, the
other two incarnation bodies were emitting similar energy.

[The demon king 'Thinker of Lies and Secrets' has revealed his existence.]

[The demon king 'Performer of Musical Instruments' has revealed his
existence.]

Three demon kings appeared through their own power. Even so, Jung
Heewon remained calm after knowing her opponents were demon kings.

"Is it a one-on-one fight?"

[Of course, it will be one-on-one. Fearless incarnation.]

Her hair raised from the true voice but Jung Heewon laughed. "Yes, I
wanted to try it one day. How great a demon king is."

There was deep anger contained in her voice. It might be Uriel's influence
or it might be the accumulated anger towards me. In any case, Jung
Heewon looked like she was doing well.

[The fight has begun!]

In fact, it was a confidence I could understand. The opponents might be
demon kings but Jung Heewon didn't need to back down. In addition, there
was the state of being possessed through proxy. If she stepped back here,
the archangel's pride would be damaged.
A red light filled Jung Heewon's eyes as the Sword of Judgment moved
through the air. The trajectory of the sword moved through the air like a
net.
There wasn't a chance to avoid it and Cho Jinchul's arm flew through the
air. [You dare…!]

The surprised Andromalius let out a roar but Jung Heewon's sword showed
no hesitation or fear. Andromalius was baffled by the arrogant style. It was
a swordsmanship that didn't look at anything and only focused on killing.
The incarnations who only went through ordinary scenarios couldn't afford
to go against her.

Blood poured out once again as there was a deep cut on Cho Jinchul's right
thigh. The gap in skill was overwhelming. The crowd's mouths dropped
open and the party members felt admiration. This was the real power of the
Judge of Evil, Jung Heewon.

[The character 'Jung Heewon' is preparing to activate Judgment Time!]

For the finish, Jung Heewon gathered her strength. It was the combination
of Judgment Time and Hell Flames Ignition. Jung Heewon was trying to
press this 'Representative Exhibition' with overwhelming force.

However, at the same time, Andromalius increased his synchronization rate
with Cho Jinchul and started the descent in earnest. Cho Jinchul's cut off
arm soared up with demonic energy and the injury restored with magic
power. This was the power of the 72nd demon king.

[Your tricks end here.]

A fist struck Jung Heewon's blade like a lightning bolt. The Sword of
Judgment shook and Jung Heewon immediately took a few steps back. Cho
Jinchul pursued Jung Heewon and continued to attack.

Andromalius prepared for damage to his probability and incarnation body
as he increased the synchronization rate.
A threatening power emerged from Cho Jinchul's body. No matter how
strong Jung Heewon was, she couldn't fight against a demon king by herself
without Uriel. In the end, Jung Heewon was thrown through the air from
the power struggle.

"Keuk, dammit…!"

I couldn't understand the situation. To be exact, it was strange that
Andromalius made such a choice.

Not all demon kings were in the same class. By doing this, the scales of
probability would move and Archangel Uriel would be able to intervene.
Once she came, the demon kings would turn into ash in the blink of an eye.
Nevertheless, the fact that they were earnestly dealing with Jung Heewon
showed they had something they believed in.

[The activation of Judgment Time has been forcibly cancelled.]

The thing they believed in was quickly revealed.

"…Uriel?"

Uriel didn't respond and Judgment Time and Hell Flames Ignition weren't
activated properly. Putting aside Hell Flames Ignition, it was strange that
Judgment Time wasn't activated. Something was wrong with Uriel and the
other constellations of the absolute good system.

…Don't tell me? At this moment, I understood how the story was flowing. I
understood why the demon kings suddenly made such a move and why they
visited my 'demon realm' at this time. Everything suddenly made sense.

Kyrgios floated in the air and was looking at me. I gazed back at him. I
didn't move despite being able to intervene at any time due to him. Then
Kyrgios spoke to me.

–You should do it.
I shook my head. It wasn't time yet. If possible, I didn't want to reveal my
strength too early. It could backfire if I revealed my power just to win this.
Kyrgios opened his mouth.

–This will happen frequently in the future unless you demonstrate your
strength.

Maybe he was right. The current Kim Dokja's Company was rising and the
demon kings had come to dampen the momentum of our nebula.

If we didn't show our strength now, our nebula would seem shallow to other
constellations.

I sighed and looked up at the air where Bihyung was laughing.

He looked like he knew the scenario would turn out this way from the
beginning. Maybe Bihyung had been calculating many things. It was why
he only opened this scenario after I woke up. Really, he was a damn
dokkaebi.

–Go ahead. Show me the status of a demon king.

I jumped out of the Factory onto the battlefield. There was a sound of
surprise from the party members as I grabbed Jung Heewon's shoulder from
behind.

"Heewon-ssi."

"…Dokja-ssi?"

"You don't have to fight here. I'm not stopping you because you are

weak." I went forward with Jung Heewon behind me.

[The constellation 'Demon King of Salvation' is opening his 'status'.]

The three demon kings were watching me. I used my true voice.
[All demon kings. Did you choose the wrong playground? I'm sure you
have something to say to me

but say it and get out of here.]

Andromalius' face distorted at my true voice.

[Cheeky guy.]

[Do you know why we came?]

I nodded. The reason the demon kings came here was obvious. Since
Earth's incarnations had exceeded the 60th scenario, it was time for the
event to be held. Perhaps these guys had come to invite me.

The fact that Jung Heewon couldn't use Uriel's power was related to this.
The demon kings giggled as if everything so far was just amusement.

[Be honoured that your elders have personally visited you.]

[Come with us. We have to prepare right now. We'll be leaving straight
away.]

I smiled and nodded.

[You came here to pick me up and I should go. By the way…]

I looked back at Jung Heewon, who was wiping her bloody nose, and the
party members supporting her. They hadn't sufficiently rested from the
aftermath of Gigantomachia.

[I think it will be hard to just send you away.]

[What bullshit is that?]

[If you are a demon king, you should be worthy. Isn't that right?]
[The nebula 'Kim Dokja's Company' is requesting a representative change.]

[The demon king 'Demon King of Salvation' has become the new
representative.

The demon kings realized my intentions and were astonished.

[You want to fight us now? You… do you know what happens when a
demon king and demon king fight?]

[I know very well.]

I looked at each of the demon kings and answered.

[The demon king 'Demon King of Salvation' has applied for a demon king
promotion.]

A demon king promotion. It was a fierce duel between demon kings who
competed for rankings and honour.

[A promotion! Are you crazy?]

It might be true. Whether it was demon king or constellation, I was tired of
being dragged around by these bastards.

[Do you agree or not? They're watching.]

[The demon king 'Immeasurable Austerity' is interested in the battle
between the low-grade ones.]

[The demon king 'Duke of Everywhere' says this is a premature fight.]

[The demon king 'Monarch of Stars and Logic' is pointing out the spelling
of the 'Duke of Everywhere'.]

[The demon king 'Devil of Lust and Wrath' is making an interested
expression.]
Countless demon kings were watching the confrontation. I was the 73rd
demon king, the lowest of the demon kings. It would be embarrassing if
they refused my challenge.

The three demon kings would be formidable but I wasn't afraid at all.
Rather, I was composed as I watched them.

「 Maybe Yoo Joonghyuk also felt like this. 」

Andromalius made a humiliated expression as he opened his mouth.

[…I accept the challenge.]

However, I shook my head.

[You are out. I'm not applying for you.]

[What?]

[Andromalius, you are the 72nd ranked.]

I pointed to another demon king behind him.

[I am applying for the 67th demon king, Performer of Musical Instruments
Amdusias.]

If I was going to fight then it was better to kill the guy with the higher
ranking. Andromalius' face turned red at my words and he rushed over. The
fist that contained the formidable stories of the 72nd Demon Realm flew
towards me.

[Giant Story 'Snake That Crouches for 1,000 years' has begun!]

Clearly, their low ranking didn't mean they had bad stories when they had
lived for a long time.
Nevertheless, they didn't know. I have lived a much shorter history than
them but it was also much fiercer.

[Giant Story 'Demon Realm's Spring' has started the story.]

[Giant Story 'Torch That Swallowed the Myth' is revealing its crouching
teeth.]

The next moment, blue-white lightning filled the area. It was Electrification
through Bookmark. The blue-white magic power was astounding. A faint
smile was seen on Kyrgios' face.

[There isn't a big gap between the character and your level.]

[Your understanding of the character has greatly enhanced your skills!]

[The exclusive skill 'Electrification Lv. 23 (+13)' is activated.]

It was a real hassle to use Electrification without Miniaturization.

[Your current body configuration is different from that of the character.]
[Your status has overcome the penalty of the physical conditions.]

Andromalius' fist stopped in front of my nose. He stared at me with
astonishment before his eyes shifted to his stomach. Half of his body was
gone.

I pulled my sword out of his body and declared. [First, the 72nd place.]
              Chapter 348: Ep. 65 - Good and Evil, IV


[The Monarch of the Snake Hell is wounded and has exited from the
scenario.]

[You have won the demon king promotion!]

[Your Demon Realm ranking is adjusted!]

[You have become the 72nd Demon King!]

I passed by Cho Jinchul's ashes and looked around. They were two demon
kings who hadn't yet come to their senses. Indeed, it was natural to be
surprised. It was because the lowest ranked 72nd demon king was finished
in one blow. Even so, this was reality.

[Several demon kings are amazed by your power.]

[The demon king 'Devil of Comfort and Savagery' is spitting at your status.]
[The demon king 'Darkness of No Value' is threatened by your status.]

[The constellation 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' is mocking the reaction of
the demon kings.]

Not all constellations received a giant story. Even if they had a giant story,
their stakes in it were low and they couldn't take full advantage of it.

I was different. All my giant stories weren't inherited from someone else
but were a history that I created with my party members.

[Giant Story 'Demon Realm's Spring' is continuing.]

The giant stories gathered in this way showed a completely different level
of power.

[Giant Story 'Torch That Swallowed the Myth' is looking at the demon
kings with greedy eyes.]

The confrontation with Poseidon still lingered in Unbroken Faith. I stared at
the demon kings.

[The demon king 'Thinker of Lies and Secrets' is preparing to depart from
the scenario.]

The 71st demon king, Dantalion. The demon who was known to be cunning
noticed quickly.

[Where are you trying to run to?]

I used both Electrification and Way of the Wind and caught him. This time,
I was helped by Bihyung.

[The bureau has rejected the scenario proposal of the Thinker of Lies and
Secrets.]

[The game should be finished to the end, demon kings.]
Dantalion's eyes widened like he hadn't expected the dokkaebi to take my
side. Was it the shock of Andromalius' defeat? I didn't feel any dignity from
the appearance of the demon kings.

The demon kings outside the top 70 were like this. They became demon
kings out of luck and barely clung to the bottom of the ladder while abusing
the title of 'demon king'.

Blood rose and the head of a negligent incarnation body rolled to the
ground.

[The 71st.]

[The Thinker of Lies and Secrets is wounded and has exited from the
scenario.]

[You have won the demon king promotion!]

[Your Demon Realm ranking is adjusted!]

[You have become the 71st Demon King!]

I looked at the last remaining one, Performer of Musical Instruments
Amdusias.

Amdusias asked, [Do you really have to do this?]

[Why, are you scared?]

[Do you see me in the same class as Andromalius and Dantalion?]

The atmosphere changed. Unlike the two demon kings I had previously
defeated, Amdusias was prepared for a fight. The horn of a unicorn grew
from the head of the incarnation.

[The demon king 'Performer of Musical Instruments' has summoned the star
relic 'Star Trumpet'.]
From the 60s, the level of the demon kings went up a bit.

[The exclusive skill 'Reading Comprehension' is activated.]

The thickness of the story was different. However, there were no special
feelings since I already met the 32nd ranked Asmodeus. Asmodeus
might've gone up the ranks a lot by now. There were demon kings who had
particularly steep growth and one of them was Asmodeus. On the other
hand, the demon kings in the lower rankings rarely had a chance to rise.

[Your status has increased greatly and your skill 'Reading Comprehension'
is strengthened!]

[Your skill allows you to understand the composition of the story!]

The story that I felt from Amdusias was very dark and worn out.

[The story 'Hell Performer' is yawning while looking at you.]

It was a boring and long story that no longer made me curious about the
backstory. This was the story that formed the backbone of Amdusias,
Performer of Musical Instruments.

Amdusias asked, [What are you seeing?]

I said it earlier but the stories I accumulated were more intense than theirs.
In fact, these words were wrong. There were fierce moments in any story
but the comparison of intensity was meaningless in the first place. In this
damn Star Stream, the only thing that won was time.

[…I just want to be able to fight.]

After hundreds of years, some constellations were dulled by the stimulation
of the scenario. Rather than look for and explore new stories, they entrusted
themselves to the flow of the stories they had already acquired. Stop
thinking about it.
[The story 'Hell Performer' is moving according to the will of demon king
'Amdusias.]

Those who were masters of the stories were eventually dominated by their
stories.

[A person who hasn't lived for 100 years is mocking me?]

Amdusias knew that his anger wasn't entirely his own.

[The story 'Hell Performer' has begun.]

Finally, the concert of hell began. The sound waves filled with the power of
the 67th Demon Realm moved through the air.

"Aaaack!"

The incarnations of Seoul shed blood and fell down. The performance of
the Hell Orchestra was full of blood and death and there was nothing wrong
with it. Nevertheless, I didn't back down. Amdusias was strong but it wasn't
to the point where I couldn't beat him.

[Giant Story 'Demon Realm's Spring' is continuing.]

[Giant Story 'Torch That Swallowed the Myth' is continuing.]

My sides and shoulders were wounded by the powerful sound waves but I
didn't care. The stories that I and the party members built up were
protecting me.

「 Therefore, the man who swallowed God made his own flame. 」

The flames of the torch rose from Unbroken Faith.

[Giant Story 'Torch That Swallowed the Myth' is letting out a wild roar.]
[The great story 'Torch That Swallowed the Myth' is exercising control over
other stories!]

The stories I had were gathered around the torch.

[The story 'King of a Kingless World' is agitated.]

[The story 'Person who Opposes the Miracle' is afraid of the giant story.]

[The story 'Giant's Liberator' is following the flames of the torch.]

White flames illuminated all of Seoul. Sparks of probability penetrated my
body as the berserk story stretched out from my sword.

The flames of the torch raced through the darkness like turbulent waves and
swept away Amdusias' incarnation. The power was so strong that my hand
holding the sword trembled.

[Giant Story 'Torch That Swallowed the Myth' is disappointed by your
'status'.]

[Giant Story 'Torch That Swallowed the Myth' wants a fiercer sprint!]

[Giant Story 'Torch That Swallowed the Myth' has complaints about you.]

[Giant Story 'Demon Realm's Spring' is displeased with 'Torch That
Swallowed the Myth'.]

The giant stories were inherently different from other stories. The strong
stories chose their master and had enormous influence, eventually
becoming the master itself. In particular, the Torch That Swallowed the
Myth was particularly belligerent. If I showed even the slightest gap, this
story wouldn't hesitate to eat me with its own flames.

[Giant Story 'Torch That Swallowed the Myth' is looking at you with
greedy eyes.]
[Giant Story 'Torch That Swallowed the Myth' is ending the story.]

Before that happened, I had to tighten the reins on it. I had to hurry with my
plan or I might end up the same as Amdusias.

Only ashes remained where the flames of the torch passed. The appearance
of the demon king was nowhere to be found. This was the gap in
overwhelming force.

[The Performer of Musical Instruments is wounded and has exited from the
scenario.]

[You have won the demon king promotion!]

[Your Demon Realm ranking is adjusted!]

[You have become the 67th Demon King!]

[Your reputation is spread throughout the Demon Realm!]

[Several demon kings are amazed by your strength.]

I heard the voice of the dokkaebi.

[The winner of the Representative Exhibition is determined.]

[The sub scenario ― Seoul Revolution has ended.]

[300,000 coins will be distributed to Kim Dokja's Company as
compensation.]

The indirect messages poured out.

[Constellations of the absolute evil system have sponsored you 100,000
coins for your battle.

[The constellation 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' likes your struggle.]
[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' is proud of your
growth.]

[The constellation 'Mass Production Maker' is nodding in a warm manner.]

[Several demon kings are offering you goodwill.]

Between the pouring messages, I could feel the eyes of the crowd from
below the wall. The survivors who lived through Amdusias' attack were
watching me. They didn't even know they had been used.

I opened my mouth towards them. [Everyone, it is nice to see you for the
first time. I am the Demon King of Salvation.]

The wings of a demon king spread out behind me while horns rose from my
head. The surprised people screamed and stepped back. I took one step
closer to them.

[Open the walls.]

There was a loud sound as the Factory forcibly opened its walls. The
barriers they had been trying to cross opened so easily that the people
seemed perplexed.

"W-What…?"

[Didn't you want to come in? Please enter at any time.]

"Is he trying to kill us?"

"He'll kill us! I'm sure he'll kill us!"

Some horror-filled incarnations started pissing themselves at my true voice.
I stared at them and spoke in a resolute voice. [I am a demon king but I
have never once persecuted incarnations for unreasonable reasons.Kim
Dokja's Company has never monopolized Seoul.]
In fact, the door of the Factory was always open. It was the citizens who
first distanced themselves and gazed at us with fear.

[The Factory will accept you. I won't spare you support as you go up
through the scenarios one by one. I will help you build your story as much
as you can.]

The eyes of the people became cloudy at the words that came out of my
mouth. Some made disbelieving expressions while others opposed it.

"How can we believe that?"

"T-That's right! You are already too strong. In addition, the
constellations…!"

I understood their feelings. Some gaps are awe-inspiring while others
created despair. The scene that the incarnations just witnessed was a great
story that they couldn't catch up with in their lifetime.

[There is no guarantee that you will be left behind if you start late. The
speed at which we go through the scenario is different. I was in the same
situation as you a few years ago.]

The constellations of the sky were looking down at me. The beings had
been far away even from the first scenario.

[I was an incarnation that lagged behind thousands of years compared to
those constellations. Yet I came all this way.]

Those beings were now in reach if I stretched out my hands.

I looked at the people with my horns and wings. [Look at my appearance.
Do I look special?]
The people were looking up at me with bemused eyes. It was as if they
were looking for something inherently special in my appearance. Someone
muttered, "…Can we become that?"

[You never know what will happen before any scenario ends. Don't give up
until the end.]

I turned around and spoke final words.

[The front door is open. If you wish, please come in and seek help or
advice.]

This might be a fake hope. Perhaps most of them wouldn't climb to the
stars but they would be excited by the enchantment when they faced the
starlight. Still, what the people needed right now was this fake hope. Then
someone muttered my modifier. "Demon King of Salvation…" There was
a bitter taste on my tongue.

[The demon king 'Devil of Lust and Wrath' likes your deception.]

[The constellation 'Saviour of Corruption' reveals hostility towards you.]
Demon King of Salvation. The Star Stream must be as bad at naming as I
was. Many people wished to survive but I wasn't a philanthropist. I only
liked the people I liked and saved the people I cared about.

"Dokja-ssi!"

In the distance, the party members were running towards me, including
Jung Heewon. I waved lightly towards them.

Then I saw a glittering system message in the air.

[The master of the 73rd Demon Realm, representative of Kim Dokja's
Company.]
The moment I was going to check the message, someone spoke from
behind me.

[You don't need to read that. I came directly.]

It was a familiar true voice. I stared at him with wide open eyes.

[Asmodeus.]

[It's been a while, Kim Dokja.

[Did you come to give up your ranking?]

[I came here to share a deeper friendship. Aren't we colleague who share a
giant story?]

The words weren't completely wrong. In fact, a minority share of the
Demon Realm's Spring belonged to him.

[Are you already aware of why I'm here?]

Of course, I knew. Asmodeus had probably come here with the same
purpose as the other demon kings.

[Do I have to attend?]

[It is a foolish question. This close to the apocalypse, you should know the
answer.]

I was silent as I stared in Asmodeus' serene eyes.

Asmodeus said, [The 'Duet Between Good and Evil' will soon begin. Now
it is time for you to choose a side.] The gaze towards me was inquiring.

Was I 'good'? Or was I 'evil'?
It wasn't only Asmodeus. The stars of the night sky split around me in
unison. One side was a bright light while the other side was a dazzling
light.

I inwardly sighed. The Duet Between Good and Evil. The implication of
this scenario being initiated was simple.

「 There isn't much time until the destruction in this world. 」

Once the balance between good and evil collapsed, the stars in the night sky
would fall one by one. It was fatal destruction that even the big nebulae
couldn't escape. If my memories were correct, perhaps the first victim of
the destruction—

[The constellation 'Scribe of Heaven' is looking at you.]

It would be the nebula of archangels, Eden.
              Chapter 349: Ep. 65 - Good and Evil, V


Duet Between Good and Evil wasn't a main scenario. The classification
belonged to the hidden scenario but strictly speaking… the scenario was
akin to an event.

I left Asmodeus for the moment and greeted my party members. There were
too many things to blindly enter the scenario.

"Hyung! Are you okay?"

The party members had different expressions but the concern on their faces
was the same. They probably had many questions.

I was reminded of the situation before I passed out and explained the whole
story to the party members step by step. In return for saving my mother and
Yoo Sangah, I was hit by the aftermath of the probability storm.

Jung Heewon listened calmly to the story and asked, "…Yoo Sangah-ssi's
soul is inside you?"
"To put it simply, yes."

"If there was such a way, why…"

"I wasn't sure about the success."

Jung Heewon sighed and leaned down with her hands pressed against her
knees. "Then Sangah-ssi really died…"

"Then is Sangah unni alive?"

Lee Jihye muttered while sitting down. She couldn't seem to believe it and
asked again several times. Shin Yoosung and Lee Gilyoung had tears in
their eyes. Lee Hyunsung was standing next to them like a bear.

"She is alive. And…" I stared straight at Lee Jihye and said, "I'll revive her
again."

Yoo Sangah was obviously alive. However, it was hard to say she was
living in her present condition.

Jung Heewon asked, "How? If it is similar to Biyoo…"

"I was thinking of reincarnation but not into a dokkaebi. In the first place,
the existences that can become dokkaebis are fixed. The Flood of Disasters
was a special case."

The 41st regression Shin Yoosung had been wandering around the Star
Stream for thousands of years. However, that wasn't the case with Yoo
Sangah.

"To save Yoo Sangah, I need to go to a certain 'star'. It is called the 'island'
among the transcendents."

In the distance, Kyrgios pricked up his ears at the word 'island'. Maybe
Kyrgios knew about the island. While I wasn't here, he had already gone to
the island.
"The problem is that I can't go there right now."

Jung Heewon glanced at Asmodeus who was wandering around the back of
the Factory. "Is it due to the invitation that the demon king brought?"

I nodded. My mind was complicated. I had to go to the island to save Yoo
Sangah and also participate in the Duet Between Good and Evil. The more
urgent thing right now…

[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' is looking at you.]

[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' is asking for your help.]

My thoughts were complicated. I couldn't believe Uriel would say this. Was
the situation in Eden that bad? However, if I attended Duet Between Good
and Evil…

「 (Dokja-ssi, I told you. A quest should always be preceded by a quest.)
」

…Eh?

'Yoo Sangah-ssi?'

「 (Yes.) 」

'Did you wake me up before?'

「 (That's right.) 」

It was surprising. How did she talk to me across the Fourth Wall? Even
Nirvana couldn't…

「 (I'll give you a more detailed explanation later but now you should focus
on the problem at hand. I'll cut to the chase. Dokja-ssi must attend the Duet
Between Good and Evil.) 」
'But…'

Yoo Sangah must be reading Ways of Survival in the Fourth Wall. Maybe
she guessed my plans through Ways of Survival.

「 (It doesn't matter if my reincarnation is late. You don't know it but this
library is pretty comfortable.) 」

'But…'

「 (In addition, I think attending Duet Between Good and Evil will
help when moving towards the next main scenario, right?) 」 Yoo
Sangah was right.

'Please endure it a bit, Yoo Sangah-ssi. I'll let you live again'.

Yoo Sangah was faintly smiling. I looked back at the party members and
outlined the current situation. "The aftermath of the last scenario isn't over
but something new has come up. I'm sorry. Even so, I must attend this
scenario."

Lee Hyunsung heard my words and puffed up his chest. "Dokja-ssi, I don't
care. I have already rested comfortably and want to move quickly."

"That is only Hyunsung ahjussi. I wanted to get some rest…"

"Are we all going?"

"I think we should leave Seolhwa-ssi and Gong Pildu behind. We need
a minimum number of people to manage the industrial complex." The
next moment, light flashed in the air.

[The 'Duet Between Good and Evil' is calling you.]

"I guess it has started."
Along with the message, our bodies were surrounded by light. The forced
transfer to the scenario began.




The Duet Between Good and Evil was literally a feast of good and evil. A
banquet after one long scenario ended in order to identify 'good and evil'.

One might wonder about the meaning behind such an action but for some
constellations, this 'discrimination' had a very important meaning. It was
because the overall discrimination of good and evil would change the status
of the absolute good and absolute evil system, leading to a difference in the
next quarter.

[It has been a long time since there was a banquet of this size.]

"Haven't you seen it often?"

[I didn't always attend. This is a bit unusual.]

Asmodeus gazed at the exterior of the magnificent banquet hall and smiled.
In fact, the banquet was unusual in not just size but also position. The
moment we were summoned, there was a crowd of people walking across
the bridge.

The constellations and incarnations passing through the bridge and the
dokkaebis waiting to broadcast the scene. In addition, there were the
constellations belonging to the independent media of the Star Stream.

Asmodeus said, [Then I will enter first. Don't be uncomfortable and take it
easy. Above all, you are the most likely candidate to win a prize this
season.] …Candidate to win a prize?
Before I could say anything, Asmodeus flicked his fingers and his clothing
behind a gorgeous black dress. He started to enter the hall by crossing the
bridge with an elegant walk.

[Devil of Lust and Wrath!]

[The demon king 'Asmodeus' laughed!]

There was the should of shutters as the bridge flooded with light. Asmodeus
smiled at the dokkaebis and glanced back at me with a charming
expression.

Once again, I realized what a great existence Asmodeus was. Every one of
Asmodeus' steps caused images of the battlefield where he fought to flow. I
didn't know how many people he fought to be upgraded.

[The demon king 'Devil of Lust and Wrath' ― is currently ranked 13th
among demon kings.]

The guy who was 32nd rank not long ago was now at the top of the
pyramid. It was a huge upgrade.

"We will enter."

I looked around at the party members but their expressions were strange.

"Ahjussi. Is it okay if we go in?"

"D-Dokja-ssi. I didn't know it would be a place like this…"

Jung Heewon, who visited Eden, took a deep breath to seek calmness but
the situation of the other party members was serious.

Lee Jihye was nervously biting her nails while Lee Hyunsung's huge
bearlike shoulders trembled. I could feel Shin Yoosung and Lee Gilyoung
holding my hands tightly.
"It's fine. We received an invitation."

I was also nervous but I smiled to reassure my companions.

"Don't be intimidated. We've been fighting hard in the meantime. It doesn't
matter what they think of us. It is more important that we build a history
that doesn't shame us."

"Dokja-ssi is right. What are we doing? We should enter quickly."

The other members seemed to wake up due to Jung Heewon's strength. Lee
Jihye struck her red cheeks.

Once the preparations were over, I walked over the opening bridge with my
companions. The path was covered with jewels and minerals, including
obsidian and diamonds. There was also a river of stories flowing under the
bridge.

The famous constellations, including Asmodeus, had already passed over so
the crowd didn't pay attention to us. To be exact, I wanted it to be like that.

[Ah, that person…!]

[Demon King of Salvation!]

Now my modifier was quite famous and some of the constellations
recognized me. At the same time, the dokkaebis broadcasting glanced this
side. The exclamation began like a small clap and soon spread throughout
the bridge.

[The enemy of Olympus!]

[Kim Dokja's Company has come!]

Attention was concentrated on us in an instant. The huge amount of
attention caused the walking party members to be embarrassed. Some of the
constellations on the bridge even reached out towards us. Messages poured
in from all over the place and placards swayed.

[Handsome Kim Dokja!]

[9158 FOREVER]

I hoped that the party members wouldn't look at them but Jung Heewon
spoke to me.

"Dokja-ssi, are you an idol?"

"Heewon-ssi is the same as me."

–Judge of Evil! I've been watching your scenario!

–Heewon unni is so cool!

–I support the love of the Steel Sword!

Lee Hyunsung was startled and glanced over frightfully. "D-Dokja-ssi!
They are talking about me."

–The 'Korean History Preservation Association' is supporting Lee Jihye, the
successor of the Duke of Loyalty and Warfare.

Lee Jihye frowned. "These guys…"

–Shin Yoosung ☆ Lee Gilyoung are the best!

I felt a strong force from Shin Yoosung holding my hand.

"Ahjussi, I feel terrible."

"Why am I and Shin Yoosung…"
I knew that the reputation of our nebula had increased since
Gigantomachia. In fact, the Mass Production Maker had said so. Still, I
never imagined the reaction would be so huge.

[Demon King of Salvation, say a few words!]

[How do you feel about being nominated the most likely to win a prize this
season?]

The microphones coming from all over the place caused me to panic. When
I thought about it, this was the first time in my life that I had received such
attention. At this time, there was someone who saved me from being
embarrassed by the dokkaebis.

[■■, aren't you getting lost?]

The distinctive platinum hair spread through the air and emerald green eyes
blazed with fury.

[R-Run away!]

[Crazy angel!]

The dokkaebis scattered and an archangel in a black silk dress reached me.

[Kim Dokja! You came!]

Uriel hugged me and rocked with me in her arms. I felt happy and
embarrassed at the same time and removed Uriel.

"Uriel, it has been a while."

[Yes yes!]

I felt good when I saw Uriel's glittering eyes. I was glad to see her again. I
was thankful but… Didn't she call me because Eden was in danger?
"…Excuse me? Don't you see your incarnation here?"

[H-Heewon! Hahaha! Of course, it is also a pleasure to meet Heewon! Let's
enter!]

Uriel turned away from the crowd and guided us to the banquet hall. I
entered the hall and felt overwhelmed with admiration. The demon kings
and constellations were separated on two long tables.

On the left were the 72 demon kings─73 now─ while the right table
contained the constellations of the absolute good system, including the
archangels of Eden.

Our position meant everyone present was focused on me. It was as if they
were asking me what table I was going to sit on.

[The demon king 'Monarch of Stars and Logic' is paying attention to your
choice.]

[The demon king 'Black Mane Lion' is wondering about your choice.]

[The constellation 'Scribe of Heaven' is watching you.] [The

constellation 'Morning Star Goddess' is looking at you.]

Sadly, this time there seemed to be no other choice.
