150: Ep. 29 - Constellation Banquet, V


At the beginning of the Story Succession, six small rooms were created at
the end of the stage. The number of rooms was exactly equal to the number
of incarnations participating in the Story Succession.

–All incarnations, please move immediately to the Room of Secrets!

The system of the Story Succession was simple. The incarnations would
communicate with the constellations through the Room of Secrets and hear
all their conditions. Later, they would go up on the stage and announce the
story they would receive.

There was a nameplate that said 'Incarnation Kim Dokja'. I said towards
Yoo Joonghyuk, "I'll see you later."

Yoo Joonghyuk didn't respond and disappeared into his room. I entered the
room and sat at a table, while the sounds from outside were completely cut
off. It felt like the space was distorted.
[The Room of Secrets.]

It was one of the most confidential places in the Star Stream. The things
that happened here couldn't be seen by even the dokkaebis of the channel.
[You have become the master of the Room of Secrets for one hour.]

[You have been given the administrative rights of the Room of Secrets.]

[The maximum time you can use the Room of Secrets is one hour.]

[Please make contact with as many constellations as possible in this time.]

I looked at the door with anticipation. Okay, who would be the first guest?
Someone came through the door at this time. It was a floating yellow book
with sacred scripture.

[Incarnation Kim Dokja. Select the Feast of Resurrection.]

…The first better was Indian mythology.




[The constellation 'Founder of Humanity' is looking at you.]

The negotiator from Vedas was the constellation 'Manu', who had the
modifier of 'Founder of Humanity'. I also knew Manu's story. Of course, it
wasn't because I knew Indian myths but because of Ways of Survival.

「 According to the Indian epic, Manu was the survivor of the great flood.
In exchange for saving a fish, he was able to escape to the top of the
Malaya Mountains in a ship prepared by the fish… 」

…I recalled this story and knew why Manu had come to negotiate. Manu
was a constellation who frequently argued over the copyright for the 'Ark's
Master' narrative with the constellations from Eden. In other words, this
Manu was a specialist in copyright disputes among the constellations of
Vedas.

"…The Master of December 25th didn't come directly?"

[Do you think he is that free? Answer simply. Will you accept the Feast of
Resurrection?]

He was coming out with this attitude? In addition, the person in charge of
the story, Mithra¹ didn't come.

[If you have ears, you will know that Vedas is one of the biggest nebula. A
myriad of myths are born in Vedas and many nebulae plagiarize our myths.
Especially those Eden guys…]

"Those personal issues don't concern me. More importantly, if I accept the
Feast of Resurrection, what can Vedas give me?"

[The protection of the sun god will be with you.]

"What is the blessing of the sun god?"

[Do I have to explain everything to you? Insignificant mortal…!]

"I have one question."

[What?]

"Again with the 'insignificant mortal', don't you think it is an antiquated
cliche? You all are constellations who love unconventional stories, yet just
how long will you continue to look down on humans with such hackneyed
lines?"

Manu's eyes widened and he glared at me.

[How dare you talk such nonsense…!]
"It is what I think."

[You have used the administrative rights of the Room of Secrets.]

[The constellation 'Founder of Humanity' has been expelled from the
room!] At my command, the Founder of Humanity was surrounded with a
pale light and disappeared with a shout. He should've done well when he
had the chance.

I wouldn't be suppressed by force, even if the other person was a
narrativegrade constellation. It might be different after the Story Succession
but now I was the one with the advantage.

"Next." I just finished speaking when someone else opened the door. It was
a wanderer with an old crown. Who was this?

[Incarnation Kim Dokja, join Olympus.]

These jerks, did they read an 'Incarnation Kim Dokja' manual or
something?

[The constellation 'Poked Out His Eyes' is laughing at you.]

…Poked Out His Eyes?

[It looks like you know me.]

"I heard your story when I was a university student."

[Is that so? How unexpected. A small Oriental country…!]

'Poked Out His Eyes'. He was King Oedipus who was taught in liberal arts
classes. A person hated by Sophocles.

"By the way, I've already heard the proposal from the God of Wine and
Ecstasy. You are here to tell me to join the Bacchus sect?"
[Bacchus? It seems that he has already approached.]

Something felt strange. Persephone attended the banquet for 'Olympus'
while Dionysus told me not to believe anyone. Both of them didn't tell me
to join Olympus. Yet King Oedipus was one of the first at this door.

[I'm not here about Bacchus. I didn't even come to exercise the copyright
for the resurrection story.]

In other words, King Oedipus visited me for a reason that was completely
different from the other constellations.

…Maybe this might be the representative of the 'real' Olympus?

[The story that Olympus will present to you is Carnival of Lightning.]

"Huh?"

I was shocked. Carnival of Lightning was the story of Zeus, one of the three
leaders. Oedipus saw my expression and smiled strangely.

[It looks like you also know this story. Yes, you are right. The story we are
suggesting is different from the resurrection stories of other nebulae.

"…Why are you offering me this?"

[It is because the three goddesses of fate have caught a glimpse of your

fate.] …My fate.

[Sooner or later, you will be eligible to inherit the Carnival of Lightning. Of
course, you could inherit my story and take the 'Blind Prophet' but… you
are already rumoured to be a prophet and won't inherit my story.]

"Wait a minute. What do you mean? Why is my fate…"
[The decision is yours. However, you will definitely need Olympus. Well,
until we meet again.]

Oedipus disappeared from the room. My heart was a bit disturbed. I didn't
know what the 'fate' Oedipus mentioned was like but if the three goddesses
of fate were involved, something similar to what they saw would happen in
the future.

By the way, why was I suitable for inheriting the story of a Greek god?
Their stories were inevitably…

[Hello?]

Something was about to flash through my head when a person entered my
room. There was a fresh and sweet scent. A beautiful angel's face appeared
in front of me. The female angel resembled a small demon.

It seemed to be Eden's turn.

"…I thought the Master of the Ark would come but you came personally."

[Are you upset that I came?]

My heart thumped after I heard the voice.

…Uriel was so cute.

"Nope, it is nice."

[I wanted to see you! Kim Dokja.]

Uriel pulled me into a surprise embrace. Our arms touched and I could feel
her skin through the thin silk she was wearing. A demon… this was a
demon's touch. It was an open back dress, meaning there was nowhere to
place my hands. Uriel rubbed my face like I was a lovely doll and I sighed.

"I also… wanted to see you."
[Yes yes!]

It was a bit embarrassing but I was glad to meet her. Uriel was a
constellation who had been with me since the beginning of the scenario.

"You are here to offer me the Messiah's Path?"

[…Ah, right! I came because of it!]

Uriel raised her head with surprise. It was an expression that showed she
didn't remember why she came here. It seemed she was quite pleased to
meet me.

[It must be because you are too handsome.]

"Your words are convincing."

Uriel smiled and said. [Kim Dokja, will you accept Eden's story?]

"That… I need to think a bit."

[Why? Our story is the best! It isn't comparable to other places!]

This was certainly true. The Messiah's Path was the best story in the
resurrection system. There was one problem.

"I will lose something precious if I accept that story."

[Eh? Ah. T-That's right. If you choose our story, you'll become an
eunuch… That can't be.]

I expected to be persuaded but unexpectedly, Uriel shook with agitation.
Was it such a big deal for Uriel that I would become an eunuch? Why?

[W-What to do? If I don't bring Kim Dokja to Metatron, he won't let me use
the Internet for a month… but if he accepts, Kim Dokja will become an
eunuch… when that happens… oh, wait a minute. Perhaps if his position
changes…?]

…What position?

[O-Okay! Kim Dokja! Don't worry too much about this problem. One way
or another…!]

Uriel seemed to be filled with great determination on her own. I firmly
shook my head. "I don't want it."

[Yes! It is okay if you are an eunuch…!]

"Next."


After that, many constellations visited me. There were places like Tamna
and Guiok, as well as independent constellations.

In particular, the historical-grade constellations of the Korean Peninsula
gave me a lot of encouragement and didn't want me to establish a
relationship with a particular nebula.

[You are the hope of our world.]

[Please don't bend your will.]

Their hearts were understanding. The historical-grade constellations who
had been suffering from the narrative-grade constellations were envious of
me.

The negotiation time soon ended. The incarnations went up to the stage one
by one. It was time to review the proposed stories and determine which
ones they would inherit.
–Now, let's announce the result of the Story Succession! First, Selena Kim
from the United States!

The dokkaebi on the stage had the atmosphere of a home shopping host. It
was natural. Through this banquet, the bureau would make a huge amount
of coins.

–Selena Kim has decided to inherit the Indomitable Aegis' story given by
the 'Last Conscience' constellation!

Selena Kim has chosen Olympus… 'Indomitable Aegis' was a story
appropriate for her as the King's Guardian.

My thoughts became more uncertain as time passed. No matter what I
chose, someone would become an enemy. If I chose no one, there would be
even more enemies.

'Think carefully. The question is who exactly I should turn into an enemy'.

Persephone said so. I faintly understood her meaning. Maybe Persephone's
words were meant for all the resurrection stories.

I didn't have only one life and there were those who would want me to
succeed their story in the next resurrection.

There was still a problem. Eden and Vedas definitely wouldn't yield the
'first resurrection' and even if I inherited their story, there would surely be
subordinate constraints on them.

It was unavoidable. From the very beginning, the relationship between
incarnation and constellation was unfair. Wait a minute, 'fairness'…?

It was finally Yoo Joonghyuk's turn to get on stage.

–The next person is the Supreme King of Seoul…
The audience gulped as Yoo Joonghyuk moved. In particular the eyes of the
narrative-grade constellations were strange. They were those who wanted to
gain Yoo Joonghyuk. On the other hand, there were those who showed
fear…

At this moment, a thought occurred. Then Yoo Joonghyuk opened his
mouth. "I…"

Dionysus had told me not to trust anyone. However, that was only if the
opponent was a constellation. I had at least one person in this place who I
could believe in.

I jumped up towards the stage. I grabbed the confused Yoo Joonghyuk's
hand and raised it high into the sky.

"I have something to say to you." I said while looking at the audience. The
constellations looked astonished. I was able to see Uriel's expression, who
seemed on the verge of fainting. I quickly glanced over the faces of the
constellations.

The reason why the Story Succession wasn't fair was because the
succession of a story was done in the form of one-sided 'sponsorship'. The
relationship between constellation and incarnation was never equal.

[The constellation 'Maritime War God' is focused on your words!]

The strength of the narrative-grade constellations differed from the
historical-grade ones. Those who were in a nebulae looked down on others.

[The nebula 'Vedas' is focused on your words!]

"We have decided not to inherit your stories."

An enormous silence descended on the audience. Many eyeballs popped out
as pressure poured towards Yoo Joonghyuk. Yoo Joonghyuk stared at me
as I held his hand.
I grinned at him and told the constellations. "We will 'buy' your stories."

In order to make an unfair game fair, I had to first make the opponents
equal.

"If you want to sell your stories to Yoo Joonghyuk and I, please make a
deal with our nebula."

There is also the Roman Mithras. The Vedic version, Mithra is part of the
Vedas so I will be keeping that spelling from now on. It is also said that
Mithras was born on December 25th. The author seems to have combined
the Vedic Mithra and the Roman Mithras, which is why he is the Master of
December 25th in this story



[1] Mithra is the name of an Indo-Iranian divinity. There is also the Roman
Mithras, who was born on December 25th. Wiki.
                 Chapter 151: Ep. 30 - Dark Castle, I


In fact, I was most worried about Yoo Joonghyuk. He was more
trustworthy than anyone else here but at the same time, I couldn't be sure of
his position. If Yoo Joonghyuk shook off my hand then my actions would
be useless.

Fortunately, Yoo Joonghyuk was calm. He might have a violent temper but
this guy was amazingly good at controlling his anger and sent me a secret
message.

–What are you doing?

[The character 'Yoo Joonghyuk' has activated Midday Tryst.]

…The item that I had previously bought belatedly came to my mind. I
didn't know that the Midday Tryst I registered at that time would still be
valid. I deliberately spoke in a brazen manner.

–I will do this more than once or twice. You should get used to it.
–What?

–The conditions aren't bad enough for you. I know that you can't inherit the
'stories' of other constellations.

Yoo Joonghyuk flinched at my words.

–…I don't know how you know such things.

In fact, declaring a 'nebula' with me wasn't bad for Yoo Joonghyuk. In the
progression of the original novel, Yoo Joonghyuk didn't inherit any stories
here. It was due to the constraints on Yoo Joonghyuk.

[The regression constraints.]

He could turn back the clock after dying but he couldn't inherit the stories
of other constellations.

[Incarnation Yoo Joonghyuk. Is Incarnation Kim Dokja correct? Are the
two of you making a nebula?]

The dokkaebi host watching the situation stepped in. Everyone looked at
Yoo Joonghyuk while I nervously waited for his answer.

"Yes."

I inwardly sighed with relief. The first hurdle was overcome. However, the
real hurdles were from now on.

In the complete silence, someone on the second floor laughed. The soft
laugh was somewhat pleasant. I could feel Persephone's mood through this
laughter.

「 Kim Dokja, you did it after all. This is why I like you. 」

Of course she liked me. Persephone's style fit this type of story. Thanks to
her laughter, the other constellations also started to laugh. Most of them
were constellations on the second floor. Unfortunately, their laughter didn't
contain the same meaning as Persephone.

[The nebula 'Vedas' is disappointed in you.]

[The nebula 'Guiok' despises you.]

Uriel held a handkerchief to her mouth and frowned at the reactions of the
constellations around her.

[What? Why are you like this? This is good!]

The constellations on the first floor watched silently. Their eyes contained a
mixture of longing and worry. Maritime War God and Bald General of
Justice also looked nervous. The one who was most interested was Goryeo's
First Sword, who was looking this way.

The laughter died down and more direct contempt flew from the second
floor.

[A person who hasn't climbed to the throne of a constellation wants to
create a nebula?]

[Dokkaebi, does this make sense?]

[Can any cat or dog open a nebula?]

The dokkaebi seemed confused at all the questions that poured towards
him.

[That… Incarnation Kim Dokja has clearly received recognition from the
Star Stream.]

Along with these words, the stories I've made were projected onto the
ceiling screen.

[King of a Kingless World]
The first scene that appeared was when I destroyed the Absolute Throne by
borrowing the power of the Four Yin Demonic Beheading Sword. Strictly
speaking, my narrative started from there. Fragments of the throne appeared
on the screen.

Some constellations nodded like they were convinced and some
constellations looked at each other with astonishment.

[He broke the throne of divinity!]

[…Did he really open with that story?]

There were probably some attendees who didn't know my information. I
thought I was quite famous but I was still lacking. I suddenly looked around
and saw the Russian child staring at me with blank eyes.

[Person who Opposes the Miracle.]

The second story was when I took down the returnee Myung Ilsang who
was a disaster.

[Some constellations are favourable towards you.]

Since the returnees were disliked by constellations then this was a suitable
story to acquire the liking of the constellations. At this time, curious
expressions appeared on the faces of the constellations.

[…What is this?]

It was due to the third story that appeared, where I beat up the intermediate
dokkaebi Paul. I was a bit surprised when I saw the screen. I only wanted
revenge for Shin Yoosung… was it included in my 'stories'?

The dokkaebi Paul screamed and the embarrassed dokkaebi host quickly
fast-forwarded. Then the complaints of the constellations were heard.

[Hey, what is that?]
[T-That. Haha, it seems to be the wrong data.]

However, unlike the dokkaebi's words, a story name appeared on the
screen.

[One Who Showed Contempt for a Streamer]

Laughter was heard from the landing of the stairs. It was Goryeo's First
Sword who was laughing.

[This is crazy! Hahahaha!]

Then the fourth story appeared.

[One Who Hunted the King of Disasters]

It was when I hunted the shadow of the constellation Yamata no Orochi in
Peace Land. The constellations' mouths dropped open when they saw
Orochi killed with my Electrification.

[The shadow of a narrative-grade constellation…]

[He has already accumulated four legendary stories?]

Confusion spread among the constellations. The screen turned off and the
dokkaebi continued speaking. [In any case, Incarnation Kim Dokja is now
at the facing the throne of a constellation. If he gains his fifth story through
this occasion…]

Those who knew I was aiming to be a constellation weren't confused but
the other constellations were startled.

[Becoming a constellation before the 10th scenario is over?]

[He is a new constellation…]
I suddenly received a lot of heated gazes. Certainly, this was a formidable
event even in Ways of Survival. There were only a few constellations or
returnees who had gained the recognition of the Star Stream before the 10th
scenario.

In the midst of the increasingly confused atmosphere, it was Manu of Vedas
who opened his mouth.

[I will acknowledge Incarnation Kim Dokja. However, I can't acknowledge
the nebula. There are two problems.]

The constellations focused on Manu's voice.

[One, we don't know if Incarnation Kim Dokja has sufficient payment
ability. Isn't it necessary to have the minimum of funds before establishing
a nebula?]

"The coins are sufficient."

Turmoil occurred again at my words.

Manu stared at me with suspicious eyes. [We will know once it is
checked. The second problem is who will 'support' your nebula.] I
gulped. It was finally the real challenge.

[The establishment of a nebula needs to be supported by at least five
constellations. Do you have the support of any constellation?]

"That…"

I couldn't easily answer and Manu laughed.

[No, is there even a name for the nebula in the first place?]

I opened my mouth as I glanced at Yoo Joonghyuk. "The name of our
nebula is… Kim Dokja's Company…"
"There isn't a name yet. In addition, we will gain the supporters now." Yoo
Joonghyuk casually interrupted me.

"Are there any constellations who want to support our nebula?"

No one responded to Yoo Joonghyuk's words. Manu laughed.

[I knew it. It is a waste of time. Dokkaebi. Continue with the Story
Succession…]

At this time, someone raised their hand.

[The Olympus 'Underworld' will support your nebula.]

[Queen!] The angry Manu growled at Persephone.


Persephone's aura rose sharply. [It is my decision. Are there any
complaints?]

[Urgh…]

No matter the strength of Vedas, the constellation Manu couldn't stand
alone against Persephone, Queen of the Underworld. In the end, he turned
towards the other constellations.

[Surely there won't be anyone else?]

[I will support it.]

The voice came from the second floor and the constellations were once
again amazed. It was the Great Sage, Heaven's Equal.

[P-Prisoner of the Golden Headband?]

[Really? Are you serious?]
I looked towards him in gratitude. The Great Sage, Heaven's Equal was
picking at his ears while looking down here like it was troublesome.

[Eh I don't know… sorry! I also support it!] Uriel of Eden declared her
support. [I will also give you the name for your nebula! The nebula name is
Forbidden… mmph mprh!]

The ninth rank angels around her were flabbergasted and covered her
mouth. No matter her intentions, I was thankful. Now the rest of the
constellations glanced at each other.

The three constellations who declared their support were powerful enough
not to worry about others. The rest were different. It was unusual for
historical-grade and narrative-grade constellations to challenge Manu just
to help establish a new nebula.

I looked to the side and saw that Yoo Joonghyuk had half given up. He
messaged me:

–We won't get any further.

…I would be blocked here but I didn't mind.

–It's okay. My objective was achieved.

–What?

–I wasn't expecting anything. The important thing was to buy some time.

From the beginning, I didn't intend to inherit the story of any constellation
here. I thought of the original novel and the banquet's ending was fixed. At
this time, something unusual happened.

[I, Goryeo's First Sword, will support your nebula.]

Goryeo's First Sword declared support for us. Then the historical-grade
constellations stood up at once.
[Then I, Maritime War God…!]

[The Bald General of Justice won't stay still!]

Once the constellations on the first floor started to support us, the
constellations on the second floor and the dokkaebi became greatly
confused.

[W-Wait a minute! Such a random declaration of support…!]

The next moment.

[The constellation 'Secretive Plotter' will support your nebula.]

…Huh? Secretive Plotter? Where the hell was he?

[You have won a Provisional Nebula Creation ticket!]

…Don't tell me? At this moment, the banquet hall started to shake and the
space distorted. I looked up at the sky. The banquet had finally ended.
'They' had come.

[…This aura is?]

[Everyone retreat!]

Even the constellations became nervous. The sky was greatly distorted and
powerful sparks appeared. It was like the sky was splitting apart.

[The Great Hole.]

The strange hole, which only appeared when a scenario was activated,
suddenly appeared above the banquet hall. The startled Manu shouted,

[The gods of the other world! How dare you come here?]
The constellations roared and raised their own aura. Then a terrible voice
came from the hole in the sky.

(Why… Weren't we invited?)

Persephone and Uriel instantly blocked Yoo Joonghyuk's and my ears. It
was to prevent the foreign true voice from intruding. They stood in front of
us, lowering the pressure from the hall.

[I'm sorry but the party is over. It's time to go back.]

[Then I'll see you next time!]

The moment Persephone and Uriel spoke, Yoo Joonghyuk and I were
surrounded by a transparent circle. It was the space transformation using
the power of the constellations. They wanted to save us from the terrible
battle that would son take place at the banquet hall.

By the way, the god of another world was a bit faster than expected. Wait…

[The gods of another world are looking at you!]

[The gods of another world are looking at you!]

At the last moment, I heard Uriel's scream. [Kim

Dokja!]


Then darkness covered my eyes.




[ Who are you? ]
[ Not recorded in the vehicle. ]

[ Don't tell me… ]

[■■■■…]

[ The 'last story' is finally about to start… ]




"Hey, is it here?"

"It is okay? What if those guys come? It is said that the Maritime Admiral
and Pure Steel often come here!"

"Isn't this the hero's grave?"

A dark night. Several robbers were gathered around the tombstone erected
in Gwanghwamun.

The leader of the robbers, Lee Dongpa frowned at the terrified people.
"Pathetic fools. What hero is he? Can a hero die so easily?"
It wasn't long ago that Lee Dongpa learnt about the existence of the hero.
The strongest man who saved Seoul by sacrificing his life. Of course, Lee
Dongpa didn't believe the rumours.

"Now, do it quickly! There is no time. Before those dark scum come out!"

Many people were already participating in the ninth scenario, Dark Castle.
However, not all people participated in the scenario, including Lee Dongpa.
The main scenarios were just festivals for the smart guys like him.

"It is a hero's grave. Wouldn't there be one or two good things buried?"

"Search the body as well! He might've hidden things on his body."

"Shit, he is buried deep. Hey, pick it up!"

The robbers quickly dug at the ground. Approximately two hours passed.

"W-We reached it!"

Finally, their shovels hit a lid. Their hearts were pounding as they opened
the lid. A man dressed in a white coat was sleeping in the coffin.

Lee Dongpa laughed. "A hero? Bah. He is a sleeping princess. He is

ugly." "The coat is excellent. Strip it off him…" Tak!

"Waaaaahhhhh!"

"W-What… kuaaack!"

The shocked Lee Dongpa fell down and started shaking. The hero, who had
just been dead, was holding onto the shoulder of a robber. Then every being
in Seoul heard the following message.

[Someone has acquired five stories.]
[A new constellation is born in Seoul's night sky!]
                 Chapter 152: Ep. 30 - Dark Castle, II


It had been five days since they entered the first floor of the Dark Castle.
Lee Jihye ran down a corridor of the Dark Castle with the injured Lee
Gilyoung on her back and Shin Yoosung.

[The 5th grade demon species, Dark Tracker is chasing you.]

"Jump!"

Lee Jihye avoided the scythe that appeared from the dark tracker and used
Demon Slaying. Magic power scattered through the air as Lee Jihye took
the children and ran with all her strength.

"Damn, Taming doesn't work on them?"

"…I can only tame monster species."

"Damn!" Lee Jihye kept cursing as she ran.
There were close to ten demons following her. The 5th grade demon
species were stronger than other monster species. Her skills weren't enough
and she couldn't use her stigma in this environment.

'I shouldn't have come in'.

After Kim Dokja's death, the morale of Kim Dokja's party was completely
disturbed. They lost focus and started acting individually. To make matters
worse, Yoo Joonghyuk mysteriously went missing while the ninth scenario,
Dark Castle appeared.

The dokkaebi had told them when the scenario first started,

[This scenario… Um. Haha, maybe you'll fail.]

Lee Jihye's reaction had been disbelief. They were going to fail? The
scenarios always seemed impossible but they always won. Thus, they could
do well this time.

At least, that's what Lee Jihye had thought then.

'Go right now. Smash all these scum!'

She didn't know why she had been so hasty. Maybe it was because of guilt,
rather than confidence. She felt guilt for someone's death and pushed
herself to the limit to wipe out the monsters.

Maybe it wasn't just Lee Jihye. Jung Heewon, Lee Hyunsung and the other
members felt a similar sense of urgency. Thus, they prematurely rushed to
the scenario area to get rid of their insecurities.

After all, they were the strongest rankers in Seoul and the strongest
incarnations. However, Lee Jihye soon realized that it was a mistake.

'Shit, this is ridiculous… ridiculous'.
Lee Jihye's power didn't work in Dark Castle. The trajectory of Kendo,
which reached level 7, rarely hit and the power of Demon Slaying only
provoked the demons. Her sword had broken a long time ago.

"Jihye unni!"

Lee Jihye moved at Shin Yoosung's cry and she avoided a dark tracker's
blade. She picked up a weapon dropped by an incarnation and used Sword
Training and Ghost Walk.

"Unni! Behind you!"

Dark liquid from the dark trackers scattered through the air. Lee Gilyoung's
small insects came from somewhere and were hit by the liquid instead of
Lee Jihye.

The insects hit by the black liquid experienced bizarre cell deformation and
exploded. Thanks to the time bought by the insects, Lee Jihye was able to
deal a bit more damage to the dark trackers.

"Aaaaaaack!"

The armour around the neck of a dark tracker broke and it fled. However,
there were still nine remaining. Besides, the dark trackers were just a joke.
The really scary thing was the guy on the other side of the dark trackers.

[Demon Viscount Noslocke.]

He had a human body with a rhinoceros head. Lee Jihye's body shook every
time he approached. She had never seen such a monster before.

In terms of individual strength, he wasn't as strong as the Disasters of
Floods. If the Disaster of Floods had her power suppressed, the demons had
no such thing.
Moreover, Lee Jihye's higher strength had become a poison to her. She
knew the opponent's strength and this only raised her fear. Lee Jihye raised
the blade and bit her lips. Thus, here…

[On the first floor of the Dark Castle, the 'Ancient Magic Power Barrier' has
been formed.]

"Unni, over there!"

A blue room was created at the end of the hallway. It was the only resting
place in this Dark Castle.

Lee Jihye and the children rushed to the room with all their might and
barely escaped from the pursuit of the dark trackers. The space was small,
not even two square meters, but the three of them managed to squeeze in.

[You have entered the Ancient Magic Power Barrier. The special barrier
will be activated for 30 minutes.]

If it wasn't for this safe zone being activated three times a day, Lee Jihye
and the children might've been killed already.

The dark trackers groaned as they touched the barrier and retreated. They
tried to enter several times before giving up. However, that guy was
different.

"Why isn't he leaving?"

The demon resembling a rhinoceros. The Demon Viscount Noslocke sat on
the gorund a few meters away, as if it knew the principles of this barrier.

"…He is waiting."

The demon's long tongue swept over his lips. Like a gourmet waiting for
delicious food, he watched Lee Jihye and Shin Yoosung. Shin Yoosung
shivered at those terrible eyes.
"Now what? There are no more monsters to summon."

"There are still 30 minutes. Let me think."

At the edge of the barrier, Lee Jihye was able to see the outside world
through the windows of the castle. They couldn't leave through the window
because of a special enchantment but they could see the outside anyway.

Demon species poured from the entrance of Dark Castle that Li Jihye and
her companions had opened.

Most of them were lesser demons but they were still too much for ordinary
incarnations. The demons of Dark Castle devoured and infected the
incarnations of Seoul.

Thanks to this, many of the demon species outside the fortress were people
she originally knew.

Min Jiwon and the Hwarang. The members of Nirvana's Salvation Church.
The people she knew were walking down the streets and tearing people
apart. All of this was the result of her impatience. If she had been a bit more
careful…

[Didn't I tell you? The difficulty of this scenario is on a completely different
dimension.]

Lee Jihye heard the voice of the dokkaebi in the air and realized. It wasn't
because she was strong that she could survive until now. It was because she
was lucky.

'Damn! Damn! Foolish girl!' She blamed her own impatience too late. The
people who entered without preparation scattered in the maze of darkness
and she met these children. What happened to the other party members?
She didn't know. Maybe they were all dead.

'If only Master was here. No… not Master…'
"I wish Dokja hyung…" Lee Gilyoung's voice was heard from behind her
and Lee Jihye frowned.

"Don't speak useless things, fool. You are hurt so go to sleep."

Lee Gilyoung, who was hit in the back of the head, fell silent again but
unfortunately, there was one other person.

"Ahjussi isn't dead. I don't know why but I feel that way."

She didn't know why these children kept on bringing up a dead person.

"That person is in hell. Quickly forget that ugly face."

Shin Yoosung showed an unexpected response to her harsh words. "I really
don't understand. Everyone says he is ugly but how is he ugly?"

The question was a bit embarrassing. In the meantime, she had pushed 'Kim
Dokja is ugly' like a slogan (the constellations sometimes gave her coins)
and she never really questioned why Kim Dokja was ugly.

"I mean, the shape of his eyes and nose… the whole harmony…"

The more she talked, the more confused Lee Jihye became. She couldn't
understand where Kim Dokja was ugly. No, Kim Dokja's face didn't come
out clearly. It was as if it was obscured by something hazy…

Or like a face that hadn't been created yet…

Why? Why couldn't his face appear clearly?

Lee Jihye told Shin Yoosung, "I-It just isn't to my taste."

"…You cried so much at the funeral."

"I was acting, you idiot. The constellations gave me a lot of coins at the
time."
[Some constellations ask Lee Jihye if it was really acting.]

Lee Jihye bit her lips.

"Unni is still a long way off. People aren't all about faces."

"You really…" Lee Jihye watched Shin Yoosung for a moment and sighed.
"…I know that much."

She spoke in a small voice. Just because she knew it didn't mean she could
admit it. At least for Lee Jihye, who was still immature.

She owed a lot to Kim Dokja. She survived because of him. She knew. She
knew it well but she didn't want to admit it. She wanted to repay her debt
while still looking good.

In fact, he… was a pretty helpful person. Now that opportunity had
vanished forever.

[There is one minute left for the duration of the Ancient Magic Power
Barrier.]

Lee Jihye came to her senses as the darkness in front of the barrier shook.
The demon's smile widened. Lee Jihye realized it was time.

"Yoosung. Can you pull Gilyoung up? Take him away at my signal."

"Huh?"

"Listen to me."

It wasn't like her at all, sacrificing her life for a friend. Even so, this is who
she wanted to be. All because of the dead man's example..

"Quickly! Run away and ask someone for help! Do it before I go to hell!"

"…Understood. Hang in there Unni."
Perhaps there wouldn't be anyone else. Still, she had to say this. Otherwise
the child wouldn't leave.

Lee Jihye rushed forward the moment the barrier disappeared. The
surprised demon jumped but that was it. The demon species surrounding
her aimed for her body. Blood flowed from her white thighs and arms.

If only there was a lake nearby. No, if only she could get in touch with her
sponsor whose link had been disconnected a few days ago.

"…I don't want to die."

The trajectory of Kendo was gradually disturbed and she weakened. The
demon's smile became bigger. There was a big hit to the back of her head
and her vision shook for a moment.

Lee Jihye muttered to herself. "I want to live…"

It seemed that something similar happened before. What had happened at
the time?

At this moment, light appeared in front of her. The bodies of the dark
trackers were split into two. It was as if the Messiah had descended and
waves were splitting in two.

Lee Jihye watched in a spellbound manner.

The confused Demon Viscount Noslocke turned his head and a powerful
electric current appeared around it. There was a man in the path of light
created by the electric current.

Ah, ah…

Lee Jihye stuttered but she couldn't make a sound. He was the one whose
face she couldn't remember. He was saying something but she couldn't hear
it. The next moment, the fog covering his face disappeared.
The demon viscount roared angrily. For what? She didn't know. However,
one thing was certain…

This time, the man's face was visible.

'…Ahjussi, is this your face?'

[The constellation who doesn't yet have a name is looking at you.]

Lee Jihye listened to the message and smiled as she fell forward.
                Chapter 153: Ep. 30 - Dark Castle, III


"…Were the words earlier referring to ahjussi?"

"What?"

"A new constellation in Seoul blah blah blah…"

"Ah… well. That's right."

I smiled bitterly while staring at the demons around. I was surprised to see
Lee Jihye's crisis but it seemed she had been acting too aggressively.

Demon Viscount Noslocke. This insidious guy who resembled a rhino was
a demon who ripped apart and killed countless incarnations. I knocked
down a noble-grade demon instantly, and realized how strong I had
become.

Lee Jihye saw his collapsed body and muttered. "This guy was incredibly
strong… How strong are you after becoming a constellation?"
"I didn't defeat him using my own strength. I borrowed the power of
another story."

"Another story?"

[Who…are…you…] I looked over at Noslocke who was still breathing.

"Wait a minute."

I simply stepped down and destroyed Noslocke's head.

[You have defeated a noble of the Demon Realm!]

[10,000 coins have been acquired!]

[The item 'Advanced Demon's Proof' has been acquired.]

[The sub-species of the Demon Realm will be afraid of you.]

Originally, killing a demon servant would gain the attention of their 'demon
king' but this scenario was different. All demons in the Dark Castle scenario
were ones waiting for their new 'master'.

[A few constellations are amazed by your overwhelming presence.]

[A considerable number of constellations are questioning your probability.]

Certainly, the probability was questionable. My strength was currently at a
level that violated the balance of the scenario. However, it wasn't because I
was a constellation that I could easily get rid of Noslocke.

[The story 'Messiah's Path' is partially in effect.]

It was the 'absolute divinity' effect of Messiah's Path.

I borrowed the story which had a special effect on demons from Eden.
[The nebula Eden is asking you to pay the 'story quotation'.]

I drew a cross shape in the air and heard a message.

[The nebula Eden is delighted with your narrative quotation.]

It was annoying to do this quotation every time but it was better than
plagiarism. Furthermore, I didn't have to pay any other price for using it at
this time. It was a special service that the Eden nebula provided.

[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' is pleased!]

This was all thanks to the cute Uriel. Fortunately, the 'banquet' was well
resolved.

"Ahjussi… have you become religious?" Lee Jihye laughed while breathing
roughly. Her right shoulder and abdomen had stab wounds. "I'm sorry.
Doesn't the 10th strongest person in Seoul look poor?"

"Now is your hardest time. Don't worry. You will be better in the future.
Stay still. I'm going to fix your dislocated bone now.

"Huh? Aaaaaaack!"

I thought I should use the Ellain Forest Essence. However, I had no items
remaining in my coat subspace. I had left it to Han Sooyoung before dying.

Just before dying in the eighth scenario, I made a small contract with Han
Sooyoung and left my items with her. Then… there was only one way left.

"Dokkaebi Bag."

As soon as I opened my mouth, I saw the screen window of the Dokkaebi
Bag in front of me.

[Some constellations are questioning the use of your natural privileges.]
Until now, most constellations didn't know I enjoyed the benefits of the
Dokkaebi Bag because Bihyung would turn on the advertising. Now there
was no need to hide it because I was a constellation.

I immediately purchased the Ellain Forest Essence and fed it to Lee Jihye.

"O-Oof!"

"Eat and sleep."

"…Thank you ahjussi."

"Well… Thank you for crying for me at the funeral."

"…I will faint now so don't talk to me."

Lee Jihye fell asleep. I lifted up Lee Jihye and heard a familiar voice from
behind me.

"Ahjussi…?"

I was filled with a warm sensation. I could tell the owner of the voice
without looking back.

[Your incarnation is looking at you.]

I wouldn't have been able to run straight here if it wasn't for this feeling. I
saw Shin Yoosung crying and thought that parents probably felt like this.

"Ahjussi!"

I grabbed Shin Yoosung and lightly embraced her. "Was I gone long?"

"You were gone for a week…"

One week. Damn, I was resurrected later than planned.
"Let's go. I have to find the items I entrusted to someone else."




"…A week has passed. Why haven't you come yet?"

Han Sooyoung lay on the floor of Dark Castle and murmured to herself.

It was crazy to act like this in the Dark Castle seething with demon
servants. Fortunately, no demon servants came after hearing her voice. It
was because someone had already swept away the nearby demon servants
while moving upstairs.

Of course, it was all done by Yoo Joonghyuk.

"Damn protagonist jerk."

Han Sooyoung gritted her teeth.

30 minutes ago, Han Sooyoung had confronted Yoo Joonghyuk here. Then
she was disastrously defeated.

Her body ached and her head was dizzy. The demons species? They weren't
the problem. The real demon was Yoo Joonghyuk.

"You scammer. How could you use such a person… Kim Dokja."

She couldn't understand it no matter how much she thought.

In the Seoul rankings, Yoo Joonghyuk was ranked third and Han Sooyoung
was fourth. Then why was the difference so large? The reason she didn't
lose her life was because of her last-ditch words.

'Hey! These are Kim Dokja's items! Are you going to steal them?'
'…Why did Kim Dokja leave his things to you?'

'That… isn't it because I am the most trustworthy person?'

'Then I will kill you and take them'.

'Y-You want to kill me? What will Kim Dokja think?'

Yoo Joonghyuk thought about it for a while before finally letting her go.

'If you mention him in front of me again, I really will kill you'.

Then he headed up to the second floor. Han Sooyoung was furious when
she thought about it and screamed.

"That jerk… ahhhhhh! Abyssal Black Flame Dragon! Didn't you say you
are the strongest constellation? Why can't I beat him?"

[The constellation 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' is in deep thought.]

[The constellation 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' says that it isn't his fault.]

Han Sooyoung sighed. It was a scene where she would be misunderstood as
having multiple personalities.

"This is a big deal. That jerk brought his little sister up… it is a
development that Kim Dokja will clearly hate. The situation is like this but
where is Kim Dokja?"

[The constellation 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' is asking about what you
mean.]

"You're a bastard. By the way, that jerk took all my 'proofs' and I will have
to start from scratch…"

Han Sooyoung opened the scenario window.
  [Main Scenario #9 - Demon's Proof]

  Category: Main

  Difficulty level: A++

  Clear Conditions: Hunt the demon species, collect nine Demon's Proofs
  and place them on the altar on the 2nd floor.

  Time Limit: 23 days.

  Compensation: 50,000 coins

  Failure: ―



The demon servants were so powerful that the scenario was a bit tricky, but
it was possible to clear if the incarnations cooperated. The major forces had
already moved to the second floor.

She might be a ranker but she might be overtaken by the other rankers. The
Dark Castle compensation was excellent, meaning the ranking would
change if she delayed even a little bit.

'What should I do?'

At this time, a group of people on the other side of the corridor caught her
attention. Han Sooyoung thought this was better. She could take the proofs
from these guys…

"Han Sooyoung-ssi!"

Han Sooyoung saw their faces and sighed.
"What the hell is this?" Someone cried out.

Han Sooyoung replied, "…I was just fighting the demon servants and was
hurt. Lee Hyunsung-ssi also entered the maze?"

"That's correct. Are you alright?"

He was the Pure Steel Lee Hyunsung.

'Why did this guy appear here?'

Kim Dokja's companion, Lee Hyunsung also came here. No matter how
urgent the situation, she couldn't take away the proofs of the main
characters… eh?

"Lee Hyunsung-ssi! Don't go over!"

The shrill shout came from a beautiful face. The four people who appeared
with Lee Hyunsung weren't anyone Han Sooyoung knew. The woman once
again shouted, "Lee Hyunsung-ssi! Can't you hear my words? It might be a
trap!"

"That's right! Back off! Come over here!"

"But…"

Lee Hyunsung was confused as he looked between Han Sooyoung and the
women.

Han Sooyoung spoke to Lee Hyunsung. "Has your party changed? Why are
you building a harem all of a sudden?"

"I split up from the party in the labyrinth…"

Lee Hyunsung looked troubled and the other women rushed at him and
pulled at his arms.
"Why are you listening to that person?"

"Those wounds don't come from fighting with demon servants. That
woman is suspicious!"

"That's right!"

"Hyunsung-ssi is too naive! You shouldn't trust anyone in this world!"

Lee Hyunsung was pulled back by the women with much difficulty.

Han Sooyoung triggered Detect Attributes. The next moment, a cruel smile
appeared on Han Sooyoung's face as she saw the names in front of her eyes.

'…What am I seeing? It is them?'

The way that people adapted to a destroyed world were different. There
were women who believed in themselves like Jung Heewon and Lee Jihye,
while other women took advantage of others. The even more interesting
way… "Lee Hyunsung, I didn't realize that you have an unusual taste?"

"Huh?"

"Don't you know they're all men?"

[A constellations who likes to change sex is surprised!]

[The constellation in love with a woman is aghast!]

The women shouted in astonishment at Han Sooyoung's words.

"W-What are you talking about right now?"

"Don't frame us!"
It was impossible to think these people were men. However, Han Sooyoung
knew them. They were a group of four who used Disguise and Forbidden
Charm to kill strong rankers or the weak.

Han Sooyoung remembered the name of this group.

[Pink Kids].

They had the name of a girl group but they were all men in their 40s. She
spoke to them.

"Hey ahjussis, do you like disguising as young girls? Lee Hyunsung-ssi, if
you stay with them, you will be tricked and killed."

"What is this crazy bitch saying?'"

"Hyunsung-ssi, let's go! She is a strange person!"

Sometimes it was common in Ways of Survival to dress up as the other
gender. There were more villains in this world than Pink Kids. Thus,
these men could be rehabilitated. "Kim Dokja might've said this…" Han
Sooyoung was different from Kim Dokja.

"I have to get rid of these disgusting things."

At this rate, Lee Hyunsung would 100% be hit in the back of the head by
Pink Kids. His death would have a severe impact on the scenarios. A large
number of clones started to surround Han Sooyoung's body.

Lee Hyunsung hastily came forward. "W-What are you doing?"

She demanded, "Get lost. I'm going to kill them."

"They aren't bad people!"
Lee Hyunsung didn't move out of the way. He didn't seem bewitched but he
stood firmly in place. If she thought about it, this was Lee Hyunsung. The
Pink Kids watched Lee Hyunsung with touched eyes.

Han Sooyoung cried out in an irritated manner, "I will kill you if you don't
get out of the way."

"Han Sooyoung-ssi. I'm aware that you are strong but please calm yourself.
I'm also confident in my strength."

"Then try it!"

The clones ran towards Lee Hyunsung while Han Sooyoung rushed towards
the Pink Kids.

"Die perverts!"

"You can't do this!"

"Kyaaack! Help us Hyunsung-ssi!"

Lee Hyunsung triggered Steel Transformation and started to kill Han
Sooyoung's clones with tremendous strength. Han Sooyoung couldn't help
sweating at the enormous damage.

'He truly is the Steel Sword'.

She noticed that the Pink Kids were planning to run away. At this rate, she
would miss this. There was nothing good about leaving them alive when
she had already made a hostile impression.

'I will do it'.

She was forced to use a secret weapon. Han Sooyoung smiled bitterly at
Lee Hyunsung. "Do you want to see a good show?"
The next moment, Han Sooyoung's clones surrounding Lee Hyunsung took
off their clothes. Her white skin was revealed. Lee Hyunsung blushed as he
covered his eyes and collapsed.

"Waaaaahhhhh! What is this?"

Han Sooyoung stepped on Lee Hyunsung's body and flew forward.

"It is a naked woman!"

Han Sooyoung flew through the air and aimed her dagger at the back of the
Pink Kids running away.

"W-What are you…!

Kuaack!"

'Yoon Woochul. 41 years old. Operated a coin farm'.

The other member of Pink Kids screamed as he saw his dying companion.

"Shit! We haven't done anything wrong!"

'Hwang Mingyu. 43 years old. Trafficking and… what was it?'

Her dagger sliced over his neck. The Pink Kids' transformation was
released, revealing hairy legs.

"S-Spare me! Spare me!"

'Bang Takho. 39 years old. The children in the third episode… anyway!"

In an instant, only one of the Pink Kids was left. Han Sooyoung frowned as
she saw the middle-aged person trembling with fear.

'What did this person do?'
Han Sooyoung wondered for a moment and was about to kill the last Pink
Kid when magic power flew from somewhere and blocked her dagger.

Then a clear voice was heard. "You made a mistake."

"…What?"

"You shouldn't kill this person. He is needed for my strategy."

She turned her head and sighed with relief. Han Sooyoung laughed. "You
are late, Kim Dokja."
                  Chapter 154: Ep. 30 - Dark Castle, IV


Han Sooyoung heard my story and muttered in a dumbfounded manner. "…
Did you really become a constellation?"

A person who was an incarnation a few days ago suddenly appeared as a
constellation. Certainly, it was strange. Han Sooyoung hadn't read anything
about an incarnation being reborn as a constellation.

"Yes. I am a constellation."

"Really, seriously?"

"That's right."

Han Sooyoung's eyes were filled with disbelief. "…Is it that easy?"

I wanted to say it wasn't easy but Han Sooyoung didn't listen.
"Shit, will you now be watching us outside the scenario and sponsoring
us?" "Nothing like that. I became a constellation in the course of the
scenario so I have to keep participating in the scenario."

"What's the difference? I can't tell at all."

In fact, I didn't feel it was real either. Borrowing stories, trading with other
constellations and nebulae, changing the attitude of the constellations
towards me…

[Some constellations are jealous of your growth.]

[Some constellations oppose you having a modifier.]

[Some constellations show hostility towards you.]

In any case, the constellations also felt the ugliness of jealousy. Why were
they so harsh towards a growing bud? Still, there was something I could do
now.

[You stare at the other constellations.]

[Some constellations are staring at you with amazement!]

[Some constellations have spat out the coke they are drinking with
surprise!]

[200 coins have been consumed to send an indirect message.]

…As expected, indirect messages cost coins. It was fun but I had to use it in
moderation.

Han Sooyoung was staring at me with an open mouth. "W-Was it you who
just sent the message? The constellation who doesn't yet have a name?"
That was what it looked like to Han Sooyoung.
"Yes."

"Is it because you haven't signed a sponsor contract until now?"

"Yes."

"…Then is it already too late for me?"

"You could say that."

Han Sooyoung frowned and looked up at the air.

[The constellation 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' hesitantly reads her face.]

Han Sooyoung sighed and glanced at me. "Shit… I'm envious. By the way,
why don't you have a modifier?"

"That…"

Why didn't I have a modifier? The correct answer was that I didn't know.

[The Star Stream is looking for a modifier for your constellation.]

Perhaps it was because I haven't accumulated enough stories. A
constellation without a modifier was similar to gaining a citizenship
without having a home.

Han Sooyoung muttered, "You are a vagabond."

"…The fifth story isn't over yet. Maybe I will have a modifier by the time
this story is finalized."

[The fifth story 'Lone Messiah' is currently in progress.]

The fifth story was a story that greatly affected the 'status' of the
constellation. The position of my constellation would depend on how this
story was finalized.
…Maybe.

Then Han Sooyoung booed. "Boo…Kim Dokja, why do you suddenly look
cool? Can you beat Yoo Joonghyuk now?"

Yoo Joonghyuk. I clenched my fist and opened it. Then there was a
message I had never seen before…

[Beware of the 'probability storm' effect.]

[The Star Stream is currently evaluating your level.]

There was a prickly feeling at the tips of my fingers. This was a problem
for constellations. Still, I would be fine as long as the 'evaluation' was in
progress. The Star Stream didn't know the right level of constraints for me
yet.

"I might be able to win against him now."

"…Really?"

The point was the word 'now'. The protagonist was the protagonist for a
reason. I could only match his growth by becoming a constellation. The
perks that Yoo Joonghyuk received were huge.

I ordered her, "Quickly return what I gave you."

"Tsk, I understand."

[The incarnation 'Han Sooyoung' has fulfilled the contract.]

I received all the coins and items I had left with Han Sooyoung. Han
Sooyoung sighed. "…It's too bad. I felt rich for a while."

"I gave you 20,000 coins for the trouble."

"I handed over 600,000 coins but only got 20,000 in return."
"Then you can give back the 20,000 coins."

Han Sooyoung scoffed and turned her back to me. I received my items and
coins from Han Sooyoung.

[Possessed Coins: 684,353 C]

In the meantime, I had collected a lot of money. It wasn't strange since I
made a steady income and saved money. Now that I was a constellation, I
no longer hesitated in using coins. The coins would exert their real strength
from now on.

Then little by little… ah, wait. I forgot an important thing. "Han Sooyoung,
when will you release that? It is sexual harassment."

"Eh? Ah, I forgot."

Han Sooyoung smiled and I approached Lee Hyunsung who was sitting on
the floor holding his head in his hands. Han Sooyoung's clones were still
dancing naked around Lee Hyunsung.

[The character 'Lee Hyunsung' is shaking with fear.]

…

「 The Steel Sword is weak to women. 」

There was such a sentence in Ways of Survival but I hadn't thought it was
so severe. Besides that…

"…It isn't real."

Han Sooyoung's clones looked naked but they didn't have the important
parts. In other words, Lee Hyunsung had become like this because he saw
mannequins.
Han Sooyoung noticed the meaning of my words and laughed
mischievously. "Hrmm…what does that mean? You are sorry because you
didn't get to see them?"

"I told you. I don't like a poor body like yours.

"…You haven't even seen it."

"Do i need to see it?"

I approached Lee Hyunsung and patted him on the back. "Hyunsung-ssi, are
you okay?"

"D-Dokja-ssi."

He looked stupid but he wasn't crazy. Lee Hyunsung looked at me like he
had seen a ghost. "Why is Dokja-ssi…you are… dead?"

I think he got a real trauma. I looked at Han Sooyoung with annoyance. It
was a comic-like situation but it would've been a serious blow for the Steel
Sword. If I did something wrong this round, Lee Hyunsung's fate might
diverge in an unknown direction…

For the moment, I had to rely on time for him to recover. Then another
voice was heard from the side. "Excuse me…"

"…?"

"Can I go?"

The last member of Pink Kids entered my eyes. She had a pretty face and
slender body. She had fine eyebrows and tender cheeks. Who would believe
this was a man in his 40s?

"What is your name?" I asked and a pretty voice answered.

"S-Seo Inna."
"That's not his real name."

Seo Inna hesitated before speaking his true name. "…I am Kim Yongpal."

Pink Kids, Kim Yongpal. I found the right person.

Han Sooyoung clicked her tongue. "…Why are you keeping him alive.
Aren't the Pink Kids scum?"

"Not yet. They 'will become' bad guys. If you read it correctly, you should
know that the Pink Kids was originally a trio."

"But there are four… eh?"

I explained, "This uncle died before they became really active."

"…Is that why I couldn't remember him?"

"Kim Yongpal is basically a pure person. Thus, he was the first to die in
Pink Kids."

Kim Yongpal interrupted. "Excuse me, what are you talking about…?"

"Shut up."

Han Sooyoung frowned at him. "This is a pure person?"

"Yes."

I also couldn't believe it but it was a setting in Ways of Survival.

[A constellations who likes to change sex is nodding.]

[A constellation who likes to change sex claims there are no bad people
among those who like to change sex.]
In fact, Kim Yongpal survived to this day without killing anyone, even in
the first scenario.

I could come up with the 'insect killing' method in the first scenario because
there was a precedent where Kim Yongpal stepped on an ant by mistake
and survived. Of course, Kim Yongpal didn't know why he had survived.

He was a person who 'fortunately' survived. This was Kim Yongpal of Pink
Kids. No, I should call it Pink Kid now that his companions were dead.

Han Sooyoung muttered like she didn't want to admit it. "Damn…so what?
In any case, you saved him because there is a use for him?"

"Yes."

"Then now what?"

"We have to break the scenario again."

"Do you know what this scenario is?"

Of course I knew. I knew it very well.

"It is the last scenario before the liberation of Seoul Dome."

The ninth scenario, Dark Castle. In this scenario, beings that had never
appeared before emerged.

I watched Lee Hyunsung, who was still trembling with fear, the
unconscious Lee Jihye and Shin Yoosung who was caring for the injured
Lee Gilyoung.

Maybe my other companions were alive somewhere. There was Jung
Heewon so they wouldn't be defeated so easily on the first floor.

"The first floor is just a joke. The real hell is the second floor."
A special window in the castle showed the outside landscape. Crowds were
moving around Seoul. Unfortunately, in the aftermath of the 'greatest
sacrifice' and the ensuing struggle, half of Seoul had become demon
servants.

The incarnations of Seoul were shouting sorrowfully. Despair already
covered Seoul but the 'story' was still lacking. The story was always
lacking.

The dokkaebis were seeking larger frustration. The constellations were
yearning for more provocative story.

Han Sooyoung stared out the window and spoke. "It is a cliche imagination.
Regressors, returnees, reincarnators. Now there are demons?"

"A person who plagiarized is saying this…"

"Hey, I told you a couple of times…"

I was joking as usual when I suddenly became curious. "Han Sooyoung."

"What is it?"

"If you are the writer of Ways of Survival…"

"I didn't write that garbage."

"Let's just assume."

The grumpy Han Sooyoung bit her lips. "…If I am the writer?"

"If you are the writer of Ways of Survival, why did you make this world?"

"How should I know?"

"You are also writer."
"How can a first-rate writer like me know the thoughts of a third-rate
writer?"

…I was an idiot for asking her. Han Sooyoung continued speaking. "I
should be the one asking you that."

"…What?"

I met Han Sooyoung's deep eyes. I couldn't read Han Sooyoung even if I
used Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint. Still, I seemed to understand a bit. A
person who read the story might have similar thoughts.

'You know the end of this world. Isn't that right?'

Han Sooyoung was obviously asking this. As always, I didn't answer.

Han Sooyoung stared out the window like she knew she wouldn't receive
an answer. Then she asked another question. "…Why do the scenarios
exist?" I stared out the window.

The dark sky above the destroyed Seoul could be seen. Was it because I had
become a constellation? The sky wasn't the same as before.

Countless constellations were embroidered in the sky. The Star Stream was
embracing the constellations. They were stars that could never be reached
despite being so close.

Even with so many stars shining…

There was the distant abyss that couldn't be erased. I felt like I had
discovered something.

What were the constellations always enduring? Why were they so obsessed
with the story?
I shook off this distant emotion and opened my mouth. "Perhaps the
scenario…"
                Chapter 155: Ep. 30 - Dark Castle, V


This was a question that countless beings of Star Stream had been asked
over many years.

'Why the hell does the scenario exist?'

The answers to this question were different. For example, the returnee
Kyrgios Rodgraim said: Without it, the universe would be too lonely.

The constellation 'Queen of the Darkest Spring' replied to the same
question: Are you asking me why 'food' exists?

The demon king Asmodeus' reply to the same question was as followed: It
is a small destruction to prevent greater destruction.

The answers might be romantic or philosophical to people who heard it.
However, 'romantic' and 'philosophical' were only luxuries for those who
were full in the first place.
Therefore, to the demon earl 'Tentacio' on the second floor of Dark Castle,
the scenario meant the following:

"It is fucked up."

This was his way of speaking, although technically, they weren't his own
words. Anyone who entered this space would say this after 50 years. Of
course, if they managed to survive 50 years.

"I'm tired."

The river running through the Abyss Plains was a tributary of the Demon
Realm's River, Phoenix. One might ask how there was such a huge plains
on the second floor of Dark Castle but naturally Tentacio was different.

There were only two things he knew. First, he had to reach the top of the
vast plains and second, he hadn't managed to do it in 194 years. 'Dammit, if
it wasn't for that dokkaebi's offer at the time…' The memories from 194
years ago were still vivid.

–Do you want to become the 73rd demon king?

Demon king. It was the long-cherished dream of all demons.

–…Can I become the demon king?

He had asked.

He was a third-grade demon and still far from rising to that status. It was
hard to climb up, no matter how many low-grade demons he ate. During
that period, Tentacio was tempted by a being more demonic than a great
demon.

–You are lacking a 'story', not strength.
–What does that mean?

–You will find out if you participate in the scenario.

Thus, Tentacio was put into the Dark Castle scenario. He tore down many
demons and slaughtered the races that came up from the first floor of Dark
Castle.

After 194 years, Tentacio had become one of the ten strongest demons on
the 'Dark Castle second floor'.

However, that was as far as he got.

'I can't go up to the third floor'.

The Dark Castle's third floor. This was where the essence of a demon king
was sleeping. In order to get there, he had to beat the strongest beings on
the second floor.

However, accumulating strength and coins wasn't enough. The best beings
on the second floor weren't the strongest simply because of strength. The
thing Tentacio was lacking…

[The constellation 'Slumbering Lady of Fine Brocade' wants to talk to you
alone.]

[The constellation 'Slumbering Lady of Fine Brocade' is curious about your
setting.]

'Setting? Fucking bastards. I know what I'm made of'.

He didn't like constellations but it was pleasant to see a constellation
wondering about him.

The constellation wondering about him meant new people were coming
from the first floor of Dark Castle. It meant the enjoyable game would start
from now on.
A group of men and women appeared. Tentacio smiled at the sight.
"Welcome, you bugs. This is the second floor of Dark Castle."

Tentacio enjoyed speaking the lines of an ambassador like it was a habit.
As expected, some of the bugs came forward and asked him,

"What is this place? Who are you? A guide?"

"…Are you perhaps a dokkaebi?"

Dokkaebi. They were existences that Tentacio hated the most. Still, he
endured it and opened his mouth. There would be a time of sweet rewards
after the patience.

"The second floor of Dark Castle is a world of survival of the fittest. Only
those who have their strength acknowledged can move to the next floor.
Isn't it a simple rule? Raise your hands if you need further explanations."

"What does it mean to have your strength acknowledged? How do we…"

"By doing this."

Tentacio's arm stretched out and the head of the speaking man
literally exploded. The bugs had frightened expressions. This was
Tentacio's favourite moment. "W-What?"

"Shit! It is a trap!"

Tentacio laughed and licked the blood that splattered from the man's neck.

"Protect the queen!"

All the incarnations rushed towards him but Tentacio didn't mind. A strong
energy rose from his body.
The demon nobility titles were, in descending order of rank: duke, marquis,
earl, viscount and baron. The viscounts and barons were fairly common,
and the real difference in power started with the earl grade.

Demons from the earl grade had a 'story'. A story, it only opened when
specific situations occurred.

[The story 'Bug Slaughter' has begun.]

"Kuaaaaak!"

Every time his hands moved, the humans died like bugs. This story was
obtained by slaughtering hundreds of thousands of players in 194 years. It
showed overwhelming power against those who were lower than him.

[The constellation 'Slumbering Lady of Fine Brocade' is surprised.]

"Mwahahaha!"

The surrounding incarnations quickly became corpses or were wounded.

'It is too dull'.

Some incarnations seemed useful but more of them were garbage. At most,
they could be transformed into fifth-grade demons. Then Tentacio's gaze
stopped on someone.

"Hoh, you will be fourth grade."

Tentacio grabbed the neck of a woman and lifted her up. The hair of the
woman scattered. A broken crown rolled around. She was the King of
Beauty, Min Jiwon.

Tentacio opened his mouth. "You must be the leader of these guys."

He liked her strong gaze. This woman's story must be quite delicious.
"I will ask you two things. Where do you come from?"

"T-Telling you something like that…"

"I've seen many bugs like you."

Tentacio made a cruel smile and trampled on one of the Hwarang. Min
Jiwon paled as she looked at the broken skull and brain matter.

"W-Wait a minute!"

Peeeok! Peeeok!

"Stop! Earth… we are from Earth!"

Tentacio laughed. "Earth?"

Tentacio remembered it as a planet full of rich stories.

'The demon kings. Earth is like a cradle for stories like that'.

There was a lot of prey in a place abundant with stories. Tentacio licked his
lips.

"Bug. Who has the most stories among you?"

"U-Uhh… stories? What is that…?"

As expected, she didn't understand him.

"Who is the strongest among you?"

Min Jiwon shook as Tentacio's yellow eyes gazed greedily at her.
"Ah, then what is the scenario?"

"…I just told you."

"How can I understand those symbolic words?"

I moved with Han Sooyoung towards the altar for the second floor. We
encountered a few demons on the way. Needless to say, our progress was
smooth. It was because I used the 'status of a constellation' whenever I saw
a demon.

[Kiiii…!]

The dark trackers who encountered my eyes screamed and trembled. I
might not be a narrative or historical-grade level but once I became a
constellation, my presence itself was different.

In other words, I could exercise considerable influence over those lower
than me with just a glance or remark.

[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' is disappointed in the
too easy progress.]

[The constellation 'Scribe of Heaven' says you need greater adversity.]

They would get frustrated when it was difficult, or get bored when it was
easy… I didn't know which one to cater to.

Shouldn't there be days like this sometimes? It was the first time a scenario
was 'easy'…

I was collecting the demon proofs one by one when a familiar voice was
heard in the air.

[…Kim Dokja. Don't you look good? Did you open the Dokkaebi Bag
alone?]
I could tell straight away who was speaking. I grunted and sent back a
message.

–Who was the one who suddenly disappeared?

It was an intermediate dokkaebi.

[Who has a big head now? I couldn't come because I was busy! In any case,
it is late but congratulations. A new constellation emerged from my
channel. It is very emotional.]

–Is the channel running well?

[Yes. I thought the 'incarnation seekers' would leave after you became a
constellation but… it actually became better. Everyone has come to watch
the castle scenario so it is hectic right now. We might have to expand the
channel soon.]

…That much? Indeed, it was rare for an incarnation to become a
constellation during the scenario.

[However, there are some who dislike you. You should be careful.
Honestly, you are a constellation but your 'status' isn't completely
established.]

It was as Bihyung said. I was a constellation but my stigma hadn't woken
up yet. In other words, I was currently more like a half-constellation.

[I heard you are stronger than Yoo Joonghyuk but honestly…] –

I'm stronger.

[Oh… Kim Dokja. Isn't this different from your usual reaction? Do you feel
a sense of rivalry?]

–I'm a constellation. He is an incarnation. It is natural for me to be stronger.
[Hrmm… is it really like that?]

–What are you trying to say? Did you come for a fight?

[Ah, I think the child will be born soon. I need a story to feed her. You
are her father and should play the role of a parent…] –I understand. I'll
get it for you.

[Brat, I like you because you understand quickly. Then I'm counting on
you.]

It was almost time for the 41st regression Shin Yoosung to wake up. I
looked back and saw the party members collecting demon proofs from the
bodies of the demons.

"Does everyone have enough proofs?"

Shin Yoosung carefully raised her hand. "I am still lacking… Gilyoung
also…"

"…Ah, I can help." She seemed like she would be annoyed but surprisingly,
Han Sooyoung took good care of Shin Yoosung.

Lee Hyunsung was carrying Lee Gilyoung on his back and spoke to me.
"DDokja-ssi."

"Yes."

"Can I ask you something?"

"…What is it?"

Lee Hyunsung had barely escaped from Han Sooyoung's nightmare and he
still seemed unable to believe I had survived. Sometimes he would grab my
arm or my head. Lee Hyunsung touched my head and then opened his
mouth.
"In the past, I lost an empty cartridge in the army."

"…That must be a big problem. Did you find it again?"

"I found it."

"You must've been in trouble. Why are you saying this…?"

"It was found out of the blue one month later." Despite my confused
expression, Lee Hyunsung still looked serious. "From then on, I kept the
empty shell in my pocket."

"…Isn't that a violation of military rule?"

"That's right."

I was amazed that he nodded so casually. I nodded curiously. "I see. But
why all of a sudden…"

"No, I was suddenly reminded of the past."

I looked at him and didn't know why he was saying this. Surely he didn't
mean to cut off my head and put it in his pocket… In any case, it meant he
was glad I was alive.

We soon reached the altar that would lead to the second floor. We had
enough demon proofs, so the only thing left was to place them on the altar
and wait. At this time, Han Sooyoung asked, "Is that ahjussi coming with
us?"

I turned and saw she was pointing at the Pink Kid Kim Yongpal.

I nodded and ordered, "Kim Yongpal-ssi. Lead the way."

"Huh?"

Kim Yongpal freaked out while Han Sooyoung's eyes narrowed.
"What is that ahjussi for?"

"Have you forgotten? The last gateway to the second floor…"

Those who collected the demon proofs on the first floor could only go up
the next floor if they hunted the 'demon' summoned after placing the proofs
on the altar. However, the demon summoned from the second floor was
based on the level of the weakest person in the party.

Han Sooyoung nodded like she understood. "Aha, that's why you're putting
the weakest person in the lead?"

"Exactly."

"…Kim Dokja is the best at being shameless."

"It isn't being shameless but strategic."

[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' is amazed at your
awkwardness.]

[The constellation 'Bald General of Justice' wants you to show the dignity
of a constellation!]

…What was dignity of a constellation? I didn't make it through difficult
scenarios by focusing on my dignity. I was a constellation but sometimes I
needed to play it smart.

Han Sooyoung said, "Then this gateway will be easily passed."

"As long as nothing happens."

"What can happen?"

"Sometimes a demon will be summoned regardless of our level."

I placed the demon proofs on the altar as I said this.
[The Demon Proofs have been placed.]

[A demon appropriate to test you will be summoned!]

There was a blinding light from the altar and the demon started to be
summoned.

A colourful spotlight shone. If my prediction was correct, someone on the
level of Kim Yongpal would come out. Maybe it was Demon Baron Viller,
the weakest of the demon nobles on the second floor. I would be able to
suppress him without even using the power of a constellation…

[The demon who wants you is on the second floor!]

…Eh?

[A demon unrelated to your level will be summoned!]

Han Sooyoung stiffened as she heard the messages. "Shit… what is this? Is
this what you were talking about?"

[Demon Earl 'Tentacio' has descended!]

…Earl?

Majestic horns rose over the shoulders. The demon who appeared in the
colourful spotlight was a powerful existence whom Viller couldn't compare
to.

A cruel smile was on his face as he opened his mouth. "…I see. Are you
Yoo Joonghyuk?"
               Chapter 156: Ep. 30 - Dark Castle, VI


"Yoo Joonghyuk?"

What was going on?

The strongest beings on the second floor of Dark Castle, sometimes they
would descend as a test. This had happened in Ways of Survival. However,
a demon earl had never appeared in cases where Pink Kid Kim Yongpal
was part of the group. Besides that, why was the demon looking for Yoo
Joonghyuk after being summoned?

I didn't answer and the demon breathed in before looking at Lee Hyunsung.
"Are you Yoo Joonghyuk?"

"…I am Lee Hyunsung."

"Then who is the person called Yoo Joonghyuk?"
I opened my mouth. There was nothing good about stimulating the demon
earl here. "Why do you want to find him? He isn't here so go back."

The demon earl Tentacio laughed at my words. "A bug is talking back to
me. It's strange. I heard that the person who is Seoul's strongest person is
here?" Seoul's strongest?

"Uh… that sounds like me."

The party members all looked at me at the same time. Why were they
looking at me like that? It was true.

Tentacio also stared at me. "You said that you're not Yoo Joonghyuk."

"The strongest in Seoul isn't Yoo Joonghyuk. It is me."

What the hell was going on? Why was he looking for the strongest in
Seoul?

[The constellation 'Slumbering Lady of Fine Brocade' is sorry towards
you.]

[The constellation 'Slumbering Lady of Fine Brocade' is asking you to
defeat this demon.]

…Slumbering Lady of Fine Brocade? I wondered reflexively. Suddenly, I
got a sense of what was going on.

[You are staring at the constellations of Silla.]

[Constellations of Silla are embarrassed.]

Yes, this was right. These bastards… they sold me to save their
descendants?
[The constellation 'Slumbering Lady of Fine Brocade' shows what
happened.]

The memory of Slumbering Lady of Fine Brocade appeared in my head.
The injured Min Jiwon stuttered as she opened her mouth.

–Seoul's strongest… is Yoo Joonghyuk.

[The constellation 'Slumbering Lady of Fine Brocade' is giving you a
pathetic look.]

The act of showing one's memories required paying some probability and a
significant amount of coins. The fact that she showed me her memory
without hesitation meant the situation was urgent.

Damn, then send him to Yoo Joonghyuk. Why send him to me? Was I
easy? I sighed lightly and spoke towards the air. "Then what will you do for
me if I help?"

[The constellation 'Slumbering Lady of Fine Brocade' says she will pay
coins.]

"How much? Will you give me 2,000 coins again?"

[The constellation 'Slumbering Lady of Fine Brocade' is embarrassed.]

"Give me something else. Something helpful."

[Constellations of Silla have their pride damaged and are angry at
'Slumbering Lady of Fine Brocade'.]

[The constellation 'Slumbering Lady of Fine Brocade' says she will pay a
story.]

A story?
[A new bounty scenario has arrived!]


  [Bounty Scenario - Fight Against the Demon]

  Category: Sub

  Difficulty level: A+

  Clear Conditions: Defeat the demon earl 'Tentacio'.

  Time Limit: ―


  Compensation: The trust of the constellations of Silla, one historical-
  grade story.

  Failure: ―




A historical-grade story. It was fairly decent.

In fact, I was already going to kill the demon earl without any conditions.
The constellations of Silla weren't as powerful as a nebula but there was
nothing bad about them owing me a debt. I had to defeat this demon
anyway.

The demon earl was tired of waiting and growled out, "Why are you
speaking to yourself? Then you're not Yoo Joonghyuk?"

A powerful airflow was released from Tentacio's body and Lee Hyunsung
quickly stepped forward.

"Dokja-ssi, I'll take care of him."
"Hyunsung-ssi, you can't do it alone…"

"I will never lose the empty cartridge again."

Han Sooyoung whistled like it was interesting. Tentacio made a
complicated expression and grinned. "You don't know who your opponent
is. I like trampling on people like you."

"You don't know who I am?"

The earth shook and Lee Hyunsung ran forward as he activated Steel
Transformation. Lee Hyunsung's shoulders became covered with steel as he
struck Tentacio's shoulder horns. Lee Hyunsung had the courage to face the
demon earl without backing off.

"You are someone who inherited a story?" Tentacio wondered.

Lee Hyunsung's Steel Transformation was a stigma obtained by inheriting a
story from Master of Steel. With one exchange, the demon noticed the
value of Lee Hyunsung. He was an earl and knew the value of a 'story'.

"I'll eat it."

Tentacio embraced Lee Hyunsung's body. Lee Hyunsung continuously
struck him with fists but Tentacio wasn't fazed. Fangs emerged from the
demon's mouth and he bit Lee Hyunsung's shoulder.

The strength of Steel Transformation was directly connected with Lee
Hyunsung's will. Unless his will was broken, Lee Hyunsung's steel wouldn't
be destroyed.

Of course, this was written in Ways of Survival. However, it was only Lee
Hyunsung of the second half who fit such a wonderful description.

Cracks started to appear in Lee Hyunsung's hard steel. Lee Hyunsung's
expression started to pale.
"…What the hell is this?" Han Sooyoung's eyes shook as she watched
Tentacio. "Kim Dokja! What is that?"

I didn't think the Seoul rankings announced by the dokkaebi were wrong.
Apart from me, Han Sooyoung was the only one who knew the exact level
of the demon earl.

I replied. "He is a 3rd grade demon."

Demon species above the 3rd grade had their own story.

[The 3rd grade demon 'Tentacio' is telling the story of Bug Slaughter.]

Bug Slaughter. It was a pretty useful narrative. It wasn't in the form of a
stigma yet but its power exceeded the stigmas of incarnations since this was
his own story.

As Tentacio's story started to be released, all the incarnations, including Lee
Hyunsung and Han Sooyoung, stood in place like hardened bugs. Lee Jihye
and Lee Gilyoung who was still unconscious, twisted in pain while Kim
Yongpal had already collapsed while foaming at the mouth.

This was the real power of the 'story'. It was to swallow other beings into
the 'story'. The frozen incarnations were waiting for their master's
command.

"It is the time of slaughter, Bugs."

Lee Hyunsung's steel shattered helplessly and Han Sooyoung's clones
exploded. It was a complete wipe out. The story 'Bug Slaughter' showed
overwhelming power against many weak people. The earls of the second
floor were beyond measure.

I held Lee Hyunsung's shoulder as he was thrown back. Lee Hyunsung was
released from the fear at my touch and he stuttered.
"D-Dokja-ssi."

"Move back."

"It isn't possible. If I don't protect Dokja-ssi this time―"

"A cartridge doesn't disappear so easily. Watch me." I patted Lee
Hyunsung's shoulder and walked forward.

Tentacio laughed amusedly. "You can resist my story? You are someone
with moderately strong mental power.

"Mental power isn't the problem."

"Then what? Kneel, Bug."

The pressure around us suddenly rose and people fell to their knees. Of
course, I was fine. Tentacio was confused as he watched me walking
casually. It was thanks to Fourth Wall. There was also a more fundamental
difference.

"…Answer me. How can you move?"

"In order to get that story, you have to pick at least 100,000 people with
weak stories and kill them. You're quite a nasty bastard."

"What?"

This was the difference in 'status'.

"Still, Bug Slaughter is a fairly usable story. At least, when the enemy is
weaker than you."

[You aren't interested in the 'Bug Slaughter' story.]

[The effect of 'Bug Slaughter' is negated by you.]
Tentacio's eyes widened. "at least a marquis-grade… perhaps a demon
king? No, that isn't likely… are you a returnee?" The peak of the demon
species, the 72 demon kings were equivalent to narrative-grade
constellations. "But a returnee can't be on the first floor of Dark Castle…"

"That's right. Both are wrong."

An existence with their 'status' revealed was constrained by probability.

[You are looking at the demon earl 'Tentacio'.]

Tentacio turned pale. I didn't delay and rushed towards Tentacio while
using Purest Sword Force.

[Blade of Faith has been activated!]

[The special option of Unbroken Faith is activated.]

[The ether attribute is converted to 'divine'.]

The new texture of Unbroken Faith was unfamiliar to me.

"Kuaack!" The demon screamed painfully as the ends of his horns were cut
off. The second strike flew towards Tentacio before he could move.

It wasn't just that the earl's story wasn't effective on me. My movements
themselves were different from ordinary incarnations. The demon gritted
his teeth.

"A constellation? No way… this is impossible!"

I wondered if I should borrow Messiah's Path again but I didn't need to use
the 'quotation' against Bug Slaughter. There was a limit to the number of
'quotations' and I also needed to check my abilities without a story.

First, I needed to adjust my stats. Let's see.
[Physique Lv. 62 -> Physique Lv. 90]

[Strength Lv. 60 -> Strength Lv. 90]

[Agility Lv. 60 -> Agility Lv. 90]

[Magic Power Lv. 62 -> Magic Power Lv. 90]

[All stats have increased significantly. [A total

of 116,400 coins have been consumed.] It was

huge spending but it was worth it.

[Your body is moving towards the limits of a human.]

[A formidable energy has filled your body!]

[All stats have reached the scenario limit!]

My heart beat faster as if I had received a caffeine transfusion. The
adrenaline level in my body increased sharply and my body became as light
as a feather.

My stats had an average level of 90. There was probably no one among the
incarnations who had my stats. This was the only thing I could do as a
constellation.

"Then let's go."

I relentlessly swung my sword. Tentacio's body was torn by the blade.
Tentacio didn't fall easily despite my stats suddenly rising. He seemed to be
strengthening his body using his remaining magic power. It was a wise
choice because the story didn't work.

"Kuaaaaaaah!"
Tentacio let out a terrible scream. As the battle continued, one or two
injuries appeared on my body. As expected, I couldn't fight him without
any skills.

Then this would work.

[The special skill 'Miniaturization Lv. 3' is activated!]

[The effect of Miniaturization has decreased the size of your body.]

"What?"

[The exclusive skill 'Bookmark' is activated!]

"I will choose the fifth bookmark, Kyrgios Rodgraim."

[It is confirmed that your body composition is similar to the corresponding
character.]

[The status of the character is higher than you.]

[The level of the skill is being forcibly adjusted.]

Normally the messages would end here. However, one more line popped
up.

[Your status has risen and synchronization with the person will increase.]
            Chapter 157: Ep. 31 - Tomb of the Scenario, I


The white storm energy caused my heart to pound and my body changed
into an engine.

[The exclusive skill 'Electrification' Lv. 11 (+1) has been activated.]

Due to the increase in my status, the skill level reached 11.

In essence, all skill levels were restricted to level 10. After that, people had
to learn better skills or use 'transcendence' like the returnees. Yet this skill
was level 11.

Now my Electrification had exceeded the limits of the system. It wasn't as
hard to use Electrification as usual.

The returnee Kyrgios had a strength comparable to a powerful
narrativegrade constellation. He was a strong figure whose depth couldn't
be measured. Now I could get a glimpse of how much strength Kyrgios
had. If Kyrgios had reached a realm that could never be reached, I got a
glimpse of where he had gone.

Tentacio was terrified beyond his surprise. "A constellation with a
returnee's ability? What on earth are you?"

I wanted to say my name but then my grumpiness got to me. "…What? I
am Yoo Joonghyuk."

Tentacio's body was torn in two by the explosive power of Electrification
and the Blade of Faith.

The electric current around the sword blew off his arms and legs before his
head rolled across the ground. He couldn't even scream. My level 90 magic
power was instantly exhausted and fatigue pulled in. Still, I have clearly
won.

"Uh… Yoo Joonghyuk…" Shit, I was scared to death. The fallen head was
talking. "Incarnation… do you know… what it means… to be a
constellation?"

What the hell was he saying now?

"You will regret… giving me… your name."

"What?"

[Demon Earl Tentacio has used 'Death Scream.]

[Demon Earl Tentacio has spread the name 'Yoo Joonghyuk' through Dark
Castle.]

[The Dark Castle rankers will remember the name 'Yoo Joonghyuk'.]

…I hadn't expected this.
[The Dark Castle rankers are baring their teeth towards the incarnation 'Yoo
Joonghyuk'.]

I felt a bit sorry. I really hadn't intended for this to happen. However, Yoo
Joonghyuk should also suffer a bit.

[You have hunted 'Demon Earl Tentacio'!]

[A 3rd grade demon has been killed for the fifth time and 30,000 coins have
been acquired.]

Transparent strings started to appear around Tentacio's corpse. From the
Dark Castle scenario onwards, we could kill those who had stories and
take them away. I stretched out my hand and grabbed the string. [The
historical-grade story 'Bug Slaughter' has been acquired.] [Bug Slaughter].

This story would be enough to hatch the 41st regression Shin Yoosung.

…By the way, could I feed her the story of a demon? Would her mentality
get worse if I fed it to her?

[You have completed the bounty scenario!]

[The constellation 'Slumbering Lady of Fine Brocade' feels deep
appreciation towards you.]

[You are now able to receive the protection of the Silla constellations.]

The protection of the Silla constellations. They might seem insignificant but
they were also 'constellations'. If I built up a relationship with them, there
would surely be a day when they could help me, just like the Absolute
Throne situation.
[The historical-grade story 'Silla Allied Forces' has been received.]

…Silla Allied Forces?

[The constellation 'Slumbering Lady of Fine Brocade' is laughing heartily.]

Well, she said she would give me a historical-grade story, not that it would
be a good one. It didn't matter since I could feed it to Shin Yoosung.

My party members recovered their spirits and approached me.

"Shit, Kim Dokja is crazy…"

"Dokja-ssi, how strong are you?"

I grinned at them. Lee Hyunsung looked down at his shoulders that had
been bitten by Tentacio. "…Are there many enemies like him on the second
floor?"

"There are some but it is uncommon. This guy's ranking is probably…"

A message finally popped up in the air.

[50,000 coins have been acquired as a main scenario reward!]

[The main scenario content has been updated!]

[You have won a place in Dark Castle.]

[You have hunted the 10th place demon on the Dark Castle Rankings,
Tentacio.]

[Ranking will be in proportion to the hunting contribution.]

"…10th place. There are at least nine existences stronger than this guy.
There are more similar guys."
"Ah…" Lee Hyunsung's expression was complicated. He was relieved that
the demon earl was in the top 10 but at the same time, he was discouraged.
"Dokja-ssi is strong enough to fight these guys."

"Hyunsung-ssi can do it if you follow your story. I also can't guarantee that
I can hunt demons higher ranked than him."

In my current state, I could deal with an earl-grade demon without opening
a story. It wouldn't have been as easy if Bug Slaughter wasn't his story.

Han Sooyoung's pride also seemed hurt. "Sheesh, pretending to be modest.
Aren't you deceiving people?"

"You might've done it if you had fought with all your power. Didn't the
Abyssal Black Flame Dragon hand you a story?"

"I haven't succeeded them yet because the contents of the story are crazy.
Why didn't you warn me when I said I would choose him? Were you
fucking with me?"

'The Abyssal Black Flame Dragon's story was…'

I couldn't remember well but considering the fact that the original
contractor was Delusional Demon Kim Namwoon, Han Sooyoung's
reaction was understandable. It would be a shameful story that would
annihilate the soul just by inheriting it.

[The Dark Castle Rankings in proportion to the hunting contribution will be
announced!]

Finally, the rankings were determined. A ranking number was sent to the
status window in front of all of us.

[The incarnation Kim Dokja's ranking in Dark Castle is 11th place.]
11th place. It wasn't bad. The rest of my party members had terrible
expressions, as if they were receiving their CSAT scores.

Han Sooyoung quickly ran to my side and glanced at my ranking window.

"Hey, you are quite high…" Han Sooyoung's expression hardened when she
saw the number '11'.

There was a big difference in contribution. Han Sooyoung and the others
were probably in the hundreds. She wondered, "Will I be 11th place if I kill
you now?"

"Do you think you can win?"

"I don't know. In any case, I am better than that ahjussi."

Han Sooyoung pointed out he passed out Kim Yongpal.

[The incarnation Kim Yongpal's ranking in Dark Castle is number

101,123.] The 102,123th ranked Kim Yongpal slept without knowing the

world.

Lee Jihye and Lee Gilyoung, who had been unconscious since the
beginning, received the ranks of 98,761 and 87,541 respectively. This was
strange. Why was this ahjussi's rank lower than people who had been
unconscious from the beginning.

"What about Lee Hyunsung-ssi?"

"636th place."

Lee Hyunsung's voice was gloomy. I hesitated to speak words of comfort
but Lee Hyunsung opened his mouth first. "…It's fine. I received many
reports like this during my school days. I'm somehow more motivated."
It seemed there was no need for me to worry. Lee Hyunsung was the type
to become more devoted if he had a specific goal.

Shin Yoosung, who was standing beside me, shook when my eyes met hers.
"D-Don't look!"

She was like an elementary school student hiding a report card from her
parents. I was a bit worried about this child.

"It doesn't matter what ranking you are right now. There will be many
chances to rise up after going to the second floor. It depends on how hard
Yoosung works."

…Damn, I shouldn't say such lame things. Not everything would work out
if you tried hard.

Still, Shin Yoosung seemed to sincerely accept my advice. "…Can I
become strong enough ahjussi?"

"Of course. You're stronger than me."

I spoke sincerely. In fact, Shin Yoosung had more potential than anyone
else here.

[Your stigma is about to blossom.]

[Screening the story of your stigma.]

Shin Yoosung would grow explosively once she received a stigma. No,
even without a stigma, Shin Yoosung was essential for the second floor of
Dark Castle. It was a stage where the children could be active.

"However, I don't know why this ranking was suddenly given. If it merely
for a competition… perhaps the person who reaches the top will receive a
medal."
It was Lee Hyunsung who spoke. His words weren't wrong. I'm sure this
was the purpose. There was an even more fundamental reason for the Dark
Castle Rankings.

The moment I opened my mouth.

[The demon king 'Asmodeus' is interested in your presence.]

[The demon king 'Astaroth' is watching you.]

[The demon king 'Orobas' is hungry for your story.]

It wasn't just me. The other party members also received the message. The
messages were much more disturbing than those sent by the constellations.
The messages alone caused everyone to shake.

In particular, Han Sooyoung was completely frightened since she
previously received the curse of the demon king.

A demon king. Among them, a few had a 'status' that could compare to the
constellation. At the end of this scenario, we would fight a demon king.




"Kuaaaack!"

The blade curved in a beautiful manner and cut off the head of a demon
species.

'…He was one without a story'.

Yoo Joonghyuk had climbed up to the second floor and launched his
fullscale plan to raise his ranking. As always, plans for the future were
crammed in his head like training routines.
'In order to get to the third floor, I need to seek the four heavenly kings'.

'The top rankers should be in the same section'.

'One of the 10 Evils is on the second floor. It is better not to bump into
him'.

'If I keep collecting stories like this, perhaps in four days…'

Then a message appeared in the air.

[Someone has spread your name with 'Death Scream'.

[The Dark Castle rankers will remember your name.]

[The Dark Castle rankers are watching for you.]

[The Dark Castle rankers will aim for your story.]

Yoo Joonghyuk frowned at the message.

'My name was suddenly spoken?'

It was strange.


'Death Scream is a demon curse. I haven't killed one yet who used that
ability'.

Yoo Mia's cheeks puffed up from beside him and she asked, "What is it
Oppa?"

"It's nothing." Yoo Joonghyuk hesitated for a moment before adding, "…It
seems that guy is doing something bothersome again."

"That guy?"

"There is such a person."
Yoo Mia watched her brother, who had spoken in a cold voice. There was a
nuance different from usual in his voice. It was a small change, like a grain
of rice, but Yoo Mia was able to perceive the change. It was because Yoo
Joonghyuk was her hyung.

"Are you referring to that ugly ahjussi?"

"…"

"Oppa looks happy when talking about that ahjussi."

Yoo Joonghyuk was embarrassed when he saw his smiling sister and he
replied sharply. "You are mistaken."

"Is that so?"

Yoo Mia laughed at Yoo Joonghyuk. Yoo Joonghyuk scowled and wanted
to say something to her.

The next moment, a bloody aura rose from Yoo Joonghyuk's body. Yoo
Mia thought he was really angry but Yoo Joonghyuk opened his mouth
first. "Stop eavesdropping and come out. Otherwise I will kill you."

One part of the air seemed rigid and a heavenly doll appeared from a crack
in the air. It was a woman wearing a cloak.

"I'm sorry. It wasn't on purpose."

"Who are you?"

"It's me, Yoo Joonghyuk."

The cloak was removed, revealing a surprising figure. Yoo Joonghyuk
knew this face. Not long ago, he had rescued her.

"…Yoo Sangah?"
It was Yoo Sangah, who was the incarnation of the nebula Olympus.
          Chapter 158: Ep. 31 - Tomb of the Scenario, II


He hadn't met Yoo Sangah in a week and she seemed more haggard than
before. However, her eyes were more dazzling than usual.

"It seems you have inherited a pretty good story."

Yoo Joonghyuk slowly pulled out the Splitting the Sky Sword. The second
floor of Dark Castle was a suitable stage for taking away the stories of
others. Yoo Sangah's story would be well worth it.

'This woman also wasn't there in my previous regressions'.

He saved her last time because of circumstances but he couldn't leave an
element of insecurity alone forever. One element in Kim Dokja was
enough. Yoo Sangah raised her hands and stepped back. "I didn't come to
fight."

"Then why did you come?"
"I need your help."

"I told you not to get involved with me anymore. I rescued you at that time
to repay my debt to Kim Dokja."

"It is related to Kim Dokja-ssi."

Yoo Joonghyuk's killing intent slightly subsided. "What do you mean?"

The energy that was pressing down on her disappeared and Yoo Sangah
opened her mouth. "In this scenario, Dokja-ssi is going to die."

Kim Dokja would die? Yoo Joonghyuk laughed. "Kim Dokja is capable of
resurrection. I thought I told you before but you must've not heard it."

Yoo Joonghyuk could guess Kim Dokja's abilities to a certain extent. It
wasn't an endless resurrection but Kim Dokja would be able to survive
death a few more times. Thus, Kim Dokja's life wouldn't be threatened for
the time being.

"He should've resurrected by now… you haven't met him yet?"

This time, Yoo Sangah's eyes shook. Still, she didn't give in and spoke
again.

"It's not like that. If you leave it like this, Dokja-ssi will 'really' die."

"…How do you know?"

"I saw it."

"You saw it?"

The next moment, a giant thread appeared behind Yoo Sangah. It wasn't a
strand from Ariadne.
Looking closer, the thread wasn't made of yarn. It was made of very small
strings. The strings were made of countless stories. Yoo Joonghyuk knew
the identity of the thread in the air that flowed like the giant fabric of fate.

He knew but couldn't help feeling surprised. This was the symbol of the
three goddesses of fate, the Moerae.

Yoo Joonghyuk thought about it. "You stole a prophecy from a
constellation?"

Yoo Sangah gently nodded.

The enraged Yoo Joonghyuk shouted, "Do you know what you have done.
Fate…"

"I know! That's why I'm asking for help, Yoo Joonghyuk-ssi."

Yoo Joonghyuk's mind was complicated. The Moerae's 'fate' wasn't simple
a power to see the future. Rather, it was a prophecy that came from
'conclusions' through 'big data'.

The most reasonable future was predicted through a combination of
countless stories. In this way, 'fate' wasn't absolute and seemed like it could
change, but this never happened.

So far, the prophecies of Olympus had never been wrong. Even Zeus, the
lord of Olympus, couldn't escape from his fate. It was because the moment
a prophecy was made, the whole probability of Olympus was used to
realize this fate.

"Please stop Kim Dokja-ssi. Otherwise…" Yoo Sangah couldn't finish her
words. The sparks around her body blocked her mouth.

However, Yoo Joonghyuk could clearly read the strings behind her.

「 Incarnation Kim Dokja will be killed by the person he loves most. 」
"Wow, the plains are huge!"

"Is this really the Dark Castle?"

Lee Hyunsung stared at the horizon with admiration. The vast expanse of
plains and forest areas spread out in front of us. A river with an ominous
aura flowed through the center of the plains. This river was a tributary of
the Phoenix River.

We finally arrived at the second floor of Dark Castle.

"That's right. This is the second floor. It is a completely different place
from the first floor."

Unlike the first floor where a new scenario was in progress, the second
floor had a scenario that had been going on for a very long time.

I could see the appearance of some incarnations in the distance. They were
Seoul incarnations who newly entered this floor with us.

The incarnations didn't react when they saw us. Looking closely, they were
receiving guidance from a dokkaebi.

[…Congratulations to all the new incarnations who came to the second
floor. The Abyss Plains is an opportunity for you to do anything.]

It was a dokkaebi with a peculiar tone of voice whom I had never seen
before. He had a visibly old appearance. He was a dokkaebi who seemed to
have worked for the bureau for a very long time.

It was natural if he was in charge of the scenario for the Abyss Plains.
Demoted dokkaebis were assigned to this scenario.
I turned on my smartphone and found information on the second floor of
Dark Castle in Ways of Survival.

「 The Abyss Plains. The dokkaebis call it the tomb of the scenario. 」

…The tomb of the scenario. The words caused me to feel refreshed. I had
already come this far.

Han Sooyoung listened to the dokkaebi and opened her mouth. "Another
jerk. What opportunity? He will just adjust the difficulty once he becomes
angry."

It wasn't just her. The other incarnations had become familiar with the
dokkaebis and they looked at this one with distrust. This was the ninth
scenario and there was no way they would make a fuss about an
opportunity.

The dokkaebi laughed as if he knew what they were thinking.

[Don't worry. There will be no interference from the dokkaebis in this
scenario. Regardless of whether the story is interesting or boring, we won't
touch it.

The incarnations murmured. to each other So far, the dokkaebis had never
said anything like this. They always wanted a more stimulating story. Why
were they suddenly not interfering?

"What the hell are you planning?"

"What does this mean?"

[I know that you're all tired from the scenario. Still, I am telling you the
truth.]

[The updated main scenario has arrived!]
  [Main Scenario #9 ― ???]

  Category: Main

  Difficulty: ???

  Clear Conditions: ???

  Time Limit: ―

  Compensation: None

  Failure: ―



All the conditions were private and there was no time limit or failure
condition. The incarnations had never received such a scenario before and
were greatly confused.

"What? Nothing is revealed?"

"Are you trying to fuck us with a shitty scenario again?"

The dokkaebi laughed at the incarnation's violent reactions.

[So far, what have you been running for? For your family and friends? To
become stronger? Or to reign over others? Each one of you have your own
answer. In my opinion, it is all a lie. You came here because you 'followed'
the scenario.]

The eyes of the incarnations were shaken as their recent life was dismissed.

The dokkaebi continued speaking. [However, future scenarios will be hard
to overcome with such a mind. Passive beings can't survive in the Star
Stream. Thus, this scenario won't ask for anything.]
A scenario that didn't require anything. The bodies of the incarnations
trembled.

[There is no time limit or failure conditions. There is nothing to fail. You
have to find the clear conditions yourself. Only beings who want to tell a
story themselves will be able to move forward. Huhu, I wonder how many
people will make such a choice? I pray that you won't fall asleep in this
'tomb'.]

The dokkaebi disappeared with these words. The incarnations lost their
sense of purpose and started making a fuss. It was a bizarre sight.

This was more peaceful than any scenario so far but the incarnations
seemed somewhat uneasy. It was like people were happier when there was
an impossible goal.

Lee Hyunsung asked, "Dokja-ssi? What is this?"

Lee Hyunsung was terribly confused. He had been filled with motivation to
raise his rankings, only for a scenario with no clear conditions to appear. He
must be discouraged. On the other hand, I was a bit worried.

This scenario might be the most dangerous scenario for my party. The
moment I was about to open my mouth, a voice was heard behind e.

"Uh… where is this place?"

Lee Jihye and Lee Gilyoung had woken up.




Lee Jihye was in great despair after confirming that her ranking was
number 98,761.
"I've never received such a rank in the mock tests…"

Of course, this was a lie. According to Ways of Survival, Lee Jihye wasn't
good at studying.

"…Dokja hyung?" Lee Gilyoung jumped like a grasshopper as soon as he
saw me. Then he curled up and pretended to be calm. "I knew you were
alive. I believed in hyung until the end!"

Lee Jihye ridiculed him. "Kid, what are you talking about? You cried so
much with a runny nose."

"Cried?" Lee Gilyoung argued that he never cried and that he naturally
knew I was alive.

10 minutes later, Lee Gilyoung couldn't control his emotions any longer. He
let out a bit sob and rushed forward to hug my thighs."

"…A scenario without a scenario?" Lee Jihye heard the description from us
and asked with a confused expression.

"How can we clear this?" Lee Hyunsung was worried.

"Is there something hidden? We will be able to clear the scenario if we find
the hidden condition."

"I guess? If we all work together…"

I smiled bitterly as I watched Lee Jihye and Lee Hyunsung. Indeed,
simplicity was helpful. However, not everyone was simple.

"Excuse me… do we really need to clear it?" It was Pink Kid Kim Yongpal
who spoke.

Lee Jihye wondered, "Who is this woman?"

"She's just a… woman who happened to accompany us."
I was too lazy to explain. She wouldn't believe me if I said this was a man
in his 40s.

Meanwhile, Kim Yongpal was stuttering with half-closed eyes. "J-Just, isn't
it okay to stay like this? If we clear it…"

"What nonsense are you suddenly saying?"

"…D-Do you know what is at the end of the scenarios?"

Kim Yongpal penetrated the essence of an unexpected place. I hadn't
expected him to say such a line.

Lee Jihye was confused. "What?"

"I-I don't know if it is bad or good for us to keep doing the scenarios… In
the constantly occurring scenarios, we are just the toys of the constellations.
Even if we clear this scenario, we don't know what the next one will be like.
W-We can die at any time."

The expressions of the party members became disturbed by Kim Yongpal's
words. It was because he was right.

No one knew how these scenarios would end. No one knew how and when
they would die. Everyone ran up to this point because they would die if
they didn't clear the scenarios.

However, this scenario had no time limit or failure condition.

Lee Jihye bit her lips. "Then what? You will stay here? Where do you think
this is? It is a dangerous place where demons are wandering around…!"

Before Lee Jihye finished talking, large demon species started to gather on
the plains. They were demons higher than 5th grade. Lee Jihye laughed like
she expected it.

"Look, they're already here."
"Everyone gather!"

The incarnations nearby gathered around our party. The ones approaching
were the fourth grade demon species, devil bears. There was approximately
20 of them. We could overcome them if I used Electrification and my party
members worked together.

Of course, the other incarnations didn't know my strength and felt despair.

"These monsters…"

At this moment, a bright light shone from the other side of the devil bears.
It was due to the white flames. The devil bears shrieked as they were burnt
by the divine fire. How powerful was the ability to be able to slaughter a
4th grade demon species? This stigma was… "Unni!" Lee Jihye shouted.

It was naturally Jung Heewon's Hell Flames Ignition. Jung Heewon
discovered us and made a startled expression. In particular, she was
shocked by the sight of me.

I waved awkwardly at Jung Heewon who nodded hesitantly. There was
some discomfort in her gaze.

…What? Jung Heewon was riding a black unicorn. How did she tame that
monster? Other people riding black unicorns came over with Jung Heewon
and quickly defeated the devil bears. The incarnations called out Jung
Heewon's name.

"Wow! The Judge of Destruction!"

Jung Heewon came closer and Lee Jihye ran towards her.

"Unni, you are really alive! Did you come here first?"

"Jihye, I'm sorry. Let's talk later."
Jung Heewon turned her back to Lee Jihye. Lee Jihye was grouchy and
walked back to my side. Jung Heewon led the people in a natural manner,
as if she was already accustomed to this.

"Everybody follow me! I will guide you to a safe place!"

…A safe place? The discomfort inside me increased.

The incarnations were bewitched by Jung Heewon's overwhelming force
and followed her. We also followed her. We spent approximately one hour
crossing the plains. Then a high wall hidden in a forest was revealed.

It was a solid wall that no demon species could surpass. The incarnations
were captivated by the sight when a voice came from somewhere.

[Welcome. Was it difficult to come here? Thank you for the trouble. Now
you are safe.]

The incarnations murmured. Jung Heewon was staring at me with a
complicated gaze.

At this moment, I realized what happened. Dammit. I see. This place was
'that guy's fortress'.

A man appeared on top of the parapet. He gave off a powerful atmosphere
that made it clear he was the owner of this place.

The demon, who embraced the most peaceful despair in the world, laughed
as he looked down at us.

[You no longer have to complete the scenarios.]
          Chapter 159: Ep. 31 - Tomb of the Scenario, III


There was no need to keep performing the scenarios. Everyone gathered at
the fortress were wary.

"What the hell does that mean?"

Some people listened to his words but most of them didn't.

(He must be a swindler.)

(…He should make sense. What? There is no need to keep performing the
scenarios?)

(This is a trick for him to gobble up the rewards alone.)

These people were incarnations who survived up to the ninth scenario.
There were many scammers in Seoul, even if Geumho Station's Cheon Inho
and Chungmuro's Gong Pildu were removed. The incarnations here were
one of those scammers or those who came here after defeating them.

That's why none of them were easily caught by a honeyed tongue.

The man on the parapet opened his mouth like he had read their thoughts.

[You don't believe. It is understandable. Nine scenarios isn't long but it also
isn't short. I can guess what you have gone through and the life you must've
lived to come here.]

The basics of a scammer was to pretend to understand the other person.
There were already people fed up with this.

"Do you think I will be deceived by that?"

"What is your purpose? What do you want to say?"

The people who couldn't stand it started shouting. Then the man laughed. It
was such a beautiful laugh that it was hard to think of him as a scammer.

[It is literally what I said. You no longer need to fight. You must've heard
the dokkaebi's explanation. This Dark Castle scenario has no time limit or
failure conditions. If you're smart, you should already understand what this
means.]

I looked to the side and saw that Kim Yongpal's eyes were shining.

[You can continue to live in this scenario area. You can eat, sleep in and do
whatever you want. Respect the rights of your life and forget the
compulsion to break the scenario… you can finish your life here, just like it
was before the 'destruction' began.]

"The rights of our life? Don't talk bullshit!"

"How can we live in a place where demons are roaming?"
"We have a place to go back to!"

People shouted like they were refuting evil.

Then the man asked, [Go back? Where will you return to?]

"Of course, the place where we lived…"

[Do you mean the perished planet?]

"It isn't destroyed! Not yet!"

[Everybody already knows. The moment the scenario begun, your planet is
walking the path towards destruction. If you go back, you will only see
ruins. Even if you break the scenario… the last thing you will see is
destruction.]

"Who are you to say that? What do you know―"

[I know. The planet where I lived has long been destroyed by the scenario.]

The shaken crowd fell silent. This person lost his home a long time ago to
the scenario. The man who stayed in Dark Castle for longer than anyone
else was speaking to them now.

[That's why I can say with confidence that there is no safer place in the Star
Stream than here.]

For the first time, people's spirits weakened. Their eyes were still
disbelieving but they were listening to his story.

Someone asked in a loud voice, "Who are you?"

[My name is Reinheit von Djerba. I am someone who came to this land 800
years earlier than you… I am the owner of this fortress, Paradise.]
Then the door of the fortress opened. The expressions of the people
changed as they saw the scenery inside. Reinheit saw their expressions and
smiled.

[I once again welcome you. Welcome to Paradise.]


Paradise.

There were numerous references to it in Ways of Survival.

The tomb of the scenario. The nest of incarnations. Flowers blooming on
the plains of despair… these were some of the descriptions for this place.

In fact, most of them were true.

"This place is…"

All the party members except for me were enchanted by the sights in front
of them. Lee Jihye, Lee Gilyoung, Shin Yoosung and even Lee Hyunsung.
In particular, Lee Hyunsung rubbed his eyes several times, as if the sight in
front of him was unbelievable.

There were residential and market areas on both sides of the main street.
Voices filled with unprecedented energy could be heard.

"Selling the legs of the demon bug! Have a taste! Recovers your fatigue!"

"Selling farm grown Sancho Berries! It is useful for recovering stamina!"

The merchants at the market were friendly and customers who paid for their
goods were satisfied. People of various races and nationalities gathered but
no one seemed to discriminate or threaten each other.

All the incarnations who entered the fortress were baffled by the
suddenly bright atmosphere. "What on earth…"
Until a moment ago, the words 'paradise' and 'peace' were just nonsense to
them. Yet that nonsense was being presented in front of them.

"…Paradise?"

Some people were so surprised that they flopped to the ground. One of the
hasty incarnations groaned while dropping a weapon.

A friendly hand was held out to him.

"Are you okay? All injured people, come here! The Paradise Clinic treats
all the wounded for free!"

"We will teach you the medicinal techniques! Learn about the difference
between ether and magic power! Anyone who wants to use sword energy
can learn it! Anyone is welcome!"

The people living in Paradise weren't stingy about sharing. They exchanged
their knowledge and regarded helping someone as a virtue. There was even
cross-species communication.

A demon with horns on his head smiled and waved at us.

"Ah, a demon!"

Some surprised incarnations pulled out their weapons and the guards in the
fortress quickly approached. "Please put that away."

"What are you talking about? He is a demon…!"

"Such hatred is prohibited here. He is also a resident of Paradise."

"R-Resident?"

The perplexed incarnations hesitated and the demon who waved at them
came over.
"I am a demon but I won't hurt you. The prejudice that all demons will eat
humans makes me sad."

The incarnations made bemused expressions at the words. Their eyes
showed they couldn't figure out what was going on.

Similar scenes kept occurring. Demons, humans and other species joined
forces to build houses, went to the pub together or sat next to each other on
outdoor terraces… They often sent welcoming gestures to this side.

The party members were distracted by the sights that were like a tourist
advertisement.

[The character 'Lee Hyunsung' is shaken by the surrounding scenery.]

[The character 'Lee Jihye' is agitated by the surrounding atmosphere.]

My companions' hearts were conveyed in real time. This was the first peace
they encountered after the scenario began. It wasn't strange that their minds
would shake.

People who lived ordinary lives didn't change their essence just because
they carried a knife.

Everything was the result of an outside force. Now for the first time, they
could escape from that outside force. It was natural to be seduced.

We saw Jung Heewon's figure in the distance. Jung Heewon was talking to
someone. It was a woman I had seen before.

"Thank you so much for that time. I can't say enough thanks…"

"It's nothing! I'm glad that you're doing well."

The young woman talking to Jung Heewon glanced at me and her eyes
widened. Her emotional state changed quickly.
Surprise, fear and… gratitude.

"Perhaps this person is…"

"Ah, Dokja-ssi…"

The woman exclaimed, "You are the person from that time! I haven't
forgotten your grace in saving my life."

At first, I was a bit confused but I remembered when I saw the child
holding the woman's hand.

"Are you from Geumho Station…?"

"Do you remember? Dayoung, you should say hello."

"Hello…"

They were the mother and daughter who fought against the Cheoldoo
Group at Geumho Station.

They didn't join our party but managed to survive until now. The mother
and daughter were working at a farm here and gave us a beautiful basket. I
tried to refuse but it was useless.

"We never could've made it here if it wasn't for your help. Thanks to you, I
could start over again. I really appreciate it."

The mother and daughter had a new home and seemed to gain a new life.

I looked at the mother and daughter moving away and the memories of
Geumho Station flashed through my mind. The regret that I didn't save
more people and the cowardly way I comforted myself by saying it was for
the best.

The child in the distance suddenly turned and looked at me. A smile spread
across the child's face.
A mild guilt flooded in. My hypocrisy was given an undeserved reward.
Maybe Jung Heewon also felt like this.

Jung Heewon looked at the mother and daughter before saying to me,
"Congratulations on your resurrection. It took a bit longer this time."

"Isn't your response too ordinary? Jihye and Gilyoung started crying."

"Should I do that?"

"I don't want it."

I looked around with a smile while a difficult expression appeared on Jung
Heewon's face.

She hesitated for a moment before opening her mouth. "…Dokja-ssi, can
we talk for a minute?"




Jung Heewon had come here four days ago. She used the power of Hell
Flames Ignition to clear the first floor in the shortest time and quickly
climbed to the second floor.

Then she reached Paradise. It was a place where the shackles of the
scenario could be removed.

Of course, Jung Heewo didn't believe the man's words. On the first day, she
felt disbelief and on the second day, she doubted everything.

She was shaken on the third day and then I came on the fourth day. Jung
Heewon said, "I suddenly thought about what it meant to continue with the
scenario."
Jung Heewon wasn't brainwashed. In the first place, Paradise itself was a
sweet drug.

I smiled bitterly and asked her, "Weren't you shaken too quickly?"

"…Maybe it has always been this way."

Jung Heewon smiled bitterly.

"Let me go! I'll pay coins! I'll pay the value of what I stole! Let me go!"

As we walked down the street, scenes of prisoners being dragged away by
the guards could be seen. Some of them were people who entered the
fortress with me.

It seemed they couldn't abandon the old habit of taking other people's
things. Jung Heewon looked at the man being dragged and said, "This place
is better than Seoul."

"Yes."

"Species don't discriminate against each other and they work hard
together. There are houses for everyone to live and places to work." She
spoke like she was making excuses.

"We don't have to be betrayed by colleagues or worry about the monsters
who appear at night."

I watched Jung Heewon who was saying such words. The Judge of
Destruction Jung Heewon.

She was a sword that I crafted myself in this world. Maybe Jung Heewon
was the woman who killed the most people in my group. A person who had
to kill everyone to protect my principle of 'non-killing'.
"We don't have to live chasing the scenario. We don't need to have
nightmares because we killed someone. There is also no more need to lose
anyone."

The hardest blade was the easiest to break. It was the hardest so it was
wielded the most. Thus, it was damaged the most and lost its sharpness the
most. That's why it broke faster than other swords.

"This is a good place." My words caused Jung Heewon's eyes to shake.
I stared into those eyes as I kept talking. "I think this is a safe place." It
wasn't a lie.

"There is no safer place in Dark Castle than here. No, maybe… it isn't easy
to find a safer place in all the scenarios."

I didn't want to admit it but it was true. Paradise was truly such a place.
"Dokja-ssi, perhaps…"

I hurried as if I knew what she would say. "Yes, I won't stay here."

"Why?"

"This place isn't the 'end'."

"…Dokja-ssi knows the future."

In the past, I had a talk with Jung Heewon in the Theatre Dungeon. Jung
Heewon had asked me about the future and I told her she didn't exist there.
It was because she wasn't in the original novel. A character I didn't know
the future of…

I told her, "I need to continue with the scenario."

Jung Heewon thought about my words. She looked at the people of
Paradise. There were people smiling, talking and willing to live again.
"Dokja-ssi, what is the 'end' you are thinking about?"
"I can't tell you."

"Then that end… is it better than this place?"

I couldn't easily answer because it was a question from Jung Heewon, not
anyone else.

"If you don't continue with the scenario, will everyone be unhappy?"

I wondered if the ending I wanted was a place more beautiful than this
Paradise? Could everyone be happy when that ending was reached?

We stared up at the sky without speaking. It felt like there was something
precious there but I had forgotten what it was. As if she had woken up
from a brief dream, Jung Heewon opened her mouth. "The master of this
place is looking for Dokja-ssi." I nodded.
          Chapter 160: Ep. 31 - Tomb of the Scenario, IV


Jung Heewon and I passed through the central shopping district of Paradise
and arrived at a small hill.

The place where the master resided was naturally gorgeous. It was the same
with the castle in Peace Land. However, the lord of Paradise wasn't a
normal existence.

[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' has wide eyes.]

[The constellation 'Patron of the Young and the Travelers' reveals
discomfort.]

As I moved closer to the hill, the constellations of Eden reacted violently.

Patron of the Young and the Travelers. Perhaps a new archangel was
paying attention to me. Based on the faint pressure felt from the indirect
message, it seemed to be a constellation that was at least on the level of
Uriel.
It meant three angels in Eden was following me.

[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' is looking forward to
your rampage.]

[The constellation 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' wonders about your
stigma.]

The Great Sage, Heaven's Equal and the black dragon were the same. All
three regular members of my channel gathered together. I felt pleased
because the Great Sage, Heaven's Equal helped with the formation of my
nebula last time.

[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' has snorted and let
out snot.]

…It was hard to believe from the indirect messages that this was the Great
Sage, Heaven's Equal. In fact, did he actually write the indirect messages?
For example, there was the clone I saw.

Either way, if Secretive Plotter came then all four of the early people would
be gathered…

[The constellation 'Secretive Plotter' is watching the situation with
interested eyes.

Scarily enough, the last one came as I was thinking about him.

Secretive Plotter. I wasn't able to confirm his face at the constellation
banquet. It was clear that he was a narrative-grade constellation but no
matter how I thought about it, I couldn't remember his modifier.

I suddenly had doubts. Was it possible this strong presence didn't appear in
the original novel?

[Many constellations are paying attention to your actions.]
"We are here." Jung Heewon spoke and I stopped at the road up to the hill.
There was a white brick house on top of the hill.

A white house on the hill. I didn't know the intentions behind it but the taste
was unique.

"I'll wait here. Call me if anything happens."

I nodded but I already knew that Jung Heewon wouldn't run right away
because I called her. In Paradise, there was no one who could win again the
Paradise master.

I climbed up along the road and a shadow appeared near the brick house. A
man with a beautiful appearance stood there, as if he had been carved into a
sculpture.

"Oh, you're here."

If I didn't have Fourth Wall, I would've stopped breathing from his beauty.
Yoo Joonghyuk was also handsome but this person's appearance couldn't be
described. It was a demonic beauty.

"I'm sorry but please wait a moment. These guys were shy around
strangers."

The man was watering the flowers on the hill. The flowers were blooming
towards the air. Their petals were wide open, like they were trying to
swallow the sky, but they were just small flowers.

I knew the name of the flower.

"The Perpetual Motion."

It was was a collective term for things that worked forever without being
supplied energy sources from outside, but here it was merely the name of a
flower.
The man asked, "Do you know this flower?"

"New flowers bloom almost every day."

"You have great knowledge."

It was naturally because I read Ways of Survival.

The flowers of Paradise, the Perpetual Motion. The flower, which only
grew on this hill, bloomed at dawn and yielded fruit at night. The fruit fell
before dawn and would be used as fertilizer to grow more flowers.
Perpetual Motion was a flower that repeated forever.

The man said this flower was very lovely. "I never get tired looking at
them. Their vitality is truly amazing."

"However, the name is wrong. If it was really perpetual motion, the flower
should grow well without water."

"It is such a beautiful flower but you can only saw the flaws?"

The man laughed and looked at me. "I haven't introduced myself. I am…"

"The master of Paradise, Reinheit von Djerba."

I knew him well. He was one of the most famous '10 Evils' in Ways
of Survival. Reinheit smiled. "Nice to meet you, Kim Dokja." As
expected, he already knew who I was.

[The exclusive skill 'Character List' is activated!]

[There is too much information about this person. Character List is
converted to Character Summary.]
  [Character Summary]

  Character: Reinheit von Djerba.

  Impossible Dream (Hero).

  Exclusive Skill: Demon's Eyes Lv. 10, Advanced Weapons Training,
  Advanced Mental Barrier Lv. 10…

  *2nd in the Dark Castle rankings.



It was truly great. His overall stats had exceeded the limits of the scenario
and almost every skill had reached the maximum. Maybe Reinheit was the
'limit' of this scenario.

I stared at him and Reinheit clapped.

"It is difficult when you are burning with too much hostility. The Perpetual
Motion will be broken."

I asked, "Why did you call me?"

"I was wondering about the rumours. You have caused a loud buzz the
moment you entered this scenario."
Reinheit was different from the 10 Evils I had met so far. If Gong Pildu and
Lee Seolhwa were growing into the 10 Evils, Reinheit was already near
completion.

"A being like you entering the scenario is a threat to me."

"The second ranked demon marquis is too humble."

"…You know about that? Your preliminary investigation is thorough."

His killing intent suddenly sprang out.

…Was he going to ambush me now?

I hesitated. I didn't think I could beat or kill him. It wouldn't be an easy
fight.
The outcome couldn't be guaranteed. Yet the reason for my hesitation…

He said, "In my world, Dark Castle was the 34th scenario."

Perhaps it was because I saw his Paradise. Reinheit watched the scenery of
the fortress below the hill.

"I remember the first time I came here 800 years ago. At the time, there was
nothing on the plains. Only the rankings were given. The incarnations were
busy hunting and killing each other, despite there being nothing in the
scenario."

I imagined them first falling on the plains. All beings in Dark Castle
evolved into demons over time. The first ones to enter Dark Castle weren't
demons from the beginning.

"They ascended to a higher species in order to become stronger. In a
situation with no time limits or failure conditions, they focused only on
getting a higher ranking. Endless war and slaughter. It is the only thing that
the incarnations could do when the story had disappeared."
The disappearance of the scenario wasn't a happy thing. Whether it was a
constellation or an incarnation, every being eventually needed a story.

However, Reinheit didn't agree with this. He was tired of being a toy in
someone's scenario and no longer wanted to be a slave to the scenario.

"Thus, I created Paradise." I knew Reinheit was sincere. "The dokkaebis
call this a 'tomb' but not me. I became a blood-stained demon after many
years but I believe real life can only bloom after the scenario has
disappeared."

The words were filled with deep emotions. I might've been caught if I
hadn't read the original novel.

「 The purest evil. 」

That was what Yoo Joonghyuk called Reinheit.

"Constellation Kim Dokja. You want to go to the next scenario."

"That's right."

"Stop. Such a thing doesn't exist." As expected, this was what he wanted.
"I've lived for 800 years and it isn't the first time I've seen someone like
you."

"…"

"Numerous strong people have found hidden scenarios but none have
cleared Dark Castle. Everyone becomes desperate and frustrated by the
void of this scenario." Reinhart continued speaking, "I don't want you to be
like them."

"What do you want?"

"Constellation Kim Dokja. Please protect Paradise with me. I need your
help."
I stood silently by his side and touched the petals of the Perpetual Motion.
Before the surprised Reinheit could stop me, the trembling flower quickly
shriveled and the fruit fell. The fallen fruit suddenly became rotten and
rolled down the hillside.

The guard passing by saw it but didn't pay much attention. It was because
they had no intention of cutting out the rotten part of Paradise.

"U-Ugh… release me! It is wrong!"

"I didn't steal anything!"

The criminals of Paradise were being transported to the underground area
below the hill. I knew where they were being dragged.

[Some constellations are laughing unpleasantly.]

Just as permanent institutions didn't exist, Paradise wasn't free. They would
probably become Paradise's fertilizer. It was just like the rotten fruit
became the plant's fertilizers.

A small earthquake occurred deep underground. It seemed to be the cry of a
terrible monster.

I told him, "Reinheit, there is no Paradise. A permanent institution can't
exist."

Reinheit didn't say anything. It looked like he was trying to test me.
However, he would soon regret it.

"Give me the 'next' scenario."

A look of panic appeared in Reinheit's eyes for the first time.

"I know that you found it 700 years ago. To be exact, you and a few strong
people have found it."
"How do you…"

"You have even challenged the scenario. Isn't that right?"

"…"

"However, you failed and survived by yourself. Then this Paradise was
made."

I didn't miss the trembling in his fingertips as he looked after the petals. He
said he created this place to help people find life.

It wasn't true. This was just a refuge for an impossible scenario.

"All the scenarios of the Star Stream exist for stimulation. There is no
stimulation in Paradise. Everything is too peaceful."

"…"

"Don't believe that the deal with the dokkaebi will last forever. The Star
Stream will never allow this space to exist for a long time.

Reinheit was quiet for a while before slowly opening his mouth. "…
Constellation Kim Dokja. What else do you know?"

His tone had changed. A faint but scary energy was flowing from him. His
attitude towards me had changed from this conversation.

It changed from a helper he was anticipating to an enemy more threatening
than anyone else.

"All of it, even things you don't know."

I saw a dark cloud coming from afar.
In such a situation, there was no chance of a cloud coming in. Thus, this
rain cloud was definitely under the direction of the dokkaebis. They were
sitting around and watching everything, even if they weren't interfering.

It was because this world was a scenario even without a scenario. I
sighed lightly and prepared for the end of the tragedy. "Reinheit. You
will die and Paradise will fall."
           Chapter 161: Ep. 31 - Tomb of the Scenario, V


'I will die and Paradise will be destroyed?'

After Kim Dokja left, Reinheit looked down the hill with a blank
expression. He had laughed when he first heard the words. However, he had
to stop laughing when Kim Dokja's expression didn't change.

Reinheit was annoyed.

Kim Dokja might be a constellation but this was crossing the line. He
wasn't the strongest in the Star Stream just because he was a constellation.
It wasn't uncommon for the 72 demon kings to devour fledgling
constellations in the Star Stream.

In addition, Kim Dokja was only a half constellation.

[The constellation 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' is warning you not to
ignore the words of 'Kim Dokja'.]
That's why Reinheit was surprised when the Abyssal Black Flame Dragon
came out to defend Kim Dokja.

Who was the Abyssal Black Flame Dragon? He was the most famous of the
absolute evil system that even the 72 demon kings didn't want to get tangled
up in.

Reinheit looked at the scenery below the hill and naturally became nervous.
Thus, he acted like he wasn't.

'Paradise won't perish'.

Reinheit was old but still alive. He had been watching this place alone for
700 years. Thus, this place would be fine in the future. This scenario might
be full of poisonous people but he wouldn't lose if he fought in Paradise.

'Rather, the dangerous thing…'

Kim Dokja didn't yet know how terrible the stories that entered Dark Castle
were.

The rotten fruit of Perpetual Motion fell off and Reinheit disappeared.




I didn't know what would happen if a battle took place on the spot but
fortunately, Reinheit didn't attack. It was obviously that Paradise would be
turned upside down if we fought here.

Of course, I had no intention of fighting. Things would be smoother if I
defeated Reinheit here but I would be badly damaged and the incarnations
of Paradise would develop a grudge against me.
I couldn't let that happen. If Paradise collapsed, it must be due to the anger
of Paradise itself, not an external enemy. The incarnations would end up in
the same predicament if I acted without revealing what was wrong.

"…Is it over?"

"Yes."

Jung Heewon was waiting for me below the hill. She still had an unclear
expression. Maybe she was struggling with her loyalty to me and the
comfort of Paradise.

I decided to relieve a bit of her worries. "Heewon-ssi. Do you want to go
shopping for a while?"

We walked along the street. Noise came from the bustling shopping district.

"…It has been a while since I've walked like this."

"Me too."

As the awkward silence continued, Jung Heewon decided to speak first.
"Do you have any questions for me?"

"What do you want me to ask?"

I know what to she wanted me to ask. However, there were some things I
didn't ask because I already knew the answer.

"Um… my favourite colour or favourite food," Jung Heewon replied.

"Those are questions that wouldn't be asked even in blind dates."

"…Has Dokja-ssi been on a blind date?"

I ignored the slight hit to my pride and asked, "Are you disregarding me?"
"No… it just doesn't seem like Dokja-ssi's style. I feel like you would want
a fateful meeting."

I felt like I had unexpectedly been stung. In fact, I had never been on a
blind date. Jung Heewon continued speaking. "We have never talked about
our past before. Aren't you curious?"

"…"

"How did you live before and where did you go to school?"

I quietly listened to her.

"What was your phone number and where did you live? In addition…"

The scenery passed and Jung Heewon's voice gradually died down. As she
was speaking, she would've discovered it. Maybe it had been too long to tell
such a story.

The area she lived would've been destroyed and those who remembered her
history… probably wouldn't be alive. These things happened to us in just a
few months.

Jung Heewon was silent for a long time before wondering, "Even if we go
back… it won't be the same Seoul, right?"

"It won't."

At the end of the 10th scenario, Seoul Dome would be broken and the
incarnations liberated.

Still, this was just the beginning of another hell. It meant the scenarios that
were limited to the capital city domes would expand to the whole world.

"Then… why do we have to continue with the scenario? None of the things
we knew are still remaining. There is no going back."
This was why she wanted to stay in Paradise. The woman from Geumho
Station, Pink Kid Kim Yongpal… Paradise was the place where lost people
came.

Jung Heewon's head hung down. I opened my mouth while deliberately
not staring at her face. "Heewon-ssi is a good sword." Small breathing
sounds could be heard.

"You are calmer in front of the fire than any of us. In particular, you
are sensitive to the tyranny of the strong." I slowly started the 'story'
that I knew.

Just because Jung Heewon didn't appear in the original novel didn't mean I
didn't know her. It made me work harder to read her.

"You always fought at the head of the party and never complained about
how difficult it was.

Jung Heewon listened to me with her mouth shut. I continued speaking,
"You didn't tell anyone when you were hurt and even if there was
something suspicious, you chose to believe in that person."

I thought of Jung Heewon. The Jung Heewon who trusted me despite my
suspicious actions. The Jung Heewon who fought for me at Geumho
Station.

"You might distrust humans more than anyone else but you are actually
filled with affection. You are the first to come running when our party is in
danger."

Jung Heewon was the one who desperately searched for the party when the
dokkaebi separated them. Jung Heewon always joked around but she was
careful to make sure we wouldn't be offended by a little joke.
"…"

"If so, don't I know a bit about Jung Heewon-ssi?"

Jung Heewon's head remained lowered as she spoke, "I'm not like that."

"This is the Jung Heewon that I see."

Jung Heewon carefully avoided my gaze.

"No one has ever told me that… Dokja-ssi would be good at blind dates. By
the way, what are you talking about?"

Jung Heewon looked up at me and smiled faintly, as if nothing had
happened. It wasn't a moment where she should smile.

"This is the Jung Heewon-ssi that I saw because you continued the
scenario." Jung Heewon's lips, which had been halfway open, stopped.
"That's why I believe you should continue the scenario."

There was no place for us to go back. There might not be a place for us to
stay. Still, at least the story was continuing. As long as the story continued,
there were more things that we could barely see.

Jung Heewon carefully opened her mouth. "…I don't understand because it
is too hard. I told you before. I didn't do well in school…"

"I'm not saying this in the hope that Heewon-ssi will act. Heewon-ssi
should live according to your own way."

I opened the Exchange while talking.

[The item that you commissioned to be made has arrived.]

The timing was good. The item that I sent to be produced had come. It was
made from the bone of the fire dragon, the heart of a demon and the nucleus
of some monsters.
It was an item that only Jung Heewon could use. In the original novel, only
the 'three original judges' were able to use the item. I paid 100,000 coins for
it to be produced and received the item.

[You have given the 'Sword of Judgment' to Jung Heewon.]

The surprised Jung Heewon accepted the sword.

"This…?"

"Didn't we decide to go shopping together? This is my gift. Isn't your old
sword broken?"

"I don't deserve this."

I slowly shook my head.

"Nope, only Heewon-ssi is eligible for this sword."
"Kim Dokja has a really bad personality. Are you actually going to leave
like this?"

We moved away from Paradise. Han Sooyoung kept looking back as she
spoke.

I replied without looking back. "The things here are finished."

"What is finished?"

If it went according to the original novel, Paradise will probably be
destroyed. The peace of the incarnations would be ruthlessly broken.

Should I stop it? I couldn't do that. This scenario would never end as long
as Paradise existed.

"Paradise isn't for me to get involved in."

"Ah, you are leaving it to the original flow of the novel… why can't you do
it yourself?"

"Reinheit is too hard to catch right now and I will gain a bad story if I do
beat him. He has too many supporters."

Stories didn't only have 'good effects'. Some stories would cause your
strength to drop.

Han Sooyoung knew this and bit her lips. "Well, it is like this. Then what
about the mental state of the companions left behind?"

"They should get some rest."
"What? Rest? Tell me honestly. Aren't you actually angry? You have done
a good job but they fell for a demon they met for the first time. In
particular,
Jung Heewon…"

"…Jung Heewon deserves it. It has been hard for her so far."

Han Sooyoung scoffed. "Don't make me laugh. Don't you know what you
have done? Paradise will soon perish. She received the sword and likes you
without knowing anything."

"She chose it herself so she should be responsible for herself."

"You demon…"

Some wounds destroyed us but some made us stronger. It couldn't be
helped, even if I was called a demon. This was my path. Han Sooyoung
grumbled for a long time before suddenly saying. "Hrmm… by the way,
Kim Dokja."

"Why?"

"Why are you taking me?"

"You will help me."

Han Sooyoung bit her lips and suddenly summoned her clones.

…Their faces seemed to resemble me. This reminded me that she could
change the faces of her clones.

"What are you doing?"

"Training."
It was more like a one-sided assault than training. Furthermore, she focused
on hitting a place that was extremely painful. Han Sooyoung beat me up for
a long time before asking, "What are you going to do now?"

"I'll set aside the scenario for three or four days and gather stories while
searching for hidden pieces."

Han Sooyoung smiled at the words 'hidden pieces'.

"Why? Aren't you the type to be focused on the main scenario?"

"This time I will leave it to other people. It has been hard for me to do it
alone up to now."

When I thought about it, I tried too hard to do it alone. That jerk Yoo
Joonghyuk seemed to be working hard but he wasn't helpful at important
moments. It would've ended at the Disaster of Floods or Peace Land if I
hadn't helped. As I was working hard on the scenarios, he went around
finding hidden pieces.

Thus, it was time for him to work properly. I smiled and said, "We will now
pretend to be the regressor."
              Chapter 162: Ep. 32 - Kim Dokja's Love, I


Four days passed since Kim Dokja left. The fortress still remained and no
signs of destruction were visible.

The sky of Paradise was more peaceful than ever and it was even languid.
Lee Gilyoung looked at the sky and spoke in a dark voice. "We have been
abandoned."

"The little boy is starting again."

"Dokja hyung threw us away." Lee Gilyoung was in a depressed state and
had been repeating these words for two days.

Lee Jihye frowned from where she was sharpening her blade nearby. "Why
are you making such a fuss?"

Lee Gilyoung replied, "Do you know when a protagonist will leave his
colleagues behind?"
"…When?"

"When a colleague will interfere."

"…"

"We are now judged as useless!"

"…How is ahjussi a protagonist? Honestly, Master is more suitable to be
the protagonist. In addition, this isn't a novel." Lee Jihye grunted but her
expression wasn't bright either.

In the past four days, the group was calm. It was a drug-like peace. It was
so peaceful that they felt calm. Nobody threatened them and there was
nothing in the world to worry about.

They trained their skills from time to time and recalled the advice Kim
Dokja had left for them.

「Gilyoung is lacking skills persistence. If you have coins left, try to place
them in 'patience' or 'indomitable persistence'. You can use the exchange or
ask your sponsor to help you. 」

「 Jihye, you are too biased towards agility. If you have surplus coins,
invest in strength and magic power. Your battle style will change
depending on where you invest. 」

「 Yoosung, focus on raising 'Taming' and Advanced Diverse
Communication' to the maximum level. If you need other skills related to
taming, tell me at any time. 」

Was it due to Lee Gilyoung's words? The uneasy Lee Jihye poked Shin
Yoosung sitting next to her. "Hey, little beast."

Shin Yoosung, who had been training Advanced Diverse Communication
due to Kim Dokja's advice, suddenly woke up.
"…What is it?"

They might be in the same party but Shin Yoosung didn't like Lee Jihye,
who was rude to Kim Dokja. Lee Jihye was embarrassed by the look in
Shin Yoosung's eyes and said, "Hey, don't look at me that way. I have to
ask you something."

"What is it?"

"Do you know what Dokja ahjussi is going?"

Shin Yoosung's eyes widened at the unexpected question.

Lee Jihye continued, "You are his incarnation so I was wondering if you
knew something. Originally, incarnations get information on the sponsor
whenever the sponsor and incarnation's synchronization increases."

In fact, Lee Jihye also shared Yi Sunsin's memories whenever she used the
Duke of Loyalty and Warfare's stigma. In the end, the core of the story was
the stigma. It was inevitable to know the story of the constellation every
time the power was used.

Shin Yoosung desperately tried to choose her words before barely opening
her mouth. "Ahjussi… he is a lonely person."

"Hey, anyone could say that."

"He also likes reading books…"

"Books?"

"Yes. Countless pages appear whenever I think of ahjussi. I'm not sure what
it is… I can't see the page contents." Shin Yoosung hesitated and lowered
her head. "I still don't know that much. I haven't received a stigma yet."

"…I didn't ask to discourage you."
Lee Jihye patted Shin Yoosung's shoulder and once again realized reality.
Only one person left but the whole atmosphere of the party changed. As a
member, they had to survive well.

'If it wasn't for ahjussi, everything would already be over…'

She looked around and noticed that everyone was uneasy. The two children
who depended on Kim Dokja, the soldier who only knew the manual, the
female swordsman who was unable to properly cope with her power…

[The constellation 'Maritime War God' criticizes the patriotism of the
incarnation 'Lee Jihye'.]

Lee Jihye scoffed and blocked her ears, shouting 'abababa' to tune it out.

'By the way, the soldier is going it again'.

Lee Hyunsung was staring blankly at something. Lee Jihye knew what he
was looking at and laughed. It might not be a bad thing to temporarily
relax.

"Hey Kid." Lee Jihye watched Lee Hyunsung approaching something and
suddenly opened her mouth. "Do you want me to show you something
fun?"




For the past four days, Jung Heewon had nightmares. The monsters were
overwhelming and the dream of Paradise was destroyed.

Once she woke up, Kim Dokja's Sword of Judgment was crying.

Several times, Reinheit had come to her and asked her to be the chief of the
fortress' security.
However, Jung Heewon refused the request. The reason was because the
Sword of Judgment only cried out when there was 'evil' nearby.

Jung Heewon sat on a low slate roof and looked at the scenery of Paradise.
There was nothing that could be seen as 'evil' in the city.

"Heewon-ssi, do you have any worries?" When did he come? The
brightfaced Lee Hyunsung was standing beside her.

"Ah, just… It is so peaceful that I have a lot of thoughts."

"Me too."

The two people were silent for a moment. An awkward atmosphere flowed.
A strange current had flowed between them ever since Lee Hyunsung saved
Jung Heewon, who had gone berserk thanks to Nirvana. However, neither
of them knew exactly what this current was.

[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' dislikes the actions of the
incarnation 'Lee Hyunsung'.]

[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' is warning 'Master of Steel'.]

[The constellation 'Master of Steel' says this isn't a matter to get involved

in.] She suddenly looked down and saw Lee Jihye and the children hiding.

'…What are those guys doing over there?'

Jung Heewon was about to call out to them when Lee Hyunsung opened his
mouth first. "I think there is a reason for this peace."

"You seem to believe that Dokja-ssi didn't just leave us here."

"Dokja-ssi is such a person. It is our job to find out the reason."
She thought using common sense but couldn't figure it out. It was related to
why Dokja-ssi left them here in Paradise but she couldn't see what the
problem was.

At this moment, noise from a group of people below the roof disturbed her.

"Return the scenario!"

"We want to go to the next floor!"

Jung Heewon frowned. They were people who felt discontent towards the
peaceful Paradise. They were the protesters of Paradise. They didn't have a
representative catchphrase but they intermittently appeared in Paradise.

Jung Heewon couldn't understand it. Why did they want to go back to the
scenario? She opened her mouth. "I think I should go down. A fight might
start."

"I understand."

By the time Jung Heewon descended, bloodshed was already happening.
However, it wasn't from a 'fight'. It was a one-sided assault. The guards
were beating up the protesters.

Jung Heewon was upset by the excessive force and stopped a guard. "Wait
a minute! Calm down and back off! This is too much!"

"I am performing official business. Don't interrupt."

The chief guard removed Jung Heewon's hand and gathered the fallen
protesters. The protesters were placed into small wagons and seemed to be
transported somewhere.

"Catch all those who ran away. I will take all these people."

"What about that woman?"
The guard captain looked at Jung Heewon and shook his head. "Leave it
alone. This is an order from the lord."

Not long afterwards, some protesters who ran away were caught. There was
an unexpected figure among them.

"I-I'm not a protester! I was just passing by accidentally! Dayoung!
Dayoung!"

They were the family from Geumho Station. Jung Heewon shouted, "Wait a
minute! That person isn't a protester!"

Then the guard said, "You are a protester. You panicked and ran away
when we chased you. If there is no sin, why did you run away?"

"That's right."

The guard captain nodded and started to give instructions again.

Jung Heewon shouted, "No, it is natural to be scared and run when you are
suddenly changed!"

"It will be revealed later. There is no time so transport them!"

"I said to wait!"

"…Despite the lord's command, I will arrest you if you interfere one more
time."

Funnily enough, Jung Heewon stopped at the word 'arrest'. She didn't know
why. Was it because she had been thrown into the wild for so long and
suddenly returned to society?

The woman judged she couldn't stop the situation and shouted, "T-The
child didn't do anything wrong! Please release the child!"
The guard captain briefly paused at the woman's scream. He thought for a
moment before ordering, "…Leave the child alone."

The guards nodded and only took away the woman. The child watched her
mother going further away and started to cry.

"Uh, Mother…"

"Dayoung, listen up. Mother will be back soon. Understood? Just wait
there! I will…"

Her mother's voice go further away. As Jung Heewon belatedly tried to
chase them, some of the watching merchants stepped in.

"Young lady, don't bother. It is useless. This is the law of Paradise."

"Where are they going?"

"They are going to Paradise's dungeon."

"Dungeon?"

"Access is prohibited for everyone except the guards. No one has ever
returned from there. Tsk tsk… she is pitiful but she should've lived well."
The merchants showed a lukewarm reaction and scattered.

Jung Heewon stood blankly for a moment before approaching the crying
child. She wondered what to do and hesitantly grasped the crying child's
hand. Something popped in her head the moment she felt the warm texture.

…This was Paradise?

"I think I know what to do."

She looked back and saw Lee Jihye and the others. All of them had
expressions like they had found their own 'scenario'.
Lee Hyunsung said, "I think it will be a big deal but I don't know if we will
be okay."

"Dokja-ssi believed in us. Maybe he is doing something bigger. He is
always like that."

"That's right. I'm sure hyung is fighting monsters alone with a serious face."

Kim Dokja wouldn't leave without a reason.

It might be to protect people from the threat or to break the scenario… No
matter the reason, Kim Dokja would be desperately risking his life at the
moment.

Finally, Jung Heewon opened her mouth. "Let's try it together this time."

They couldn't rely on Kim Dokja every time.

Kim Dokja would obviously be performing a hellish scenario in a place that
wasn't visible.




"Hey! Kim Dokja, this is honey. You really didn't live like this before?"

On the vast plains, a sports car with a loud engine was moving.

"…Yes."

In the past three days, we had captured three hidden scenarios on the Abyss
Plains. The strategy itself wasn't difficult. It was because unlike what I had
done so far, all the future information I knew was completely accurate.

"This guy's weakness came out in the 34th regression. If we press the three
small dots on his back…"
"His attack range is dangerous but he will reveal a gap after using a ranged
attack…"

"The weakness of the boss is the anus…"

It was more comfortable because I was with Han Sooyoung.

"Okay, it is the anus."

I didn't have to explain why I knew the information and Han Sooyoung
didn't doubt what I told her.

As a result, we got two star relics. One was an SSS-grade star relic that was
only useful as a star relic on these plains.

[SSS-class Ferrarigini].

This car was an SSS-class item created by the Mass Production Maker.

The SSS-class Magic Turret installed on the front and rear were useful for
destroying a large number of enemies, as well as moving as fast as Way of
the Wind without using magic power.

Thanks to it, we can enjoy the feeling of driving through the plains. What
should I say? It was a top-grade regressor course?

I once again felt resentful towards Yoo Joonghyuk. He had been enjoying
this type of thing while I broke the scenario.

Han Sooyoung was even more excited than me. She stood up on the
passenger seat and raised her arms, shouting, "I will never be a pushover! I
will only live selfishly for myself!"

I wanted to tackle that faithful regressor mindset of 'You live only for
yourself'.
[Many constellations are pleased with incarnation 'Han Sooyoung's exciting
remarks.]

[Many constellations agree with her behaviour.]

[20,000 coins have been acquired.]

The monsters that came running exploded from Ferrarigini's magic bullet.
Han Sooyoung was pleased at collecting coins and shouted towards the sky.
"Kim Dokja! Say something as well! When will you feel like this again?"

I hesitated for a moment. I was somewhat embarrassed but I agreed with
Han Sooyoung's words.

If I thought about it, my life had never gone well. I had always suffered
from overtime. Forget a Ferrari. I used public transport because I had no
money to buy a used car.

Thus… I felt it as well. I hesitated before shouting in a timid voice. "I-I am
the protagonist!"

[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' covers her eyes with
embarrassment.]

[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' considers moving
channels.]

[The constellation 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' is taken with your chuuni
words.]

Shit… why couldn't I feel it?

By the way… things must've happened in Paradise by now. This was the
flow in the original novel and the party members would probably do well.
Things had been working out recently. If this continued, the scenario would
be cleared in a flash…
[A huge fate is hoping for your death.]

…What?
            Chapter 163: Ep. 32 - Kim Dokja's Love, II


I thought I heard wrong and dug at my ears. However, the message didn't
change.

[A huge fate is hoping for your death.]

What the? I pressed hard against the brakes as my mind became troubled.
Han Sooyoung screamed from the sudden stop. "What is it? I was in the
middle of feeling good!"

"Please be quiet."

I once again listened. This time a voice appeared as well as the message.

[A huge fate is hoping for your death.]

This was the third time. I gulped. Dammit. Was there an incident where a
'fate message' appeared three times in the original novel?
I thought about it. It was… the 71st regression Yoo Joonghyuk. At that
time, Yoo Joonghyuk had been named due to Yama, king of hell.

Shit, what was going to happen?

Han Sooyoung scowled and asked again, "Why? What's going on?"

"Someone has read my fate."

"…Fate?"

Fate. It was as scary as the 'probability' in Ways of Survival.

Strictly speaking, this was a force using 'probability' in the broader sense.
However, there was a reason it was called something different. It was
because 'fate' was the power of the constellations, who exercised their
accumulated probability.

"Uh, wait a minute. It seems to be a story that I vaguely know…"

"Perhaps there was a quick mention in the beginning of the novel."

"Fate… is it similar to Future Sight?"

"It is similar but different."

In fact, it was very different. Reading fate wasn't as simple as reading
'information of the future'. Rather, it was even more dangerous.

"If Future Sight is a glimpse of a predictable future, fate was a power that
forced a predictable future."

I didn't know if Han Sooyoung understood so I added an explanation.

"For example, let's say I step on the accelerator for five seconds. Then
when
I look using Future Sight, won't I be driving?"
"…Well, I guess."

"However, if I know information about the future, I might not step on the
accelerator."

"That is possible."

"Fate is different. If someone reads the fate that 'Kim Dokja will step on the
accelerator for five seconds', this fate is forced unless it is withdrawn or
realized. To put it simply…"

"You must step on the accelerator."

I nodded and Han Sooyoung spoke like it was strange. "By the way, isn't it
a bit weird?"

"What?"

"It doesn't fit the probability. According to you, 'fate' is a force that
interferes with the scenario but who can force it?"

"Who…"

In principle, the dokkaebis couldn't interfere with the scenario. Thus, there
was only one being who could interfere. Han Sooyoung immediately knew
the answer. "Even if it is a constellation, alone…"

"It is a problem because they aren't alone."

"What?"

"Only the big nebulae can read fate."

Then a big explosion occurred in front of us. Something was approaching at
a formidable pace. It was on a different dimension from the monsters we
had met before.
Han Sooyoung's face paled. "…Kim Dokja, what exactly is the fate
message that you received?"

"I will die."

"Dammit, you should've told me that first! Why does something always…"

Han Sooyoung spat out and was about to leave the car. A presence
appeared in front of them. I reflexively drew Unbroken Faith but the man
opened his mouth first.

"Kim Dokja. I have something to tell you."

It was my first time seeing him but I was accustomed to the energy from his
body. I instinctively felt that he wasn't an enemy.

"You are…"

The moment I smelt the scent of fragrant well and felt the overexcited air, I
discovered who this person was.

"…Did you come to say I will die?" I asked.

The incarnation of Dionysus, who smelt of alcohol, smiled at me with white
eyes.

"Ah, you already know?"

I had a good impression of Dionysus. He fought for me on the way to the
banquet location. Still, that was a different story from the current situation.
I opened my mouth and spoke in a wary voice.

"Are you the ones who read my fate?"

"Yes. Olympus read your fate. But if you're asking if I'm one of them, I'm
not."
"What do you mean?"

Dionysius' incarnation just smiled. A thought crossed my mind the moment
I saw the smile.

"Surely Olympus isn't splitting apart?"

"You are truly smart."

…Already? This development was faster than the original. The breaking
apart of Olympus was scheduled but it should've happened after at least 10
scenarios.

"It isn't just Olympus. Many constellations are aiming at you. They are very
strong and mighty existences."

I had expected it. Otherwise my 'fate' wouldn't be so overbearing.

"Why are they aiming for me?"

"Those strong people are afraid of your influence."

"I'm just a fledgling constellation."

"That's how it should be. However, the scenario started on Earth is very
special. Some constellations believe this is the scenario we have long been
waiting for. Ahh, don't make that expression. I'm not saying this so you can
understand."

I wanted to say that my face always looked like this but Dionysus
continued. "In any case, just know that this scenario is very important to us.
Then you showed up in the scenario."

"I don't know what it is but I'm disturbing things."

"Yes. You are bound to be an obstacle. You will be less influenced by
probability than other constellations. You have overwhelming growth and
strength compared to other incarnations. That's why some nebulae believe
you should either be absorbed or removed."

I briefly looked at Dionysus. "Why are you telling me this information?"

This was the thing i was most curious about. Why was Dionysus showing
kindness towards me?

"It is because I like your story." Dionysus laughed heartily and added.
"Some constellations and I believe that you can reach ■■."


Jung Heewon and the group spent the day investigating the dungeon of
Paradise. There was no way to invade with a large number of people at
once so the party decided to scatter and find a method. The method Jung
Heewon chose was straightforward.

'I will mix in'.

In the afternoon, new criminals appeared. Uriel gave her the Recluse's
Cloak and she chased after the guards while the dungeon was open. The
guards and arrested criminals went through the underground door without
feeling her presence.

The prison was much deeper than she thought and the darkness was beyond
her imagination.

'Where are we going down to?'

It was a depth she couldn't understand. Why did it need to be so deep, even
if it was a prison? It would be inconvenient to move…

She was feeling doubts when the guards' footsteps came to a halt.
Strangely, all of them looked tense.

"All of you, move over there! We will withdraw immediately!"
The guards were afraid, as if this was a place they shouldn't enter. It was the
same for the scary guard captain. Then a thick iron door opened and once it
was opened, an entrance filled with metal bars could be seen. There were
several layers of steel bars. It was a prison with excessive defenses
designed to lock humans in.

"Everybody go in!"

The guards drove the prisoners inside and quickly rushed away.

"Aaack!"

"Help me!"

Jung Heewon mixed in with the prisoners and recoiled at the sight. Why
were these people thrown here? What was going on here?

"U-Uhh… where is this place?"

The prisoners looked around. There was a faint light but it was extremely
dark. Jung Heewon would've also been lost in the darkness if it wasn't for
her Night Vision skill.

'This is a prison?'

She looked around and didn't feel it was a prison at all. The surrounding
landscape was closer to a natural cave and there was no method to
distinguish between prisoners. No, there were no other prisoners trapped in
the first place.

'How does food distribution happen? What the hell is this?'

It was a 'dungeon' system that couldn't be understood at all. The prisoners
she came in with were also disconcerted.

"What are we supposed to do here?"
"Excuse me! Is anybody there?"

The scared prisoners shouted but there was no reply. Instead, faint sounds
were heard in the darkness.

Jung Heewon slowly pulled out the Sword of Judgment. The moment she
stepped in here, the crying of her sword became more violent.

'This…'

An eerie sensation reached her back and Jung Heewon shouted, "Everyone,
run away!"

However, it was already too late. Monsters rushed from the darkness
and pounced on the people. "Uwaaaack!"

"Save me! Kuaack!"

Leopard-like creatures were randomly biting people's arms and legs.
People's limbs were torn apart like they were toys and blood splattered.

She originally only planned to rescue the woman from Geumho Station but
things changed. The almost level 10 Demon Slaying skill was activated and
a red aura wrapped around her body.

Her Kendo drew a perfect line in the air. The leopard's body was split apart
in a neat line. The agitated leopards kept following her but she cleaned up
the monsters.

Jung Heewon's power reached its peak in a place where demons were
swarming.

"I-I don't know who you are but thank you…" The people in the darkness
found her presence and thanked her. However, Jung Heewon couldn't
afford to accept the thanks. She had seen the faces of the leopards.
'What the hell is this?'

The leopards had the faces of humans. Jung Heewon reflexively ran
through the darkness.

All her senses had become cold with fear.

She ran and soon arrived at a cavern that was huge beyond her capacity to
measure. To be precise, it wasn't a cavern. There were countless monsters
in it. This was like the boundary of the Demon Realm.

There were 5th grade, 4th grade and even 3rd grade species. There were
also monsters she didn't know the rating of.

"This is Paradise…"

She couldn't find the woman from Geumho Station. Of course, Jung
Heewon wouldn't be able to find the woman. She had already been eaten
or… Kuaaah!

She would become one of these monsters. The monsters felt her lifeforce
and were excited. Most of them were mixed breeds between demons and
other monster species. Some looked like insect kings while others were the
outside species… although this was just from the external appearance.

Prisoners were approaching behind her.

"Don't come!"

Before her cry reached them, the ground started to shake and the monster's
feast began. The monsters ran out of the cavern like ants. Jung Heewon bit
her lips and used her hell flames again.

'I shouldn't have come in alone'.
No, what could the others do if they came with her? Could Lee Hyunsung
and the children fight against these distant enemies? Rather, it was good
that she came alone.

"Kuaaack!"

The prisoners were eaten as prey while Jung Heewon wielded the Sword of
Judgment and used Hell Flames Ignition. The burning heat of the
archangel's flames caused the frightened demons to step back and be more
cautious.

She didn't know how long this confrontation could continue. Some
monsters watched the movement of the flames and dared to jump forward.

"Oh, you are an archangel's incarnation."

At this voice, the monsters who weren't afraid of the flames withdrew with
weak groans.

She turned around and see Reinheit. He asked, "Are you ready to be the
chief of the guards?"

"…Can you say that after seeing me?"

Jung Heewon told him, "You are a liar. Paradise? Get away from the horror
of the scenario? Can you say that to me after making this place?"

She pointed the Sword of Judgment at Reinheit. Kim Dokja was right.
There was no such thing as paradise in this world. They… were bound to
continue the scenario.

Reinhart said, "If you want to kill me, you can."

"I don't need your permission."

She would naturally do so. She would borrow the power of her sponsor and
end this terrible nightmare.
[Judgment Time is activated!]

[Constellations of the absolute good system are struggling with your
request.]
            Chapter 164: Ep. 32 - Kim Dokja's Love, III


Jung Heewon was surprised.

…Struggling? Anyone could see that Reinheit was evil. He deceived
countless and produced monsters in this underground area. How could he
not be evil?

[Constellations of the absolute good system entrust the judgment to
incarnation 'Jung Heewon'.]

Reinheit opened his mouth. "If you kill me, Paradise will end."

Jung Heewon's hell flames decreased at these words. There was a faint
smile on Reinheit's face.

"Jung Heewon-ssi, I didn't expect you to be here."

"What…"
"You should've known. Paradise isn't perfect. It is natural for a beautiful
place to have a shadow."

Jung Heewon didn't respond. Ignorance was a deception. Of course, she had
thought about it. This place must be hiding some awful truth. She just didn't
think it would be this…

"Why are you mass producing monsters? Are you going to conquer Dark
Castle?"

"I'm not doing anything. They are just the nutrients of Paradise."

A huge tree trunk could be seen in the center of the cavern. Branches
stretched out like tentacles towards the monsters in the vicinity.

Jung Heewon realized where the tree trunk was heading. The small flower
that bloomed on the hill, the Perpetual Motion.

Jung Heewon's legs were shaking without her knowing. Surely this tree…

"Isn't it strange? Weren't you curious about why the many demon species
on Dark Castle don't invade this place?"

She thought it was strange. It wasn't enough to describe Paradise as a
blessed fortress.

"Why are there so many demons in Dark Castle?"

Rapidly moving branches grabbed the humans one by one. The prisoners
screamed but there was no room for resistance. The rapidly moving
branches tied around the prisoners' bodies and three them into a hole in the
trunk.

A terrible noise was heard and then there was a scream like a soul was
being castrated.
After a while, buds blossomed on the tree trunk. Jung Heewon sensed what
would be born from the bud and shook. In less than a few minutes, a giant
monsters was born from the bud. It was the human who had just been
swallowed by the tree.

The Perpetual Motion was a tree that made demons.

Jung Heewon kept trembling. "H-How can you do this?"

Why couldn't she find any demon species near Paradise? Paradoxically, it
was because Paradise itself was the source of the demon species.

"The demons produced here are released every month on certain days.
There is a limit to the capacity of the prison." Reinheit smiled as he spoke.
"Don't look at me with those eyes. Being a demon isn't necessarily a bad
thing."

"…"

"They can have eternal life and are stronger than humans. In addition…"

The tree emitted a bright light and started to supply nutrients to the earth of
Paradise.

"Their sin is used to sustain the lives of other beings. In other words, they
are martyrs."

It was the source that provided vitality for crops to grow on the barren land
of Dark Castle. This was the role of the Perpetual Motion. Jung Heewon
understood everything and felt desperate.

[Constellations of the absolute good system are demanding you make a
choice.]

If she killed Reinheit, the underground prison would collapse. The
Perpetual Motion would die and the system of Paradise would be destroyed.
People would lose the land and their food. Then they would be torn apart by
the monsters.

"Why… why…" Knowing this, Jung Heewon couldn't kill Reinheit. She
had no confidence in condemning the source of the tragedy when she would
cause a bigger tragedy.

"Somebody has to do it." Reinheit's face was sad. "Life continues for the
losers of the scenario. Someone has to create a place for them."

"If you really care for them, you should help keep the scenario going! Don't
make a place like this. Lead the people and try to clear the scenarios!"

"You don't know. The enemy in the following scenario isn't someone we
can win against."

Jung Heewon was surprised at his gloomy expression. The 2nd ranked
demon marquis of Dark Castle. Who could cause him to feel such fear?

"…What do you know?"

"That isn't important. Even if you clear the following scenario… the 'next'
one is always ready. More losers will be made."

"We can clear all of them! It is a scenario. Won't it end one day? Practice
your skills and build your story…!"

"Do you think we can clear all the scenarios one day?"

Jung Heewon closed her mouth. The end of all the scenarios. Her colleague
Kim Dokja wanted to reach that place.

Reinheit continued speaking, "Do you believe peace will come at that
time?"

Jung Heewon cried out with all her heart. "Yes. I believe."
"Why do you think so? Is there a single person who has reached the end of
the scenario?"

"There are the constellations!"

"The constellations?"

"They exist outside of the scenarios. In other words, there is a way to
escape from this scenario."

The constellations who treated the incarnations like toys. The existences of
such 'absolute' beings actually gave hope. Someday they would be able to
reach that place. They could get away from this hellish scenario.

"Ha. Haha, hahaha…" Reinheit laughed. "I see. The constellations. I
understand your mind. I had thought so as well."

"What do you mean?"

"Why do you think that constellations cleared all the scenarios? Did Kim
Dokja say so?"

Kim Dokja never said this. An ominous feeling entered her heart.

"They certainly are outside the scenario. However, they are just 'outside' the
scenario."

"…"

"They are all doing scenarios like us. 76 times, 84 times. The size and
number of scenarios vary but they are like us."

She had never thought of this before. Jung Heewon asked in a trembling
voice, "T-Then…?"
"The constellations are just powerhouses beyond the standards, born in
the middle of the scenario. They are neither gods or absolute beings."
Reinheit spoke as if declaring an absolute proposition.

"Let me tell you once again. No one has ever reached the 'end' of the
scenarios."

"…"

"This world is eternal hell."

Jung Heewon collapsed to the ground. Even the constellations couldn't do
it. Even the mighty beings couldn't reach that place.

Kim Dokja wanted to go to such a place.

"Something like this… what do you want to do? Kim Dokja, you…"

Reinheit kept speaking. "That's why I made Paradise." Jung Heewon stared

blankly up at Reinheit.

"If this continues, Paradise will someday collapse. The number of humans
is decreasing and the number of demons is constantly increasing. The
nutrients to sustain this land are running out."

At the end of despair and desperation, he created the Paradise of Despair.

"I need a noble human to sustain this tree. There are many souls who
entered this quarter. Kim Dokja is one of them."

Jung Heewon realized what he was talking about. "That's why I'm needed?"

"That's correct. You are chosen by an archangel and will last at least 10
years. A constellation like Kim Dokja will be able to maintain the vitality
of Paradise for more than 200 years."
"Do you think I will just listen to you?"

"You will listen. It is because you are the incarnation of an archangel."

If she sacrificed herself, she would be able to protect Paradise.

"If you help, there will be no need to punish people for minor offences for a
while. You can save thousands, tens of thousands of lives."

Jung Heewon's shoulders trembled. She could save tens of thousands of
people with her life. If she didn't die, tens of thousands of people would die.

She saw a monster reminiscent of a fish squirming on the ground. The face
resembled the woman from Geumho Station. The monster stared at Jung
Heewon with a hungry expression and roared.

"I…"

It was an abandoned life anyway. Her parents, friends and the people who
remembered her were all dead. The end of the scenario was impossible.

Living any further was useless.

"I…"

[Constellations of the absolute good system are looking at you.]

Jung Heewon made a decision. "I understand. Then I…"

If she died to save tens of thousands of people, it was the right thing, the
righteous thing.

Reinheit's expression seemed to soften. At the last moment, something
caught her.

'Then what is my life?'
It was probably empty.

'I… what the hell is this?'

It was the foolish last attachment to life. She already knew the answer.

–Heewon-ssi is a good sword.

–You are calmer in front of the fire than any of us. In particular, you are
sensitive to the tyranny of the strong.

–You always fought at the head of the party and never complained about
how difficult it was.

It was because someone told her the answer already.

–This is the Jung Heewon-ssi that I saw because you continued the
scenario.

Maybe Kim Dokja knew the reality of the scenarios from the beginning.
Even so, he didn't give up.

–That's why I believe you should continue the scenario.

Jung Heewon stood up.

"I can't die here."

Thus, she decided to be selfish. She decided to live, even if many people
died from her choice. She had to live with it.

"No, you will die."

However, sometimes their life and will were irrelevant.

"Then you will become the nutrients of Paradise."
There were a number of demons who couldn't be dealt with even using Hell
Flames Ignition. Jung Heewon's expression tensed and she opened up all
her magic power. She couldn't die. She would never die.

At this moment, there was an explosion and people appeared.

"Heewon-ssi!"

"Ah, Unni went alone again!"

It was the people who sustained her life. Still, Reinheit didn't panic. He
smiled like it was good.

"I'm able to get a lot of nutrients."

This person was the second strongest in Dark Castle. He wasn't afraid of a
group without Kim Dokja.

"Everybody stand back!"

Lee Hyunsung stepped forward and protected his companions. He was
much stronger than before but the situation was bad. Maybe someone
would die in this fight. It would be lucky if all of them didn't die.

How good would it be if Kim Dokja was here? She tried to avoid
depending on Kim Dokja but Jung Heewon couldn't help having this
thought.

"This is your end." Reinheit declared and raised his hand.

Then the entire ceiling collapsed. It was like bombs had poured down in
succession. The ether storm ripped through the branches of the Perpetual
Motion and the shattered ceiling fell towards Reinheit and the monsters.

The crushed monsters let out terrible screams. Somebody's voice was heard
among this chaos.
"You hid in a deep and dirty place."

There was a man and the shadow of a woman chasing him. Yoo Joonghyuk
faced the people looking at him with wonder and confusion and asked, "…
By the way, where is Kim Dokja?"
            Chapter 165: Ep. 32 - Kim Dokja's Love, IV


"Master!" Lee Jihye shouted when she discovered Yoo Joonghyuk.
However, Yoo Joonghyuk asked again without caring about her at all.

"Where is Kim Dokja?"

"…Why are you looking for Dokja ahjussi?"

Yoo Joonghyuk was about to answer when Yoo Sangah carried Yoo Mia
and descended from the ceiling like a beautiful woman. The party members
called out her name. Rather than responding to their greetings, Yoo Sangah
hastily said, "Dokja-ssi is in danger."

"Huh?"

"Do you know where Dokja-ssi is now?"
Just like Yoo Joonghyuk, Yoo Sangah's eyes search the people nervously.
She couldn't see Kim Dokja at all. Lee Hyunsung quickly replied, "Dokja-
ssi left four days ago."

"What do you mean by Dokja-ssi is in danger?" Jung Heewon asked again.
Unfortunately, there was no time to explain.

Lee Jihye added in a frustrated manner. "Didn't you come because you
knew something was wrong? We are the ones in danger, not Dokja ahjussi."

Yoo Sangah had no idea of the situation and replied, "Let's leave this place
and I'll explain."

Due to the turmoil, many monsters were pouring out of the connected
caves. Lee Jihye spoke in a creeped out manner.

"Damn, if Gong Pildu ahjussi was here…"

Certainly, the situation would be a lot different if Gong Pildu was here.
Gong Pildu's stigma Armed Fortress was useful against large numbers and
was suitable for slaughtering many monsters.

However, they already split from Gong Pildu on the first floor of Dark
Castle and it was unclear where he was.

Yoo Joonghyuk was the party's sole comfort. Simply in terms of force, he
was much stronger than Gong Pildu or Kim Dokja. He had enough strength
to crack apart a mountain with his fist.

Yoo Joonghyuk blew away the incoming monsters with Hundred Steps
Godly Fists and said, "It is disadvantageous if we fight here. Let's go out
via the ceiling."

Yoo Joonghyuk sought the fastest method of escape and opened a path in
the monsters. His ability to open a path without a significant consumption
of magic power was close to a human tank. No, a real tank wouldn't be so
powerful. Yoo Sangah asked, "Can we escape?"

"I'll make some steps so jump out yourself."

At these words, Yoo Joonghyuk flew into the air.

It was the Air Steps that only the strongest returnees in the Murim World
Could use. He built a tower with the corpses of monsters for the party
members to step on. Then he went through the ceiling and punched
something to create a platform.

He normally wouldn't have done this for the party. However, Yoo
Joonghyuk in this regression was different. Yoo Joonghyuk himself didn't
know what had made him change. Then he heard a voice in his ears.

[It is a very unexpected situation. You are 'Incarnation Yoo Joonghyuk?']

It was Reinheit's voice. Lee Jihye was amazed as she was running
towards the ceiling. "What, he isn't dead?" It was natural.

The second-ranked being in Dark Castle wouldn't die from a few stones.
Yoo Joonghyuk didn't reply to Reinheit, instead waiting for the rest of them
at the top of the stairs he had made. Lee Jihye, Lee Hyunsung and Yoo
Sangah climbed up first, followed by Lee Gilyoung and Shin Yoosung.

The moment Shin Yoosung was about to pass by, Yoo Joonghyuk grabbed
her shoulder. "You shouldn't come with us."

"Huh?"

Before Shin Yoosung could reply, Yoo Joonghyuk pushed the child down
from the ceiling. The monsters opened their mouths as they waited for Shin
Yoosung. Lee Gilyoung shouted, "Yoosung! What…? What are you
doing?"
The angry Lee Gilyoung swung his fists at Yoo Joonghyuk. Yoo
Joonghyuk lightly grabbed Lee Gilyoung's fist and said, "You should go
too."

After a moment, Lee Gilyoung screamed and fell down along with Shin
Yoosung.


After Dionysus' incarnation left, Han Sooyoung asked me with a serious
expression, "…What the hell was that last thing he said?"

"I don't know."

"You don't know? It was filtered for you as well?"

I didn't hear it. However, I could vaguely guess what he meant. It was
probably related to the 'end' of all scenarios. Then it was natural to be
filtered.

I was challenging the 10th scenario and just became a scenario. I couldn't
get all information at will.

Han Sooyoung stared at me with a grumpy expression and made a small
sigh. "…By the way, what are you going to do about your fate? It must be
really dangerous if the constellations of Olympus are directly coming to
warn you."

"It looks like it."

"Is there no way to completely stop the fate?"

"It isn't completely inevitable. If the execution of fate was absolutely
impossible, the fate would be withdrawn. Fate always followed
'probability'.
In the opposite sense, fate could never be escaped if there was even the
slightest chance of it happening. Han Sooyoung thought about something
and wondered,

"There isn't any specific information? It only mentions your death?"

"That…"

In fact, Dionysus risked losing a huge amount of probability by telling me
the prophecy.

「 Incarnation Kim Dokja will be killed by your most loved ones. 」

To be honest, it was a confusing story for me.

The person I loved most… They were going to kill me?

I hesitated before telling the contents of the prophecy and Han Sooyoung
opened her mouth. As if she didn't know what to say, her face paled and
then reddened.

"The person you love most?"

"Yes."

"…Do you have such a person?"

I felt bad but somehow, I also wanted to ask this. I tried to recall the faces
of every person. There was some affection but there was no one I 'loved'.
Indeed, 'love' was the word that was furthest from my life.

"To be honest, I would say there isn't one."

Han Sooyoung's face became redder at my words. "Then shouldn't the fate
be withdrawn?"

"At first glance, you might think so…"
"Or are you going to fall in love with someone now? Are you the type to
fall in love at first sight?"

"That has never happened and it isn't likely."

The fate message was strong enough to be repeated three times. I was
confused. Had I fallen in love with someone?

Han Sooyoung looked at my complicated expression and opened her
mouth.
"Or there is another possibility."

"What is it?"

"Originally, fate isn't something that should be interpreted literally.
Don't you know Greek mythology? Originally, prophecies aren't
immediately known. It is full of metaphors and symbols." Han
Sooyoung cocked her head.

"Incarnation Kim Dokja will be killed by the person he loves most… what
symbolism or analogies are present in this sentence?"

"Do you mean the sentence might have a surprisingly different meaning?"

"Hrmm…"

Han Sooyoung was an author so she might be surprisingly helpful in
interpreting this aspect. Han Sooyoung started to take out plausible
hypotheses.

"I think there are three possible things."

"What is it? Tell me."

"First. There might be a reason why 'incarnation' was mentioned first."
"…Incarnation?"

It was a point I had inadvertently overlooked.

"Aren't you a constellation now? Then as an incarnation, you have already
died. No?"

It was a plausible hypothesis. However, if this hypothesis was correct, I
would've seen the message about fate being realized the moment I became a
constellation. In other words, there was no reason for the fate messages to
repeat.

Han Sooyoung seemed to think something was lacking as well and came up
with a second hypothesis. "Second, it is possible that the words 'person he
loves most' itself is a metaphor."

"What else is considered a 'person' in the Star Stream?"

"Um… It might be the personification of something."

I tried to think about it but couldn't find a plausible interpretation for this
part.

By the way, I looked at Han Sooyoung and wondered if she was a good
person. I was very grateful for her thinking about all these possibilities for
me.

I watched Han Sooyoung. Her lashes seemed unusually long because of the
lingering twilight. It turned out that this person was quite pretty. In fact,
Han Sooyoung was a bit young but her looks weren't bad.

…Wait a minute. What was I thinking right now? I had to be careful.
Maybe I would be hit by Han Sooyoung if I did something wrong.
Honestly, this person would stab me without any hesitation. In fact, she had
already stabbed me once.
Han Sooyoung spoke again. "The last thing we need to think about is 'die'.
Perhaps this death isn't literally death."

"Then?"

"When do you think people die?"

"That… I suppose when their life is over. Their heart stops and they are no
longer breathing."

Han Sooyoung clicked her tongue like she was disappointed in my answer.
"Well, there is a reason why you kept reading a novel like Ways of
Survival…"

"…Don't start a useless argument. So what do you mean?"

"Don't you read manhwa? Usually you should say something like this.
When a person dies? It is when they are forgotten by people!"

"Those are manhwa. Then are you saying I will be forgotten?"

"It is just an example, you idiot. In the Star Stream, a constellation dies
when they are forgotten. You can think of similar possibilities."

In fact, it didn't sound impossible. The Star Stream was a huge story and
beings with no relationship in the story were naturally wiped out.

I wondered, "Why will people forget me? Is it group amnesia?"

"They might not mean to forget." Han Sooyoung's face suddenly seemed
lonely.

Speaking of which, I didn't know Han Sooyoung's life. Apart from the fact
that she wrote a novel plagiarizing Ways of Survival, I knew nothing about
Han Sooyoung.
…Even now, the part about plagiarism was uncertain. In the past, Han
Sooyoung said she didn't plagiarize and Lie Detection said she was telling
the truth.

I asked after a moment, "Then what do you mean?"

Han Sooyoung seemed to be picking her words as she opened her mouth
with a dark expression. "Kim Dokja, dead people can't remember
anything."

I realized what Han Sooyoung was talking about. We reflexively looked
towards Paradise.

…Perhaps?

Han Sooyoung spoke first. "Should we go back?"

"…It is too late if we go now. It has already been four days. It is impossible
to get there in time."

"Then?"

"It's okay. By now, the strongest reinforcements should've arrived."

"The strongest reinforcements?"

"That guy should be sent…"

At this moment, a message appeared in the air.

[Someone in Dark Castle has achieved the first transcendence in the
scenario!]

It was as I expected. I thought he would've reached that position by now.

I thought about Yoo Joonghyuk, who should be causing a disaster in the
distance. "Now the main character should pay for his meal."
            Chapter 166: Ep. 32 - Kim Dokja's Love, V


Han Sooyoung bit her lips besides me. "When did you become so close to
him? That psychopath…"

"We aren't close."

"You had a very trusting expression when you said those words?"

"You are mistaken. I trust the dokkaebis more than I do him."

If I believed in Yoo Joonghyuk, it was in his experience, not his
personality. This was a guy with three times the experience and he learnt
various types of information from the 41st regression Shin Yoosung.

Furthermore, Paradise was originally his main responsibility. He took care
of it well in the second regression so he should do better this time. Just…

"…I'm a bit worried."
I couldn't be completely relieved because I didn't trust his personality. I had
made various preparations for the party members to attack Paradise but I
couldn't be perfect.

I was a reader, not a writer, and Yoo Joonghyuk was a regressor sunfish. I
hope he felt a lot better since his last psychotic break…

Han Sooyoung spoke with an understanding expression. "Well… if you're
worried then you can go and watch. You have a skill to watch it in real time
anyway."

"…You are aware of it?"

"I didn't know until now."

Well, Han Sooyoung had watched me take over Yoo Joonghyuk last time. I
struggled for a moment before telling her, "Then I'll go. Please wait."

"How much are you going to give me?"

"Why do you want coins every time? You should give a bit of free service
for once."

"…Then do it quickly. I can't deal with some enemies alone.

"If something happens then just wake me up."

I closed my eyes and fell asleep.

[The exclusive skill, 'Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint' stage 3 has been
activated!]

Soon after stage 3 was activated, the voices of the people thinking about me
started to be heard.

I set aside a few voices and chose the one with the widest scenery.
The shaking began from the center of Paradise. The street stalls were
overturned by an intense shock wave that shook the entire ground.

"Aaack, what is this?"

"A monster?"

Everyone looked around but they couldn't figure out the situation. Maybe it
was because they enjoyed peace for too long. Their cerebral cortex, which
had always assumed the worst, were now brainwashed to only imagine the
safest future.

"The guards will resolve it. Don't worry."

"Hang in there!"

In the center of the explosion, Yoo Joonghyuk saw the incarnations of
Paradise. There were faces he knew and faces he didn't know.

In the first regression, Yoo Joonghyuk had been betrayed for trying to save
them and in the second regression, Yoo Joonghyuk destroyed this place
with his own hands.

Finally, the third regression…

Some people held onto Yoo Joonghyuk and asked him questions as he
walked from the blast.

"What? What the hell is happening?"

The people who had just been selling fruit or harvesting crops stared at him
with frightened expressions. Yoo Joonghyuk also faced them. It was
definitely a story, even if it wasn't a scenario.

Yoo Joonghyuk knew the reason. When he saw Paradise for the first time,
he agreed with Reinheit's intention and protected this place.
"H-Help me! Please!"

Of course, it was all in vain. Paradise was no different from the scenario.
Just as the scenarios kept exploiting the incarnations, Paradise was a place
supported by incarnations turned into fertilizer.

There was one thing Yoo Joonghyuk realized after destroying the place
several times. Giant stories always ate small stories. The only laws involved
stories and this was the providence of Star Stream.

Yoo Joonghyuk told the people. "Paradise will soon cease to exist."

"Huh?"

"Find something that you can protect yourself. Then defend it."

The monsters started running out from the passage that Yoo Joonghyuk and
the party members created.

The incarnations shrieked as they watched the giant claws coming from
underground. Some guards belatedly ran to protect the incarnations but it
wasn't enough to stop all the monsters.

"W-Why are they here?"

"The lord! Where it the lord?"

Many guards fell down from one strike of the monsters. The guard captain
just barely managed to escape in time.

Yoo Joonghyuk cut off the limbs of the incoming monsters and looked
around. Jung Heewon and Lee Hyunsung were evacuating people from
various places.

Yoo Joonghyuk muttered, "It is amazing that you survived up to this point."
They might die for people who didn't even know their names. It was the
influence of Kim Dokja. It was a miracle they could make it here with such
a heart.

"No, I was able to come to this place because of those people."

Yoo Joonghyuk frowned after hearing Yoo Sangah's words. "I wasted time
because of you."

"I heard that Dokja-ssi was here when I contacted Olympus."

"The information is either wrong or someone is manipulating the
information."

Or perhaps Kim Dokja somehow manipulated the information. Either way,
it wasn't a favourable situation for Yoo Joonghyuk.

Originally, the strategy to clear Paradise shouldn't be done in this way. In
fact, the current Paradise was the more unsuitable place to attack.

The branches of Perpetual Motion came up from the ground and soared to
the sky.

This was the 'story' of Demon Marquis Reinheit. It was the body of
Paradise, the Perpetual Motion plant that was sustained by souls.

Some monsters climbed on the branches and were released above ground.
The monsters, who had been starving for a long time underground,
discovered their prey and roared as they scattered all over the place. There
was the 5th grade Dark Tracker, the 4th grade Lubel Tiger and even
unknown 3rd grade species.

"Kuaaack!"

In the midst of this terrible carnival, the incarnations found the lord. They
believed he was the salvation who could save them from this tragedy.
"Lord!"

Then the plant moved. The vines stretched out like tentacles. The tip of the
sharp vines pierced the monsters to protect the people of Paradise.

The incarnations cheered. They knew there was only one powerful being in
Paradise.

"This is the lord!"

"Lord!"

[Please rest assured.]

The incarnations' hearts were caught as they listened to Reinheit's voice.

'Our Paradise won't fall so easily'.

Everyone believed this. At least, until the guard captain discovered
something in the smoke.

"Lord…?"

A familiar face was growing from a bud at the end of a branch.

"Uwaaaack!"

The frightened guard captain collapsed on the ground.

"M-Monster! Monster!"

The guard captain, who had long vowed allegiance, lost his composure
when he saw Reinheit was one with the plant. The appearance of the
demon's true body was terrible.

[Ah, Haidel?]
The guard captain confirmed the lord's true appearance and shook with fear.
The power that Reinheit radiated was terrible. It was thanks to Reinheit's
legendary story, Paradise of Despair.

[It finished well. I needed food to recover.]

The flying vines started to swallow the people of Paradise, including the
guards. The vines pierced the incarnations and sucked their small stories.
The inhabitants either became mummies or were turned into demons.

"Stop!"

The hell flames burned several branches. However, there was no end to
them. Jung Heewon shouted, "I thought this was the place you had to
protect! What are you doing?"

[That was until you guys showed up.]

Reinheit laughed. His upper body emerged from the highest branch and he
looked at the landscape of Paradise.

[Paradise is already over.]

The incarnations shook with fear in front of the gigantic Perpetual Motion.
The residents who were in awe of the lord just a moment ago could no
longer be found.

[This is why the presence of small stories is unavoidable. You have lived
on a small tree all your life and didn't know it was actually a forest.]

One by one, the incarnations realized the identity of the world they lived in.
No, maybe they already knew the truth but were ignoring it.

[Thus, I will restart everything.]
Like an umbrella, the branches shot up and started to cover all of Paradise.
It was as if it wanted to absorb all of Paradise. Jung Heewon stared at the
scale and was completely lost.

How could they hurt that? Could humans fight and win against that?

Then a huge explosion occurred from one side of the branches. Along with
the roar, the branches covering the sky were broken. It was like a huge hole
in the roof of Paradise.

[Truly great. You are…]

There was sincere admiration in Reinheit's voice. There was a man with a
huge presence under the damaged roof. Needless to say, it was Yoo
Joonghyuk.

[…You have gone beyond a human.]

Surpassing humans. The words that sounded like rhetoric had a completely
different meaning to beings like Reinheit.

[You reached such a level in only the ninth scenario? Kim Dokja was great
but you… you are the real monster.]

A mighty presence was filling Yoo Joonghyuk's body. Yoo Joonghyuk,
whose eyes were closed, had exceeded his limits by mobilizing all his
capabilities.

'The Rock King's Gloves increases strength by two levels'.

'The Gukryong's Skin increases strength be one level'.

'The Heavenly Sword of Gathering Clouds increases strength by four
levels'.

'The skill buff increases strength by three levels'.
Once strength broke through level 100, a tremendous energy filled Yoo
Joonghyuk's whole body. He remembered the words of his teacher,
Breaking the Sky Sword Saint.

–The first course of transcendence is to go beyond the limits of the body.

Most incarnations thought there was a limit to becoming strong through
their efforts alone. That's why they tried to get better sponsors and show off
to the stronger constellations.

However, the universe was large and some people disagreed with such
cowardice.

There were those who didn't get a good sponsor or a sponsor at all. There
were those who dream of becoming 'one' with their own efforts, not the
assistance of an absolute existence.

–The second course is to train all skills to the limit. The skills that existed
in the world were 'stigmas' left behind by someone. Train all those skills to
the limit. As if climbing a ladder, try and explore the limits of the system.

The constellations devoured stories and strengthened their influence,
constantly tempering their existence into a 'story'.

–The final course is to kick away the ladder. Forget everything you have
accumulated so far. Forget the level, forget the skills and forget the story.
After all, the system that many beings choose is the 'universal' one. The
important thing is that you find your own 'story'.

Training, training and training. Going beyond the limits of the skill with
extreme story and become a story. This was the peak of mortality that could
be compared to constellations.

Those who had talent and worked hard were able to achieve transcending
the limits of their species. In honor of their noble endeavors, the Star
Stream called them transcendent, despite not being constellations.
–These are the minimum conditions to enter the seat of transcendence.

Yoo Joonghyuk had already achieved transcendence in the last regression.
He had already reached it once so it wasn't difficult to climb up again. Only
physical conditions and time were needed.

Yoo Joonghyuk's golden aura was formed around the Heavenly Sword of
Gathering Clouds. Despite obviously using a skill, the message about the
skill usage didn't pop up.

It was because this power wasn't using the 'system'. It was a power built up
by Yoo Joonghyuk alone.

"Reinheit, I beat you in the last round."

Yoo Joonghyuk aimed two swords towards the Perpetual Motion that had
become a huge forest.

"This time I will kill you."
             Chapter 167: Ep. 32 - Kim Dokja's Love, VI


The air burst like a fighter jet had passed by. The places hit by the golden
energy cracked apart. The monsters caught in the crack were torn apart
without even being able to scream. The golden light blew away 4th and 5th
grade species.

Breaking the Sky Sword. This was the road of the sword that broke the sky.

Even the 3rd grade monsters, which could easily destroy the area in 10
minutes, screamed because they couldn't resist this sword.

How long had Yoo Joonghyuk practiced this sword? 10 years? 20 years? If
he combined the training in the time dark dimension, it would be well over
100 years. Thanks to all these years, Yoo Joonghyuk was able to reach the
peak of humanity.

'My physical limits is still low but I can barely do it'.
Yoo Joonghyuk controlled his overloaded body and constantly swung his
sword. This transcendent power couldn't last long, no matter how strong he
was. His level was also far less than his teacher, the Breaking the Sky
Sword Saint.

Nevertheless, his attacks were far beyond the general 'skills' category. The
monsters exploded like firecrackers and Reinheit was amazed.

[The rumours of transcendence aren't false. But how can a human who isn't
a returnee…?]

Reinheit didn't finish his words. The place where he had just been located
was torn apart from the ether blades of Yoo Joonghyuk's Splitting the Sky
Sword.

It was a truly formidable destructive power. This was the power of the
Breaking the Sky Energy.

"Be careful! People are getting caught up in it!" Yoo Sangah shouted at
Yoo Joonghyuk but he ignored her.

In the first place, he was good at destroying things, not saving things.

"This is the master of a legendary-grade story. It isn't easy to defeat him. In
Paradise, his strength is equivalent to a 2nd grade monster.

In fact, Reinheit's Perpetual Motion showed no signs of receding despite the
damage. Rather, the branches were angry and absorbed more of the humans
around them.

"Aaaaack!"

The rate at which the Perpetual Motion grew was faster than the rate at
which humans were rescued. In addition, there were still a lot of monsters.

Yoo Sangah opened her mouth as she used Hermes Walking Method and
Theseus' Resolution to kill the surrounding beasts. "It doesn't end. Where
have they been hiding these monsters?"

"The monsters are the exports of Paradise."

"Exports?"

Yoo Joonghyuk looked up at the air for a short moment. The dokkaebis
who said they wouldn't interfere were gathering, as if it was a fun sight.

[Huh… this is difficult.]

[It looks like a new farm is needed.]

Yoo Sangah didn't immediately understand what they meant. In the midst
of the surging beasts, she could see monsters that were familiar from
previous scenarios.

9th grade ground rats, 8th grade grolls…

"The monsters used in the scenario. Have you ever wondered where they
came from?" Yoo Joonghyuk asked her.

"They came from another world…"

"There is a limit using that method. The dokkaebis are busy and don't have
time for inefficient work."

Yoo Sangah stared blankly at Yoo Joonghyuk, the dokkaebis and the
monsters of Paradise. She was frozen and it was Jung Heewon, using Hell
Flames Ignition by her side, who reacted first.

"Saying this now…"

Yoo Joonghyuk nodded. "Paradise is the source of the monsters of Star
Stream. To be precise, it is one of them."
In Jung Heewon's mind, some things that hadn't been understood finally fit
together. The second floor of Dark Castle. The reason why the dokkaebis,
who were involved in everything, didn't interfere for the first time. If she
thought about it, there was a reason for everything.

[Dokkaebis! A new Paradise can be created!]

In the distance, the upper half of the restored Reinheit grew on the
Perpetual Motion again.

[There might be a fairly low volume for a while but the restoration will
soon be completed! Please don't cancel the contract!]

The despair and desperation inside him was something that couldn't be
shared. This was a world that sacrificed the incarnations to protect the
incarnations.

Reinheit was devoted to his beliefs, even if those beliefs made him a
monster. The incarnations belatedly discovered the dokkaebis floating in
the air and shouted.

"Dokkaebi! Dokkaebi!"

"Uhh, has the scenario started?"

"Why? Why do this? We didn't anything wrong!"

The dokkaebis just laughed.

[Why? You did nothing wrong.]

[This wasn't what we intended.] Hahaha!]

Jung Heewon bit her lips at the sight. She didn't want to see anymore.

"Is there no way?"
Of course, there was a way. If he used Giant Body Transformation and then
transcendence, he would be able to press Reinheit with his strength.

'However, the consumption is too big. All of Paradise will fly away'.

The regressor Yoo Joonghyuk didn't favour such inefficient fighting.

"If we want to kill him, we have to get rid of the roots of the Perpetual
Motion."

The core power source of the Perpetual Motion lay in the roots.

If the roots were removed, he could overpower the Perpetual Motion. The
problem was the monster in the 'roots'. It was a mighty monster that even
Reinheit couldn't control.

'Even if I had the sixth ranked demon, Sephirots…'

If he had Sephirots as a colleague as he planned then it would've been much
easier to hit Paradise. However, Sephirots was already dead when he went
to pick Sephirots up.

'There is a person hunting rankers as fast as me'.

The first one he thought of was Kim Dokja, but there was no guarantee
that it was Kim Dokja. There were too many variables in this regression.
"We can't enter underground. What should we do?"

"There is no need to enter. I've already entrusted it to someone."

Jung Heewon's eyes instantly widened. "You, don't tell me…!"

She noticed exactly who wasn't present right now. However, Yoo
Joonghyuk spoke before she could. "Kim Dokja didn't leave all of you
behind for no reason."
Perhaps he was able to think of it because he was a regressor. He was
always one-sidedly read by Kim Dokja but this time he was about to read
Kim Dokja's thoughts.

[The constellation who doesn't yet have a name is smiling.]

Yoo Joonghyuk sensed the gaze and his expression distorted.


In the midst of the swarming monsters, Shin Yoosung and Lee Gilyoung
lay curled up against each other. The concentration of monsters was so high
that the children's small bodies couldn't be found.

In a moment of crisis, they helpfully tamed some 8th grade monsters, the
giant wasps. The wasps danced around Shin Yoosung and Lee Gilyoung,
distracting the beasts' eyes. However, there was a limit to the wasp's dance.

The two children's eyes met.

'What should we do?'

'I don't know'.

Beast Master Shin Yoosung and Insect Master Lee Gilyoung. The two of
them were currently the most powerful tamers in Seoul.

However, even they couldn't tame all these monsters. Their brains would
explode and they would die. In fact, the limit they were capable of with
Taming was a 4th grade species. The 3rd grade species was also possible if
they overdid it, but only for a moment.

'…Am I going to die like this?'

The more powerful monsters trampled on the surrounding monsters and the
ecology of the whole area gradually calmed down.
The devil wolves and dark splinters bared their fangs and sniffed around.
The frightened wasps danced harder but discovery was only a matter of
time.

There was also another threat besides the monsters. The branches of the
Perpetual Motion moved through the monsters and rushed towards the
children.

Lee Gilyoung embraced Shin Yoosung and it seemed like the branches
were going to pierce the two children.

At this moment, the branches stopped due to a powerful energy that was
fired from somewhere. The branches seemed panicked and finally turned
away from the children. Shin Yoosung turned in the direction of the energy
that stopped the branches.

'What is that?'

There was a monster who saw through the wasps' dance and was staring
this way.

At first, Shin Yoosung didn't think 'it' was a monster. It was too big to
fathom as a living creature. Its body occupied exactly one third of this
cavern. Yellow eyes blinked in the darkness and all the hairs on Shin
Yoosung's body rose.

This wasn't a 'monster'. She couldn't think of it using this term. It was an
existence that overwhelmed all monsters.

All the noise in the area quieted down. Everything was bowing in awe
before the monster. The being with such a ridiculous presence was looking
this way with interested eyes.

'Who are you?'
It seemed to be asking. Shin Yoosung wasn't willing to answer the question.
Looking back, Lee Gilyoung was in a similar state to her.

Shin Yoosung raised her courage first. "…Hey."

Lee Gilyoung shook his head with fright. "It is impossible. We can't do it."

Those who raised Diverse Communication to the limit could understand
each other's intentions without saying anything.

"In any case, we will die if this continues."

Shin Yoosung carefully got up and staggered towards the monster. The
monsters around her were snarling wildly but the child didn't care. At this
moment, Shin Yoosung realized her usefulness.

'This is why ahjussi left me here'.

Only she could do this.

"Damn." Lee Gilyoung cursed and followed behind her.

As soon as they approached, the presence of the huge monster became
much stronger than before. Shin Yoosung felt like her skin was being
peeled off in front of this monster's gaze.

[The exclusive skill 'Advanced Diverse Communication Lv. 5' has been
activated!]

The transparent aura shot towards the monster in an instant. Diverse
Communication. It was a skill made to understand different species.

The moment that the aura touched the monster, Shin Yoosung felt an
overwhelming flood of memories.

'Ah, ahh…'
The terrible memories of the monster flowed into her head. An existence
who fell to the bottom of this miserable Paradise and grew up eating other
monsters. Eat, eat, despair and scream. A monster who walked through a
hell that couldn't be described using human language.

The blood vessels couldn't cope with the excessive blood flow and burst.
Blood flowed from Shin Yoosung's nose and mouth. She shed tears of
blood.

Lee Gilyoung tried to control Shin Yoosung but the situation was already
getting out of control.

In the end, Lee Gilyoung also triggered Diverse Communication.

The two children, who had always been fighting, joined hands at this
moment. Lee Gilyoung's power was added and the channel of
understanding widened.

However, it was still an arduous opponent. Soon, blood poured from Lee
Gilyoung's nose.

"U… Uwaaaack!"

Shin Yoosung understood the suffering of the strange beast and wanted to
give up everything for the first time. There was the sound of a vessel being
broken as Shin Yoosung and Lee Gilyoung's spirits collapsed little by little.

It was the cost of trying to tame an ego they couldn't cope with, an
opponent they couldn't touch.

At this moment, Shin Yoosung felt eyes on her back. It was as if someone
was looking at her. A being that wasn't pushed at all by the monster's
presence was watching her.

[The constellation who doesn't yet have a name is looking at you.]
             Chapter 168: Ep. 32 - Kim Dokja's Love, VII


The constellation who doesn't yet have a name. Shin Yoosung was well
aware of who it was referring to.

'Ahjussi'.

It was only a gaze but in fact, many people died because there wasn't a
'gaze' at an important moment.

In that sense, Shin Yoosung was lucky.

[The constellation who doesn't yet have a name is nodding.]

Shin Yoosung received the attention of only one person in the world and
stepped forward.

She could do it. Her legs were numb and her lips couldn't move, but she
was convinced.
One step, another step.

The child's small hands soon reached the outer shell of the monster. There
was a very small wound on the outer shell. The startled monster's eyes
shone. Shin Yoosung stared straight at the monster rather than avoid the
monster's eyes.

"Look straight at me."

Looking closer, it wasn't just one wound. Numerous scars were covering
the outer shell of the monster's entire body.

The monster let out a small cry. Perhaps no one had seen its wounds before.
The cuts were created a long time ago. These wounds were the very
existence of this monster. Due to these wounds, the monster became
stronger but it also became lonely.

Shin Yoosung's face distorted as if she vividly felt the pain. "You shouldn't
be a monster just because you are hurt."

Shin Yoosung slowly touched the monster's injuries. However, they were
wounds that couldn't be healed no matter how long passed.

That didn't mean she would give up. There would be a miracle. Just like
Kim Dokja saved the 41st regression Shin Yoosung. Even those who
couldn't be healed could be saved.

Shin Yoosung saw the roots of the Perpetual Motion that pushed down on
the monster. Perhaps this monster had been tied up in this place for a
lifetime.

Shin Yoosung pulled out a golden fruit.

[Ancient Beast's Fruit].
It was the SSS-grade item that emerged from the random box Kim Dokja
had given to her one day. It was a consumable item that could be used to
tame an historical-grade monster that couldn't be tamed.

She slowly bowed to the monster and said, "Let's go together."




It felt like Paradise was experiencing an earthquake and Reinheit shouted in
a baffled manner.

[Keuk, kuheok, w-what is this…!]

The Perpetual Motion suddenly collapsed. Little by little, the plant's
branches and leaves were wilting. The supplied energy was drifting to a
distant place.

By the time Reinheit realized something was wrong, the branches in the air
were already breaking.

[Kuheeeeok! H-How? How can…!]

Reinheit started vomiting. Sap poured out like it was blood.

Something was eating at the base of the Perpetual Motion. As the eerie
teeth penetrated the sharp roots, Reinheit screamed like his body was being
torn apart. The being tied to the roots of Paradise for a long time was now
destroying the roots.

The Perpetual Motion lost power and started to collapse.

[N-No. No…!]

Something huge exploded from under the ground. It didn't have a rating
because it had never been revealed to the world.
It had a huge dragon's body, a demon's wings and the eyes of an insect. It
was the ultimate monster that evolved from the interbreeding of demon
species, insect kings and other monster species.

Everything in Paradise saw this miracle and Yoo Joonghyuk was one of
them. "…Chimera dragon."

This was the real monster of Paradise. The power was close to the 2nd
grade but its potential was beyond the 1st grade. Despite starting from the
bottom, it could threaten even a dragon, the strongest monster species. Yet
the bleeding Shin Yoosung and Lee Gilyoung were riding on its back.

Jung Heewon exclaimed with joy. "Yoosung! Gilyoung!"

The two children had done it after all.

The chimera dragon roared and all the monsters in Paradise withdrew at
once. There were those who escaped back underground, those who were
frightened unconscious on the spot and those who escaped beyond the
walls.

In the midst of this mess, Reinheit staggered away from the Perpetual
Motion and ran away.

Yoo Joonghyuk didn't miss this opening. The Breaking the Sky Sword
moved and Reinheit wasn't able to escape the sword.

"Uh…Uhhh… kuheook…"

Black blood poured from his mouth. No matter how powerful a demon he
was, he couldn't survive his heart being pierced. Reinheit slowly collapsed
and Yoo Joonghyuk and the party members approached him.

The dying master of Paradise said, "Ha, haha… all of that… in the end, it is
nothing but a small play for those bigshots…"
Yoo Joonghyuk stared down at the bleeding and muttering Reinheit.

Reinheit stared at the Perpetual Motion disappearing in the sky and his
breathing became rough. "You might not believe it but I… I just wanted to
create a good world."

Some people who heard this yelled at him. They were all people who had
been protected by Paradise. Some called him a hypocrite while other
shouted that they should immediately kill Reinheit.

Now that they knew the secret of Paradise, they no longer protected
Reinheit. However, none of them moved. It was because Yoo Joonghyuk
didn't allow it.

Tears flowed from Reinheit's eyes. "I, I really…"

"I know."

Reinheit slowly closed his eyes at the short answer.

Yoo Joonghyuk spoke once again. "Everybody knows."

Of course they knew. Reinheit burst out laughing when he saw the life that
he lived was so easily seen. "Strange. Why… do I feel like you actually
understand…"

Yoo Joonghyuk stared down at Reinheit. It wasn't in this round of
regression but Yoo Joonghyuk had also sympathized with Reinheit's will.
The memories of raising Paradise together and then destroying Paradise
weer still clear.

As if to reciprocate the feelings, Reinheit spoke in a pained voice. "You…
will go to the next floor?"

The next floor. This was the location of the last scenario of Dark Castle.
"You… won't find what you are looking for. This castle, it is just the
constellations' playground. So be careful. The next floor…"

At this moment, Reinheit's body exploded. Yoo Joonghyuk stared silently
into the air where the dokkaebis were smiling.

[Nah uh, that is prohibited.]

[Right, right. This isn't fun.]

Then the messages of the constellations came like they had been waiting.
[Many constellations admire the performance of the incarnation 'Yoo
Joonghyuk'.]

[Constellations of the absolute good system agree with the judgment of
'Yoo Joonghyuk'.]

[Some constellations express regret over the collapse of Paradise.]

…

[Many constellations have sponsored 150,000 coins!]

Yoo Joonghyuk's expression didn't change. The eyes of joy or sorrow
weren't revealed.

[You have defeated the Demon Marquis Reinheit!]

[150,000 coins have been acquired.]

[The legendary-grade story 'Paradise of Despair' has been acquired.]

[Your Dark Castle ranking has been adjusted!]

[A new main scenario has appeared.]

[Main Scenario #10 ― '73rd Demon King' is temporarily opened.]
Everything was so perfectly solved that he couldn't do better. It didn't
follow his plan but he raised his Dark Castle ranking, collected coins and
got a clue about the next scenario.

Nevertheless… Yoo Joonghyuk didn't know what these complicated
emotions were. He looked down at his hands and started brooding.

"Our saviour!"

"You are the saviour!"

He looked back at the shouts and saw people rushing towards him. They
treated him as a Messiah as people knelt before him and cried. They were
grateful to him for destroying Paradise.

"Thank you! Thank you very much!"

"If it wasn't for you, we…"

Yoo Joonghyuk heard these words and looked back down at his bloody
hands. Then he realized the identity of these emotions.

Originally, he had no intention of saving these people. The people of
Paradise weren't important to him at all. If Reinheit saw them as a sacrifice
for Paradise, Yoo Joonghyuk considered them a sacrifice to clear the
scenario.

"Thank you."

Yoo Joonghyuk listened to the voices and thought about it. Since when did
this happen? From the second regression? No, perhaps the precursor had
already been there.

His goal was to finish all the scenarios and save the world. Under this
tremendous conviction, he kept running forward. On this lonely and slow
run, he was worn down bit by bit.
There was no meaning in saving the world if everyone was dead. Yet he
stood by and watched people die. It was as if he took the sacrifices for
granted.

After seeing Reinheit's death, Yoo Joonghyuk started to rethink his goal for
the first time.

"Can I ask for your name?" Someone asked for his name.

Being famous in the Star Stream was directly related to the strength of the
story. By answering with his own name, he would be able to gain new
achievements. Yoo Joonghyuk was well aware of this.

Yoo Joonghyuk thought for a moment before slowly opening his mouth.
"My name is Kim Dokja."




"My name is Kim Dokja."

As I was observing using 'third person's viewpoint', I heard Yoo
Joonghyuk's words and felt a chill.

[A new achievement has been added to your fifth story.]

[The inhabitants of Paradise will remember the 'Liberator of Paradise Kim
Dokja'.]

[The 'Lone Messiah' story has become even richer.]

This situation didn't make sense. I panicked when I saw that the people of
Paradise would remember the name 'Kim Dokja'.

No, why was my name listed all of a sudden?
[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' is shedding tears at this true
companionship.]

Uriel, who had been quiet for a while, started jumping with excitement. I
would've scolded her previously but after the banquet, harsh words couldn't
emerge.

However, that Yoo Joonghyuk bastard… he was really mysterious. That
egoist couldn't hand his achievements to other people. Did he want to make
friends with me now?

It wasn't possible.

That reminded me, all the party members except for myself and Han
Sooyoung were gathered in one place. No, Gong Pilduwasn't present…
damn, where did that guy go?

"By the way, why are you looking for Dokja ahjussi?"

The people who were excited about the chimera dragon tamed by Shin
Yoosung and Lee Gilyoung started talking about me.

"That…"

The faces of the party members changed after hearing Yoo Sangah's
explanation.

I wasn't too surprised. Yoo Sangah must've stolen the prophecy from the
Moerae. Perhaps like Dionysus, she was struggling to save me.

"Ahjussi will die?"

"By the person he loves most?"

「 Incarnation Kim Dokja will be killed by the person he loves most. 」
The party members had extremely confused expressions. Jung Heewon
looked puzzled, Shin Yoosung was concerned and Lee Hyunsung was
struggling with something. Lee Jihye was the first one to open her mouth.
"Ahjussi will just revive again after dying. Isn't it fine?"

Yoo Sangah replied to Lee Jihye's question. "It is a good thing but I don't
know how many times he can resurrect…"

"It is a prophecy of Olympus and it isn't that easy to avoid."

Jung Heewon's words caused the party members to look serious again.
They were this worried about me.

Jung Heewon asked, "Then who is the person Dokja-ssi loves most? Don't
we need to know this first?"
           Chapter 169: Ep. 32 - Kim Dokja's Love, VIII


Everyone made expressions of belated realization. They understood that
they hadn't thought of the fundamental problem. At this moment, Lee Jihye
opened her mouth again. "That…"

Lee Jihye raised her hand. I felt somewhat uneasy.

By the way…

"Yes, Jihye? Do you know something?"

"No, you don't think it is me…?"

What bullshit was this girl saying? Lee Jihye's comment seemed to relax
the party members.

Jung Heewon asked, "What? Did Dokja-ssi do something? That man,
towards a minor…'
"No, that's not it…"

"Then?"

"I just thought about it using common sense. I am a high school girl. Then
he should like me…"

The party members ignored Lee Jihye and continued the discussion. It was
Jung Heewon who gave her opinion first. "My guess is that Dokja-ssi's
most loved person is Yoo Sangah-ssi."

"Huh?" Yoo Sangah was startled. She was so surprised that I was hurt.
"Why
me…?"

"It should be like this. In fact, Yoo Sangah-ssi's beauty… well, I don't need
to mention it."

The members nodded and Yoo Sangah's face turned red.

Jung Heewon kept speaking. "You are running around everywhere to save
Dokja-ssi… I honestly think it would be strange if Dokja-ssi doesn't like
Yoo Sangah-ssi."

Certainly, there was no one who wouldn't like Yoo Sangah. She was
pretty, kind, had a good personality… There was no denying it.

"Huh? Just… I'm just a work colleague and received help from Dokja-
ssi…"

Yoo Sangah acted like it was difficult situation before she suddenly hit
back at Jung Heewon. "I actually thought it was Heewon-ssi."

"Uh…yes? Me?"

"Yes, I think that Dokja-ssi iikes Heewon-ssi."
Jung Heewon was surprised by the unexpected counterattack and her eyes
widened. Lee Hyunsung also jumped with shock. It was an interesting
hypothesis for me as well.

"This… Dokja-ssi is really kind to Heewon-ssi. He gave you equipment
and… Heewon-ssi seemed to smile very well when talking to Dokja-ssi…"

Certainly, there seemed to be such a thing. It was very easy for me to
converse with Jung Heewon. It was in the sense that she was a 'character' I
found and raised.

The confused Jung Heewon shook her hands with a flushed face. "Huh?
No, wait a minute. That…"

The party members started to gossip again. It didn't feel good. Lee Jihye
stood alone and muttered 'Kim Dokja is trash'.

No, I didn't do anything wrong…

This time, it was Lee Gilyoung who interrupted. "I don't think 'love'
necessarily means love between a man and woman!"

"Maybe… then what do you think Gilyoung?"

"Dokja hyung likes me."

"Why do you say that?"

"That…"

Lee Gilyoung agonized over the question before giant tears started to spill
from his eyes. It seemed that no matter how much he thought about it, he
couldn't find a reason why I would love him. This time, it was Lee
Hyunsung who spoke, "Um, ahem. Perhaps it's the love between
'comradesin-arms'…"
People simultaneously stared at Yoo Joonghyuk. Yoo Joonghyuk, who
was standing with his arms crossed, frowned. "What are you looking at?"
Lee Jihye and Jung Heewon were whispering to each other.

"…Ah, perhaps."

"Right? Isn't this right?"

[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' is nodding violently!]

At this time, the quietly listening Shin Yoosung raised her hand. "Excuse
me…"

The party members tacitly realized something. Among them, the one who
might know my mind best was my incarnation Shin Yoosung.

"Y-Yes! Yoosung! Speak!"

"Do you know anything?"

Shin Yoosung slowly shook her head. The expressions of the party
members were disappointed. However, Shin Yoosung's words weren't over
yet.

"Why don't you just ask ahjussi?"

"What? Dokja-ssi? How?"

I suddenly felt cold. Shin Yoosung was looking exactly where I was
watching them. As always, my ominous feeling was correct.

My lovely incarnation smiled and pointed at me. "Ahjussi is listening to our
conversation after all."

…Damn.
[The constellation who doesn't yet have a name is wrong.]

"Again."

[The constellation who doesn't yet have a name is wrong.]

"One more time."

[The constellation who doesn't yet have a name says he was really wrong.]

After repeatedly apologizing, the party members―especially Jung Heewon
and Yoo Sangah, barely forgave me.

Jung Heewon said, "Then… who is the person Dokja-ssi loves most?"

I was about to answer when Lee Hyunsung spoke up. "Come to think of it,
it might be no one here."

"Ah, that reminds me, Dokja-ssi left with that woman. The name… Han
Sooyoung?" Jung Heewon also added.

Yoo Sangah's expression hardened at Han Sooyoung's words. "Are you
with that woman right now?"

Yoo Sangah's expression was greatly disappointed because she didn't like
Han Sooyoung.

…I needed to speak before things got worse. I took a deep breath and sent
an indirect message.

[The constellation who doesn't yet have a name says he doesn't love
anyone.]
An unknown atmosphere covered the party members. Some were
disappointed while some were excited. No, why were they so interested in
the love life of others?

Jung Heewon said, "You have to say it precisely. There is no one 'right
now'. According to fate, Dokja-ssi will surely love someone."

Well… she wasn't wrong. Jung Heewon continued speaking. "Then I will
change the question. What type of style does Dokja-ssi like? Is it close to
one of us?"

No, why should I tell them?

"I know you are wondering why you should answer but it is important to
us.
If Dokja-ssi likes one of us, we might be able to stop that fate."

…It was slightly convincing. Fate was very powerful but as I said, it wasn't
inevitable. If I knew who I loved, I might be able to go against fate.

I felt sorry that the party members were so worried about my death.
However…

[The constellation who doesn't yet have a name isn't sure.]

In the end, Jung Heewon was irritated. "Oh, why are you so frustrating?"

"Ahjussi, it's fine to tell us! Is it the time to be polite?"

[The constellation who doesn't yet have a name says there is no such thing.]

Damn, I had to use a lot of coins to send the indirect messages.

[The constellation who doesn't yet have a name doesn't know his heart.]

"Dokja-ssi really…"
[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' is interested in the
new story.]

[The constellation 'Secretive Plotter' wonders about your choice.]

[The constellation 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' is glancing this way.]

[Many constellations are choking on sweet potatoes are your frustrating
answer.]

Even the constellations were listening to our conversation.

[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' is telling you not to deceive
yourself on your heart.]

[Some constellations declare there is no one apart from the incarnation 'Yoo
Sangah'.]

[Some constellations support the incarnation 'Shin Yoosung'.]

[Some constellations who love true friends support the incarnation 'Lee
Hyunsung'.]

…This was an utter mess.

[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' has a good idea.]

The next moment, an item popped out of thin air.
  [Item Information]

  Name: Affection Reader

  Rating: SS

  Description: An item that lets you know what the other person thinks
  about you. After pressing the button and thinking about the name and
  appearance of the other person, the affection number will automatically
  appear in the air.


I became distracted the moment I saw this item. The Affection Reader was
a luxurious item that could only be purchased by platinum members of the
Dokkaebi Bag.

No, using 100,000 coins for this unhealthy entertainment? Was she crazy?

"As expected from an archangel! This is big!" Jung Heewon shouted.

[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' says to try and use it.]

"Then who will go first?"

"It is Heewon unni's sponsor so let her try first."

"Uh, um. Shall I?"

Jung Heewon became slightly nervous once it was time to use it. I was also
tense. Why was I so nervous when I was finally getting to know my heart?

…It felt like I was naked. I felt really strange as I saw everyone focus on
the
Affection Reader. After a while…
There was a beeping sound and the message slowly appeared.

[The affection score of the constellation 'Kim Dokja' towards the
incarnation 'Jung Heewon' is 54 points.]

The nervous Jung Heewon was disappointed when she saw the score. "54
points? Is that high?"

"I want to try next!" Lee Jihye took away the reader and cried out playfully
as she pressed the button. "Let me know Kim Dokja's heart!"

[The affection score of the constellation 'Kim Dokja' towards the
incarnation 'Lee Jihye' is 6 points.]

"…"

Lee Jihye was in a daze as the other members used the reader. Then it was
Lee Gilyoung, Lee Hyunsung and Shin Yoosung. Their scores were 49
points, 50 pints and 56 points respectively. In the corner, Lee Jihye was
muttering, "Kim Dokja is trash." On the other hand, Shin Yoosung was
excited.

Finally, only Yoo Sangah and Yoo Joonghyuk were left.

"J-Joonghyuk-ssi first…"

"I have no intention of joking around."

Yoo Joonghyuk went to search the monster corpses in the distance and all
eyes naturally turned to Yoo Sangah.

Yoo Sangah took the reader. Then just before she used it…

[The constellation 'Queen of the Darkest Spring' presents a special item to
incarnation 'Yoo Sangah'.]
Clothes fell out of the air and the clothing of Yoo Sangah changed. It was
into a black Chinese dress with a black garter belt.

Yoo Sangah stuttered at the sudden change. "T-T-This is…"

I felt desperate at the sight of Yoo Sangah and inwardly cursed. That damn
granny of Olympus.

Jung Heewon, who didn't know anything, nodded. "Ah, it is a constellation
event?"

"Sangah noona, come forward."

Yoo Sangah pressed the button.

[The affection score of the constellation 'Kim Dokja' towards the
incarnation
'Yoo Sangah' is 481 points.]

"4-481 points? Isn't that crazy? Doesn't this confirm it?"

"Dokja-ssi's favourite person is really…"

Yoo Sangah was stuttering with a red face when Lee Jihye felt something
strange and opened her mouth. "No wait… Sangah unni. Can you lend me
those clothes?"

"Uh, yes."

Lee Jihye entered a nearby building to change clothes before pressing the
button of the reader.

[The affection score of the constellation 'Kim Dokja' towards the
incarnation 'Lee Jihye' is 481 points.]

Everyone was speechless.
I couldn't say anything through my shame. Lee Jihye shouted ridicule
towards the air, Jung Heewon grabbed her belly and shook as she laughed
and Yoo Sangah muttered with blank eyes,

"It isn't a person he loves most…"

Lee Gilyoung and Lee Hyunsung were shaking their heads. Shit, this was
why I didn't want to do this…

Shin Yoosung was shivering as she watched me. I wanted to apologize
when I saw my incarnation's reaction, but Shin Yoosung shouted first.

"A-ahjussi!"

Yes, sorry Yoosung. I…

"Ahjussi! What's wrong? Ahjussi!"

The pale Shin Yoosung stretched out a hand towards the air. There was
something strange.

…Eh? Shin Yoosung's voice became distance and my vision swirled as I
became dizzy.

Wait. This was perhaps…

The next moment, my consciousness was cut off along with the message.

[You have died.]
               Chapter 170: Ep. 33 - Reading Again, I


I remembered the moment I read a novel for the first time.

The texture of the soft paper touching my fingertips. The black letters
blooming on a white field. The texture of the page I folded with my hands.

「 It isn't important to read the letters. The important thing is where the
letters lead you. 」

My mother, who loved books, used to say this. At least for me, it wasn't just
a saying.

The gaps in the black print. My own little snow garden lay in between the
letters. This space, which was too small for someone to go into, was a
perfect place for a child who liked to hide. Every time a pleasant sound was
heard, the letters stacked up like snow.

In it, I became a hero. I had adventures, loved and dreamt. Thus, I read,
read and read again.
I remembered the first time I was about to finish a book. It was like being
deprived of the world.

The protagonist and supporting characters walked off with the sentence
'They lived happily ever after' and I was left alone at the end of the story. In
my vanity and sense of betrayal, my young self struggled because I couldn't
stand the loneliness.

「This… is the end? 」

Perhaps it was similar to learning about death. For the first time, I realized
that something was finite.

My mother said, 「This is the end. 」

「There isn't anything that comes next? 」

「There is no 'next'. 」

My mother was cold as she told me a brutal truth.

「 However, just because it is the end doesn't mean you've seen the whole
story. 」

Then she gave me wise advice.

「 Yes? 」

「 Read it again. 」

Reread the finished story. As a child, I didn't know what this meant.

「 Why read a story I already know? 」

「 If you read it again, it will definitely be a different story. 」

「…I don't want to. 」
I was stubborn because I was afraid of feeling the deprivation again. Then
my mother said, 「 Do you want to read it together? 」

Thus, I learnt to read again.

At first, I only saw the main character's position. The second reading
showed the position of the supporting character and the third reading
showed the position of the enemy.

The story changed every time I read it. The story was over but it wasn't
over. The story wouldn't end unless the reader gave up on the story.

I still thought about it often. What if my mother had said something else at
that time?

All fiction was fake and it would just be a loss of my life if I read it.

Would I then have a lot of friends? What if I didn't study hard, wasn't
bullied and didn't run away from the reality given to me?

Sparks appeared in the air and the flowing memories were broken.

「 Kim Dokja. You look relaxed. 」

I turned my head and saw someone standing in the darkness. It was a
presence that could easily pierce other people's dreams. Apart from a
mighty god, the only possible people who could do this were prophets.
However, the person here wasn't Anna Croft.

「 Is 'fate' bearable? 」

I knew this face. It was a crowned wanderer dressed in old clothes. That
reminded me, there was a prophet among the constellations.

'Poked Out His Eyes'.
It was King Oedipus of Olympus, who I met at the banquet. King Oedipus
said to me.

「 Your fate is approaching. 」

'Fate? Hasn't it already been realized? Aren't I dead as you planned?'

「 This isn't a fate that can be avoided with a shameful story. You have to
decide which side you will stand on soon. I believe you will make the right
choice. 」

'I'm not on anyone's side'.

King Oedipus laughed.

「 You will definitely come to Olympus. It is because no incarnation fits
the story of Olympus as much as you. 」

'What are you talking about…'

Before I could finish speaking, my memories came back.

「 Dokja. 」

Shit. I remembered this. It was a bloody living room. My mother was
holding a knife and standing in front of a dead man.

「 From now on, I will read all of this again. 」

My mother smiled towards me and said.

「Thus, you have to remember well. Understood? 」

A nightmare was coming towards me. I heard screaming. King Oedipus's
voice was heard, as if he was laughing at all the memories.
「 Succeed the Carnival of Lightning. Otherwise you will die 'forever' in
the following scenarios. 」




[The attribute 'Eight Lives' has been activated.]

[Your body will be resurrected.]

My breath burst out of me like amniotic fluid.

[The second head of the snake has been sacrificed.]

[The power of the head is 'intelligence'.]

My cold skin turned warm again and my stretched muscles gained strength.
This was the fourth death I had experienced.

Once against the fire dragon, once against the Disaster of Floods and once
when dealing with Nirvana. At this point, I should think about whether Yoo
Joonghyuk was the sunfish or if I was the sunfish.

"…Uh, where is this place?"

I looked around but I couldn't tell where I was. I only saw a white cloud-
like ground and an open sky.

…Was this Dark Castle?

[The bonus effect has sped up the actions of your brain.]

Due to the resurrection bonus, my judgment of the situation became clearer
and faster. I decided to look at it again from the beginning.

First, there was the biggest question.
'Why did I die?'

I had been using third person's viewpoint to watch Paradise and left my
body with Han Sooyoung. Suddenly, my consciousness blurred and the
death message emerged.

There was only one conclusion. Someone killed me while I was asleep.
Who was it? Han Sooyoung?

[A new achievement has been added to your fifth story.]

[People will know you as the 'Messiah Who Bears Shame.]

I died at a strange time so a weird achievement was added to my story.

…I didn't think it was actually shameful.

The prophecy was 'Incarnation Kim Dokja will be killed by the person he
loves most'. Then to kill me, they must be someone I loved.

"Hey Kim Dokja! You survived?" In the distance, Han Sooyoung was
walking this way.

"What on earth happened?"

"An ambush." Han Sooyoung grumbled as she looked at the cloud field. It
was a place where nothing could be seen except for floating clouds. It was
an overly peaceful scene to be called an ambush.

"As soon as you fell asleep, some people appeared who were after you. I
tried to stop them but it didn't work. You ended up with a fatal wound and I
carried you away while crying. Suddenly, I appeared in this place."

The story flowed as naturally as the clouds but it was unbelievable.

[The exclusive skill 'Lie Detection Lv. 2' is activated!]
[You have confirmed that the statement is true.]

"…Did you see the faces of those who attacked?"

"Everybody was wearing an mask and I couldn't see properly. I saw a few
people using Detect Attributes but I didn't know them."

The three day journey had made Han Sooyoung considerably stronger. Now
Han Sooyoung would be 20th in the Dark Castle rankings. Yet the people
broke through her to kill me, then brought us here. I couldn't come up with
a plausible group, no matter how hard I thought.

"You didn't find out anything else?"

"By the way, aren't you really relaxed? Who was the one suffering for three
days…"

"Three days?"

"You have been dead for three days. Didn't you know?"

That reminded me, Eight Lives had a bit of a wait time. Three days…
damn. What happened to the other party members? Surely they hadn't
already passed onto the next scenario? If so, all my plans would go wrong.

Han Sooyoung sighed. "No matter how far I go, there are only clouds. I
have already given up."

"…Is that why you released your clones?"

Han Sooyoung's clones were training in various parts of the cloud field.
Han Sooyoung training in Hidden Weapons Technique, Han Sooyoung
training her footwork… each Han Sooyoung was devoted to one skill.

"It is my own training. I didn't want to waste time waiting for you and once
I take back my clones, my skill proficiency increases quickly."
Somehow, I discovered the secret behind how Han Sooyoung could become
so strong in such a short time.

"What? Are you a ■?"

"I'm a ■?" Damn… it is filtering something like this. Well, I have an idea of
what you wanted to say."

In any case, she didn't seem like just a plagiarist writer anymore. I was
suddenly curious. The original description in Ways of Survival didn't
describe the Avatar skill in detail. It wouldn't be bad to learn a bit more
about this skill.

"Are there no constraints on the skill? You can make infinite number of
clones as long as you have the magic power?"

"That would be a scam. Of course there are restrictions. Every time I use
the skill, I share some of my memories with the avatar."

"…Some of your memories? Then what about after the avatar dies?"

"Then I will lose the memories."

I felt a bit surprised when Han Sooyoung responded casually. Wasn't it a
skill that could give her Alzheimer's if she made a mistake?

Han Sooyoung read my thoughts and smiled. "Don't worry. I usually use
unnecessary memories. In addition, the memories will come back if I
recover the clones. Sometimes… it is a problem because some go out of
control."

"Out of control?"

"The first time I tried creating a clone using Avatar… I gave away too
many of my memories and it went out of control."

"…Is that possible? Then did you lose those memories?"
Han Sooyoung shrugged. "I don't know. But now I use small memories so
it's fine."

"You just think that you're fine."

"Shut up."

A clone ended up having important memories due to a mistake. I shivered
as I thought about another Han Sooyoung that might still be moving around
somewhere in Seoul.

One be one, the clones turned into smoke and returned to Han Sooyoung. It
was probably to recover the accumulated skills proficiency.

Han Sooyoung suddenly exclaimed, "Ah! There was something I didn't say.
I just remembered. A constellation came looking for me when you died."

Why give such an important memory to her clone?

"I forgot the name but the constellation belonged to a nebula. Vedas or…
Tamna?"

These names were dangerous. Regardless of how I felt, Han Sooyoung
muttered in a relaxed manner,

"I heard some ambiguous words. Make the right choice…"

"Can't you remember it properly?"

"I'm sorry. If I recall all my avatars then I can remember… oh, it was a
strange Goryeo warrior."

"Goryeo warrior?"

"He left without saying anything. He stared at your dead body for a moment
and left straight away."
If it was a Goryeo warrior, it was probably Cheok Jungyeong. There were
also Olympus, Vedas and Tamna. The big nebulae were moving so it
seemed like something was going to happen.

At this moment, something crossed my mind. "Wait, a constellation
appeared directly? It wasn't an avatar?"

"Yes. It was a symbol. Why?"

"…Don't you know the problem with this?"

"Eh?"

"No matter how symbolic, a constellation can't appear in the scenario area
without consuming a lot of probability."

The constellations feared probability the most and wouldn't descend as a
symbol.

I slowly looked around. "…I think I know where this place is."

This place was a ward but it wasn't a normal ward. It was a ward where
constellations could appear in symbolic form.

Han Sooyoung belatedly noticed something. "…The Mechanical Gateway
Array Method."

The Mechanical Gateway Array Method It was a technique used by
constellations who mastered the principles of the five elements, four
heavenly divisions and three calamities.

By the way, it was hard to see people use this technique. Zhuge Liang of
China could use it freely. Yet this was the Korean Peninsula. Then…
"Won't you come out?" I spoke to the air.
With the exception of Zhuge Liang, there was one other constellation who
could use it freely. It was also a constellation I had already met.

"…It seems it is impossible to deceive you with the shape of a
constellation."

A voice was heard as clouds gathered in the air and formed the image of a
person. It was a woman in her 30s wearing a prison uniform.

"Haven't we met before?"

"It isn't a very good reunion."

[The constellation 'First Spiritualist of Joseon' is giggling at you.]

First Spiritualist of Joseon, Jeon Woochi's incarnation.

She was the first 'limb' of the King of Wanderers.

"The king is waiting for you."

Somehow, I knew who had killed me. This situation appeared to be the
worst. Either way, I had no other choice.

I nodded and said. "Guide me."
               Chapter 171: Ep. 33 - Reading Again, II


"That jerk Kim Dokja… he forgot about me again."

There was a small fortress standing on the empty plains. In fact, it was the
size of a small house rather than a fortress. However, the armed weapons
meant it wasn't lacking compared to a fortress.

Needless to say, it was Gong Pildu's Armed Fortress.

Dudududu!

Gong Pildu fired shells at the monsters approaching the fortress. For several
weeks after entering Dark Castle, Gong Pildu had been living in a hellish
monster zone. There was an endless stream of monsters. If it wasn't for the
coins that Kim Dokja had previously provided him, he might've run out of
magic power and died already.

[The constellation 'Defense Master' is excited about the defense game.]
The situation wouldn't have ended up like this if it wasn't for the perverted
sponsor.

"Shiiiiit!"

His Dark Castle ranking had risen sharply due to all the monsters he killed.
The problem was that his mental strength and magic power had reached
their limits.

"It is up to here…"

Gong Pildu had a disheartened expression as he watched the Armed
Fortress being broken down by the claws of the monster.

At this time, something golden flew in the distance. It was a powerful ether
storm that broke apart the whole field. He wondered if it was Kim Dokja
but the person was unexpected.

"…Yoo Joonghyuk?"

A huge dragon was flying through the storm. On top of it, there were two
people Gong Pildu knew. Strength went out of Gong Pildu's body and the
fortress collapsed. Yoo Joonghyuk ran like the flash and caught the falling
Gong Pildu.

'I overused the power of transcendence. For the time being, I must preserve
my strength'. Yoo Joonghyuk thought as he glanced at his right arm.

The hand that was holding the sword was swollen and red. It wasn't the
power of his sponsor but transcendence was also affected by the
probability.

The situation would improve as the restrictions were gradually lifted.
However, the probability allowed in the ninth scenario wasn't enough for
him to take full advantage of transcendence.
'I have recovered Gong Pildu. Lee Seolhwa is steadily raising her ranking in
the western field…'

His plan was progressing steadily. The situation was smoother than any
previous scenarios.

'Now the only thing left is Kim Dokja'. Yoo Joonghyuk thought as he
looked towards the western plains. 'The fate of Star Stream isn't that lax.
What are you going to do, Kim Dokja?'




"Don't worry. There is a way out."

"…That woman isn't the only problem. There are many tough people.
Moreover, how are you going to deal with the Mechanical Gateway Array
Method?"

"There isn't a way to break the Mechanical Gateway Array Method."

Han Sooyoung and I were walking through the Mechanical Gateway Array
Method while following the incarnation of Jeon Woochi, Cho Youngran. I
saw that she was floating, not walking, and thought she definitely fit the
incarnation of Jeon Woochi.

Jeon Woochi. Along with Hong Gildong, he was one with the power to
enter the peak of the Korean constellations…

Han Sooyoung noticed her and spoke again. "By the way, wasn't the King
of Wanderers killed by the reincarnator?"

"She isn't someone who will die so easily."
"Come to think of it, you said that you know the King of Wanderers. Tell
me precisely. What is your relationship?"

A light sigh emerged at the question. "It is the most complicated
relationship in the world."

"I feel disgusted. An old girlfriend?"

"My mother."

"What? Really? Uh… I'm sorry." Han Sooyoung stuttered in an unusually
embarrassed manner.

As if hearing our conversation, Cho Youngran looked back with a stiff
expression. "Follow exactly where I am stepping. If you step on another
place, you will get lost."

I thought it would be like this. All Mechanical Gateway Array Methods
were the same. If you didn't go through the proper path, you would get lost.
I asked a slightly disgruntled tone, "Can't you just turn it off?"

"It is difficult. I don't know what you will do."

"How funny. You killed me and now you're afraid of me."

"I know you are capable of resurrection."

"Does that let you kill me willy-nilly?"

"I'm sorry for that. In addition, I wasn't moving to kill you. I attacked the
woman and she used you as a shield."

…What? I turned around and saw Han Sooyoung whistling. I watched Han
Sooyoung smiling and thought about hitting her head. I would question her
about it later. I might have eight lives but… wait, it was six lives now.
I glanced back towards Cho Youngran and asked, "Why are you helping my
mother?"

Cho Youngran paused at my sudden question. "I honestly don't know why
someone like you is following an incarnation. The First Spiritualist of
Joseon can become a king right now."

"…How do you know my sponsor?"

"It is obviously a Korean constellation who can use the Mechanical
Gateway Array Method."

Jeon Woochi wasn't a narrative-grade constellation but he had many
advantages in the early scenarios because the consumption of probability
when using his power was small.

Moreover, according to the progress of the scenario, the fame and stories
that could be built up were overwhelming compared to other constellations
of the same rating.

It was the reason why Yoo Joonghyuk tried to recruit Jeon Woochi as a
colleague in the early scenarios.

Cho Youngran replied, "I'm not suitable to be a king."

"Did my mother grab your weakness or something?"

Cho Youngran was going to say something, only to close her mouth

again. I said to her, "Tell me honestly. I can help you."

"…"

"You are being deceived by that person."

Jeon Woochi would be a great power if I could get his incarnation on my
side. Of course, I didn't expect much.
"She saved my daughter."

It was as expected.

"I see. Saving the life of your child… of course, you would be loyal after
something like that."

Cho Youngran's eyebrows twitched at my words. "Is that a sarcastic tone?"

"That's right. I think 'saving that life' is intentional."

"…Intentional?"

"My mother, isn't there something strange about her?"

"What?"

"She is overly adaptive to the world or knows a lot of information that
shouldn't be known at this point."

Han Sooyoung looked at me with a confused expression because she didn't
know what I was trying to do. Cho Youngran wondered, "…What do you
want to say?"

"What do I want to say? My mother knew what constellation you would
get."

"…"

"Maybe she saved your daughter for the purpose of trying to use you. She is
such a person."

Cho Youngran… I didn't remember precisely but it seemed a woman with
this name had once been Jeon Woochi's incarnation.

A character who lost her daughter and became Jeon Woochi's incarnation
decided to get revenge on the world.
I didn't know when I told my mother the story, but if she heard it from me
and remembered the information, it wasn't an exaggeration to think my
mother would use it.

However, unexpected words emerged from Cho Youngran's mouth. "You're
mistaken about her."

"Mistaken?"

Cho Youngran gazed at me in a strange way. It was filled with unpleasant
sympathy and was the type of gaze I hated.

"Sookyung-ssi isn't as bad as you think."

Was it because repulsion was surging inside me? I replied bluntly, "Nobody
knows her better than me."

"Originally, it is the child who doesn't know anything about their parents. In
any case, we've arrived."

I suddenly saw something that was like a front door. Cho Youngran spoke
towards Han Sooyoung.

"Girl, you can't enter. Wait with me."

"Tsk, your mother seems very shy. Be safe."

I nodded and brought my hand to the front door. Behind this door was
probably the strongest enemy in the current scenario.

Cho Youngran told me, "There is a bell."

Ding dong.

Somehow, the quaint ringtone stimulated familiar memories. It was a
ringtone I seemed to have heard a long time ago. Then my mother's voice
was heard from inside the door. "Come in."
The door opened and the familiar entrance of a house appeared. A few pairs
of shoes were placed neatly together. Some of them were small enough to
belong to children. My sense of deja vu was even worse. The interior of the
house was familiar. It wasn't too flashy or old-fashioned, but the small
decorations showed it was a person with some sense of style.

I entered the living room and saw a familiar room. There were the forgotten
wall clock and the television. I knew the texture of the sofa without needing
to sit on it. The location of the table was also familiar.

[The 'Fourth Wall' is shaking.]

Really… this was a terrible hobby.

My mother was sitting on the sofa of the living room, dressed in elegant
clothes. She asked me, "It took a long time. How does it feel to be home
after a long time?"

"I would rather remain dead."

"I'm glad that you are healthy."

"Thanks to someone, I just died and came back to life."

Maybe my mother chose this place to seize the initiative. The dialogue from
now on would be a battleground to determine the outcome of the next two
scenarios.

"I heard Nirvana killed you. How are you alive?"

"I wouldn't be fooled by such a person. Have you forgotten? I also have a
lot of information about the future."

I had expected it. Still, my mother managed to deceive Nirvana. I had no
idea what this person was capable of. Perhaps the most threatening thing to
me at present wasn't Yoo Joonghyuk or the constellations, but this woman.
"You were alive yet you didn't come to my funeral."

"Why would I go to a funeral when I was the unfortunate one left behind."

"You thought it wasn't enough and had your people kill me once more."

"I killed you once more because you are an irresponsible son. Do you need
a funeral this time as well? I saw that you have many good colleagues.
They didn't know you were going to rise again and cried…"

The person saying this was my mother. I took a deep breath. I could never
be careless when talking to my mother. From now on, it would be the real
thing. "Why did you kill me?"

My mother laughed and replied. "Incarnation Kim Dokja will be killed by
the person he loves most."

"…How do you know that?"

"Yoo Sangah-ssi told me. She asked me to save you." Yoo Sangah must've
visited my mother. "By the way, you came with another girl this time. Have
your tastes changed? Honestly, I like Yoo Sangah more."

"Don't pay attention to unnecessary things. I don't understand you the more
you talk. Why did you kill me when you were asked to save me?"

"The prophecy came true thanks to me. Isn't that right?"

"Huh?"

My mind became complicated. No, she was saying…

My mother continued, "It said it in the prophecy. The 'person you love
most'. Thus, I killed you."

It was ridiculous that the person I hated more than anyone else would say
this.
Even so, the moment I heard it, I was disturbed by a feeling I couldn't
express well. I definitely hated my mother. My life was a mess because my
mother ruined it. Yet… my mood was complicated.

"I see. You killed me because you thought you are the one I love most? Is
this fate?"

"Doesn't it often appear in your favourite novel?"

"If so, you have completely failed."

Obviously, fate told me that I would be killed by the person I loved most. If
so, my last death should've made my fate come true.

"I am still receiving the fate message."

It was true. A little while ago, the infernal message entered my ears.

[A huge fate is hoping for your definite death.]

A modified was even added. It was a 'definite death'.

The words of King Oedipus in my dreams were correct. I couldn't escape
this fate with the story 'Eight Lives'.

"At the very least, you aren't the person I love most."
                Chapter 172: Ep. 33 - Reading Again, III


My mother was silent for a moment. The silence cheered me up a bit. The
fact that my mother expected me to love her and the idea that I could hurt
her feelings excited me.

However, my mother spoke in a tone that sounded like she had expected it.
"Hrmm, I see."

"…"

"I still wanted to try it. It could've ended your fate. In any case, you still
have a lot of lives left."

"Don't speak like you are doing this for me."

"I love you."

I got goosebumps. Why was she suddenly saying this? "What does this
mean?"
"I am your mother."

I looked at my smiling mother and one corner of my heart ached. Did she
really believe that such words were acceptable? A decade's worth of
suffering alone couldn't be denied because of these words.

I glared at my mother.

Mother, love…

I didn't use Lie Detection on her. Sometimes there were such words in the
world. Even if it was true, it was painful enough to be called false.

I sighed and said, "It's too late."

"I know."

"Then why…"

"I just wanted to say it once. I don't think I've ever told you before."

We fell silent and didn't say anything for a while. Only the second hand of
the wall clock told me that time was passing by. It was like a page with
nothing on it. Like a writer squeezing out my first sentence, I barely
managed to open my mouth. "…How was your life in prison?"

"You often came to see me. Is there a need…"

"You didn't tell me anything."

"…"

"Why didn't you say anything? I went to see you so many times…"

I didn't hate my mother from the beginning.

Even when my mother killed my father.
Even when she went to jail.

Even when my relatives rushed to take our assets and I was treated like a
leftover product.

I didn't hate or blame my mother.

"How can a person be so shameless?" The reason why I hated my mother
was simple. "Why did you remain silent? And why… did you write such a
story?"

Someone might say this: You became rich. Isn't it good that she sold the
book? I didn't know if the royalties from my mother helped my life. My
relatives always treated me like I wasn't a person.

"I had a really hard time. Whenever I went to school, walked on the streets
or met someone, it seemed like everyone was talking about me. It was the
same when I moved schools. Every time, I was the son of a murderer."

Those who had never experienced it would never know. The world was
tenacious. The reporters stood in front of my house and it felt like all eyes
in the world were chasing me.

"Maybe, just maybe, I could've endured it."

It might've been okay if my mother had said something to me. If she told
me to endure it, I could've. If only my mother had told me she was on my
side, even if she sold our story for money.

[The 'Fourth Wall' is shaking violently.]

[The stigma 'Self-rationalization Lv. 2' has been activated!]

I looked at my mother. I hadn't misunderstood. My mother sold our lives to
earn money.

Then my mother opened her mouth. "I wanted to know."
"Know what?"

"The truth."

"…What is the truth? Mother, didn't you kill Father?"

"You don't know the story."

"I know it very well. Since separating from you, I looked over my
memories again and again."

In other words, I read it again. I became absorbed in the characters of the
novel because of my mother.

–Dokja. -From now on, I will read all of this again.

–Your father, he did something wrong and died.

–This was self-defense. Understood?

I read it again hundreds, thousands and even tens of thousands of times. No,
I replayed it so many times that I couldn't even tell it was true anymore.

"It was enough for my father to die. He was a gambling addict and violent
towards his family. Our family would've been in danger if he remained."

The mother watched me and nodded. "Yes, I remember it well. So why are
you angry?"

I tried to ask my mother several times.

Why didn't you run away with me? Why did you leave the child alone?
Why didn't you come see me after you were released?

The questions piled up inside me and I got the answer on my own.

[The Fourth Wall's shaking has subsided.]
This was a fear created by the answer. It was an answer that I tried to erase.
I was afraid that once the answer was given, I wouldn't be able to accept it.

In the meantime, my mother had been repeatedly opening and closing her
mouth before finally being able to speak. "…It is too late to say anything."
Yes, I knew.

[Many constellations have sponsored you 5,000 coins for your family
history.]

This was sufficient for the damn drama.

[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' is thirsty from your
sweet potato.]

[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' suggests that you think
again.]

[The constellation 'Poked Out His Eyes' is smiling in an insidious manner.]

This role didn't suit me in the first place.

"Why do you keep changing the original novel?" My mother changed the
topic. "If you let it flow like the original and let people die, the scenarios
wouldn't have been so difficult."

"I have to change it. Mother, you know that Yoo Joonghyuk can't reach the
ending in the third regression."

[Many constellations are frustrated by the filtering.]

The story about the original novel was filtered by the constellations.

"The ending?"

"Yes. The ending."
"…You are struggling just for that? You're not crazy."

"The ending of this story is important to me. It was this world that kept me
alive while you were gone." It was thanks to the novel that I could survive
the last few years without my mother and father. "You can never
understand."

『 Three Ways to Survive in a Ruined World. 』

I didn't know what the author intended with this title. However, this title
was reality to me, not a metaphor. It was because for me, this had become a
'ruined world' a long time ago.

I read this novel on a daily basis and survived. Thus, I couldn't give up on
this story.

My mother refuted, "This isn't a novel. There is no ending like 'Everyone
lived happily ever after' in reality."

"I will see it through to the end. In addition, when did I say I wanted that
ending?"

"Stop. This world is crazy. It isn't something you can achieve because you
know the future. Don't you already know this? The next scenarios―"

"Stop." It was pointless to keep arguing with my mother. "Just tell me what
you want. Why did you call me here?"

"Stay here."

Yes, I thought she would say this. It was just like my mother.

"Why would I do such a thing?"

"I can't lose my son again. I will somehow do the following scenarios."

"Save it."
I raised my energy.

"Be honest. You think I will be a hindrance. I don't know what your
purpose is but I won't ask you anything."

For the first time, an unfamiliar emotion crossed my mother's face. She
looked sad. Sad? What qualifications did she have to feel like this?

"…Who do you really resemble?" A wave of magic power rose in my
mother's body as she spoke. "I dislike this method but it can't be helped.
[Some constellations like this fighting in a family.]

[Some constellation's who value filial piety dislike this situation.]

The furniture of the house was swept away by the magical storm, causing
Han Sooyoung to notice and run inside.

"Kim Dokja!"

The incarnation of Jeon Woochi, Cho Youngran was also behind Han
Sooyoung. The living room quickly changed into a confrontational
situation. Cho Youngran was preparing a trick while my mother gazed at
me with serene eyes. Jeon Woochi's techniques were tricky but I could
somehow defend against them.

The problem was my mother's side. I didn't yet know who my mother's
sponsor was. This was just before my mother's ability was revealed.

[The exclusive skill 'Bookmark' is activated!]

"Selecting the fourth bookmark, 'Lycaon Isparang'."

[The exclusive skill 'Way of the Wind Lv. 10 (+1) is activated!]

Way of the Wind reached its limit and the whole room was caught in a
magical storm. I condensed the winds and destroyed the entire living room.
Then I escaped from the house with Han Sooyoung. As dark smoke covered
my field of view, I told Han Sooyoung. "I will finish this right away so get
ready."

"Understood." Han Sooyoung started to generate a powerful 'black fire' in
her hand.

I immediately changed the bookmark. "I will choose the fifth bookmark,
Kyrgios Rodgraim."

The combo of Miniaturization and Electrification followed after Way of the
Wind. The fastest and most efficient way to overpower my mother was to
use the greatest skill I had.

However, the moment I was about to use the skill, dozens of people
appeared through the smoke. They surrounded me and spoke in fervent
voices. "You've misunderstood everything. Please. You have to stay here."

They were my mother's subordinates. Dozens of women wearing prison
uniforms looked at me with sympathetic expressions. Han Sooyoung
shouted, "What is this?"

The surprised Han Sooyoung poured the black flames towards them but
they were scattered in all directions by Jeon Woochi's defense. Cho
Youngran shouted, "Kim Dokja! Stop! Sookyung is doing this for you!"

It was my mother who blocked their mouths. She raised a finger to her
mouth, telling them not to say anything. Then a grand aura started to
emerge from my mother's body.

Sparks formed due to the excessive use of probability. It was a more intense
synchronization than anything I had seen before. My mother was obviously
overdoing it.

[The sponsor of incarnation 'Lee Sookyung' has revealed her modifier.]
[The constellation 'Founder's Mother' feels deep sadness towards you.]

The Founder's Mother? Oh my god. Don't tell me?

[The constellation 'Founder's Mother' says that your strength is a threat to
the Korean Peninsula scenario.]

[The constellation 'Founder's Mother' says that she won't take your life if
you don't rebel.]

I hastily used Miniaturization and Electrification at the same time.

[The energy of the old land has sealed your skills.]

My vision became dim, as if I had entered a dark cave. Power was
extinguished from my body and I became an ordinary human. The
helplessness of a small animal captivated me.

[The energy of the old land seals your 'value'.]

I knew this stigma. There was only one 'story' regarding sealing on the
Korean Peninsula.

"…I never thought you could use this."

Yes… it was strange I hadn't thought about it This was the Korean
Peninsula. Yet there was one nebula that hadn't contacted me yet. I
should've made contact with them first but I hadn't got close to them at this
point.

"I told you, I love you." My mother smiled while waving a bronze bell in
my hand.

The Founder's Mother. One of the highest ranking constellations of Hongik
and one of the most well-known stories on this land.

My mother's sponsor was Ungnyeo¹, mother of Dangun Wangeom.
I sighed and said. "…Okay. I surrender."

"What? Hey! Kim Dokja!"

"Just wait here. You can't win anyway."

A sense of exhaustion filled my body. Now I was no different from an
ordinary person.

"…Putting aside your sponsor, how did you get the Eight Beaded Bell?"

I stared at the bronze bell in my mother's hand. The Eight Beaded Bell was
one of the three 'heavenly seals' of Dangun's myth. It was one of the
greatest relics of the Korean Peninsula and had the ability to seal the 'story'
of another person.

No matter how I thought about it, there was no way to get this star relic
through normal methods at this point. My mother must've paid a price to
get it.

"I will let you go once it is time. Just stay here for now." Finally, my
mother and the wanderers disappeared.

Han Sooyoung and I were trapped in the Mechanical Gateway Array
Method. I was able to guess where my mother had gone.

Maybe she went to see Yoo Joonghyuk. I didn't want to imagine the
catastrophe that would happen if they met.

"Shit, what now? How are we going to get out of here?"

Han Sooyoung asked as she tried to break the Mechanical Gateway Array
Method. My skills as a constellation were sealed so it was impossible to
destroy straight away.

Well, this was with my own power. I thought it over. "There is one way."
"What is it?"

"There is a presence that can break the Mechanical Gateway Array
Method."

"What? Who?"

If I called him, the seal would somehow be broken. Originally, it was a
constellation I didn't dare call but now it was unknown.

I pulled out Ganpyeongui. I saved it for an important time and now it was
the only thing I could believe in.

[The special option of the 'Ganpyeongui', Echo of the Stars has been
activated.]

[Echo of the Stars allows you to ask for help from a historical-grade
constellation.]

"I will call the constellations."

[In the flow of the stars, the historical-grade constellations hear your voice.]

I called out the modifier of the constellation.

[The status of this constellation is too high.]

[Five points on the Sky Disc are required for this constellation. Will you
accept this?]

There were only five points left because I had used the rest on calling the
Big Dipper and the Nation's Independence Activist.

Now this constellation required all the remaining star points on the
Ganpyeongui.
It was necessary because this being's strength already surpassed the
historical-grade rank.

[The operation of the stars has begun.]

In the darkness of the deep night sky, a solitary star was shining. I declared
towards him. "Goryeo's First Sword, I need your strength."



[1] Ungnyeo – Korean for "bear woman." A prominent figure in the
creation myth of the Korean nation. According to the myth, she and divine
king
Hwanung had a son, Dangun, who would go on to found the nation of
Korea. Wiki
               Chapter 173: Ep. 33 - Reading Again, IV


Sparks wrapped around my body as I felt the signs of a probability storm.
This was a big burden for a single constellation not of the narrative-grade to
bear.

I thought the records of how Cheok Jungyeong faced an army alone were
exaggerated. However, rather than an exaggeration, the stories had been
reduced.

In fact, Cheok Jungyeong had become much stronger than what was written
in Earth's records after becoming a constellation. In other words, there were
sword masters who would become nervous just hearing about this
constellation.

Still, I had to endure it. If I couldn't withstand the spirit of Cheok
Jungyeong, I couldn't break the 100 Days Seal.

[Your 'status' is currently sealed.]
[Your main skills are currently sealed.]

[Time remaining: 100 days]

The 100 Days Seal, which could be carried out by the three highest beings
of the constellation 'Hongik', was the highest-grade seal that sealed up the
target's abilities.

[Eat garlic and mugwort and endure for 100 days.]

Of course, this seal wasn't necessarily a bad thing. If I could eat garlic and
mugwort for 100 days, I could receive Hwanin's blessing and wake up the
potential of my body.

However, now I didn't have enough time. Han Sooyoung watched the garlic
and mugwort pouring from the sky and asked, "Hey, isn't it almost done?"

"The power is so strong that it is hard to control. Just wait."

I took a deep breath and controlled my magic power. Cheok Jungyeong lent
me strength in response to my call but didn't say anything in his true voice.
He just handed me some of his strength, as if saying 'try it if you are
confident'.

As a result, I had been controlling the story that had been running wild for
30 minutes. It seemed like my whole body would burst.

I watched the grumbling Han Sooyoung and suddenly became annoyed.
"This is all because of you. This wouldn't have happened if you didn't use
me as a shield."

"I didn't do it on purpose."

"Do you expect me to believe that? Based on what you have always
done…"
It seemed like many complaints had piled up and I couldn't help nagging.
How many minutes had passed?

Han Sooyoung slowly got fed up and shouted, "Ah, I apologize! Yes, I used
you as a shield. What do you want me to do?"

I wanted to say she was brazen-faced but then a presence suddenly
intervened.

[The constellation 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' interrupts with a cough.]

[The constellation 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' says that Han Sooyoung
never used you as a shield.]

[The constellation 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' says your death is your
responsibility.]

Han Sooyoung shouted, "Hey, you shut up and stay still! Saying
unnecessary…!"

"What does he mean?"

"It is nonsense. Don't worry about it."

[The constellation 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' claims that Han
Sooyoung didn't protect your heart to protect your black fire dragon.]
…My black fire dragon?

"That's why I…" Han Sooyoung hesitated before starting to talk. "I mean,
Jeon Woochi's attack… flew to that place."

"…Hah."

I was so dumbfounded that I forgot the important situation and sighed. Han
Sooyoung hesitated as she stared into my eyes and bit her lips. "That… you
would be a bit unhappy if you lost that function so… I shifted the
direction."

"That's why it hit my heart?"

"…Well, there is such a story."

It was an absurd story. Han Sooyoung didn't wait to see how I accepted it
and added swiftly.

"I-I didn't have any strange thoughts. Don't be mistaken. The Black Flame
Dragon bastard was shouting that I should protect the whale…"

[The constellation 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' is looking at his
constellation with embarrassment and agitation.]

I sighed lightly and said, "…I don't care about that. Just protect my heart
well next time."

Han Sooyoung made a surprised look at my words and nodded. An
awkward atmosphere briefly flowed.

Han Sooyoung seriously considered something and opened her mouth. "By
the way Kim Dokja, I have a question…"

"What is it?"

"Why does he call it the black flame dragon?"




'That guy… he was very small when he was a child'.

Lee Sookyung was immersed in her memories as she gazed at the dark and
desolate plains of Dark Castle.
How much time did it take to get here?

There were no easy scenarios and all plans were half-distorted or broken.
How many times had she experienced the crisis of death due to insufficient
information?

'It was especially dangerous when I met Nirvana'.

The reincarnator. Lee Sookyung never thought that such a being could exist
in the world. Well, it was abnormal for a novel to become reality in the first
place.

She turned around and saw Cho Youngran, the incarnation of Jeon Woochi.

"Your Majesty."

"Stop it with that title."

"…Sookyung-ssi."

Cho Youngran had a complicated gaze.

'It is no wonder,' Lee Sookyung thought.

Cho Youngran was the only wanderer who knew all her circumstances.
"You didn't need to fight him. If you were honest about why you wrote the
book…"

"Being honest is harder than fighting. Especially when it is between a
parent and child."

In fact, she had the conversation with Kim Dokja because of Cho
Youngran's suggestion.

Cho Youngran kept pressing. "Now is the age where he can accept the
truth. He isn't the 10 year old boy you knew."
"For me, he is just a child. It doesn't matter if he is 30 or 40 years old."

"…It is the pride of a parent."

Pride…

That's right, it was pride. Lee Sookyung lowered her eyes. "At first, I tried
to show courage. I tried to tell the truth."

"…"

"However, after I looked into his eyes… it felt like an excuse for me to
enter his life."

Reality was different from a novel. A wounded person might be saved but a
wounded person. wouldn't heal that easily.

"I don't know if that child really needs the truth. Maybe it was what I
needed. I didn't want to stay as a bad mother…"

She became crooked herself to protect Kim Dokja. She became like this as
a result of her own love.

「 Incarnation Kim Dokja will be killed by the person he loves most. 」

Lee Sookyung recalled the moment when she first heard of her child's fate
from Yoo Sangah. The fate of Olympus would surely be realized.

"…The child will understand you one day."

In order to find out how to save her son, Lee Sookyung gave three days and
three nights to the Founder's Mother.

Three SSS-grade items were offered as a tribute to Hongik and she also
gave
20 years of her life. In return, she was able to steal a line of fate that
Olympus had hidden.
「If he doesn't go to the next scenario, Incarnation Kim Dokja can live. 」

Lee Sookyung smiled. "Have all the troops gathered?"

"Yes. They are all assembled."

On the edge of the plains, the group of wanderers she led were gathered.
They were all here because they believed in her. Lee Sookyung opened the
main scenario window.

  [Main Scenario #9 - 73rd Demon King]

  Category: Main

  Difficulty level: SS
 Clear Conditions: You are eligible to participate in the last scenario of
 Dark Castle. Gather four rankers to go up to the third floor of Dark
 Castle and enter the final scenario.

 Time Limit: 30 days

 Compensation: 100,000 coin

 Failure: ― Death

   Your current Dark Castle ranking is 2nd place.
   Only incarnations within the top 10 of the rankings can challenge
    the final scenario with you.



Lee Sookyung glanced at Cho Youngran. She currently had two of the top
10 rankers. They were Cho Youngran and Lee Boksoon. In order to
complete the scenario and challenge the final floor of Dark Castle, two
more rankers were needed.
Cho Youngran said, "They are coming."

An army was pushing from the other side of the Abyss Plains. They came
from Paradise. She saw a familiar face at the head of the army.

Lee Sookyung greeted one of the people in the opposing force. "Yoo
Sangah-ssi. It's been a while."

"Ah! Really, I'm really glad… you are alive! Dokja-ssi…"

"We can talk about it later."

Lee Sookyung looked at the party across from her.

'From left to right, it is Lee Hyunsung, Shin Yoosung, Jung Heewon, Lee
Jihye and Lee Gilyoung'.

She heard about Lee Hyunsung, Shin Yoosung and Lee Jihye from Kim
Dokja but she had never heard of Lee Gilyoung and Jung Heewon. Perhaps
they were new people her son had recruited, regardless of the original
novel.

'It would've been a lot easier if there were only original characters. Stupid
fool'.

As a child, Kim Dokja did many unpredictable things. Therefore, Lee
Sookyung had believed that her child would become an artist.

"The King of Wanderers."

The voice came from the person she had been waiting for. It was a person
she heard a lot about from her son while she was in prison. She never
imagined she would see him in person.

"Yoo Joonghyuk."
Supreme King Yoo Joonghyuk. The protagonist of this story opened his
mouth. "Why did you want to see me here?"

"I have decided to end this scenario."

Yoo Joonghyuk glanced next to Lee Sookyung and asked, "Are you also
collecting the four heavenly kings?"

"Four heavenly kings?"

"You need four rankers to go to the next scenario. Don't you know?"

"Ah… yes, that's right. I'm collecting them. I guess they are called the four
heavenly kings. I can't keep up with the trendy words of children these
days."

Yoo Joonghyuk's eyebrows twitched at Lee Sookyung's words. "You have a
twisted mind."

"You are a shrewd child."

The eyes of the two people met and waves of energy bounced wildly. Just
by exchanging looks, Lee Sookyung could get a vague glimpse of Yoo
Joonghyuk's power.

It was transcendent. He had to be at this level to be the protagonist of the
story.

Lee Sookyung took a short breath and opened her mouth. "I want to hold
hands with you. Let's gather the remaining rankers together."

"…Rankers?"

"Yes. Isn't your goal to save this world? You need the most powerful lineup
of incarnations as possible if you want to clear the next scenario. I can help
you. My sponsor is Founder's Mother."
Yoo Joonghyuk's eyes slightly tensed up at the words 'Founder's Mother'.
However, it was just for a moment. The words that came out from Yoo
Joonghyuk's mouth were completely unexpected. "Where is Kim Dokja?"

"…Why are you looking for him?"

"I heard you took him."

"So why?"

Lee Sookyung had a strange feeling at his dismissive attitude towards her
suggestion. It was a disturbing feeling that only a mother with a child could
detect.

She wondered, "Surely you aren't going to include that child in your four
heavenly kings?"

"I'm not obliged to answer that."

"Your personality is exactly the same as what he said."

"…Kim Dokja told you my story?"

"He did. He told me a lot."

She stared into Yoo Joonghyuk's eyes and Lee Sookyung's suspicions
increased.

Lee Sookyung asked, "I heard that you handed the Paradise achievement to
my son. Why did you do that?"

"He can save the world if he grows stronger."

"Aha, you are going to use him for 'that'?"

Lee Sookyung deliberately emphasized a word. It was a relaxed tone, as if
she already knew it.
Then Yoo Joonghyuk replied, "Kim Dokja is necessary for this world. I
need him."

"…"

"He will be my companion and he will see the end of the scenario."

Lee Sookyung's expression slowly hardened. Companion? The voice of her
young son appeared in her mind.

–That jerk, he is a complete psychopath.

–He knows nothing but how to use people. -He will do whatever it takes to
reach his goal.

"This is strange. The Yoo Joonghyuk I heard about will never talk like
you."

"Does your family like to talk as if they know someone well?"

Yoo Joonghyuk pulled out his sword. It was a hard attitude that showed no
more dialogue was needed.

"Give me Kim Dokja. Then I will spare you."

Lee Sookyung stared into Yoo Joonghyuk's blazing eyes and recalled her
son's voice. Despite his many complaints, her son always looked somewhat
excited.

–But the story won't continue without him. Ways of Survival is such a
novel.

At this moment, enlightenment filled Lee Sookyung's head.

「 Incarnation Kim Dokja will be killed by the person he loves most. 」
Lee Sookyung realized the true meaning of this fate. She knew who would
kill her beloved son. Maybe it was an insight Lee Sookyung was able to
reach because she was used to these types of metaphors and symbolism.

"I see." Lee Sookyung realized everything and laughed.

This wasn't her original plan. Still, the prophecy meant that the plan had to
be modified here.

"I'm sorry but I can't let you see my son."

"Why?"

"A mother's responsibility is to control her child if he mixes in with bad
people." Lee Sookyung's eyes were cold as she took out the Eight Beaded
Bell. "I have to send my son back to reality."
               Chapter 174: Ep. 33 - Reading Again, V


At this time, Bihyung was at the Seoul Administrative Branch of the
bureau.

It would soon be time for the Seoul Dome liberation scenario. All
dokkaebis in the dome were busy trying to finish the scenario.

Bihyung walked through the halls of the bureau and saw newly hired
lowgrade dokkaebis moving along with the instructor.

Newly born dokkaebis. They received basic education at the branch's
education center, were assigned their own channels and were reborn as
streamers.

"Don't hesitate to intervene if the interest of the constellations fall. You
can't directly intervene in a given main scenario so use sub-scenarios to
aggravate the conflicts between people or create a dangerous situation."
"Don't create situations where the constellations are annoyed by character
conflicts. A good person is a good person, a bad person is a bad person.
Make sure the dichotomy is clear. This way, the constellations can easily
determine the objects of their anger."

"Always induce the incarnation to be in the middle of the event. However,
keep an eye on the main incarnation and make the event move around the
incarnation. It also shouldn't give off an artificial feeling."

The instructors spoke these words and the low-grade dokkaebis were busy
taking notes.

At one time, Bihyung had been one of them. He learnt how to proceed with
the scenario and was taught how to smile and talk. It couldn't be too strange
or too cliche. Become a streamer who wasn't disturbed by the scenario
progression.

"Are you remembering the old days?"

Bihyung turned and saw the advanced dokkaebi Baram, the chief of the
Seoul branch. Bihyung was nervous and his expression changed.

Baram stroked his beard and stared at the low-grade dokkaebis. "It is a
terrible sight. Every time it sounds refreshing to the constellations, but this
is something learnt from the dokkaebis' formal education."

"It is somewhat inappropriate for an advanced dokkaebi to say this."

'It is you who made the guidelines'. Bihyung swallowed down these words.

Baram laughed bitterly. "It can't be helped. These scenarios sell well."

"There might be exceptions."

"There should be. However, that 'exception' is possible because the ordinary
scenarios are openly reviled."
Some low-grade dokkaebis were gathered in front of the screens and
watching the scenarios going on in Seoul Dome. On the screen, the stories
of the incarnations belonging to the biggest channel in Seoul Dome were
flowing. Bihyung's face became a bit hot.

–Then I will be forced to kill you.

–Yoo Joonghyuk-ssi! No!

Yoo Joonghyuk and Lee Sookyung were confronting each other on the
second floor of Dark Castle.

–Damn, why isn't ■■ and ■■■ coming out?

–It will come out. I just don't know when.

On the other side, Kim Dokja and Han Sooyoung were discussing an
unknown story in the Mechanical Gateway Array Method.

Bihyung was immersed in his thoughts. 'I warned him not to say
information that would be filtered, dammit'.

The advanced dokkaebi Baram opened his mouth. "Your channel is popular
these days. Talk of your channel is everywhere in the Seoul branch. In
particular, that incarnation…"

"I also receive a lot of curses."

"That's good enough. In any case, it is raising curiosity. Do you know that
you are the number one dokkaebi respected by the low-grade dokkaebis
these days?"

"I want to know why you called me here."

It was language that could seem somewhat rude but Bihyung had no other
way. There would be a difficult situation if he didn't go back to his channel
right now. Baram was silent and Bihyung once again spoke.
"I'm sorry but it is entering the final phase of the ninth scenario. I have to
go back to my channel…"

"That's why I called you."

Bihyung saw Baram's serious expression and realized something had gone
wrong.

There was a loud noise from the screen and the full-fledged battle began.
The incarnations with strong sponsors were fighting, raising
synchronization in a reckless manner. Signs of a probability storm appeared
all over the place.

If such strong signs continued, the outer gods would gain the right to
intervene. If so, Kim Dokja's safety couldn't be guaranteed.

The anxious Bihyung tried to leave this place when Baram spoke in a cold
voice. "The constellations don't want your intervention."

Currently, Bihyung's channel was the most influential one in Seoul Dome.
The fact that Bihyung was clearly being kept in the Seoul branch made
something obvious. "Since when has the Seoul branch been watching the
constellations?"

"I'm always watching. I don't just look at the education of the low-grade
dokkaebis."

"Isn't this what it looks like on the surface? The main scenario policy…!"

"A large number of nebulae have complaints about this scenario." A

large number of nebulae. Bihyung knew who they were right away.

Olympus.

Vedas.
Papyrus.

…

The nebulae with influence in the Star Stream were interfering with the
progress of this scenario.

Why? In fact, Bihyung knew why.

"It is because of that incarnation."

Kim Dokja didn't know anything and was still struggling against the
Mechanical Gateway Array Method with Han Sooyoung.

"At most, he is one incarnation. He can't influence the entire scenario,"
Bihyung refuted.

"Only one incarnation… do you really think so?"

"…"

"No, he isn't an incarnation anymore."

Before the 10th scenario arrived, an incarnation with no sponsor became a
constellation. This was impossible considering the difficulty of the
scenario.

"He will be a monster. Have you forgotten about the Goryeo's First Sword
incident? It is difficult to see such a non-standard existence again."
Goryeo's First Sword, Cheok Jungyeong.

The strongest on the Korean peninsula and among the historical-grade
constellations caused an incident.

Bihyung also knew about what happened at the time.
A person who incited many grudges because his natural talent didn't fit the
balance of the scenario. A great deal of probability was consumed to
'exclude' him from the scenario, only for him to return as a 'constellation'.

"Goryeo's First Sword is a special case. Kim Dokja became a constellation
faster than him but Kim Dokja's potential itself isn't high. If it is potential,
the incarnation Yoo Joonghyuk has already reached transcendence…"

"I know. That isn't too serious. In fact, Yoo Joonghyuk is the one who is
similar to Goryeo's First Sword. That's why Kim Dokja is more dangerous."

The frustrated Bihyung shouted, "I can understand some of the complaints
of the constellations. Kim Dokja didn't enter under them so they are
annoyed." "…"

"However, isn't this a situation where they have already taken action? Have
there ever been any cases where 'fate' is used before the 10th scenario?"

"You are defending the incarnation."

"It isn't defending! I'm talking about unfair treatment in the scenario!"

"I don't think you are in a position to say that."

Bihyung was surprised but pretended to be calm. The advanced dokkaebi
Baram smiled. "It's fine. I didn't call you here to catch your transgressions."

It sounded like a threat where he intended to catch Bihyung's
transgressions. Bihyung asked, "Then why…"

"If you're smart then you would know. Haven't you ever thought it was
strange? Why are the constellations already using the excessive action that
is 'fate'?"

"…"
"In most cases, they can peek at the future through their dealings with
prophets who can use Future Sight, without using fate. If they anticipate
how the target will behave, they can change the future with a moderate
amount of probability. Yet they didn't do that this time. Why?"

It was something Bihyung had never thought about before. The power to
force fate also placed a heavy burden on the nebulae. There were many
powerful incarnations apart from Kim Dokja. Why force fate over Kim
Dokja?

"Don't tell me…?"

If the nebulae called for fate, it meant they had no choice but to use fate. In
other words…

The senior dokkaebi Baram nodded. "It means that no one in the Star
Stream can see the future of Constellation Kim Dokja."

"…How can that be?"

"I don't know either. One thing is for sure, many constellations are afraid
that Kim Dokja will reach ■■. Hmm, it is still being filtered. So… it is all
for the 'end'."

Baram's gaze was fixed on the screen.

"You need to do this. Once it is over, I will recommend you to be an
advanced dokkaebi."

It required a screening process to become an advanced dokkaebi. Bihyung
already guessed what Baram would do.

Bihyung watched the screen and unknowingly hugged the egg.
"Hey, do a good job."

"I know."

Perhaps it was due to the former black flame dragon incident but the
atmosphere with Han Sooyoung had become a bit subtle.

Han Sooyoung's constant trying to start an argument was probably because
she was aware of this awkwardness.

[The constellation 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' is smiling with
satisfaction.]

[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' hates this atmosphere.]

It took much longer than I thought to digest the power of Cheok Jungyeong.
Four hours had already passed. I was sweating just controlling the power of
his story.

My mother had probably met Yoo Joonghyuk by now.

Han Sooyoung was sitting on the floor eating mugwort. Then she said, "By
the way, I don't think your mother is a bad person."

"…Did your mind become strange after eating some grass?"

"Well, the two of you seem to have a bad relationship. I don't intend to
meddle with someone's family affairs… in any case, she is taking care of
her child."

"How is this taking care?"

"There are many parents in the world who have no interest in their
children."

Han Sooyoung's voice took on a darker tone. I sighed and replied to her,
"My mother spoke to me about you. She thought I was dating you."
Han Sooyoung laughed. "Your mother has an eye for females."

"By the way, she thinks that Yoo Sangah-ssi is better than you."

"…So when are you going to kill that aunty?"

We laughed. Once again, I realized how certain Han Sooyoung was. She
was more like a character than anybody else these days.

Han Sooyoung stopped laughing. "We sound like characters."

It was as if she read my mind. My heart started pounding. Han Sooyoung
didn't know it but one day, she would become a 'character'. It was just like
Lee Sungkook and Jung Minseob.

I liked both characters and non-characters, so I didn't know if it was a good
or a bad thing. Just… I felt unsure when I thought about that time. Why
didn't I want this person to become a character?

"Eh? Something has changed?"

I looked down at my right hand after hearing Han Sooyoung's words. The
power of the story borrowed from Cheok Jungyeong was finally stabilizing.
I nodded.

"Be prepared. We are escaping."

I controlled my strength and pulled out Unbroken Faith. The moment I
borrowed Cheok Jungyeong's story, the trajectory of his life passed through
my head like a panorama.

「 Cutting 1,000 people with one sword. 」

「 Cutting a great mountain with one sword. 」

「Separating the sea with three swords. 」
It was Cheok Jungyeong's Three Sword Style. It was the name given to a
person who never swung a sword more than three times towards a target.
[The status you can't afford has fallen onto your right arm.]

100 Days Seal started to instantly crack. It was the splendor of Cheok
Jungyeong.

The imperfect seal made with just the Eight Beaded Bell could never
restrain Cheok Jungyeong's power.

A real 100 Days Seal would only take effect after gathering all three
heavenly treasures.

[The explosive flow of the story has distorted the space of the Mechanical
Gateway Array Method.]

[The explosive flow of the story has broken the 100 Days Seal.]

I poured the Purest Sword Force into the air.

One Sword, One Sword Cuts Thousands.

Like a meteor shower, the sword cut through the air and the space split
apart. The Mechanical Gateway Array Method and the seal. Everything was
pointless before this overwhelming destruction.

It was the sword technique of a genius training in the sword for tens of
thousands of years. The most ideal cut for destruction.

I couldn't see the true power but I felt a sense of freedom that was just like
when I reached 100 strength not long ago.

This was the power of the stars.

The illusionary space collapsed and reality started emerging. It was a
completely crazy sword technique.
I felt just as greedy as when I got Kyrgios' Electrification. How good would
it be if I could make this mine? Unfortunately, Bookmark only applied to
'characters'.

[Due to your status increase, the Bookmark skill will be updated.]

[A new feature has been enabled.]

…Eh?

[Your understanding of the constellation 'Goryeo's First Sword' has
increased by a very slight amount.]
              Chapter 175: Ep. 33 - Reading Again, VI


…What? I was surprised to see the message. So far, my understanding of
constellations had never increased.

I opened Bookmark but Cheok Jungyeong wasn't added to the list of
available people. It might be due to the 'very slight' increase. Perhaps it was
a 1% increase.

Still, I was full of expectations. If my understanding continued to rise,
wouldn't it be possible to imitate the skills of the constellations one day?

"…What is this?"

I turned at Han Sooyoung's voice. The white sky, the precursor of a storm,
looking down at me with a disturbing aura. It was a white night.

There were intermittent rumbling sounds and the entire field shook like
there was an earthquake. The aftermath of the two warlords colliding
scattered all over the plains. However, they didn't kill each other.
[Everyone… kneel… down!]

A constellation's true voice. I wondered how much probability was
consumed to speak these words. Many incarnations who couldn't bear it
were struggling in pain.

Those who had the protection of their sponsors or those with strong mental
powers didn't give in. Han Sooyoung was one of them.

"What? What is going on?" Han Sooyoung shouted in a frustrated manner.

I watched the field with her. In fact, I thought this might happen but not to
this extent.

"…This is an utter mess. Do they intend to all die together?"

It wasn't just one or two incarnations who raised their synchronization rate
to the limit.

The probability allowed by Dark Castle was exhausted to the limit. Sparks
appeared like firecrackers all over the battlefield.

–Kim Dokja, listen to me. if you do this, you will die.

I heard Bihyung's voice coming from someone as I looked at the ruined
battlefield.

–There is only one way to escape from 'fate'. Find the force that will protect
you. Otherwise…!

There was a sound and Bihyung's voice was cut off. Someone was blocking
Bihyung.

At the same time, hundreds of eyes focused on me. They were
historicalgrade and some narrative-grade constellations who maximized
their synchronization with their incarnations.
I felt the scorching air and gulped. Then Cheok Jungyeong spoke for the
first time. [You must be scared.] "Nope. Rather, it is fun."

I was serious.

[Many constellations are looking at you!]

[Some constellations are chanting your name!]

[2,000 coins have been earned as a bonus.]

Cheok Jungyeong spoke again, [The wall of fate is high.]

"It's just a high wall. I will break it if I have to."

The person who I loved. Thus, the person who would kill me. I didn't know
who they were. Just as I didn't know my own fate, they didn't know me
either.

"Let's go."

I ran through the battlefield. This time I didn't hide my power.

"I will choose the fifth bookmark, Kyrgios Rodgraim."

The moment that Bookmark was activated, I triggered Miniaturization and
Electrification.

[The technique of a returnee. How interesting.]

I was able to sweep through the battlefield with the power of Cheok
Jungyeong.

However, I shouldn't overdo it. My right arm had almost turned into a rag
after using one sword from the Three Sword Style.
I ran through the battlefield while sprinkling the high-grade physique
recovery potion that I had bought from the Dokkaebi Bag.

"Out of the way!"

A white trail was left whenever I passed. This was the power of the returnee
Kyrgios. The power of the being who exceeded level 10 and gained the
power of a constellation left white blue trails as it passed through the
battlefield.

"Aaaaack! What the?"

Like a tsunami being split in two, the incarnations fighting each other
screamed and scattered.

"I don't know what you're fighting for but stop."

It was good to raise the ranking to resolve the ninth scenario but it wasn't
good to consume each other in this way.

"T-The Ugliest King!"

"I heard he was dead!"

There were incarnations who remembered me.

"If you know who I am, do you have a grasp of the situation?"

Some incarnations put down their weapons while others fell back. There
were those looking at me with shining eyes.

[Many incarnations are paying homage to you.]

"Thank you for the eighth scenario. The rumour about your resurrection
was real."
There were those who remembered how I sacrificed myself when I was the
'strongest sacrifice'.

They lightly nodded and willingly withdrew.

[Your resurrection story is widespread.]

[A new achievement 'Mediating Messiah' has been added to your fifth
story.]

I think they were the forces who came from Paradise. Yoo Joonghyuk and
the party members were probably also included.

Then the other side?

"Huhu. We meet again, young man. How did you get out of that array?"

As expected, they were the wanderers. I asked Lee Boksoon, "Why are you
fighting?"

"Why? It is because of you."

Lee Boksoon. She was the grandmother who had Harbin's sniper as a
sponsor.

"You shouldn't go to the next scenario.

"…Is that what my mother said?"

Lee Boksoon rushed towards me without answering.

The skill Old Strength suddenly increased the grandmother's muscle
strength, allowing her to push through the surrounding incarnations like a
train, arriving by my side in an instant.

[Under the banner of the constellation 'Goryeo's First Sword', all stats will
increase by 10 for 30 minutes.]
[All of your stats have temporarily transcended human limits.]

I couldn't say that I respected the elderly but some degree of politeness was
required. Still, this time was an exception.

"I'm sorry but I won't let you go this time, Grandmother."

The 'Harbin Sniper' was a sponsor that only showed a strong response to
certain constellations.

In other words, the current attack power was based on the power of the
stories built up by Lee Boksoon.

If so, I wouldn't be pushed.

Once all stats exceeded 100 in the Electrification state, an enormous power
emerged from my body.

Lee Boksoon was hit by my fist and flew away.

"Stop Kim Dokja!"

The forces of the wanderers surpassed my expectations. It was unbelievable
that they had been defeated by Nirvana's Salvation Church with such a
large force.

By the way, there were some strange things among the wanderers. They
were contaminated humans who had been transformed into a demonic
person.

Unfortunately, I knew this story. Han Sooyoung saw it and muttered.
"Dammit, someone got the story of the third place ranker."

Third on the Dark Castle rankings, 'King of the Dead' Davidtz.

It seemed there was a person among the wanderers who had killed Davidtz.
King of the Dead was a story that was as powerful as Paradise of Despair.
King of the Dead was a skill used to turn the dead into undead to fight.

"Get ready to run, Kim Dokja! Break through here!"

Han Sooyoung created 10 or more avatars and untied the bandage around
his right hand. Black ether focused in their hands and black flames swept
over the battlefield.

I ran along the path Han Sooyoung made. I overcame the group of demonic
person and shook off the wanderers.

Then I saw Cho Youngran using King of the Dead. As expected, this
woman had the story.

The First Spiritualist of Joseon, she had the Mechanical Gateway Array
Method and King of the Dead.

My mother had a truly versatile subordinate. She was taking a magic power
potion and looked surprised to see me. "Kim Dokja? How did you… You
were caught in the Eight Beaded Bell's seal!"

"I was a bit troubled."

Cho Youngran gathered her magic power. Maybe this person was currently
third on the Dark Castle rankings. "Stop and back off. I don't want to hurt
you."

"I can't…"

There was a sign she was using the Mechanical Gateway Array Method
again and I raised the energy I had kept hidden. Then Cheok Jungyeong's
strength was released.

[The constellation 'First Spiritualist of Joseon' is greatly confused.]
The Mechanical Gateway Array Method was broken and blood flowed
from Cho Youngran's mouth. Sparks flew behind her and a voice was
heard.

[T-This aura…! Why are you here?]

In the end, Jeon Woochi spoke in his true voice. Then Cheok Jungyeong
replied, [Get lost.]

[B-But you aren't his sponsor…!]

[I won't tell you twice.]

[Kuek…]

Jeon Woochi was crushed by the strong difference in status and quickly
disappeared.

Cho Youngran was unable to cope with the aftermath of the probability
consumption and staggered. She could no longer maintain King of the Dead
and the balance of the battlefield started to collapse.

"N-No. You can't, Kim Dokja!"

I ignored Cho Youngran and ran. I wasn't afraid of any attacks pouring
towards me because of Cheok Jungyeong. The difference in status was
huge.

After five minutes, the center of the battlefield was revealed. It was the
place where the most powerful sparks were present.

On the field where white night, the people I knew were pointing weapons at
each other.

Han Sooyoung ran up behind me and opened her mouth. "…Your mother is
a monster."
I wasn't too surprised. My mother would surely be at this level. The
information that I knew…

My mother was fighting on an equal footing with Yoo Joonghyuk and my
other colleagues.

An incarnation who could fight evenly against a transcendent didn't exist.
Behind my mother's back was the shadow of a giant bear.

[Poor descendants… I don't want to fight…]

I had seen Yamata no Orochi descend in the same form on Peace Land. It
was the descent of the shadow of Founder's Mother.

Han Sooyoung shook her head as the nightmare of Peace Land came to life.
"How… wouldn't the probability be lacking?"

"It is due to the Eight Beaded Bell."

One of the three heavenly treasures shone in my mother's hand. The lack of
probability was replaced by a powerful relic.

"If you don't want to fight then why do you keep hitting us! Uwaahh!"

The shadow of the giant bear swept through the field, causing Lee Jihye
and Lee Hyunsung to be thrown out. They couldn't stand properly against
the destructive power. It was obviously a terrible situation.

"Dokja-ssi!"

Yoo Sangah recognized me first. Then the other party members approached
me. Jung Heewon shouted first. "Dokja-ssi, talk to your mother!"

"Hyung, is that person really your mother? Yoosung…"

"Dokja-ssi, what is this situation?"
The words poured out all at once and I couldn't answer. Finally, Yoo
Joonghyuk approached me. "I guess your mother doesn't like me."
             Chapter 176: Ep. 33 - Reading Again, VII


I nodded and opened my mouth. "Still, don't kill her."

"…We must beat her. That woman has no intention of cooperating."

I glanced at my blood-soaked mother. I didn't know if it was her blood or
the blood of others.

However, she was obviously at her limits. She had somehow been fighting
with a reasonable probability but her physical strength must've bottomed
out. It was an inevitable result.

She was alone and this place had Yoo Joonghyuk.

Yoo Joonghyuk had become transcendent and was on a completely
different dimension compared to Peace Land. No matter how great the
story, it was impossible with just a shadow.
It wouldn't be easy to overcome a transcendent unless one part of the body
descended, but my mother didn't have enough probability remaining.

[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' is gulping.]

[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' is paying attention to
your choice.]

[The constellation 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' is observing your
atrocious acts.]

I left my party members and headed towards my mother. "Stop trying."

[The 'Fourth Wall' is shaking faintly.]

"Why are you stopping me?"

My mother's face didn't look good, despite it being barely visible through
the shadow of the constellation. Only her eyes and mouth were barely
revealed. It was a distance that could be crossed, but I could never reach
her. It was the same in prison and even now. This had become our distance.

She told me, "If I talk… you won't listen…"

This person, why was she going so far? Why did she keep doing this
despite her bloody body?

My companions were watching me. Their eyes were asking me to make the
right choice. I sighed and opened my mouth. "Just once. I will listen just
once, so tell me."

I was surprised by the words that came out of my mouth.

"Tell me the story properly."

I didn't know I could say this. I squeezed out these words even though I
didn't know if I was sincere or not.
My mother's eyes shook.

"How long can you stay like this? Don't keep it to yourself and tell me.
Why are you blocking me? Mother, why did you come all the way here?

Anything, saying anything is fine!"

"If I say it…"

I saw the eyes that seemed like they would cry and realized all the stories so
far had been connected.

I was her child, so I knew. The reason my mother blocked me was related
to why my mother wrote the essay.

I would be hurt. I would break. My previous life might be ruined.

"Tell me." I had long thought about it. Perhaps it was the story I had
already predicted.

There were so many hints from the constellations that it would be odd if I
didn't know. Nevertheless, I wanted to hear the story directly from my
mother's mouth.

It might completely change my life but I had to listen, even if the wall
shook again. It was because it was my story. Some stories couldn't be
understood if I missed a page.

Soon, my mother's lips opened. However, in this damn scenario, it wasn't a
story just involving mother and son.

[The nebula 'Vedas' is looking at your fate.]

[The nebula 'Olympus' is looking at your fate.]
[The nebula 'Papyrus' is looking at your fate.]

A new drama wasn't allowed for us.

The nebulae's messages popped up and intense sparks filled the air. My
mother grabbed her head with both hands and started to scream.

I yelled and ran towards her. The moment my outstretched hand was about
to reach my mother, the shadow of Founder's Mother caught me.

[Constellation Kim Dokja. You… can't pass here.]

There was a crack on the Eight Beaded Bell and black, muddy waves
overflowed. There was a fierce sound like the sky was being ripped apart,
and a vortex appeared in the sky. A portal was opening at the center of the
vortex.

[The Great Hole.]

The excessive probability had summoned a being who would destroy
everything.

"Everyone, don't look at it! Close your eyes!"

I shouted the moment I discovered the tentacles coming from the Hall. I
didn't know about Yoo Joonghyuk, who was a transcendent, but ordinary
incarnations would collapse just from seeing such an existence.

"…An outer god"

Yoo Joonghyuk's expression hardened. We were convinced when we saw
the tentacles coming from the Great Hole.

This was an outer god. A god who was called due to the sacrifice of
Founder's Mother.
Thunder fell from the crack in the sky while the distorted time and space
screamed painfully.

It was similar but different to when that guy was summoned on Peace Land.
The one being summoned now was the true body of an outer god

Based on this scale, at least one-third of the true body would be summoned.
The true body of a god. The shadow couldn't even be compared to it.

"Yoo Joonghyuk! If we don't stop it now―"

"It is too late. It isn't a level I can stop."

My body was trembling just looking at the sky. I could see it with the status
of a constellation.

[The Fourth Wall is strongly activated!]

My trembling subsided a bit by Fourth Wall but the fear didn't change. The
existence beyond that Great Hole was something that couldn't be beaten
even if the present Yoo Joonghyuk and I combined strength.

In the midst of this helplessness, I realized something. Now it wasn't a fight
for incarnations.

"Kuaaaaah!"

Some of the incarnations with historical-grade constellations shed blood
and died the moment they saw this existence. Yoo Joonghyuk and I
protected the party members and retreated. Yoo Joonghyuk's eyes were
becoming darker. I spoke in resistance,

"Don't worry. The constellations won't stay quiet once this type of guy
descends."
It was shown at the constellation banquet that the constellations and the
outer gods didn't have a good relationship. In a situation where the god
descended, no other constellations would intervene.

The Great Sage, Heaven's Equal, Uriel and the slightly reliable black flame
dragon…

However, the constellations showed no response to the true body of the god
passing through.

Yoo Joonghyuk spoke through gritted teeth. "…I don't know how they can
be ignorant."

It was a confusing situation for me as well. This was the descent of an outer
god. Why wasn't anyone coming to help us?

[Some constellations are astonished by the coming of the outer god!]

[Many constellations are complaining about the tyranny of some nebulae.

…What?

[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' is showing hostility to
the nebula Papyrus.]

[The constellation 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' is baring his fangs to the
nebula 'Vedas'.]

[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' resents the atrocious acts of
the nebula Olympus!]

Now I realized. I see. This damn situation.

[All constellation on the Korean Peninsula are wondering which nebula you
will choose.]

This was all happening because of me. The messages popped up in turn.
[A number of nebulae want you to inherit their stories.]

[If you inherit a story, your existence will be forcibly bound to the nebula.]

.

.

[The nebula Olympus wants you to inherit Carnival of Lightning.]

[The nebula Olympus wants you to inherit Thunder Guide.]

[The nebula Papyrus wants you to inherit 'Master of the Typhoon Wolf'.]

.

.

[The nebulae are offering you a final choice.]

[All the constellations on the Korean Peninsula are watching your

choice.] I laughed. This was why I didn't like the constellations.

Carnival of Lightning.

Thunder Guide.

Master of the Typhoon Wolf.

They were all stories of constellations with histories of killing their own
relatives.

At the same time, each nebula had a powerful story. Perhaps if I succeeded
their stories, I would be able to repel the outer god. Then my mother would
die here.
Yoo Joonghyuk was watching me. His eyes asked what I was going to do. I
said to him, "…Yoo Joonghyuk. Do you remember the nebula we made?
Kim Dokja's Company."

It wasn't simply to save my mother. Everything would end if I belonged to a
nebula.

There was no way I could overcome the unfair contract with them and I
would never be able to reach the end of the story.

"…You still want to use that name." Yoo Joonghyuk frowned as he moved
close to me and pulled out a sword. "I will choose the name of the nebula."

I smiled at the thought that Yoo Joonghyuk was joking. The energy of
transcendence could be felt by my side. It was strangely relieving despite
the presence of a person who had long surpassed my scale.

It might be because I felt like we were standing on the same horizon for the
first time since the scenario began.

I declared towards the stars in the night sky. "I won't bow to your fate."

I pointed my sword towards those silent gazes.

"I will decide my story."

Then I heard a laugh come from somewhere. Along with the laughing
sound, I heard a whisper from the universe that seemed to be mocking these
insignificant worms.

–Unfortunate constellation.

–You who killed your father with your own hands.

–You who will destroy your mother.

–You who will see the downfall of your precious things.
I stared at the outer god. If he finished his descent, the second floor of Dark
Castle would be completely erased.

It was a different situation from Peace Land. There was no place to go if a
crisis happened here. However…

Inside me was a constellation who was as weary of the word 'fate' as I was.

[A few hundred years have passed and things haven't changed. Damn son of
a bitch.]

Cheok Jungyeong's presence inside me started to be released. I didn't know
if it was possible for Cheok Jungyeong to cope with the god from another
world. Still, I had no choice but to believe in him.

Cheok Jungyeong shouted towards Founder's Mother, who was half eaten
by the god from another world.

[Founder's Mother! Why did you make a deal with the outer god?]

It was a deep and resonant voice filled with anger.

[Since when did Hongik become so cheap?]

Surprisingly, the Founder's Mother replied.

[I didn't make a deal… with the outer god.]

[Then what is this situation?]

[I'm sorry. There was no… other way. To protect the… scenarios of the
Korean peninsula. This incarnation… should be here. That man shouldn't
return to the Korean Peninsula. Otherwise, the other nebulae…]

[Did you make a deal with the nebulae?] Cheok Jungyeong exclaimed. [Are
you still so obsessed with that little land that you are now betraying your
descendants?]
[You don't know. You…]

[What the hell is this? Where is the creation god? Why is he invisible when
something like this is happening?]

[The creation god…]

However, the words of Founder's Mother didn't finish. The next moment, I
felt Cheok Jungyeong looking towards the sky.

[Don't tell me…?]

The night sky sent an indirect message before answering.

[The nebulae declares that anyone who helps Goryeo's First Sword will be
regarded as their enemy in the future.]

Then like magic, the indirect messages in the night sky became calm.

I heard the voices of the Great Sage, Heaven's Equal and Uriel, but they
seemed unable to intervene due to their own interests or special reasons.

Cheok Jungyeong gazed at the night sky through my eyes. I could feel the
explosive emotions mixed in the silence. Cheok Jungyeong's rage and
sadness. His grief… And… his decision.

[You can feel proud.]

Cheok Jungyeong spoke to me.

[Those who are at the highest point in this damn world are afraid of you.]

"…What is pride worth when I am going to die?"

[You won't die.]

They were just words, but they were words spoken by a constellation.
As if putting a buoy against fate, all the stories built by Cheok Jungyeong
were rooted in my existence.

[I won't let you die.]
             Chapter 177: Ep. 33 - Reading Again, VIII


Cheok Jungyeong's story filled my whole body, while the stories of Cheok
Jungyeong scattered through the Star Stream started to gather. It was a good
story that improved the status of existence just by reading.

[The story 'Dragon's Blood' has become known.]

[The story 'Wiping Out An Army With One Sword' has become known.]

[The story 'Battlefield Slaughterer' has become known.]

…

「 He was a strong man from birth. He was born with a dragon's bloodline.
」

「 "Cheok Jungyeong! Cheok Jungyeong has appeared!" 」

「 "He cut 36 enemies alone." 」
From the time of Cheok Jungyeong's birth until now. He didn't know about
the 'scenario' but he heard stories that were part of the 'scenario'.

[The story 'Exiled from the Scenario' has become known.]

「 "He is too strong. Exile him from this scenario. Use every means
possible to send him to another world." 」

I watched the passing history and felt anger, sadness, joy and frustration,
just like Cheok Jungyeong. After the bout of emotional feelings, Cheok
Jungyeong's face and solid body were seen. I had never seen Cheok
Jungyeong before but I seemed to know him better than anyone else.

This story was Cheok Jungyeong.

"Why are you going so far to help me?"

[Who knows? Why?]

Five constellations on the Ganpyeongui were consumed in exchange for
summoning Cheok Jungyeong.

However, the thing he was doing for me now far surpassed five
constellations. No constellation would disclose the base of his story to an
incarnation. In addition, Cheok Jungyeong wasn't my sponsor.

[I was like you.]

One of Cheok Jungyeong's stories flowed into my head.

[The story 'One Who Fights Against Fate' has become known.]

「 "Place Fate on him. This person has to die." 」

The words of the constellation struck me. I knew that Cheok Jungyeong had
been wronged. I didn't know he was affected by fate, just like me. A long
time ago, Cheok Jungyeong experienced the same thing due to the
constellations.

I saw the rising notification windows.

[The story 'One Who Fights Against Fate' has begun!]

Cheok Jungyeong's story was my story. Cheok Jungyeong laughed.

[It isn't the same size as your fate. There was only one nebula who did this
damn thing to me.]

Cheok Jungyeong spoke as he watched the world through my eyes.

[At that time, I survived with the help of Hongik. However, I still often
think about it. I shouldn't have received the help of any nebulae.] Cheok
Jungyeong's spirit emerged from my chest.

[That's why I want to help you.]

He raised the sword in my hand and took a specific posture. The outer god,
who had almost swallowed the Founder's Mother, roared.

Cheok Jungyeong also pulled out all his aura. The Unbroken Faith in my
hand was crying violently.

[A good sword.]

The sword shook as if in response to the remark. My magic power was
reduced, like there was a bottomless pit, while particles of pure ether
gathered in my sword.

An ether blade that was over 10 meters in length was formed. I shook from
the formidable power and tried not to lose focus.

[I will borrow it for a while.]
My body was completely possessed by Cheok Jungyeong and I started to
run with Unbroken Faith in my hands.

It was an overload that I couldn't cope with, despite my overall stats being
over level 100. The bones in my body creaked and the group exploded,
forming a huge crater.

I was confident that I could cut anything with this power.

However, I was engulfed in a sense of despair as soon as I leapt into the
void and confirmed the enemy. It was an emotion I felt while living in the
'human' world.

Could I kill such a huge thing?

The outer god beyond the Great Hole exceeded imagination just from the
size. The diameter of the body alone was at least one kilometer. Each of the
12 legs attached to the body had a diameter of several dozens of meters.

Still, not even one-fifth of it had passed through yet. If all of this guy
appeared, who the hell could kill it?

Cheok Jungyeong read my despair and laughed.

[I am Cheok Jungyeong.]

It felt like the world was listening. Or it was a declaration to the entire Star
Stream.

[The strongest military leader on the Korean Peninsula.]

Then the sword moved. There was a moment when I didn't know what I
was doing, despite being the one to do the action. It was the swordsmanship
of Cheok Jungyeong.

Two Swords Style, Two Sword Mountain Chop.
Cheok Jungyeong's sword moved. It wasn't a sword for cutting humans. It
wasn't a sword for cutting monsters. It was a sword to cut nature.

The blade that was over 10 meters moved twice in succession. This was a
giant cracking sound.

It looked more like darkness was flowing than blood and looking closer, the
darkness seemed like printed letters.

I recognized it as the story of the outer god. In a way, the outer god was the
same type of existence as the constellations.

Along with a scream, the god's tentacles were separated from the torso and
fell to the ground. It was like a huge building was falling.

The astonished incarnations evacuated in all directions while I was
surprised in another sense.

A human could cut something like this. I felt awe for a being who was born
a human but went beyond humans.

However, a terrible pain came after the amazement.

"H-Heok… kuooooh."

I started groaning from the terrible pain. A violent storm was battering my
body. I shivered like a person electrocuted by hundreds of thousands of
volts.

The bones in the hand that swung the sword were destroyed and my mind
shrivelled like a crushed bug. Strong power came with great responsibility
and in this world, the name of this responsibility was 'probability'. Still, I
wasn't ready to take responsibility yet.

[The constellation 'Goryeo's First Sword' is looking at you.]
Cheok Jungyeong was sharing the probability but I was still too weak to
handle his strength. Cheok Jungyeong sighed.

[Weaker than I thought! I thought you could afford this much because you
are a constellation…]

I wanted to say that he had too much brute strength but my words didn't
emerge.

"Cough! Pant! Pant! Pant!"

Instead of throwing up food, I threw up electricity. I sat on the ground and
breathed out for a few minutes before I barely managed to escape the
probability storm.

I looked up and saw the scene made by Cheok Jungyeong.

The sword that cut mountains.

Cheok Jungyeong had turned two of the twelve tentacles into rags from the
one attack. In other words, he cut two mountains.

However, there were 10 mountains and the torso remaining. Cheok
Jungyeong's voice was dark.

[…It is insufficient. It might be possible if I could use more three swords.]

"There are more than three swords?"

[I haven't used it yet but in your situation, I doubt I can even use three
swords.]

I gritted my teeth. The summoning speed of the outer god was
accelerating. Even if the scale of probability had been almost adjusted, the
summoning continued and it seemed furious from the blow. "Is there any
way to negotiate with that guy?"
[Negotiate? How will you negotiate with it?]

"It is also a god…"

Cheok Jungyeong noticed my intentions and interrupted me.

[If you are trying to save your mother, give up. It is a situation where the
shadow of Founder's Mother is eaten. Your mother's soul would already be
scattered.]

"It hasn't happened yet. The outer god doesn't eat its prey that way."

[It sounds like you are aware of the outer gods.]

Cheok Jungyeong didn't know. I really did know the outer god. I once again
looked at its appearance.

The two giant tentacles and body were covered in a thick fog, making it not
visible.

The body, that was reminiscent to a giant canal, provoked cosmic awe just
seeing it. There was no doubt. The Yoo Joonghyuk of the 136th regression
fought against this very god.

In fact, while I was sitting down and trying to breathe, Yoo Joonghyuk was
fighting against another tentacle.

By using the power of transcendence along with Giant Body
Transformation, Yoo Joonghyuk looked like a half-god who had descended.
The power of Breaking the Sky Sword moved over a tentacle and it shook
painfully.

Using his own strength, Yoo Joonghyuk damaged the outer god.

The level was still insignificant compared to Cheok Jungyeong but Cheok
Jungyeong spoke in an admiring voice.
[This reminds me of me in my prime. With this type of talent, he might be
able to catch up with me after a long time…]

Yoo Joonghyuk avoided the moving tentacles and cut off one-third of a
tentacle. However, there was a limit to the blow he could deal. Yoo
Joonghyuk stepped back and gasped.

"Kim Dokja, this guy is the 'Devourer of Dreams'. I met him in the second
regression. Once eaten by him, you will live in his space for the rest of your
life and have your stories extracted. You must never enter his mouth."

It was information I already knew but I nodded anyway. As Yoo Joonghyuk
and I was recuperating, the summoning of the god kept accelerating.

Now almost one-third of his body was summoned.

The summoned tentacles started to riot and the landscape hundreds of
meters around them were completely devastated. Some incarnations
screamed as they were hit by the tentacles.

The Devourer of Dreams wasn't a 'great old one' but it was still a cosmic
god. The stories from Earth couldn't deal with it unless they joined forces.
Cheok Jungyeong spoke in a dark voice.

[…If he fully descends, it isn't possible even with my strength. We have to
attack now.]

However, the situation wasn't advantageous to us at all. Sparks flew as soon
as Cheok Jungyeong pulled up his story again, crushing my heart.

[This damn probability doesn't help at all.]

This was all the probability I could use, despite the outer god being
summoned.
The meaning of this was simple. Someone had assigned the amount of
probability that could be used to us. It was stupid to ask who was behind
this.

I bit my lips and blood flowed down. "We still need to do it. Use the Three
Sword Style!"

[Your presence might disappear if I use it.]

"This is the only chance. Yoo Joonghyuk. Join forces with me this time."

Yoo Joonghyuk nodded.

I once again started running with Unbroken Faith in my hand. The sparks of
probability flew with every step that I took.

Would it be possible? I didn't know. This time I might really be crushed by
the probability storm. Still, I had to do it. I had always done it and it would
be the same again.

"Kuheeeok…"

Before I could even run 10 steps, the probability grabbed onto my ankle
again. This time, the recoil was greater.

As expected, it was impossible alone. I needed someone's help but who
could help me now?

It was different from the time with the Absolute Throne. The constellations
who tried to help me now would become enemies with the huge nebulae.

[The constellation 'Maritime War God' is looking at you.]

The amount of sparks around me were gradually decreasing.

The Duke of Loyalty and Warfare, Yi Sunsin.
He led the historical-grade constellations of the Korean Peninsula and
contributed to my probability.

Cheok Jungyeong was slightly touched.

[Duke of Loyalty and Warfare. There was a story that you are more likely
to become a narrative-grade than me.]

[The constellation 'Maritime War God' is nodding lightly.]

[Well, okay. The stories added… are there any more? Are there no
more constellations courageous enough to confront this god?] The sky
was silent.

Apart from the Duke of Loyalty and Warfare, no one else took on my
probability. Then Cheok Jungyeong's angry roar emerged.

[Baldy! Come quickly and help! Aren't you a someone who fights for
justice?]

[The constellation 'Bald General of Justice' bows his head.]

[Fucking one-eyed jerk, what are you doing?]

[The constellation 'One-Eyed Maitreya' is tightly holding his eyepatch.]

Cheok Jungyeong shouted towards the world, without worrying about his
probability being wasted and his status being damaged.

[All of you are hiding even in this situation? Aren't you constellations?
General? Maitreya? King? You don't deserve to be called this!]

[Constellations of the Korean Peninsula are silent at the words of Goryeo's
First Sword.]
Yet there still weren't any constellations who moved. At this moment, a
figure staggered in the distance.

The woman breathed roughly as she reached out to this side. It was Min
Jiwon. Fortunately, she was alive.

[The constellation 'Slumbering Lady of Fine Brocade' is looking at you.]

Then a message was heard.

[Constellations of Silla are bearing your probability together.]

The constellations of Silla were helping me. It was a modest level of help
but they were still constellations.

[The nebula 'Vedas' feels resentment towards Slumbering Lady of Fine
Brocade.]

[The constellation 'Slumbering Lady of Fine Brocade' is exhausted from the
excessive probability and has fallen into a deep sleep.]

A constellation closing their eyes meant they had suffered significant
damage to their existence.

Even so, the will of Slumbering Lady of Fine Brocade seemed to have
affected the other constellations of the Korean Peninsula.

I felt a prickling sensation as eyes started to gather on me.

[The constellation 'Bald General of Justice' says he doesn't care and is
looking at you.]

It started with Samyeongdang.

[The constellation 'One-Eyed Maitreya' is looking at you with half an eye.]
[The constellation 'King Heungmu the Great' is swearing as he looks at
you.]

[The constellation 'First Spiritualist of Joseon' sighs and looks at you.]

The sparks covering me dwindled in an instant. It was finally turning into a
likely probability.

[The nebula 'Olympus' declares that Maritime War God is an enemy.]

[The nebula 'Papyrus' is furious at the constellations of the Korean
Peninsula.]

…

Thanks to me, the whole Korean Peninsula was covered with war clouds.

Cheok Jungyeong laughed. [This is why I curse this land but I can't leave.
Fighting to the death with a few people…]

[The minimum of preparations is reached.]

Finally, Cheok Jungyeong prepared his Three Sword Style.

I'll see you Monday.
              Chapter 178: Ep. 33 - Reading Again, IX


I held onto Unbroken Faith. My muscles expanded from the powerful
stories. It was like a dragon's blood was flowing through my heart.

[Move while the force is building up. We have to make a gap.]

Yoo Joonghyuk came forward first.

"I will buy as much time as possible."

The movements of the tentacles were more active than before and the
ground was almost in ruins. We tried to move this guy as far away from the
party members as possible.

"Haaaaap!"

Yoo Joonghyuk raised his magic power and moved forward. Meanwhile, I
moved behind the Devourer of Dreams. It was to find a place where I could
hurt the main body as much as possible without hitting the tentacles. The
body was at least one kilometer in diameter so it was a hard job to find the
weak spot.

In the meantime, Cheok Jungyeong built up his strength. The one sword
and two swords were powerful enough but they couldn't be compared to the
huge force building in my right arm.

It was doubtful if this was really the power of a historical-grade
constellation.

[…Damn, this is the limit for this body. This much is possible with the
support of the probability.]

Cheok Jungyeong grumbled as the accumulation of power almost finished.

[Don't be too elated. I don't know if I can cut all the tentacles and hurt the
body with this much strength.]

"I guess. The opponent is an outer god after all. Do you have a plan?" I
asked with a bit of expectation. He spoke so confidently that I thought
Cheok Jungyeong had a countermeasure.

Cheok Jungyeong thought for a moment before replying, [I will hit him
with the Three Sword Style and hope he is tired enough to go back.]

"…Didn't you say you would protect me?"

[I will protect you. I promised in my name.]

"The strongest person on the Korean Peninsula is relying on luck in this
situation?"

I flinched at the magic power that exploded from Unbroken Faith. Was he
angry? However, Cheok Jungyeong calmed down.

[I know the 'Demon of the Horizon'.]
The Demon of the Horizon. I heard this name and glanced at Yoo
Joonghyuk, who was still fighting.

He didn't seem able to listen in on our conversation. Cheok Jungyeong
continued speaking.

[I will ask him to send you to another world. There is no time limit on the
ninth scenario. If you flee there, you will be able to live for a while. Of
course, you will have to take care of things after that.]

"What type of demon has that power?"

[Rather than a demon… he is closer to a god. You don't need to know the
details. You would be better off praying not to meet him.]

I didn't know the relationship between Cheok Jungyeong and the Demon of
the Horizon…

I pretended differently but I knew that name. It was because the Demon of
the Horizon was the existence who sent Shin Yoosung of the 41st
regression here and who supplied the 'disasters' to the dokkaebis.

I wasn't sure how Cheok Jungyeong knew the Demon of the Horizon but
perhaps he was the one who helped when Cheok Jungyeong was exiled
from the scenario.

"Can other people escape this way?"

[Such a large amount of probability isn't allowed. The dokkaebis also won't
allow it.]

"But once this happens… all the people left here will die."

If I ran away, the people here would be swallowed up by the Devourer of
Dreams and have their stories swallowed. Cheok Jungyeong clicked his
tongue.
[That isn't any of my business. Don't worry about the others. Take care of
your own life. Life is about being alone anyway.]

As expected of Cheok Jungyeong. His life philosophy was very pessimistic
due to his life of betrayal.

[A gap! Run!]

I used Electrification and flew forward with all my speed at Cheok
Jungyeong's sudden shout.

I passed through two or three tentacles but there were still five or six
blocking the way. It was dangerous to get closer. There was the place where
I should stop.

"Goryeo's First Sword. I have an idea."

[An idea? What is it? Concentrate instead of speaking nonsense!]

"To be honest, it is impossible to kill him with the Three Sword Style. You
should already know it."

The ground that the tentacles touched subsided. It would be instant death if
I was touched, no matter Cheok Jungyeong's defense.

However, Cheok Jungyeong's pressure would kill me before the tentacles.
I shouted as Cheok Jungyeong's power pressed down on me. "I'm not
saying this to provoke you. Just think about it realistically!" Cheok
Jungyeong's pressure decreased at my words.

[…So? Do you have a way to beat that guy?]

"I do. If you help, perhaps I can kill the outer god."

Cheok Jungyeong laughed in a dumbfounded manner.
[Kill the outer god? Do you know what you're saying right now? This is an
outer god. It would be hard even for those damn Olympus and Vedas guys.]

"There is no way I would say this if it was another god. However, the
Devourer of Dreams… it might be possible."

[…I am listening. What is the method?]

"Hurt his body and throw me into it."

Cheok Jungyeong was confused and at a loss for words. The giant tentacles
were coming once again.

[If you do that, you will die. You won't survive being eaten by him. Didn't
you hear the words of that good-looking guy before? Once you are eaten by
him―]

"I will survive."

I was convinced as I listened to him.

I was certain that I could survive being eaten by this outer god. No
constellation, let alone a mortal, could feel this conviction. Cheok
Jungyeong trembled as if he was incensed and opened his mouth.

[…Is there something you can do?]

"I can't say it is 100%."

I might be able to get help from the Demon of the Horizon through Cheok
Jungyeong. Yet there would be nothing left for me if I survived alone.
Escape was a denial of everything I had built up so far.

Thus, I chose this approach.

[Kuhuk…]
The silent Cheok Jungyeong suddenly gave a huge laugh. It was a laugh
that seemed to fill the plains.

[I lived long enough to see the day. The day when a man like you believes
he can fight against that god.]

Finally, the upper body of the Devourer of Dreams started to be summoned.

The first eye that watched the world was revealed. As soon as the gaze of
the Devourer of Dreams touched on the ground, the sensation filled me with
more trepidation than I had ever felt.

If I fought this thing, I would die. No matter what I did, I couldn't win
against it. Cheok Jungyeong sighed.

[Stupid constellation.]

"Yes."

[I like you. So don't die.]

I nodded and ran. The mountain of tentacles soared into the sky. I used
Electrification and there was a blue-white trail everywhere I passed.

[Come, outer god!]

Cheok Jungyeong gripped the sword in my hand. All of Cheok Jungyeong's
stories were gathered and the Three Sword Style was expressed.

[I, Cheok Jungyeong, will cut you!}

The ether blade increased.

The blade that was 10 meters long increased to 20 meters. The blade that
was 20 meters long increased to 30 meters.
The power that transcended my magic power and my story was falling
down here.

Three Sword Style, Three Sword Ocean Chop.

I knew it the moment I drew the sword. This…

In my head, I saw Cheok Jungyeong standing in front of the sea. Cheok
Jungyeong watched the sea from dawn to dusk.

All the years of watching the sea, looking at the distant horizon until he saw
the 'target'.

It was one line that distorted the balance of time and space. The waves split
apart and the waters had the illusion of splitting.

This was a sword made to cut the sea.

[The constellation 'Maritime War God' admires the power of Goryeo's First
Sword!]

[The constellation 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' admires the power of the
pure human constellation!]

[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' shows great interest in
Goryeo's First Sword!]

The air exploded and all sound was swallowed. I swung my sword despite
feeling like my body was going through a blender.

One sword, two swords, three swords. After wielding three swords, the fuse
of my consciousness was completely broken.

Really, just wait a moment.

[…Up!]
Then Cheok Jungyeong called out to me.

[Wake up! Stupid constellation!]

I barely managed to open my eyes and saw a few strands of tentacles
floating in the air. However, the tentacles were no longer what I
remembered. Seven of the twelve tentacles had been cut apart and fell to
the ground.

Cheok Jungyeong was a historical-grade constellation. He cut half of the
tentacles with his own strength. Nevertheless, Cheok Jungyeong spoke like
he was angry.

[…I couldn't cause a deep wound because of lacking strength. I couldn't cut
him with the sword that cuts the sea.]

"No, this is enough. It is enough for success."

Cheok Jungyeong was successful. Beyond the tentacles, there was a huge
horizontal scar on the main body. The Three Sword Style had cut off the
tentacles and wounded the main body.

It was a small wound compared to the size of the guy but it was wide
enough for me to enter. A pained cry burst out from the Devourer of
Dreams.

I had to run over there. I had to do it right now. Before his wound healed, I
must enter the wound. This was the way to end this scenario.

[The nebula 'Vedas' is ridiculing your adversity.]

Dammit, I wanted to deal a blow to those damn nebulae. By the way…

[The nebula 'Papyrus' is toasting your scenario.]

My legs didn't move. No matter how much strength I used, my legs
wouldn't budge. No, I couldn't even feel my strength.
What…

[The constellation 'Queen of the Darkest Spring' is looking at you with sad
eyes.]

I looked down and realized the state I was in. I couldn't see anything below
my knees.

My lower legs had disappeared like it had been cut by something. Blood
constantly flowed from the cut sections. It was probably the world of the
tentacles while I was using the Three Sword Style.

Dammit. I was almost there yet a situation like this occurred.

In the meantime, the duration of Electrification ended. Little by little, the
injury on the god was healing. It wasn't a distance I couldn't cross in the
state where I lost my lower legs.

"Kim Dokja."

I turned my head and saw the bloody Yoo Joonghyuk. Yoo Joonghyuk
staggered to me, grabbed me by the collar and lifted me onto his shoulders.

He looked at the wound on the god and asked, "I have to throw you over
there?"

"…Can you do it?"

Yoo Joonghyuk didn't answer. He just showed it with his actions. Yoo
Joonghyuk jumped onto what seemed like stairs in the air.

He stepped on the tentacles while using Air Steps. I could hear a slight
creaking sound from Yoo Joonghyuk's body. His body was already at the
limit. Even so, Yoo Joonghyuk didn't give up.

He climbed and climbed again. Soon afterwards, the distant wind soaked
my cheeks.
Yoo Joonghyuk stopped his magic power and paused. I looked up and the
wound on the god was right in front of me.

Despite the lack of time, Yoo Joonghyuk hesitated. He hesitated while
holding tightly to my collar. "…We don't have to hold another funeral,
right?"

I smiled because of Yoo Joonghyuk's question. "Even if I die, I will rise
again."

"That isn't what I mean."

Yoo Joonghyuk's expression was serious. A high wind blew between me
and Yoo Joonghyuk.

I looked at him for a moment before asking, "Do you remember the second
scenario?"

The subway of Oksu Station. It was where Yoo Joonghyuk first appeared
after smashing everything. He was a cold-blooded regressor who would use
whatever means necessary for the results.

Yoo Joonghyuk's calm eyes shook at my words.

Who would've known at the time? Me and this guy, we would actually end
up as companions. I hadn't wanted to admit it but now I had to. The things
that hadn't seemed possible became reality. I was actually going through the
scenarios with him.

That's why I could now say it. Just like I did when I first met him on Han
River Bridge. This was the way that suited us best.

"Release your hand and get lost, you damn son of a bitch."
            Chapter 179: Ep. 34 - Unable to be Eaten, I


Yoo Joonghyuk's expression slowly changed as he held me by the neck.
Previously, I would already be falling through the air.

Now everything was the opposite. I flew through the air instead of falling.
Yoo Joonghyuk had thrown me as hard as he could.

Yoo Joonghyuk was watching me. His expression showed he was certain
that I wouldn't die. I didn't hear his voice but I could tell what he was
saying.

'Feed him one blow, Kim Dokja'.

The moment I was about to answer, the tentacles blocked my gaze.

The attack of the tentacles missed me by a hair's breadth and I landed on the
Devourer of Dreams body. I used the strength remaining in my arms to grab
the body and move towards the wound.
This guy was a life-threatening presence just through touch. If I was still an
incarnation, I might've already passed out or died. If he finished his
descent… it was scary to think about what might happen.

I threw my body into the wound.

[…I'm sorry. I can't go with you.]

Power drained from my body and I felt Cheok Jungyeong's strength
scattering. I didn't panic because I had already expected it.

Soon afterwards, the wound connected to the outside completely closed.

I floated in the air, like a person floating in the universe. The inside of the
Devourer of Dreams was as dark as the sky. It was a space with no blood or
flesh. It was natural since the outer god wasn't a living thing.

Dung… dung… dung…

I heard the sound of drums coming from somewhere. Then there was a
whispering. Someone gazed at me. It wasn't hard to breathe despite there
being no air. Perhaps the moment I entered this space, my very existence
was transformed.

Then after a while, all sounds disappeared. The screams of the incarnations
and the messages of the constellations were gone.

Instead, there were unknown characters and images. This was the stomach
of the Devourer of Dreams. It was a place where all the stories he had eaten
were gathered.

「■■■■■■■…」

「 #%&^#$^ 」

There were some stories I could recognize. Perhaps they were from
Founder's Mother.
「 It is my fault. The foolish history was too long… 」

「 I have to protect this land from the nebulae. However, now there is no
one in Hongik. Where have all the gods of creation gone? 」

「 Hwanung… I want to see Hwanung. 」

Then a story with a small light came up to me and shouted,

「 What are you doing? Why are you here? Run away…! 」

The light flickered. Thank you but there was nowhere for me to run away
to.

The 'outer gods' were existences rooted in the distant outer universe. Half of
his body was connected to the second floor of Dark Castle while the inside
of his body was directly connected to the outer universe.

Thus, his stomach was like outer space to me. It was a world of sheer
emptiness, only filled with the desire to eat.

The Devourer of Dreams wanted me.

The scattered letters gathered together and started to form a shape. In this
empty space, eyes and a mouth were created. In fact, I wasn't sure if they
were eyes or a mouth, but I had to think of it in these terms since I was a
human.

He seemed to be saying something but his voice wasn't heard properly.
After a while, the letters shivered and started to transform into words that I
could understand.

[ The smell of an interesting story… ]
The moment that two eyes looked at me, I gulped without knowing it. This
was the presence of a god who caused fear in even the narrative-grade
constellations.

[ The presence of an inferior scenario… how… do you hear me? ]

[The exclusive skill 'Fourth Wall' is extremely active!]

The Fourth Wall became more active than it had ever been so far. I felt like
a wall was growing on my skin.

It meant this enemy was dangerous.

He wasn't even a 'great old ones'. I couldn't imagine what the gods such as
'The Fear of Sarnath', 'Horror from the Hills' or 'Master of R'lyeh' would be
like.

I took a deep breath and slowly opened my mouth. "Devourer of Dreams.
You are a great god of another world."

[ Ohh… ]

The letters of Devourer of Dreams twitched like he was surprised by my
words. In this guy's eyes, I wasn't even a bug. I was a strange toy he could
erase at any time.

Strong sparks occurred around me and the letters started to revolve. There
was something that wanted to penetrate inside me. However, as soon as it
reached my side, it was bounced off.

The letters of Devourer of Dreams spoke in a subdued manner.

[ What… are you? Are you under a special protection? ]

This guy had attempted to mentally invade me. Then he had been bounced
off by the Fourth Wall.
I would've been destroyed if I didn't have this skill. I controlled my heart
and looked at the Devourer of Dreams.

As I said before, the Yoo Joonghyuk of the 136th regression was eaten by
him. However, Yoo Joonghyuk didn't die. In other words, my current basis
was his 136th attempt.

I slowly opened my mouth so that I wouldn't be caught by his boundaries.

"I came to tell you a story."

[ Story! I like stories. ]

The outer god reacted immediately. The monstrous greed caused him to
become fuzzy.

"Among all the stories you have eaten, there are those belonging to
Lee Sookyung. Please send her back." The face looked puzzled.

[ This… isn't a story? ]

"I will tell you a story in exchange."

[ What story will you tell me? ]

I pointed to myself without speaking. It was obvious what I meant. I was
making a bet with my existence at stake. The big eyelids slowly blinked.

[ Small constellation… ]

"Yes."

[ Do you intend to make a deal with me? ]

The moment I was going to open my mouth, shapes appeared in the air. It
was an image made up of the stories that Devourer of Dreams had
devoured.
[ The bear doesn't talk to the fish. ]

The image shown was a giant bear, reminiscent of Founder's Mother. The
bear looked around with foolish eyes and caught the fish flowing through
the empty universe.

The Devourer of Dreams looked at the bear and said, [ Human, I don't
negotiate with bugs… ]

I hadn't been properly recognized yet. A half-constellation couldn't deal
with a cosmic deity. It was a natural story.

However, I shook my head.

"If bugs talk like humans, think like humans and act like humans, they can't
be called bugs anymore."

I glared at the two huge, black eyes.

[ You… aren't qualified to make a deal with me. I can take away everything
you have at any time. ]

"Then why are you talking to a bug instead of taking it away?"

[······.]

The bear eating the fish looked at me. The bear raised its paws in a
threatening manner, as if it was going to hit me right away. I stared at the
bear and said,

"The bear knows how to eat fish but it doesn't know how to eat them
deliciously."

The bear's paw hesitated.

"The feet are damaged by the scales, the claws are dirty after taking out the
guts of the fish and it just fills its anger."
[······.]

"Just as I'm not a bug, you're not a bear. Isn't that right?"

The letters in the space jumbled together and the Eater of Dream's face
became bizarre. Usually, I would be terrified but I had read the original
novel.

I started grinning. This situation was too pleasant for me to bear.

"All the stories will be damaged if you forcibly take them. If you trample
on me right now, you won't get a 'perfect' story. I will tell you a story that
you can eat in its best condition. You'll always be able to eat it."

Dung… dung… dung!

Once again, I heard a drumming sound. It was like a giant beast's pulse. The
tempo of the sound became increasingly faster.

Dung! Dung! Dung! Dung!

I had read the original work and knew the identity of this drumming sound.

[ I want to eat you. ]

This sound was the Eater of Dream's hunger. I gulped and raised both
hands. "If you keep your promise, I will give you a lot."

The letters turned into smoke and started to form a shape. After a while, it
took on the appearance of my mother.

[ Is this what you want? ]

I nodded.
[ This story has some interesting corners. I saved it because it smelt more
delicious than the shell of the constellation I ate along with it. I want to eat
you very badly but I can't afford to give you this story. ]

"Are you a beast who can't control your hunger?"

[ Is there anyone who would be offended by the insults of bugs? ]

…Fucking bastard.

I didn't know what rank he was among gourmets but he was low among the
outer gods. The letters formed a brutal smile.

[ The conversation with you ends here. I will eat all of you. ]

The image of the bear who caught the fish flew towards me baring sharp
teeth like a piranha. There was no place to run away. My legs couldn't
move and in any case, I was in his stomach.

"Shit, fine. If you want to eat then eat as much as you like." Instead, I
spread open my arms and greeted him. "Be sure to eat all of it." Hundreds
of fish started to eat at my body.

They bit at my arms, my legs, my back and my face. I felt a terrible pain
but no blood came out. Instead, it was letters. The stories and histories I had
built up started to leak out after I was bitten by his teeth.

[ Ohhhhh…! T-This is? ]

The god shrieked with joy at the heavenly delicacies. My consciousness
was blurred and there was a pounding in my head. Nevertheless, I held on. I
had to hold on until he ate the part I was thinking about.

[ Ohh… oh? ]
The next moment, something poured out of me like a waterfall. He had
touched something.

[The exclusive skill 'Fourth Wall' has reacted to the vibrations hitting the
wall.]

The moment I was waiting for had finally come. The letters poured into his
stomach, creating a torrent. It was an enormous amount of stories.

[ You, what the hell are you…? ]

The baffled Devourer of Dreams cried out to me but I didn't have the
strength to answer.

I was hard to keep my sanity with all the stories pouring out. I looked at the
sentences passing in front of my eyes.

「 Yoo Joonghyuk looked at the mouth of Devourer of Dreams and spoke.
」

It was the contents of Ways of Survival.

「 "Yes, if you want to eat me, eat as much as you can." 」

It was the 136th regression Yoo Joonghyuk. Yoo Joonghyuk was eaten by
the Devourer of Dreams and had been in the same situation as me.

[ This, what the hell is this…! ]

Yoo Joonghyuk of Ways of Survival replied on my behalf.

「 "You will know. You will experience what it is like to have lived 136
times. You will know all the loneliness, sorrow, anger and hatred towards
this damn world that I felt during this awful time." 」

[ K-Kuaaah…! ]
「 "You think of humans as worse than bugs. If so, feel it from now on. 」

[ Wait, wait a minute…! ]

「 "The pain that bugs suffer. Feel the history of the bug that you can't
handle. If you have the confidence to eat me, then eat and eat as much as
you can!" 」

The stories pouring all filled the stomach of the Devourer of Dreams with
continuous explosions. The Devourer of Dreams ate Ways of Survival and
struggled with the pain.

Somewhere in his stomach, cracks started to appear. Ways of Survival
spoke as if laughing at the confused Devourer of Dreams.

「 It was the moment when the Devourer of Dreams, who was born in
space and lived for 8,000 years, realized it. 」

[ Kuooooooh…! ]

It was the scene where Yoo Joonghyuk first killed a 'god'. I had read it over
and over again, almost memorizing it. I paraphrased the following sentence
on behalf of Ways of Survival.

"In this world, there is a story that should never be eaten."
            Chapter 180: Ep. 34 - Unable to be Eaten, II


In the original novel, the Devourer of Dreams swallowed Yoo Joonghyuk,
struggled against the terrible life that Yoo Joonghyuk suffered and
eventually disappeared. It was a disaster caused by overeating. However,
this was the story in Ways of Survival.

It wasn't the 136th regression that he would eat this time.

[ Kuooooooh…! ]

The third regression, the fourth regression, the fifth regression…

「 "Do you know what will happen if humans live for thousands of years?"
」

The 36th regression, the 47th regression, the 69th regression…

「 "Have you ever thought about the pain of an endlessly repeating life?"
」
The 141st regression, the 143rd regression, the 148th regression…

「 "This is human suffering. You damn tentacles bastard." 」

There was a feast of memories that never ended. Cracks started to spread
through the engorged space. After eating what shouldn't be eaten, the crazy
Devourer of Dreams started to riot.

However, he had no place to go because this was his stomach. No one
could escape from themselves.

[ Kuooooooh! ]

The flood of words was larger than what he could handle.

The stories that weren't absorbed flew away and the flood of stories swept
over the outer universe like waves. The wreckage of the damaged stomach
scattered.

The Fourth Wall is slowly opening its eyes.] [The

Fourth Wall is searching for something to eat.] The

startled Devourer of Dreams stared at me.

[The Fourth Wall laughs at the Devourer of Dreams.]

Now the relationship between predator and prey had changed.

[Kuaaaaah…]

The Fourth Wall, which was made up of many letters, started to swallow
the stories of the Devourer of Dreams.

It was purely hungry eating, without caring about gourmet food. The
countless fish and other symbols of the Devourer of Dreams tried to flee,
but it couldn't escape from the persistent wall.
The stories that he had eaten for 8,000 years were crushed to powder and
sucked into the wall. The patterns on the wall emitted a bright light.

The voice of the unauthorized guy who read the story was shocked.

[■■…?]

More than half his thoughts had been consumed and they appeared on the
wall.

「 Surely this isn't ■■…? 」

[ Ohhhh… ]

「The great old ones! Where are all of you? 」

At the last moment, he tried to abandon everything and run, but the Fourth
Wall was one step faster. The wall exposed its terrible teeth and swallowed
the contents of the stomach.

[ Ohhh… great old… ohhhh. ]

There was a dazzling light and the open mouth of the wall finally closed.

[The Fourth Wall has finished eating.]

[You have defeated an outer god!]

.

.

.

[The Star Stream has failed to find a suitable name for your achievement.]

[An unknown achievement will be added to your fifth story.]
[Your status, which was about to be confirmed, will be re-evaluated.]

The fragments of the Devourer of Dreams scattered and I remained in the
void of the outer universe with a few stories.

The space didn't collapse even though the Devourer of Dreams was dead. I
still hadn't returned to my original world.

[The gods of the outer universe are greatly confused after hearing of the
death of Devourer of Dreams.]

[The outer gods are trying to figure out what happened in his scenario.]

[Some 'great old beings' are watching you'.]

A feeling of nausea rose inside me. Perhaps it was because my spirit had
been eaten but I felt weakened.

"Heok, heok… kueeek!"

It was a horrible experience. Yoo Joonghyuk had done this in the 136th
regression.

"Kueeeek!"

After vomiting a few times, I searched through the fragments of the story
for my mother.

Fortunately, the image formed by Devourer of Dreams was preserved. She
stood there with closed eyes.

Was she still alive? I didn't know. I tested my mother's pulse and shook her
shoulders. "Please wake up."

First, I had to take my mother out of here. I looked around.

…Why wasn't this space broken?
In the 136th regression, there was the scene where Yoo Joonghyuk killed
the Devourer of Dreams, this space collapsed and he returned to the original
world. The outer universe was operated with the power of the outer god.
Once the outer god died, it should be broken. This time, the outer god died
but his space was still maintained. Why?

[The Fourth Wall is looking at you.]

…Don't tell me?

[The Fourth Wall shakes its head with regret.]

[The Fourth Wall is still hungry.]

It ate so many stories yet it was still hungry?

[The Fourth Wall has started to suck the remaining remnants.]

It was as if a vacuum cleaner was turned on as the Fourth Wall opened its
mouth and started to suck in the rest of the surroundings.

The remaining stories, the dust and…

"Wait! Wait!"

Even my mother who was in my arms. I flew towards the wall.

"Hey! Don't eat that!"

Before I could reach the wall, my mother was sucked into it. The mouth
devoured my mother's head, arms and torso.

"Shit! I told you not to eat that!"

[The Fourth Wall is laughing with satisfaction.]

[The Fourth Wall is licking its lips as it looks at you.]
I had to ask something. There was something I hadn't heard yet. Yet this
damn wall had swallowed my mother.

What happened after being swallowed by the wall? I didn't know. One thing
was for certain, none of the beings eaten by the wall had returned.

The Theatre Dungeon's master, the reincarnator Nirvana and even the
Devourer of Dreams…

Was there any possibility of my mother surviving when even an outer god
couldn't survive?

"Spit her out!"

I started punching the Fourth Wall. The wall licked its lips towards me but
showed no signs of eating me. The surface of the wall faintly shook at my
punch.

Punch and punch again. I knew it was foolish but I didn't stop. I couldn't
stop. How much did I hit the wall? Then a message appeared on the wall.

「 First, I remember when I gave that child a name. 」

I stared blankly at the sentence. I realized what it meant after a short time.

「 He wanted to use Dok (alone) and I wanted Dok (reader). Maybe it was
from here that he and I became different. 」

I groaned and hit the wall. I never wanted to hear the story this way.

「 I wanted him to be a reader rather than a lonely person. As long as they
read something, humans won't be lonely. I probably wanted to believe this.
」

As soon as my punches stopped, countless sentences appeared on the wall. I
couldn't believe how many sentences there were in a person's lifetime.
「 "I should stay at home? Huh? Why should I live like this? How long do I
have to live while supporting you and that child!" 」

「 "Sookyung, you have to endure it. Think of Dokja. The man will only do
it for a moment." 」

「 "Mother, I think you should pay attention to Dokja." 」

I cursed and started beating on the wall again. There were some things I
remembered but some things I didn't. Still, the feelings of those days were
vivid.

「 It was hard. At the time, I was so tired that I couldn't think of anything
else. When I thought about it, it was just as hard for my child. 」

My mother had suffered in those days. Violence against a woman, a mother
and a person, it should never be done.

「 "Dokja. Get in here. Understood? Don't come out until Mother says you
can." 」

The merciless words continuously appeared and I once again suffered my
childhood from another point of view.

It sounded like a completely strange story, despite it being something I had
experienced personally.

This was what happened. It was so painful. It was miserable. By the way,
why had I forgotten all of this? Did I just want to forget?

Meanwhile, the wall continued to speak.

「 I should've left him. No matter what other people said, I should've taken
that child and gone to a distant place. 」 She should've left in the end.
「 Why didn't I? 」

It was a record filled with remorse and regret. This was my mother, who
was 'silent' in reality. Now she was opening her mouth when it was a novel.

「 It happened late in the evening. 」 Finally, the story began.

「 "Bring more alcohol!" 」

My father's voice shouted to bring more alcohol. He pushed my mother and
hit her stomach. My father was threatening.

"Y-You! Put down the knife and let's talk!" 」

Slowly, the memories were coming back. The little boy hiding in the room
stuck out his head. That's right. At that time, my father was holding a knife
and acting threatening.

「 "Dokja! I told you to stay in your room!" 」

My mother shouted and ran towards me. My drunk father swung the knife
threateningly.

「 You will die and I will die as well. Eh? Should we all die? Aren't we
fucked up living together like this? Huh? Then let's die together! 」

My mother threw her body forward. There was a sound and my father's
body collapsed. A knife dropped to the ground. Alcohol flowed from a
rolling wine bottle. I knew the next scene. My mother would pick up the
fallen knife and stab my father. Then she would tell me, 'From now on, I
will read all of this again'.

「 "U… Uwaaaack!" 」

By the way…
「 "Dokja. No! Put down that thing!" 」 What was this?

「 "Dokja!" 」

I picked up the knife and was trembling as I stared at my father. My small
face was covered in tears. My father laughed mockingly and swung his fist.
Instead of hitting my mother, my father slipped on the bottle. Then… Blood
emerged from his mouth.

「 If I immediately called for help, he might've been able to live. 」 I felt
clogged up.

I was the only one who could save him and I chose not to. 」 This accident
changed our lives.

「The words I told the child weren't a lie. I was the one who killed him. 」

My mother took away the knife from the child who lost his mind. Then
after a few deep breaths, she quietly woke me up.

「 "Dokja. From now on, I will read all of this again. 」

「 "Your father did something wrong and died. This was self-defense.
Understood? 」

「 "No matter what, you must not forget that you are the victim." 」 My
mother's voice permeated my ears.

「 Perhaps many things were decided at that time. 」

The mother searched for cases relating to murder and manipulated the
evidence. She ruled out anything that could involve me. This ended up
making the accidental death seem like a premeditated crime.
「 Someone has to live as a murderer. Someone else has to live as the son
of a murderer. 」

Now I remembered.

"…It was because of this?"

I placed my hands on the wall and bowed my head for a while.

…In fact, I knew. I thought it might be this and it was the only reason that
would make me understand my mother's behaviour.

The reason why she suddenly wrote the essay was to make me the son of a
murderer, not a murderer.

「 I often think about it. 」

Maybe it was all an excuse. 」

「 There could've been a better way. 」

「 No matter what, I shouldn't have left the child alone. 」

「 As a mother, I shouldn't have acted that way. 」

…

「 In the end, I'm just a mother who ran away. 」

This was the last sentence. I waited just in case, hitting the wall a few
times. However, no more sentences appeared.

It shouldn't be like this. In this way, I wouldn't be able to hear the end of
this ridiculous story.

"Spit her out! Spit her out!"
I started to frantically hit the wall.

"Fuck!"

The Fourth Wall licked my fists. The blood, memories and stories on my
fist were sucked into the Fourth Wall. I didn't cry.

「 Kim Dokja was crying. 」 The Fourth Wall said.

「 Kim Dokja quietly clenched his fists. 」 Bang!

「 He hit the wall. 」 Bang!

「 He hit it again. 」



"Fuck!"

「 Kim Dokja got goosebumps. Everything was becoming a story. All his
actions and words in the scenarios were becoming sentences on the wall. 」

"Shut up!"

「 Kim Dokja wanted to know. What should he do? How could he break
this wall? Was this the price for reading Ways of Survival? He read it and
his reality became a novel. Then a noise like a page tearing was heard. 」

Jiiiiiik!

「 Kim Dokja thought… (Hey)… what is this? 」

I finally saw unnatural words on the wall. It was like graffiti left behind by
someone who read the novel.

「 Kim Dokja was amazed… (Stay upright)… Who was talking to him? …
(This is your skill)… Who was it? …(You shouldn't be eaten by your skill)
… What… (You idiot, quickly take off your hands!) 」 I saw that the wall
was swallowing my fist.

「…(Turn the skill off, Kim Dokja)… 」

Enlightenment ran through my head. I didn't know who I was talking to. I
didn't know if it was possible or not.

However, it was clear what I had to do. "I will turn off the Fourth Wall."

An electric current flowed through the wall as it shook violently. For the
first time, I felt something around me fading.

The wall was collapsing.

The next moment, a message was heard.

[The system error due to unknown causes is temporarily fixed.]

.

.

[Your Attributes Window has been restored.]

[Do you want to check the Attributes Window now?]
           Chapter 181: Ep. 34 - Unable to be Eaten, III


I could see the Attributes Window? I finally understood a few things that
didn't make sense.

The reason I hadn't been able to see my Attributes Window was due to
Fourth Wall. The Fourth Wall protected me from other beings but at the
same time, it was a skill that isolated me from myself.

[Checking the Attributes Window.]

[The system configuration is unstable. Some skill names and levels are
limited.]

Then for the first time, I saw my Attributes Window.
 [Personal Information]

  Name: Kim Dokja

  Age: 28 years old
  Sponsor: None

  Modifier: The Ugliest King (Tentative)

  Exclusive Attributes: Eight Lives (Hero), Scenario…



Before the Attributes Window was fully revealed, the screen crashed and
sudden messages emerged.

[Some constellations are approaching your mental barrier.]

At this moment, I wanted to say oops. Maybe the constellations had been
looking for this opportunity—for the day that my information was revealed
to the world.

[Constellations of the nebula 'Vedas' are approaching you.]

[Constellations of the nebula 'Olympus' are approaching you.]

[Constellations of the nebula 'Papyrus' are approaching you.]

The constellations who sought to improve my existence started to forcibly
open my mind. At this moment.

[The exclusive skill 'Fourth Wall' is reactivated independently of your will!]
    Exclusive Skills: Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint Lv. ?, Bookmark Lv.

    ?, Character List Lv. ?, Fourth Wall Lv. ?, ■■■■ Lv. ?, ■■■■■■■■…
    .

    .

    Overall Evaluation: …■■ you ■■■■■■…?


A lot of the information was hidden by '■'.

As numerous bricks piled up, strong sparks that concealed my information
appeared.

[The constellation 'Founder of Humanity' is groaning.]

[The constellation 'Poked Out His Eyes' is covering his eyes and stepping
back.]

[The constellation 'Scorpion Goddess' steps back while protecting her tail.]

.

.

[Some of the constellations approaching you are struck and have retreated!]

The countless letters rotated reliably.

The fierce sparks of the Fourth Wall were protecting me from the
constellations. The guy who was fighting me a while ago was now emitting
a fierce aura towards the constellations.

[The Fourth Wall is baring its teeth towards the Star Stream.]
I stared at the Fourth Wall. The last thing I heard was a message from a
wellknown constellation.

[The constellation 'Secretive Plotter' is smiling at you.]

The message was distinctively different from the other constellations.

…Surely he didn't see my information in such a short period of time? Even
if he did see it, he wouldn't have been able to check everything. I couldn't
confirm all the information despite opening the Attributes Window.

The sparks calmed down and the wall turned towards me again.

[The Fourth Wall is angry with you.]

I stared at the wall.

For a long time, I thought this wall was the boundary between the novel and
reality. The wall allowed me to adapt to the new world and show unusual
judgment in terrible situations.

However, once I asked about the actual identity of the 'wall', I couldn't
come to a conclusion. The only thing I could be certain of was that this wall
had protected me for a long time.

There were a few crises but I overcame them due to the presence of this
wall. It was thanks to this wall that I could arrive here.

I brought my hands towards the letters making up the wall.

"I'm sorry."

[The Fourth Wall is shaking.]

The strange texture of the letters wrapped around my fingers. The Fourth
Wall felt like this.
The letters of the wall clung to my hands like doctor fish (red garra). They
seemed to be licking and biting me. It was a feeling that couldn't be clearly
shared. There was no analogy for it. The Fourth Wall was like a wet puppy,
an abandoned child, a teenager who didn't listen etc.

The Fourth Wall… The Fourth Wall was like me.

Then a sentence appeared on the wall.

「 Kim Dok ja is an i diot. 」

The sentence seemed to have been written by a child just learning Hangul.
It wasn't a story related to me or the world. It was the words of the Fourth
Wall.

I smiled at the wall.

…$#^#$^#$%@#$… 」

The Fourth Wall wrote unrecognized characters, as if it was confused for a
moment. Then after a while, it wrote a sentence again.

「 Kim Dokja thought, 'The Fourth Wall is an existence with its own will
as well'. 」

…It was starting again.

「 Then were the words written in brackets from the Fourth Wall?
However, the Fourth Wall's tone is too static compared to that… then who
wrote those words? If this really is a wall, there is something else in the
wall… 」

"Stop reading other people's thoughts."

[The Fourth Wall is turning its head away.]
[The Fourth Wall is telling you not to forcibly turn it off again.]

I kept talking while touching the Fourth Wall. "I know. Instead, I have a
request."

[The Fourth Wall is looking at you.]

I took a brief breath before saying, "Give me back my mother."

The wall shook briefly, as if to judge if my words were true or

not.

Then a sentence appeared on the wall.

「 Kim Dokja hates his mother. 」

"That's right."

「Kim Dokja knows what happened with his mother. He knows what his
mother has been through, the life she lived and what she was hiding. Just
because he knows doesn't mean he understands everything. 」

"…Yes."

Because of this, Kim Dokja still hates his mother. This is what human
emotions are like. There is no magic that will heal all wounds just because
someone else has a deep wound as well. 」

"You have great insight. I agree."

「 Thus, Kim Dokja can't understand it himself. Why is he trying to save
his mother? 」

"I can't explain."

「······ 」
"Not everything can be expressed in sentences."

I quietly looked at the wall and said, "I don't have much energy left. Please
help me. I'm asking you."

The Fourth Wall was silent for a long time before displaying the following
sentence,

「 Kim Dokja… 」

Could an existence who already entered the wall come out again? I didn't
know if it was possible or not. Still, I had to try.

Then the wall started to move. Something was vomited out from the wall.

There were numerous letters. The letters gathered to become words and the
words came together to become sentences. The sentences gathered into
paragraphs and the paragraphs gathered again to become a story.

The story soon formed a person.

I embraced my mother who was lying in the letters. Then I told the Fourth
Wall, "Thank you."

The Fourth Wall shook and started to disperse.

Sl, ee, py. 」

Little by little, the surrounding space was broken.

[The constellation 'Secretive Plotter' is snapping at the 'great old ones'
spying on you.]

The darkness of the outer universe was clearing away.

Time and space were broken and the surrounding scenery changed to the
second floor of Dark Castle.
Then the subsequent messages appeared.

[Your Dark Castle ranking has changed.]

[Your current Dark Castle ranking is 2nd

place.]

.

.

[You have met the hidden goal of the main scenario.]

[You are eligible to participate in the last scenario of Dark Castle.]




Two days had passed since the battle on the plains. All mortals lost their
fighting spirit in the face of a god.

The forces of the wanderers and the forces of Paradise. In a sense, the
powerful despair brought peace to all of them.

The commanders of the wanderers and the commanders of Paradise settled
the dead and cleared up the situation. The unnecessary disturbance
disappeared and the second floor of Dark Castle was slowly gaining
stability.



The rankers were slowly selected to go up to the next floor and people
agreed to entrust them with the future of Dark Castle.

Most rankers were gathered in front of a small coffin.
"It is his job to die all the time."

Kim Dokja died as soon as he came back from defeating the outer gods.

He fought against such a mighty being that his companions thought it was
natural. Jung Heewon said, "Will he be alive again tomorrow? Last time it
also took three days."

The group had adjusted to Kim Dokja dying and weren't as shocked. Yoo
Sangah bit her lips and wondered,

"…By the way, did we need to put him in a coffin?"

"Even the dead should be put in a bed…" Jung Heewon made an excuse.

The party members stared at Kim Dokja's coffin with different meanings.
Lee Hyunsung was watching with a reverent gaze, Shin Yoosung looked
guilty and Yoo Sangah was confused. Then…

"By the way, Master. I thought you would go to find hidden pieces…" At
Lee Jihye's words, the party members all looked from the coffin towards a
certain place.

Yoo Joonghyuk frowned at the gazes and replied, "Now the only hidden
pieces in Dark Castle are worthless."

"Then the reason why you came here…"

"I need Kim Dokja to move to the next floor."

"Hrmm… aren't the two of you very close these days? A few days ago, I
saw…"

Yoo Joonghyuk's impression became grim and the cowardly Lee Jihye
closed her mouth.
Jung Heewon tapped Lee Jihye and rebuked her. "Stop teasing
Joonghyukssi. Don't disturb the two of them."

"…Oh, fine."

"In addition, you know the reason why he came here without asking. It is
the same for everyone."

At these words, the faces of the party members became solemn. They
looked down at Kim Dokja's coffin.

Jung Heewon opened her mouth again. "He isn't afraid of death because he
will live again."

Just because he had multiple lives didn't mean he should keep sacrificing
them for others. Shin Yoosung touched the surface of the coffin.

"If it wasn't for Dokja ahjussi, we would've died by now."

No one doubted it. Lee Hyunsung, Jung Heewon, Lee Gilyoung and Lee
Jihye as well. All of them had been saved by Kim Dokja.

Lee Jihye sighed. "I'm not saying this to be cheesy but… if I had two lives,
I would probably give one to ahjussi."

"I'm afraid he won't receive it because you only have 6 points in affection."

"This kid… in any case, aren't we all the same when it comes to the garter
belt?"

The group smiled as they watched Lee Jihye and Lee Gilyoung clashing. It
was an unbelievable sight when people were crying with frustration at the
bloody battlefield two days ago. Yoo Joonghyuk watched them from a
distance.
Kim Dokja appeared and his plans changed a lot. The easy scenarios
became difficult and the simple stories became complicated. Those who
were supposed to die survived.

Yoo Joonghyuk looked down at his hands. Perhaps among those who were
supposed to die, Yoo Joonghyuk himself would be included.

Yoo Joonghyuk thought it was very strange. This landscape could be made
be a person who wasn't a regressor. This regression might be better than
any other round of life that he had lived. It was terribly complicated in his
mind.

"By the way, isn't that fate over now? Dokja ahjussi died." Lee Jihye asked
and some companions replied.

"Ah. That's right. That reminds me…"

"Since he was destined to die because of a loved one, isn't the fate fulfilled?
He died because of his mother…"

"Yes. Why didn't I think of his mother?"

The voices were boisterous. Yoo Sangah watched Yoo Joonghyuk standing
in the distance with a complicated face. Yoo Joonghyuk also had a thought
as he faced the eyes.

'The fate isn't over'.

There was the variable called Cheok Jungyeong but the nebulae weren't that
simple.

The nebulae knew about Kim Dokja's resurrection. Thus, the fate could
never end this way. In addition, the nebulae were angry with Kim Dokja
and were likely to maliciously engage in realizing the fate.

Above all, the big hurdle that was the next scenario would soon arrive.
Thus, Yoo Joonghyuk needed to choose.

He silently stared up at the sky. It was like he was looking for something
there. After a while, his gaze was returned.

[The constellation '???' is looking at his incarnation.]

The constellation '???'. It was the third regression but Yoo Joonghyuk still
didn't know who his sponsor was. It was the source of the regression and
the one who made Yoo Joonghyuk suffer a terrible tragedy.

Yoo Joonghyuk took a breath and opened his mouth. 'Sponsor. I have to ask
you something'.
           Chapter 182: Ep. 35 - The 73rd Demon King, I


[You have died.]

The aftereffect was death. It was the shock from my stories being eaten by
the Devourer of Dreams. It was quickly restored with the ability of the
Fourth Wall but it was difficult for it to be as perfect before it was broken.

'The head…'

I was in a half-awake state for three days. My consciousness only appeared
and disappeared. Every time my consciousness returned, I reflected on what
had happened so far.

'After this scenario, the flow of the story will return'.
During the course of the first nine scenarios, I undermined the flow of the
original novel. It ranged from saving a few people to largely changing
scenarios.

Of course, changing the scenarios didn't mean that the original elements
would be useless. Yoo Joonghyuk had experienced over a hundred life
cycles. Even if the scenarios changed, there was still plenty of information I
could use.

Nevertheless, in order to take advantage of the large currents, there should
be parts that flowed according to the existing scenario.

Fortunately, the Seoul Dome Scenario was a closed scenario.

There was the national convention in the middle and there were a few
butterfly effects to worry about, but the flow of the Star Stream is still what
I remembered.

Moreover, some of the characters had grown beyond what I thought., I had
enough power to drive the flow in the future.

I observed the characters one by one using the third person perspective. The
first one I checked was Jung Heewon, the Judge of Destruction.

"It isn't easy to control yet. My sponsor said that once I can use this
perfectly, I could deal with that tentacle monster… I don't know when that
can happen." Jung Heewon muttered as she emitted white flames.

She had little weight in the original and was the most powerful character I
chose.

She had the Judge of Destruction attribute from Ways of Survival and
gained Uriel's Hell Flames Ignition. If this continued, it wasn't strange for
her to be one of the top 100 strongest people in Ways of Survival or even
the top 10.
Lee Hyunsung, who was sparring with Jung Heewon, opened his mouth. "It
is getting better little by little, Heewon-ssi."

"I think Hyunsung-ssi has also improved a lot. Now you can cover your
whole body with steel."

Jung Heewon spoke without knowing anything but she wasn't wrong.
Before the end of the Seoul Dome scenario, Lee Hyunsung started to inherit
Steel Transformation. However, Lee Hyunsung wasn't satisfied with his
accomplishment.

"I am working hard but… there is still a long way to go to help Dokja-ssi."

There were people who did better when they were told to keep up the good
work and that they were going a good job. This was the case with Lee
Hyunsung.

[The constellation who doesn't yet have a name has sponsored 100 coins to
Incarnation Lee Hyunsung.]

"D-Dokja-ssi?" The perplexed Lee Hyunsung stuttered with wide eyes.

Jung Heewon clicked her tongue. "Wow, he truly is watching. He has the
temperament of a stalker but… isn't 100 coins too stingy?"

I turned my gaze towards the two children practicing Taming. The children
kept commanding the mighty dragon. Shin Yoosung felt my gaze and
smiled towards the air.

[The constellation who doesn't yet have a name is smiling gently.]

In Ways of Survival, the relationship between constellation and incarnation
was often similar to a parent and child. I never had a child but I knew what
it felt like when seeing Shin Yoosung.
It was a bond that was more solid than blood. It was really tiny and fragile
yet so precious that I didn't know what to do…

Of course, not every father in the world was a good father and not all
constellations had the same mind. It was common for incarnations to be
stabbed in the back by their sponsors.

The second grade evolutionary species, the Chimera Dragon let out a deep
cry.

It still wasn't completely obeying but since it joined, the power of the party
had shot up. It was currently a second grade species but if it reached first
grade or transcendence, the dragon would become a monster that even
constellations were afraid of.

Lee Jihye looked at the chimera dragon and sighed enviously. "Damn, I
should've chosen a good sponsor. I thought that the Duke of Loyalty and
Warfare was good…"

In any case, the ones who didn't work hard were those who complained the
most.

A person who didn't know how excellent the Duke of Loyalty and Warfare
was… once I got back, I should teach her a lesson.

I looked around at all the characters and sighed lightly as I organized my
thoughts.

'This is good enough for the next scenario'.

Lee Jihye and Gong Pildu's growth was a bit disappointing but the situation
wasn't bad. There was even Yoo Sangah present. Once we escaped from
Seoul Dome, progressing through the subsequent scenarios would be quite
easy.
"Master! Do you have any strong skills that don't require a sponsor? Teach
me!"

"It is impossible for you now."

Yoo Joonghyuk had overcome the regression depression to a certain extent.
If they continued to follow Yoo Joonghyuk's route, I didn't have to worry
about the survival of the characters.

Rather, the problem was on my side.

[A huge fate is hoping for your death.]

I looked at the fate message that still hadn't disappeared. I had hoped the
fate might be fulfilled after experiencing death because of my mother.
Naturally, that didn't happen.

Maybe the person who would kill me wasn't the significant problem. The
important thing was that I couldn't avoid this fate with 'resurrection'. 'Damn
nebulae bastards…'

In the end, the reason this happened was because I changed the scenarios
too much. I also received excessive attention after becoming a
constellation. This way, the problem would constantly appear, even if I
postponed it through resurrection.

'There shouldn't be another situation like this'.

It was true just looking at the Devourer of Dreams. An outer god descended
and the party was nearly destroyed.

It didn't matter since I could resurrect, but the other party members couldn't.
None of the party members could die. In particular, everything would be in
vain if Yoo Joonghyuk died.

In the first place, all of this wouldn't have happened if it wasn't for me.
[The nebula 'Vedas' is waiting for your resurrection.]

[The nebula 'Papyrus' is waiting for your resurrection.]

[The nebula 'Olympus' is waiting for your resurrection.]

The nebulae were still waiting for a chance. I had attracted their
attention and was too weak to stand up against them. How could I
protect my party members and shake off the nebulae… 'Indeed, that is
the only way'.

Then a system message emerged.

[All the conditions for resurrection have been met!]

[The attribute 'Eight Lives' has been activated!]

Now it was time to go back.

[Your body will be resurrected.]




There was the sound of a breath being taken.

The hardest moment to adapt to was the first breath after the resurrection. I
woke up but darkness filled my surroundings. Maybe it was because my
party members put me in a coffin.

Damn, I didn't know why they put a person who would survive inside a
coffin. Were they acting sarcastic?

[The privilege of 'Eight Lives' has been activated.]

[The third head of the snake has been sacrificed.]
[The power of the head is 'fighting spirit'.]

Once again, I received a privilege effect. The benefits of Eight Lives were
less effective than other high-level privileges but it was better than nothing.

The legs that had been lost in the process of dying were restored to their
original state. Now the only thing left was to kick off the coffin lid.

"Ohh! The rumor is real!"

"He really resurrected!"

As soon as I pushed off the lid of the coffin, the people gathered in the area
cheered. Maybe rumours of my resurrection had spread because a variety of
incarnations were gathered and watching me.

[Your resurrection has increased your fame among the incarnations.]

[Your status is rising modestly.]

Finally, Jung Heewon used Hell Flames Ignition to greet me. She used the
skill in a way that would make the constellations of Eden enraged.
"Congratulations on your resurrection."

"…Please don't put me in a coffin next time."

"Just wait. I'll bring the others."

Jung Heewon left and the indirect messages of the constellations poured
into my ears.

[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' rejoices in your resurrection.]

[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' is congratulating you
on your return.]

[The constellation 'Goryeo's First Sword' is praising your courage.]
[The constellation 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' is grumbling and putting
his hands in his pockets.]

[Many constellations greatly admire your achievements.]

[90,000 coins have been sponsored.]

90,000 coins…

Perhaps it was because they weren't able to help me the day before
yesterday. It was a bit disappointing but I understood. Rather, it would be
more disappointing if they helped me confront the other nebulae.

[The evaluation of your achievement has been completed.]

[You have earned the 'semi-myth'-grade story.]

[The story 'One Who Killed an Outer God' has been acquired!]

.

.

.

[Due to the achievement of the story, some outer gods show hostility
towards you.]

[Due to the achievement of the story, some outer gods are curious about
you.]

[Due to the achievement of the story, some great old ones are watching
you.]

[Your modifier will soon be announced.]

A semi-myth-grade story…
It was a bit disappointing that I didn't receive a myth-grade story but it was
still satisfactory.

I would've received a myth rating if I fought a great old one. However, if I
actually encountered a great old one, I would've vanished before I could
even have a conversation.

[You have achieved a new story during the evaluation.

[The acquisition of a story beyond the existing stories means your status
will be re-evaluated.]

[The status will be published in the following scenarios.]

[Your fifth story is in progress.]

It would be good to start as a historical-grade but at this rate, I might be a
considerable level among the great-grades.

It would be announced in the following scenarios. The timing was okay.

The long-awaited tenth main scenario, the 73rd Demon King. This scenario
was the last scenario to be carried out in Seoul Dome and the participants
were extremely limited.

Only the first and second place in the Dark Castle rankings could challenge
the scenario. Of course, they wouldn't challenge it alone. They could team
up with four rankers.

[Your current Dark Castle ranking is 2nd place.]

I could take four people with me. However, it would be difficult to deal
with the enemy that would appear on the next floor with them alone.

In other words, I had to get the help of the first ranked person to complete
the Dark Castle scenario.
Then who was first place?

"Kim Dokja."

As soon as I thought this, a voice was heard behind me. I started smiling.

…Indeed, he was first.

"Yoo Joonghyuk, are you now ranked first?"

"Are you talking about the Dark Castle rankings?" Yoo Joonghyuk nodded
and instantly replied. "I am first. The situation is different from the Seoul
rankings."

This jerk, he was upset that he wasn't first previously. In any case, he was a
stingy guy.

I inwardly grumbled while opening my mouth. "I need your help. You
know how you can take people to the next scenario? If you and I take
them…" I could see my party members running in the distance.

In particular, Shin Yoosung and Lee Gilyoung were fighting each other to
be in the lead. I didn't know why they were doing this since there wasn't a
prize for being first.

I talked for a while but Yoo Joonghyuk didn't answer. I felt something
strange and saw Yoo Joonghyuk staring at me with serious eyes.

"Kim Dokja, what is your purpose?"

"Purpose? What is my purpose?"

"If your final goal to reach the end of all the scenarios?"

I hesitated for a moment before answering. "Well, I guess so."
"Can you promise not to give up on that goal, no matter what?"

…What was with this guy all of a sudden? I wanted to turn it into a joke but
I couldn't help feeling serious when watched Yoo Joonghyuk. "Of course I
won't give up. By the way, why are you asking?"

"It's nothing."

Yoo Joonghyuk looked away from me towards the party members. His left
eyebrow was twitching. I saw the eyebrow wriggling like a caterpillar and
sensed something in my heart.

"Hey, you…"

I knew because I had read to the end of Ways of Survival. Yoo Joonghyuk's
left eyebrow only twitched when he made a serious decision. Once this guy
made a serious decision, there was always a high probability of death and
regressing.

I wanted to use Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint on this bastard but the party
members had already arrived. Before I could speak, Yoo Joonghyuk took
the lead first.

"I will announce the participants for the tenth scenario."
          Chapter 183: Ep. 35 - The 73rd Demon King, II


The backlash to Yoo Joonghyuk's one-sided notification was enormous.

"Why are you deciding so arbitrarily?" Jung Heewon shouted first after
Yoo Joonghyuk gave his notification and disappeared. "We will depart in
three days! Until then, increase your rankings! If he says that and goes
away, should we just roll over and listen?"

"He should've said that when he was talking to me."

"…Does Dokja-ssi want that?"

"Nope."

Jung Heewon was still very spirited.

I said, "Even so, there is a higher probability of surviving if you do as Yoo
Joonghyuk says."
"Dokja-ssi, whose side are you on?"

"That…" I glanced at Yoo Joonghyuk in the distance, shrugged and smiled.
"First of all, it's nice to see all of you. This is the third resurrection."

The people who were frozen by Yoo Joonghyuk's words smiled awkwardly.
Lee Gilyoung and Shin Yoosung stuck to my legs while Lee Hyunsung
nodded with a slightly gloomy expression.

"Congratulations on your resurrection. It has already been a few times but
I'm getting used to it."

"It would be sad if you get used to it. First of all, let's get organized."

These were the words that Yoo Joonghyuk one-sidedly gave:

–There are two teams. My team and Kim Dokja's team. Four people will be
arranged for each team.

–My team will consist of Lee Hyunsung, Gong Pildu, Lee Jihye and Lee
Seolhwa. It is the four of them.

–Kim Dokja's team will be Jung Heewon, Shin Yoosung, Lee Gilyoung and
Yoo Sangah. It is another four.

In the end, the configuration was similar to the main party up to now. It
meant the companions I had participated in the scenarios so far would
challenge the tenth scenario. Perhaps he was being considerate of me or it
might be more comfortable for him. The latter was more likely when
thinking about Yoo Joonghyuk's personality.

Everyone involved didn't have any big complaints about the lineup itself
but
Lee Hyunsung was slightly sullen. "I want to be on Dokja-ssi's team…"

"The teams don't matter since we are all going together."
"…Yes."

I patted Lee Hyunsung's shoulder and turned towards the rest of the party
members. The first one to catch my eye was Yoo Sangah. So many things
happened that it felt strange to meet her eyes.

After a moment, Jung Heewon poked my side. "What is it? Do you want
her to wear a Chinese dress and garter belt?"

"…Are you still talking about that?"

"It was very shocking. We named it the 'Kim Dokja Garter Belt Incident'.
By the way, I won't wear that even if I die."

"I don't want you to wear it."

Then Lee Jihye raised her hand. "I'm willing to put on a good performance!
SSS-grade!"

"Stop playing around."

"I can wear that if it is had a good performance."

"Hyunsung-ssi, why…"

"Soldiers don't care about the equipment."

I wanted to say that he was using his military spirit in the wrong way when
I heard a message from Uriel.

[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' says that the constellation
who made the garter belt was a man.]

Was this a joke? Dammit. Furthermore, a constellation?

[The constellation 'Queen of the Darkest Spring' smiles and says that she
will invite him once.]
Come to think of it, this situation was due to Persephone. I would have to
argue with her if I ever went back to the Underworld.

"At this point… what is everyone's ranking? For reference, you all know
that you have to be within the top 10 to proceed?"

The party members replied in turn. The first was Jung Heewon. "I am 4th. I
got the ranking from the grandmother Lee Boksoon.

"Hyung, Shin Yoosung and I are 8th and 9th. Ah, I'm higher than Shin
Yoosung!"

"I am 5th. Gong Pildu-ssi has gone to raise his rankings. There is also Han
Sooyoung-ssi."

I forgot about Han Sooyoung. Yoo Sangah asked like she had read my
thoughts. "Han Sooyoung wasn't on the list. Are you going to leave her
behind?"

"Nope, I will take her. Han Sooyoung is quite helpful."

"…I see." Yoo Sangah smiled weakly once she heard about Han Sooyoung.

The other party members still didn't know she was the First Apostle. Yoo
Sangah didn't like lying so she was in a bad mood every time Han
Sooyoung was mentioned. I didn't know when there would be a chance to
tell the story.

Jung Heewon listened on the side and opened her mouth. "A total of 10
people can go up. How will you take Han Sooyoung-ssi?"

"In principle, only 10 people can go. However, there is a hidden piece.
Among the items available in Dark Castle, there is one called the 'Six-man
Card'. This way, non-team members can participate in the next scenario."
"…It is a hidden piece. Is there anything else you want to tell us? I think we
need to know what the next scenario is about. You and Yoo Joonghyuk are
always whispering together."

"Whispering together? That expression is a bit uncomfortable."

[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' has a runny nose.]

Jung Heewon smiled at me. "Then please tell me. Kim Dokja-ssi, show me
that you are different from Yoo Joonghyuk-ssi."

I looked around and saw the party members watching me like they were
grandchildren waiting for their grandmother's fairy tale.

If I was a streamer, I would tell a plausible story about a 'mighty person
who lived once upon a time'. However, I was Kim Dokja, not Kim Jakga¹.

"Have you ever heard of an existence called a demon king?"

Demon King. The party members glanced at each other at the unexpected
words.

"What… the king of demons? Is there such a thing?"

"I know! It comes out all the time in anime!"

I nodded at Lee Gilyoung's words. "It is roughly similar.

It was a bit different in the setting of Ways of Survival but the main point
was explained.

"The tenth scenario is one where we fight against the demon king."

Lee Hyunsung nodded. "Dokkaebis, returnees, tentacled monsters…
certainly, now it is time for a demon king to come out."
The listening Lee Jihye asked, "Isn't a demon king too strong? The demon
marquis was already high… how strong will a demon king be in
comparison?"

I thought for a moment before answering, "A constellation-grade."

There was a saying in Ways of Survival about the demon kings. They were
constellations who hadn't ascended. Literally, the demon kings were
constellations attached to the world.

Lee Jihye paled. "Then how will we kill it? Or are you and Master going to
kill it?"

"No, this time we will all kill it."

"…Can we do it?"

"We can if we all fight together. It was pure luck that Yoo Joonghyuk and I
defeated the outer god. Such a thing won't occur twice."

"Still…"

"Don't worry. It is true that a demon king is as strong as a constellation but
the one upstairs isn't that strong."

"Then?"

I hesitated for a second. I didn't want to tell them too much information at
once. The information wasn't just about the demon kings but also the
constellations of the Star Stream.

I thought about it before deciding to tell them through the group chat. [I
will tell you.]

Then a voice was heard from the air, as if he knew my worries.
[Everyone, it has been a long time. You don't know how frustrated I've
been when I wasn't able to tell to you… Haha, are you ready for the
scenario?] It was Bihyung.




In the original Star Stream, only 72 people were recognized as 'demon
kings'. They had modifiers like the constellation and governed different
kingdoms in the Demon Realm. It might not be equivalent to a nebula but
there were still those who lead 'forces'.

They laughed at the constellation who clung to the glory of a constellation
and remained on the land that even the dokkaebis abandoned.

Was that why? The constellations hated the demon kings as much as the
outer gods and this Dark Castle scenario was made considering the
tendencies of such constellations.

They watched the incarnations fight and kill the demon king. In short, it
was a scenario made to be refreshing to the constellations.

"Ah, please! I'm not going!"

After three days, I found Han Sooyoung hiding in the periphery of Dark
Castle. I wouldn't have found her if I hadn't purchased the Rope of Restraint
and Search for Life items from the Dokkaebi Bag.

Han Sooyoung shouted, "I won't fight! I'll just wait here and go out when
you clear the scenario!"

"You have to go."

"I don't want to fight the demon king!"
"The 73rd demon king is a pushover. Don't you already know that?"

As I mentioned earlier, only 72 people were recognized as a demon king in
the Star Stream. However, the title of this scenario was the 73rd Demon
King. In other words, the guy on the above floor wasn't a 'formal king'.

"He is still a demon king but he isn't as strong as the narrative-grade
constellations I've met so far. It is worth fighting."

"The difficulty might've changed. Hasn't it changed once or twice already?"

"The dokkaebis can't change the main scenario difficulty. That is the
jurisdiction of the Star Stream."

"Don't you think the dokkaebis are dangerous? Have you already forgotten
what happened three days ago?" It wasn't unusual for Han Sooyoung to
think like this. She was a person who knew the development of the original
novel.
"If we continue with the scenarios, the whole group will soon be wiped out.
You know that the nebulae are aiming at you."

"…I know. That's why I'm well prepared."

"Prepared? No, how are you prepared? Do you know what will happen in
the next scenario?"

We arrived at the camp and I pointed to the party members without
speaking. They were training in a formation. They assumed there was a
virtual enemy and practiced skills linkage in combination with changing the
formation.

"Gilyoung and Yoosung, go back! Yoo Sangah-ssi, go forward and take
care of it!"

"Understood!"
The calm and coordinate attacks couldn't be compared with the past. The
party members' damage overlapped and they attacked based on the enemy's
attack radius. Han Sooyoung opened her mouth as she closely watched the
scene.

"Is that… the demon king's pattern analysis?"

I nodded. "Yes."

"How much?"

"Almost everything."

It wasn't impossible.

I had Ways of Survival and the database piled up by Yoo Joonghyuk who
fought the 73rd demon king. Furthermore, Yoo Joonghyuk had fought the
73rd demon king in the second round. Practical experience and theoretical
knowledge combined forces, so it wasn't impossible to clear the next
scenario.

Han Sooyoung made a sad expression and sighed. "…You are a really crazy
person."


[1] Jakga – Korean for "writer"
         Chapter 184: Ep. 35 - The 73rd Demon King, III


"Don't you think the next scenario will still be tough?" Han Sooyoung
asked me.

"…"

The 73rd demon king was strong but there would be no problems if we
were thoroughly prepared. Maybe this was the easiest of all the scenarios I
had done so far.

Shortly afterwards, the people training gathered near me.

"Have you finished raising your rankings?"

It was Jung Heewon who answered my question. "We are all in the top 10.
In fact, Jihye and Pildu-ssi were close but they automatically upgraded this
morning."

"Automatically?"
There was only one reason for such an upgrade. It was when a top ranker
was killed.

Han Sooyoung already had an ominous expression. "A top 10 ranker
suddenly died? Something is strange… Hey, I'm really not going…"

"You came, Kim Dokja. Are you also going to take that woman?"

Han Sooyoung hid behind me at Yoo Joonghyuk's sudden appearance. She
was still scared of Yoo Joonghyuk. I nodded as Yoo Joonghyuk stared at
Han Sooyoung and pulled out the Six-man Card.

[The incarnation 'Yoo Joonghyuk' has used the Six-man Card.]

[The incarnation 'Han Sooyoung' has become a special participant of the
scenario.]

[The incarnation 'Han Sooyoung' has joined incarnation Yoo Joonghyuk's
team.]

Han Sooyoung was astonished by the rising messages. "W-What is this?
Hey! Why am I on his team?"

"Now, let's get ready to leave."

At my words, the party members moved into their teams.

The first to gather was Yoo Joonghyuk's team. They were Lee Hyunsung,
Lee Seolhwa, Lee Jihye and Gong Pildu. In addition, there was the
complaining Han Sooyoung.

The unusual mixture of old characters from the novel and new characters
gave me a wonderful feeling. It was a luxury that only a reader of Ways of
Survival could enjoy.
My team followed suit. Jung Heewon, Yoo Sangah, Shin Yoosung and Lee
Gilyoung. There was a free atmosphere compared to the military discipline
of Yoo Joonghyuk's team.

I looked at the members one by one.

"…Why are you looking at us like that?"

"Just… It is a new feeling…"

I smiled at Jung Heewon's scolding. I felt pained and sad at the people who
followed me well all the way here. I felt like my heart had grown since I
talked with the Fourth Wall.

It might be because I was more prepared for this scenario. I was now afraid
to lose them.

"Oh, shouldn't we be a group of six as well?"

The team members followed my gaze. There was a line of dolls a few steps
away.

"Don't stay over there and come here."

We had obtained two Six-man Cards. Han Sooyoung went to Yoo
Joonghyuk's team and my team also needed a sixth person. To be exact, it
was a sixth woman.

"…Sookyung-ssi also wanted to go with you."

"It is more helpful for you to go with me."

Jeon Woochi's incarnation, Cho Youngran looked at me with complicated
eyes. I asked my mother to include her as a member of the team. Jeon
Woochi's stigma was quite useful for emergency situations.

"Did you talk to Sookyung-ssi?"
I replied, "A little bit."

Due to the aftereffects of escaping from the Fourth Wall, my mother wasn't
in a position to participate in the next scenario.

Thanks to the Fourth Wall, I discovered different things about my mother.
It wasn't just about the past she was hiding. It was also what she
experienced after participating in the scenario.

Unlike me, who knew the whole story, my mother had a desperate struggle.
She paid an unreasonable price to constellations many times, was captured
on purpose to steal the memories of the reincarnator Nirvana and even
contracted with the nebulae to keep me safe.

Despite knowing all of this, I couldn't find anything to say to my mother.
Perhaps because it wasn't yet time.

Once the scenarios were finished safely, perhaps then we could share the
real story. My mother probably knew it as well because she didn't say much
this time. She just stared at me for a long time before saying:

–I believe in your choice.

I didn't know why but I felt strange when I heard this. Perhaps my mother
read something from me, just like I read her through the Fourth Wall.

"Depart."

We started to move. The target was the altar located in the center of the
Abyss Plains. Just like the first floor of Dark Castle, we could move to the
next floor using the altar.

We started the boring walk and Jung Heewon opened her mouth. "It bothers
me that the nebulae are so quiet."
In fact, I hadn't heard the nebulae's messages since two days ago. I didn't
know if they were hiding something or perhaps they had consumed too
much probability. I glanced at Yoo Sangah and asked, "Have you been in
contact with Olympus?"

"…Not since three days ago."

As I heard last time, the constellations of Olympus were currently split. The
outsiders of Olympus, like Dionysus and Persephone, were the ones who
approached Yoo Sangah. Perhaps three days ago, there was a struggle
inside Olympus.

My expression was uneasy and Yoo Sangah spoke in a concerned voice.
"Dokja-ssi, are you okay?"

"I'm fine. What about Yoo Sangah-ssi?"

"…I am trying to be okay."

I glanced at Yoo Sangah. She was such a good person that I would feel
sorry if I kept watching her. She learnt about my fate first and I heard that
she ran around in order to save me.

It wasn't strange for Yoo Sangah. She was the first person to come forward
if something was wrong. In the first scenario, she stood up first to save the
grandmother. Yoo Sangah would act exactly the same if someone else was
in my position.

"Can we win? We've managed so far but this time…"

"Don't worry." I tried to reassure Yoo Sangah. "I won't die. You know."

Yoo Sangah was the first to see my fate and she must know that it hadn't
disappeared.
I was wondering what else I could say to reassure her when I heard Yoo
Joonghyuk's voice. "We're here."

There was a gigantic building reminiscent of the ancient Parthenon. The
party members noticeably stiffened and I called people one by one.

"Gilyoung. Yoosung. Do it as we practiced earlier. Don't call the chimera
dragon until I give the signal. Do you understand?"

The role of these children was the most important thing before the attack on
the demon king. The chimera dragon tamed by the children would play a
key role in this attack.

"Yoo Sangah-ssi, please protect Jung Heewon-ssi from being hurt. This
time, the main damage dealer will be Jung Heewon. Are you familiar with
how to fight?"

"I remember."

Yoo Joonghyuk looked this way when he finished preparing and I pulled
the team members over to him. A waist-height alter soon appeared. Yoo
Joonghyuk and I placed our hands on the palm marks on the altar at the
same time.

[The scenario challengers have been confirmed.]

[Scenario Challenger: 1st in Dark Castle, Yoo Joonghyuk.]

[Scenario Challenger: 2nd in Dark Castle, Kim Dokja.]

[Total Number of People Admitted: 12 people]

[Are you sure you want to enter the scenario?]

We all nodded at the same time. There were dazzling rays of light and our
bodies were transferred to the next floor. The place we were transferred to
was a cramped passage.
[You have entered the new main scenario area.]

[Main Scenario #10 ― '73rd Demon King' has started!]

As expected, it was the same development as the original novel. Once we
followed this passage, we would reach the hall where the 73rd demon king
was waiting.

"Prepare the formations."

We moved carefully along the passage. The difficulty depended on how
much damage was inflicted with the first surprise attack. If we could get as
close as possible and deal a large amount of damage, we might be able to
finish it without using all the formations we practiced.

However, as I moved along the passage, a worrisome feeling filled my
mind.

…Why was it so quiet? Shouldn't I feel the demon king's aura at this point?

Then a system message emerged.

[An error has occurred in the scenario.]

"Hyung, this is…?"

The surprised Lee Gilyoung reflexively opened his mouth and I placed my
finger against his lips. The party members lowered their voices.

"Dokja-ssi, this is different from the story…"

"T-There are dead people here…!"

The one who spoke was Lee Hyunsung, who had been searching in the
front. We moved as stealthily as possible and gathered near Lee Hyunsung.
Surprisingly, there were bodies that looked like they just died. Yoo
Joonghyuk touched them and powerful sparks popped out. "It is evidence of
a probability storm."

I didn't know what they had done but if the sparks were still here after their
deaths, their sponsors must've done something huge. The incarnations had
used a lot of force and the sponsors behind them must've suffered a huge
blow.

Who the hell had done this?

Then Yoo Joonghyuk opened his mouth. "The incarnations of Vedas and
Papyrus."

"What?"

"I've met them wandering around Dark Castle. They were in contact with
me."

"…How did those guys come here? A terminal of the nebulae would have
sufficient rankings but they wouldn't have the right to participate in the
scenario."

"It looks like there was another Six-man Card."

One question was resolved. The sudden rise in Lee Jihye and Gong Pildu's
ranking was because of the rankers killed here.

I had an ominous hunch. Were the nebulae quiet because they used up all
their probability here? It meant…?

We reflexively looked at each other and Yoo Joonghyuk started running
towards the hall, forgetting the formation. If I was right, now wasn't the
time to worry about the formations.

The moment we arrived in the hall, we witnessed a shocking sight.
[Constellations, what the hell are you doing?]

Dozens of dokkaebis floated in the air in the center of the hall.

[It is difficult if you do such arbitrary things. Aren't you looking down on
the Star Stream? Using Deus X Machina in this place?]

The words weren't directed towards us but we were obviously meant to
here. Bihyung looked awkward as he met my gaze.

This jerk, what the hell…

[I know you are worried about the incarnations but the scenario won't be
over just because you interfere. Some of you have received a blow that
nearly destroyed you. Why the hell did you do this? Just look at the
probability. All the lower constellations have collapsed…]

There was a strange smile on the face of the representative dokkaebi. He
smiled like he knew this would happen from the beginning.

Wait a minute. What did that bastard just say?

"Kim Dokja."

I looked in the direction that Yoo Joonghyuk was pointing. The center of
the hall. There was a broken throne that should've originally contained the
73rd demon king. In addition, the fearsome demon king that we should've
met…

[The 73rd demon king is dead.]

He was lying dead on the ground, his chest torn apart.

"W-What is this? He's dead?"

After Han Sooyoung's words, the other members belatedly opened their
mouths.
"The demon king is already dead?"

"Then what will happen to the scenario?"

"…Maybe it has already ended?"

My head was too complicated that I couldn't hear the voices of the people.
The unqualified incarnations challenged the scenario, received the
probability storm and killed the demon king with the support of the
nebulae.

At first, the scenario seemed to be resolved. However, the main scenarios of
the Star Stream weren't so simple.

[The Star Stream has corrected the balance of this scenario.]

The scenarios where transcendent existences excessively intervened were
forcibly corrected by the Star Stream.

There was a strong sense of deja vu in my head.

It wasn't the 73rd Demon King scenario but a similar thing happened in
Ways of Survival. The scenario was ruined by the rioting of constellations
and the Star Stream restored the main scenario.

Then what would happen?

[The Star Stream has corrected the broken probability.]

I looked at the dead demon king.

The Star Stream liked the natural flow of stories and it couldn't revive dead
existences. A time reversal or resurrection would undermine the probability
of the scenario even more.

[The main scenario contents have been updated!]
The 73rd demon king was dead. However, a 73rd demon king was still
needed. It was because we had to hunt him in order to proceed with the
scenario.

The Star Stream was originally set to fix these contradictions. There was a
shining precious jade in the spot where the demon king had died.

I reflexively muttered, "Hey, this…"

By the way, I couldn't feel any signs around me. There was an eerie feeling
creeping down my spine.

Time seemed to flow very slowly. I looked around and Yoo Joonghyuk
wasn't there.

"Yoo Joonghyuk!"

By the time I moved, Yoo Joonghyuk had already reached the jade. His
expression as he looked at me was something I had never seen before. Yoo
Joonghyuk was looking at me with eyes that had never been present in
Ways of Survival.

"Kim Dokja. Be sure to keep your promise."

Then the system messages rose.

[The candidate for the '73rd Demon King has been found.]

[The new '73rd Demon King' is elected.]
         Chapter 185: Ep. 35 - The 73rd Demon King, IV


"Hey! What nonsense are you saying?" I shouted while hurriedly running
towards Yoo Joonghyuk.

Aura started to emerge from Yoo Joonghyuk's body as he held the piece of
jade.

[The selected person is evolving into a demon king!]

The person who was selected by the jade would become the 73rd demon
king.

–Can you promise not to give up on that goal, no matter what?

A few days ago, Yoo Joonghyuk had asked me a meaningful question about
my goal. Was my goal to reach the end of the scenarios…

Don't tell me…? No, it was impossible. I almost had a fit as I screamed,
"Yoo Joonghyuk you son of a bitch!"
Then the sound of steel wire moving through the air was heard. Dozens of
wires poured down towards Yoo Joonghyuk, one of them snatching the jade
that was in Yoo Joonghyuk's hand.

[The succession of the demon king is cancelled.]

A bewildered expression appeared on Yoo Joonghyuk's face.

"Dokja-ssi!"

I looked back and saw dozens of threads stretching out from Yoo Sangah's
hand. As everyone was frozen, only she kept her mind. She tied up the
demon king's jade with Binding Thread and it flew to this side. Yoo
Joonghyuk let out a huge burst of killing intent.

"Don't interrupt!"

As soon as an intense wave of magic power was about to cover Yoo
Sangah, I triggered Bookmark and Way of the Wind and blocked the magic
power. It wasn't easy to block, even with Way of the Wind at the maximum
level.

This was the power of Yoo Joonghyuk, who had become a transcendent. I
shouted through clenched teeth.

"Yoo Sangah-ssi! Hold it well! Never use it!"

"Yes!"

My party members were wondering what the hell was going on.

Han Sooyoung created dozens of clones and shouted, "I knew this would
happen! Kim Dokja, I told you! Yoo Joonghyuk is someone who only
thinks about himself to the end!"

Han Sooyoung kept shouting while I was unable to grasp the situation
properly.
"Kim Dokja! We must stop him! This jerk is obviously going to become the
demon king, kill all of us and clear the scenario alone…!"

Han Sooyoung's clone blocked Yoo Joonghyuk and exploded instantly. Han
Sooyoung's main body was trapped against the wall of the hallway.

The other party members rushed in front of me.

"Master! What's wrong with you? Kyaaack!"

"Yoo Joonghyuk-ssi!"

Lee Jihye and Jung Heewon as well. They couldn't cope with Yoo
Joonghyuk's blow and fell.

Now Yoo Joonghyuk was serious. He was committed to defeating all those
who interfered with his purpose.

I stepped past the party members while telling them, "You can't deal with
him!"

Yoo Joonghyuk's eyes glared at me. "Get out of the way Kim Dokja. I will
be the demon king."

"What nonsense is this? Why all of a sudden?"

"Shouldn't you know as well? There is only one way to clear this

scenario." I glanced at the scenario window floating in the air.
 [Main Scenario #10 - 73rd Demon King]

  Category: Main

  Difficulty level: SS+

  Clear Conditions: You can choose one of two ways. Take possession of
  the throne and become the 73rd demon king, or kill the newly born 73rd
  demon king. The scenario can only be cleared by choosing one of these
  two methods and there is no other way to proceed.

  Time Limit: 30 minutes

  Compensation: 200,000 coins,???

  Failure: Death and expulsion from the scenario.



This scenario was similar to the 'sacrifice' scenario. One person had to die
for everyone or one person would live while everyone else died.

I bit my lips and asked, "Are you going to sacrifice yourself?"

"Hunt me and go to the next scenario."

"Why are you doing something like this all of a sudden?"

"This is the right thing to do."

There was no doubt that he thought this was the right answer. Yoo
Joonghyuk spoke with his unique nuances. "I am used to the pain.
Similarly, I am familiar with death. Don't you already know this?"
He was certain that I knew all about him. However, Yoo Joonghyuk was
wrong. I didn't know Yoo Joonghyuk. The Yoo Joonghyuk I knew would
never do this.

It seemed like there was room to talk so I decided to calm down this damn
sunfish.

"I know what you are saying but you don't have to sacrifice yourself. You
are a regressor but you don't have multiple lives. I have resurrection on my
side. That's why you're not the one suitable to become the demon king."

"Resurrection. It is a good ability. However, do you think it will work in
this scenario? If you have seen the scenario failure, can you be certain that
resurrection will save you?"

I had forgotten for a moment. Certainly, Yoo Joonghyuk was right. This
scenario didn't just end with 'death'. This jerk… had he calculated it and
moved?

"Get out of the way Kim Dokja."

My Unbroken Faith cried out while his Splitting the Sky Sword pointed at
me. In this stubborn confrontational state, I desperately thought about it.
How could I persuade this person?

No matter how much I squeezed my head, I couldn't come up with a
method. If this continued, this jerk would become the demon king and take
the damn regression route.

[The exclusive skill, 'Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint' stage 2 has been
activated!]

I started to soak up his thoughts like a sponge.

「 The cost of failing this scenario is expulsion from the scenario. 」
「 There is no one who can survive being expelled from the scenario. Then
Kim Dokja's resurrection ability is meaningless. 」

「 Perhaps this is the death that his fate is pointing to. 」

「 If Kim Dokja becomes the demon king, he will die here. 」

My heart was heavy as I received the waterfall of thoughts.

「 Thus, it is me who should sacrifice themselves here. 」

This guy was really going to sacrifice himself. The arrogant and aloof Yoo
Joonghyuk. It was for the sake of others, not himself.

Suddenly, unknown emotions rose inside me. "Then you? What about you?
If you die here, what about your damn goal?!"

"You will do it for me."

"What?"

Yoo Joonghyuk watched our companions behind me. "The one who can
save the world… it might be you, not me."

Lee Hyunsung, Lee Jihye, Shin Yoosung, Lee Seolhwa…

There was deep regret in Yoo Joonghyuk's eyes as he gazed at every single
person. I seemed to know what he was thinking.

「 There have never been so many people who made it to here. And maybe
it won't happen again in the future. 」

This was the Yoo Joonghyuk who had experienced several lives and
received advance information from the 41st regression.
There were no cases like this regression. This fact caused Yoo Joonghyuk
to shake.

My mind worked quickly. How could I persuade him…

"Get out of the way. There isn't much time left."

He used Giant Body Transformation and started to swell up dramatically.
He had either grown stronger in three days or the party members were
frozen by the energy he was emitting. Yoo Sangah was terrified and Yoo
Joonghyuk approached her step by step.

I eventually activated the Blade of Faith. "Stop! Stop it you son of a bitch!"

The white ether sword collided with Yoo Joonghyuk's Splitting the Sky. Of
course, it was my side that suffered one-sided damage. I had to use at least
Electrification to deal with this guy.

…I couldn't let him take the path of regression. The moment I was about to
activate Bookmark, Yoo Joonghyuk asked me,

"Are you concerned about what will happen to this world after I go back?"

"What?"

"You must be afraid. The moment I disappear, this world will disappear.
Isn't that right?"

I was so surprised that I was lost for words. How the hell did he know this?
I started to wonder if he was the one with Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint
instead of me.

Then I forgot even this thought.

"There's nothing to worry about. I already asked my sponsor."

…What?
"This world won't disappear if I regress. This world won't end or be upset if
I die."

Yoo Joonghyuk easily suppressed Yoo Sangah and reached for the precious
jade. As if it wanted him, demonic energy stretched out from the jade and
tangled around Yoo Joonghyuk's fingers.

"Continue to live, Kim Dokja." Yoo Joonghyuk looked at me with the face
of a stranger. "Now you have to save this world."




Thunder struck the sky on the second floor of Dark Castle. It was a sinister
thunder, as if suggesting the collapse of Dark Castle.

Lee Sookyung gazed at the sky as she moved with the wanderers. Her son
was probably beyond this sky.

"Hulhul, you look very worried these days."

It was Lee Boksoon who spoke. She handed her Dark Castle rankign to
Jung Heewon and chose to stay here. Lee Sookyung glanced at Lee
Boksoon for a while before replying, "I guess I'm not familiar with being a
mother."

"Do people get used to it? You will never get used to it in your life. Me
too…"

"You aren't going to bring up the story of raising six siblings again are
you?"

"Hulhul, you knew?"
Lee Boksoon chuckled. There were no wanderers who didn't know the story
of the six siblings raised by Lee Boksoon.

Lee Boksoon patted Lee Sookyung's shoulder and spoke in a friendly voice.
"He will surely come back alive. Don't worry too much."

"I wish but… fate says differently."

"You don't think that fate can be overcome? To me…"

In the end, Lee Boksoon retold the story of how she raised her six siblings
through all types of hardships. Lee Sookyug smiled bitterly. No one
would've suffered if fate was so easily overcome.

「If he doesn't go to the next scenario, Incarnation Kim Dokja can live. 」

Lee Sookyung sacrificed 20 years of her life and read this sentence from
'fate'.

Kim Dokja could live if he didn't go to the next scenario. In other words,
Kim Dokja would surely die when he went to the next scenario.

'…Dokja'.

However, Lee Sookyung didn't give up even when all indicators pointed to
the death of her son. She couldn't let go.

There was the sound of falling sound and Lee Sookyung looked down at
her fingertips. Her body was still crumbling because her recovery was slow
and incomplete. It was all due to the aftereffects of entering the Fourth
Wall.

Lee Sookyung remembered the moment she was eaten by the Fourth Wall.
It was a terrible experience, as if her being itself was breaking down into
morpheme units.
Perhaps she died at that time. Like a broken story, she was sucked into the
wall and experienced something no human ever had before.

She was shocked that there was such a 'wall' inside her son. She also
shuddered at the fact that someone was living inside the wall.

'…What the hell is it?'

There, Lee Sookyung confronted the presence inside the wall. Her
existence was crushed and recreated so there weren't many accurate
memories left.

The exact structure of the interior of the wall… she didn't remember. Still,
there was one thing she remembered. It was the answer to a question.

「 What is the way for my son to survive? How can he get rid of that damn
fate? 」

Lee Sookyung asked this even when her existence was fading away. The
being inside the wall laughed like it was having fun.

「 There is only one way to escape from fate. 」

There was a strange smile, as if this whole situation was a joke.

「 Kim Dokja already knows how to do it. 」
          Chapter 186: Ep. 35 - The 73rd Demon King, V


–Stop! Stop it you son of a bitch!

At this time, the main scenario was flowing through the holographic panel
at the Seoul branch of the bureau. Some dokkaebis sighed as they watched
the storm of magic power on the screen.

The dokkaebis instinctively knew it. The scene that would unfold from now
on would be the best story since the Seoul Dome scenario began.

Bihyung watched the scene and was one of them.

–Yoo Joonghyuk! This damn ■■■ bastard…! Please!

–Everyone stop him! Block Yoo Joonghyuk!

Some dokkaebis expressed dissatisfaction with the filtering. However,
Bihyung was different. Despite the mix of filtering, Bihyung was now able
to understand their words to a certain extent.
Some words could be read, even if they weren't completely written. The
same was probably true for the constellations who had been watching the
channel all along.

Otherwise, the following messages wouldn't come out.

[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' is despairing at the tragic
situation.]

[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' is tearing out his hair
in lumps.]

[The constellation 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' is looking disturbed.]

[The constellation 'Secretive Plotter' is silently watching the situation.]

.

.

[Some constellations resent the atrocities of the nebula!]

[Many constellations are completely immersed in the unpredictable
developments.]

Bihyung couldn't take his eyes off the screen.

Yoo Joonghyuk who wanted to become the demon king and Kim Dokja
who wanted to stop him…

Bihyung saw this and was reminded of the days when he was a novice
dokkaebi.

It was a time when he was doing all sorts of events in the Star Stream. All
the stories were lovely and he couldn't bear the curiosity of the next story.
The feelings of those days when he was immersed in the incarnations of his
channel were pure and unforgettable…

Bihyung struggled to ignore the emotions wriggling inside him.

'That is just a story'.

No matter how tragic or sad, a story was just a story. The story of Kim
Dokja and Yoo Joonghyuk was just one of the countless stories repeated in
the Star Stream.

Most of the stories had already been seen and he had long forgotten the
excitement. All he knew was how to give an exaggerated and stimulating
directing.

Then why? Bihyung desperately held the egg in his arms.

'Shit! Kim Dokja! Do something. As always, fool everyone with an
unexpected development!'

Kim Dokja would find a new method, just like he always did. The dokkaebi
had such expectations.

"It is really tragic. Isn't that right?" The head of the Seoul branch, Baram
stood beside him.

Bihyung looked at him and answered, "…It is a very tragic situation for a
half constellation."

The nebulae would suffer greatly from this intervention. Using Deus X
Machina on this scale wouldn't stop at simply sacrificing lower
constellations.

Each constellation shared the probability through the nebula and this
incident caused tremendous loss to the probability. If a war between
nebulae was to take place in this situation, the loss caused by Kim Dokja
would be a decisive blow.

Baram replied after a moment, "I think it is worth it if Kim Dokja dies. As I
said, they are very sensitive to issues related to the 'end of everything'. They
think that the likelihood of Kim Dokja is very high."

"…Then the situation is unfortunate."

"Hrmm? Why?"

"Kim Dokja won't die." Bihyung continued without understanding why he
was making such a boast. "As long as he becomes the demon king, Yoo
Joonghyuk won't kill Kim Dokja."

Bihyung looked back at the screen.

Perhaps the plan was the nebulae was to kill Kim Dokja by making Yoo
Joonghyuk the demon king. However, it was the arrogance of the nebulae
who didn't fully understand Yoo Joonghyuk's personality.

–Don't interrupt!

Bihyung watched Yoo Joonghyuk through the screen and swallowed down
the boiling sensation.

In the end, Yoo Joonghyuk would die here but Kim Dokja would live.
Thus, Kim Dokja would once again escape the constellation's fate.

If he survived and survived, someday…

Baram laughed, "You don't know 'fate' yet."

"…Huh?"
"Do you think the nebulae wouldn't have known this? Do you believe that
they wouldn't have analyzed Kim Dokja's personality, even if they can't
read his future? Then you are underestimating the weight of destiny."

"What…"

Bihyung was interrupted by the bright flash that came from the screen.

[The Star Stream is announcing the status of the constellation who doesn't
yet have a name.]

The magnificent light covered the entire holographic panel and even
advanced dokkaebis like Baram were impressed.

"Look. Fate is about to be realized."




"Dokja-ssi! What are you doing? Wake up!"

I watched Yoo Joonghyuk being tinged with demonic energy and was in a
dazed state.

–Are you concerned about what will happen to this world after I go back?

–You must be afraid. The moment I disappear, this world will disappear.
Isn't that right?

It was like thousands of insects had entered my eyes as my senses were
disturbed.

"Kyaaaaak!" The party members screamed.

There was an explosion in the surrounding area.
–This world won't disappear if I regress. This world won't end or be upset if
I die.

The words spoken by Yoo Joonghyuk encroached on my head.

'This world won't disappear, even if Yoo Joonghyuk goes back'.

I didn't understand it. Yoo Joonghyuk's sponsor. The existence that never
responded to anything in Ways of Survival… actually replied to Yoo
Joonghyuk?

Why? Under these circumstances?

"Dokja-ssi!"

I didn't know.

[The exclusive skill 'Bookmark' is activated!]

[The 5th bookmark, Kyrgios Rodgraim is selected!]

[The exclusive skill 'Miniaturization Lv. 3' is activated!]

[The exclusive skill 'Electrification' Lv. 11 (+1) has been activated.]

My body size was reduced in an instant and the blue-white trail moved
towards Yoo Joonghyuk.

"Kim Dokja!" Yoo Joonghyuk growled out.

The blue-white energy hit Yoo Joonghyuk's blade and a terrible collision
sound was heard.

The combination of Electrification and Purest Sword Force met the power
of Giant Body Transformation and Splitting the Sky.

I had a thought as I watched the ether storm explode.
If Yoo Joonghyuk was right, I would no longer have to worry about him
regressing. Even if he returned, I could guarantee that this world remained
and keep living in it.

"Kim Dokja, think about it. The opportunities won't often come."

The muscles of my body creaked from the excessive force collision. Yoo
Joonghyuk also poured out all of his power.

I felt the texture of the blade in my hand and realized. My pain was
alleviated by Fourth Wall while Yoo Joonghyuk would be taking all of it
without a wall.

"No, it's difficult."

Was it okay just because he could regress? Would he sacrifice himself to
end this scenario?

I told him, "There is no such development in the ending that I want."

"Are you still failing to understand? I must be the demon king…!"

"I will be the demon king."

"Don't talk bullshit! If you do that, you will surely die. After being banished
from the scenario, resurrection is useless!"

Perhaps Yoo Joonghyuk didn't understand my words. There was a huge
wall between us that couldn't be filled.

However, it was due to this wall that I could see this guy again and again.
Yoo Joonghyuk's remorse, his despair and his dreams. An indomitable will
that didn't give up.

I grew up reading all of this.

"Think about it. Who would watch a story without the protagonist?"
There were numerous memories in my head. I overcame all the tragedies in
my life with a single story. It was the story of a person who never gave up,
no matter what. That story made me. I could survive to reach here.

"I will pay off the debt."

"…Debt? What do you mean?"

"You saved me once. Now I'm going to save you."

"What nonsense is this…?"

I listened to Yoo Joonghyuk's voice while using all the techniques I had
saved. It was a technique that would exhaust my physical endurance, even
if it was just for a moment. It was the first time I tried it directly but it was
probably theoretically possible.

"Turn off Miniaturization."

At the same time, my body that was covered in the brilliance of
Electrification started to return to its original size.

[Your current body configuration is different from that of the character.]

[At present, you can't use Electrification with your body composition.]

[The powerful skill penalty will encroach on your body!]

Electrification was a technique that could only be used by a 'small person'.
However, if I released Miniaturization while using Electrification, I could
still use the power of Electrification with my original body. My body
wandered through a deadly situation but once Miniaturization was turned
off, the power of Electrification was amplified.

"Kim Dokja…!"
Yoo Joonghyuk's eyes widened with astonishment as the power of
Electrification filled the area. The dazzling blue-white ether swept the hall
and Yoo Joonghyuk was thrown back into the wall as he coughed up a large
amount of blood.

A few steps away, I saw Lee Gilyoung picking up the jade that Yoo
Joonghyuk had dropped. "Gilyoung. Give that to me."

Lee Gilyoung hesitantly withdrew from me. "I don't want to. I heard it all.
If hyung gets this…"

As Lee Gilyoung hesitated, Han Sooyoung shouted at him. "Stupid! Get
away from Kim Dokja!"

It was too late. I instantly narrowed the distance and snatched the jade from
Lee Gilyoung's hand.

"I'm sorry Gilyoung."

At the same time, a surge from Electrification emerged and the people
around me were thrown back.

[The exclusive skill, 'Bookmark' has been forcibly terminated.]

My body was overloaded and blood gushed from me. I grasped the jade
tightly as my consciousness blurred. Then demonic energy flowed from the
jade and wrapped around my whole body.

[Constellations of the Vedas nebula are smiling with satisfaction.]

Yes, this was what they wanted.

[You have met the qualifications to become the 73rd demon king.]

[The precious jade is amazed by your potential.]

[A new main scenario has been acquired!]
"Dokja-ssi!"

The system messages blocked the voices of my party members, which was
vaguely heard.

[If you choose the way of the demon king, you must destroy all existences
on the third level of Dark Castle.]

[If you fail the scenario, you will be banished forever from this scenario.]

Banishment from the scenario. It didn't have the same meaning as 'death'. It
was to be kicked forever from the flow controlled by the Star Stream.

I would die in that empty void that couldn't be reached by the eyes of the
dokkaebis and constellations.

There was no one in the Star Stream who could endure that void. No
constellations could exist without the scenario.

Now I knew for sure. This was what those damn nebulae were hoping for. I
knew very well what that damn fate was pointing to.

"I am the demon king."

[The precious jade has chosen a new candidate to become the 73rd demon
king.]

[The new '73rd Demon King' is elected.]

A mighty demonic energy filled my whole body.

[You have got a new story!]

[You have inherited the power of the 'demon king.]

My damaged body received the enormous demonic energy and recovered
its strength in an instant. No, it was more than recovering. It was a huge
energy I had never felt before. I was reborn as something completely
different.

[The Star Stream will announce your status.]

[Your status is narrative-grade.]

.

.

[Your 'stigma' has opened!]

[A strong demonic energy is polluting your constellation.]

[You have become a corrupted constellation!]

A corrupted constellation. It was the Star Stream's name for the demon
kings.

[Many constellations are greatly shocked by your choice.]

[Constellations of the absolute good system are showing fierce hostility
towards you.]

The dark demonic energy slowly lifted and I could see the party members
looking at me with devastated expressions. The people who knelt down
were trembling like they couldn't believe it.

Yoo Joonghyuk's desperate face could also be seen in the distance.

[The Main Scenario #10 ― '73rd Demon King' has started!]

I looked at them and opened my mouth in a grand manner. "Everybody
wake up."

Everything in the last three days had been for this moment.
"Remember how to deal with a demon king."

The nebulae probably thought it was going as they planned. Finally, as fate
decreed, Kim Dokja would die here.

However, they would never know. Just as they placed the scenario of fate
here… I had been preparing for three days to escape from this damn fate.

Faint sunlight was leaking in from the gap in the broken ceiling. I laughed
as I gazed at the sunlight that seemed dazzling.

"Now let's start the last scenario."

Today was the day that 'Incarnation Kim Dokja' would die.
         Chapter 187: Ep. 35 - The 73rd Demon King, VI


The party members were still watching me with confused expressions. The
expressions showed they didn't know what the hell was going on. Yoo
Joonghyuk was still coughing up blood against the wall.

I looked at them for a moment before glancing at the wall of the hall. My
appearance was reflected on the polished stone wall.

Black wings sprouted from my shoulders and small horns rose from my
head. Traces of demonic energy were imprinted on my skin like a stigma.
My body was three or four times larger than usual and the muscles of my
whole body were greatly expanded.

"T-This is ridiculous!" Why is Dokja-ssi the demon king…?"

"What the hell is this? What should we do?"

Yoo Sangah and Lee Jihye shouted.
Jung Heewon, Lee Hyunsung, Lee Gilyoung, Shin Yoosung… even Cho
Youngran and Gong Pildu. Everyone was looking at me with shocked
expressions.

I watched them and opened my mouth. "From now on, you will have to
hunt me."

[The first phase of the '73rd demon king' will begin.]

[The attack time limit is 30 minutes.]

"There is no time. Quickly start."

A formidable energy was flowing through my body. Even if I was passively
hit, I couldn't help wondering if the party members would be able to
decrease my health in the given time.

Jung Heewon and Lee Hyunsung looked at me desperately and cried out. "I
don't want to fight Dokja-ssi!"

"I can't follow your command!"

I could understand their feelings. I would also hesitate if I was in the same
situation as them. I deliberately laughed at them.

"I don't know why you're so serious. Have you forgotten who I am? I am
Kim Dokja. I won't die even when killed."

The innocent Lee Hyunsung was shaken by my words. "…Will you come
back to life against this time?"

"Yes."

"But I heard…!"

"Yoo Joonghyuk was deliberately trying to provoke me."
I didn't use the Incite skill but conflicted emotions were appearing on the
people's faces. Maybe their trust in me and the burden of attacking me were
clashing inside them.

"Believe me. This is the most ideal way."

The party members would eventually have to attack me. It was because
there was no other way. If they didn't kill me, everyone here would die.

Han Sooyoung was staring at me with scary eyes. I sent a signal to her
before she could open her mouth.

'Han Sooyoung'.

Han Sooyoung paled as she read my lips.

'You are the only one. You have to take charge'.

I knew it and Han Sooyoung did as well. The party members were stronger
than other incarnations but they weren't decisive in this situation. On the
other hand, Han Sooyoung was faster and more realistic when judging the
situation than anyone else here.

"…You are always like this, Kim Dokja." Han Sooyoung told me through
gritted teeth. "Do you think I'm an emotionless monster?"

Han Sooyoung glanced between me and then the party members.
Everyone's eyes were focused on her. It was as if everything would be
decided by her words.

Han Sooyoung breathed heavily before opening her mouth.
"Everybody, wake up. Do you want everyone here to go to hell?" I
smiled. Yes, she was doing well.
"We have to kill Kim Dokja."

This was Han Sooyoung.

"I don't want to! I don't want to! Hyung!"

Han Sooyoung grabbed Lee Gilyoung as he ran towards me.

"Stupid kid. Listen well."

Lee Gilyoung gasped and struggled. Han Sooyoung snarled as she grabbed
Lee Gilyoung's collar.

"Don't whine. Do you want to die instead of Kim Dokja?"

"A-Ahhh…"

"The rest of you are the same. You aren't willing to sacrifice yourself so
don't be a hypocrite. Instead of dying, say thank you and swing your
weapons!"

Han Sooyoung's clones, which had grown by dozens, simultaneously
opened their mouths.

"I don't know if Kim Dokja will come back or not. We will die if we don't
kill him in the next 30 minutes. That is the only thing I need to know."

Han Sooyoung's clones rushed towards me with red eyes. I mouthed
towards her, 'Thank you'.

Han Sooyoung bit her lips until it bled and swung her dagger towards me.
The rain of attacks didn't deal much damage to my body but this was only
the beginning.

Yoo Sangah received my gaze and slowly stood up. "Dokja-ssi."
It was hard to know what she had decided as unknown feelings were in her
eyes. I nodded in response while being hit by Han Sooyoung.

"I think Dokja-ssi isn't a person who will hurt others without thinking. Do
you have a plan? Did you deliberately direct this scenario?"

"Yes, that's right."

"Really?" Yoo Sangah was crying. "…Should I believe you again? As
usual…"

I knew this would happen. I was glad to hear it. Yoo Sangah roughly wiped
at her tears. She raised her dagger and participated in the battle.

Han Sooyoung's lips twitched. "…I thought you were going to sit back
hesitantly and whine."

"Please be quiet."

Han Sooyoung and Yoo Sangah's daggers placed small wounds on my
shoulders and back. However, they were still lacking strength.

The remaining time was 25 minutes. It was a tight amount of time if they
wanted to use the formation.

I looked at Lee Hyunsung. "Lee Hyunsung-ssi. Will you let the party
members die?"

"…"

"Didn't you say you would never lose the empty cartridge again?"

"D-Dokja-ssi…"

"This isn't just one cartridge."

Lee Hyunsung's eyes were shaking like the sea that met the wind.
[The constellation 'Master of Steel' is deeply immersed.]

Time passed before Lee Hyunsung shouted at the sky. He used Steel
Transformation and rushed towards me. The hard body bumped into me
and there was a strong shock.

My vision shook slightly. Lee Hyunsung used Great Mountain Smash but
he seemed on the defensive rather than attacking me. When would I see the
sight of a bearish man weeping again?

Next was the sound of magic turrets being fired. I laughed when I heard the
sound and turned towards that side.

Indeed, this was why I couldn't hate him. Gong Pildu was frowning as hard
as he could as he activated the turrets of Armed Fortress. Of course, I
wasn't just getting hit.

[The probability of the scenario is dominating your body.]

Regardless of my will, my body would act as the demon king. Of course,
the attacks were in perfect patterns so the party members could easily cope.

"Everybody, stay awake. Now it is the second phase."

The second phase of the 73rd demon king was starting. In order to thwart it,
special support was needed.

"Cho Youngran-ssi."

Cho Youngran received my gaze and invoked the power of the Mechanical
Gateway Array Method.

As if air was being drained through a ventilator, the demonic energy I was
emitting disappeared into the hole she created. Her complexion was rapidly
becoming white as she dealt with the energy of the demon king.
Blood spilt from her lips as Cho Youngran told me, "Sookyung-ssi will be
sad."

"She already knows."

My demonic energy dwindled and the party members attacked me again.
However, they still lacked damage. I paid attention to those who weren't
participating yet. Lee Jihye bit her lips and finally pulled out her sword.
"Ahjussi, don't take revenge later."

"I won't."

Lee Jihye smiled weakly at my words.

"…In any case, my attacks are weak and won't hurt. My constellation is
only historical-grade."

"The Duke of Loyalty and Warfare is not that weak. Jihye will soon
discover
it."

Lee Jihye used Song of the Sword and aimed for my weakness. The attacks
overlapped and a tingling sensation started to appear on my skin. The threat
was enough. Now I needed people who could deal the finishing blow.

"Jung Heewon-ssi."

As if she had been waiting, Jung Heewon slowly pulled out her sword. "In
the old days… do you remember what you asked me?"

"What?"

"You asked me to be your companion."

I remembered. In the Theatre Dungeon, I asked Jung Heewon to be my
reliable companion.
"Now Dokja-ssi is asking your companion to do something like this."

I was speechless.

"…What companions?" Jung Heewon raised her sword and ran towards me.
"What type of companion has to kill another companion to live?"

Jung Heewon triggered Demon Slaying and started to attack my body.
However, the sword just made a rough sound.

I told her, "It is because you are a trustworthy companion that I am putting
my life in your hands."

"…"

"Heewon-ssi, you have to do it properly. Think that I will come back to life
again and stab me as hard as possible."

"Dokja-ssi really…"

Jung Heewon raised her sword towards me. The power of Hell Flames
Ignition appeared around Jung Heewon's body.

Jung Heewon's eyes were red as she started to concentrate her strength. Her
real strength was when the power of Judge of Destruction was added to
Hell Flames Ignition.

Kim Dokja became a demon king and was a suitable target for that power.

[The character 'Jung Heewon' has activated Judgment Time!]

[Many of the constellations of the absolute good system agree to trigger the
skill.]

[There is only one constellation who is strongly opposed to the activation of
the skill.]
[The skill activation has been cancelled.]

The confused Jung Heewon stared at me and I gazed into the air. It was
obvious who had opposed the activation of Judgment Time.

"Demon-like Judge of Fire."

[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' is covering her eyes with a
pained expression.]

"…Uriel."

Sparks filled the air in response to my call.

"Please agree to the activation of Judgment Time."

[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' is shaking her head
violently!]

"If you don't do this, your incarnation will die."

[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' says that if she does this, you
will die.]

How good would it be if all the constellations were like her? It was
regrettable that I had to hurt Uriel.

"Uriel, you know. This is just a story." I spoke like a dokkaebi. "You
must've seen many people die in the meantime."

[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' feels despair.]

The messages alone portrayed it clearly. I remembered the small and
beautiful Uriel I saw at the banquet.

[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' is weeping and repeatedly
shaking her head.]
The little face that kept crying and shaking. She was an angel that didn't
match the modifier of 'demon'.

"Do what you need to do. Only then will this story be completed."

[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' is looking down at

you.] After a moment, I heard the message I had been waiting for.

[All constellations of the absolute good system are in favour of Judgment
Time.]

Finally, a bloody aura rose from Jung Heewon's body. "…Shit, I really hate
the name of this skill."

The aura of Judgment Time combined with the power of Hell Flames
Ignition and created a tremendous wave of magic power. It had the power
to destroy all the evil in the world.

The Judge of Destruction slashed at the demon king's chest with her sword
of fire.
         Chapter 188: Ep. 35 - The 73rd Demon King, VII


I was hit by the pouring flames and pain started to spread through my entire
body.

…It hurt. It really hurt. My skin cracked from the high temperature and my
eyeballs felt ripe.

Jung Heewon endured her tears and kept attacking me. The flames that
destroyed evil burned away at my wounds and all my flesh.

I probably would've fainted from the pain if it wasn't for Fourth Wall. Even
so, my body didn't break.

The shocked Jung Heewon asked, "What is going on with your body?"

"…The damage is probably too insufficient."
The rate of my stamina consumption was accelerated but it wasn't enough
to kill me in the remaining time. I didn't expect that even Jung Heewon
wouldn't be sufficient.

Honestly, I was at a loss for words. Maybe it was because I was judged to
be narrative-grade.

[The nebula 'Vedas' is rejoicing in your pain.]

[The remaining attack time is 10 minutes.]

[Constellations of the nebula 'Papyrus' are making a toast.]

This was just the beginning. A huge shock wave spread through the hall
and my body started to grow again.

[The third phase of the '73rd Demon King' is starting.]

[Your body has become harder.]

We had now reached the third phase. I shouted without feeling panic,
"Everybody, stay awake! Do you remember?"

The party members nodded and skillfully changed the formation. However,
I could see that Cho Youngran's Mechanical Gateway Array Method had
slightly collapsed from my explosive increase in magic power.

In the end, Cho Youngran coughed up blood and sat down. The timing of
this was faster than expected. Demonic energy started to fill the whole
hall and the party members became weaker as they received debuffs.
Now I had to borrow a hand that I hadn't wanted to borrow.

[The constellation who doesn't yet have a name is looking at his
incarnation.]
Shin Yoosung trembled after receiving my message and shook her head.
My incarnation Shin Yoosung had felt my determination long ago.

'Ahjussi, I can't do it. Please'.

I stared at Shin Yoosung.

This was the relationship between a constellation and incarnation. Rather
than speaking one hundred words, I conveyed my indescribable and deep
emotions just by looking at them. Shin Yoosung finally burst out crying as
the violent emotions were one-sidedly passed on.

'I understand'.

The pain and bitterness in the small child's heart resonated and as a
constellation, I could hear it more than anyone.

Shin Yoosung held the other child's hand and stood up. "Gilyoung. Let's go.
We have to do it."

Shin Yoosung's eyes shone yellow. The characteristics of Beast Master
were started to manifest. There was a great trembling in the hall and I soon
heard a tearing sound. A giant beast's snout appeared in the gap.

The chimera dragon. The giant monster that would later become a
destruction species flapped its giant wings as it was summoned to the hall.
However, the chimera dragon hesitated instead of attacking when it saw
me.

[The 2nd grade monster species, the 'Chimera Dragon' has refused its
master's command.]

[The 2nd grade monster species, the 'Chimera Dragon' feels terrified of the
73rd demon king.]
Blood poured from Shin Yoosung's nose. She couldn't control the 2nd grade
monster alone yet. I watched Lee Gilyoung and said, "Gilyoung. Think of
this as a game."

Lee Gilyoung looked up at me. I stared at the child's eyes and remembered
the words I had once spoken as we walked through the darkness.

It was a conversation that occurred when we wandered together through the
darkness of Geumho Station. The moments that passed like nothing became
precious memories that returned.

"Even if I die, I will come back. I promise."

These stories became the power to kill me.

"…Aaaaaah!" Lee Gilyoung howled and used Taming.

[The remaining attack time is 9 minutes.]

The chimera dragon was controlled by the two children's Taming and
started to cry out in pain.

The chimera dragon sucked in all the air around it. The chimera dragon
sucked in even my magic and started to open its huge snout towards me.

It was a dark magic power. A huge sphere of light was created between the
ferocious fangs. It was a weapon that only a dragon, the peak of monsters,
could use.

The Breath. I was hit by the Breath and my body was torn apart again. It
was a shock that caused the mind to break down.

Despite this shock, my body was still alive. The party members were
shocked by my miserable appearance but they shouldn't stop.

I straightened my ripped lips and said, "Con… tinue."
If they didn't do it now, there wouldn't be another chance.

[A few constellations have noticed your sacrifice.]

[Many constellations are amazed by your will.]

The chimera dragon was exhausted by the use of Breath and its huge body
lay on the ground. Fortunately, the chimera dragon sucked in most of the
worst of my rampaging magic power but the attack power of the party
members were decreasing.

"Damn, I'm out of magic power!"

[The remaining capture time is 5 minutes.]

My preparations for dealing with the 73rd demon king were up to here. So
from now on… I should leave it to someone else.

"Kim Dokja." Yoo Joonghyuk had risen from the stone wall and was
watching me.

I saw that Lee Seolhwa was exhausted by his side. She had probably poured
all her magic power into healing him. I saw many emotions cross his eyes
as he identified me as the demon king.

"Don't make such an expression. You can't change what has already
happened. Don't you already know?"

Yoo Joonghyuk wiped his bloody lips and murmured, "It should've been me
who died here."

Fortunately, Yoo Joonghyuk was Yoo Joonghyuk. He already accepted that
he would have to kill me.

Yoo Joonghyuk rushed towards me with the Splitting the Sky Sword. Every
hit made me feel that my physical strength had been reduced. He didn't say
anything but his despair was conveyed every time the blade cut me.
[The remaining capture time is 4 minutes.]

For us, we weren't even allowed time to feel that despair.

"Let's end it now Yoo Joonghyuk. Bring 'that' out."

"I don't know what you mean."

"Don't play around. I know you didn't use it on purpose."

"…If I use this, you can't be resurrected."

"That's why you are going to use it. It would be difficult if I came back
again as a demon king."

"…"

"What if the scenario ends up being ruined? You should stop thinking about
it."

Yoo Joonghyuk glared at me without speaking.

「 Do you have an idea? 」

I just laughed at his question. Yoo Joonghyuk hesitated before eventually
pulling out a sword.

The Heavenly Sword of Gathering Clouds. Ame no Murakumo no Tsurugi.
It was a sword obtained from Yamata no Orochi in Peace Land.

Yoo Joonghyuk spoke in a somber voice, "I hoped the moment where I had
to use this would never come."

"Me too. However, now is the time."

[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' feels despair.]
[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' is sighing deeply.]

[The constellation 'Queen of the Darkest Spring' is holding her breath.]

The power acquired by a story will eventually collapse because of a story.
My attribute of Eight Lives was derived from the power of Yamata no
Orochi. This power was bound to be vulnerable to the weapon of death that
killed Yamata no Orochi. Perhaps I would lose all my remaining lives if I
was cut by this sword.

Yoo Joonghyuk opened his mouth. "…To be honest, there is no certainty in
this. The duration of Giant Body Transformation is over and I'm not
confident in my current attack power."

"Don't worry about it."

I could see Shin Yoosung furiously shaking her head towards me.

[The constellation who doesn't yet have a name has given his incarnation a
'stigma'.]

There was a dazzling light and my stigma nestled inside Shin Yoosung.

[The stigma 'Sacrifice's Will Lv. 1' has been activated!]

The stigma caused a brilliant glow to emerge from Shin Yoosung's body.

[The master of the stigma risks his life for others.]

[The attack power of the party is greatly increased in proportion to the
desperation of their lives.]

The exhausted eyes of my party members started to become energetic
again.

Sacrifice's Will. It was a stigma that didn't really suit me. One thing was for
certain. My death was now confirmed.
"Thank you for everything."

[The remaining capture time is 3 minutes.]

The party members were running.

Lee Hyunsung, Jung Heewon, Shin Yoosung, Lee Gilyoung, Yoo Sangah,
Gong Pildu, Lee Jihye…

They cried, screamed or were filled with deep anger. Everyone was coming
towards me. My vision gradually diminished and all the characters became
the landscape. I saw them and laughed.

「 Incarnation Kim Dokja will be killed by the person he loves most. 」

I had forgotten. All prophecies couldn't be interpreted literally. In this Star
Stream, people were stories.

[The constellation 'Secretive Plotter' is looking at you.]

[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' is looking at you.]

[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' is looking at you.]

[The constellation 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' is looking at you.]

[The constellation 'Maritime War God' is looking at you.]

As the gazes of countless stars in the sky poured towards me, a story was
running towards me.

"Ahhhhhh!"

Parents, friends and lovers were all stories.

[The remaining capture time is 2 minutes.]
This wasn't the Ways of Survival I knew but—It was a story more
wonderful than Ways of Survival.

[A constellation of a small planet is looking at you.]

[All the constellations on the Korean Peninsula are looking at you.]

It was my story. I laughed as Yoo Joonghyuk's sword pierced my heart.

[Your fate has been realized.]

My body slowly sank down and Yoo Joonghyuk held onto me. "Kim

Dokja." "It was a really great story. Isn't that right?"

Yoo Joonghyuk stared down at me silently. I couldn't find any words and
just watched. It was as if I had always been meant to do this.

[The effect of the Heavenly Sword of Gathering Clouds has destroyed all
remaining extra lives.]

[You can no longer resurrect.]

I finally looked up at the sky. The clusters of nebulae were in the center of
the night sky. Vedas, Olympus, Papyrus…

I would never forget what they had done.

Then the sky blinked.

[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' doesn't wish for your
death.]

The stars shone brightly as if in response to my will.

[The constellation 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' doesn't wish for your
death.]
[The constellation 'Secretive Plotter' doesn't wish for your death.]

[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' doesn't wish for your death.]

I looked at the sky and laughed. Due to these guys, I hated the
constellations but I couldn't hate the story.

"Let's meet again, Yoo Joonghyuk."

The power of the demon king disappeared and at the same time, strength
drained from me.

[The main scenario has ended.]

[Seoul Dome has been freed.]

A small black hole appeared in the air behind me. My body was slowly
being sucked into it. My legs, my torso, my arms…they turned into powder
and were slowly being sucked in.

"Kim Dokja! No! Kim Dokja!"

At the last moment, he tightly held me by the neck. However, it was already
too late.

My vision turned black and I was sucked into an empty void. The eyes of
the constellations watching me started to disappear one by one. I was
leaving the area of the channel.

[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' doesn't wish for your death!]

In the distant night sky, one star desperately blinked at me.

[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' doesn't wish for your death!]

Yes, you can stop now. Uriel.
[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire'…]

Thank you.

The stars in the night sky went out one by one and Incarnation Kim Dokja's
story finally ended.

[Constellations of the absolute good system have withdrawn the mark of
'evil' from you.]

[Your incarnation body has completely been destroyed.]

[You have failed the scenario.]

[You have been expelled from the scenario.]

[The Star Stream will announce your modifier.]

In the faraway darkness, the Star Stream was quietly whispering to me.

[Your modifier is the 'Demon King of Salvation'.]
               Chapter 189: Ep. 36 - Story Horizon, I


On this day, everyone in Seoul Dome was immersed in a dazzling light.

[Someone has cleared the tenth main scenario.]

[Congratulations. You have passed the tenth scenario.]

Those who were hiding in corners of Seoul Dome to avoid the demonic
people and those who barely survived on the first and second floors of Dark
Castle.

All the incarnations who somehow survived the threat of the scenario
received the same message.

[You have accomplished the 'Liberator of Seoul Dome' achievement.]

Liberator. People didn't understand it at first but their bodies were
convinced before their minds. Their limbs cramped, their pupils expanded
and their lips trembled.
[You can escape Seoul Dome.]

Their long wish had finally become reality. The people on the first and
second floors of Dark Castle were summoned out into the city.

Then everyone saw the same sight.

The Dark Castle collapsed with a loud sound. The terrible nightmare
gripping all of Seoul collapsed like a sand castle. The broken chunks soon
turned into powder. People were filled with unknown emotions as they
watched the scene.

"It is finished," someone said.

"I can go out… I can live now…"

"The hell is over!"

Some people felt it was the end of the tragedy.

Compensation poured from the air. People had jubilant expressions on their
faces. Another tragedy might begin but for now, they were enjoying the
immediate feeling of liberation. However, not everyone shared that
sentiment.

"…What happened to Dokja ahjussi?"

Kim Dokja's group escaped from Dark Castle. Jung Heewon, Lee
Hyunsung, Lee Jihye, Gong Pildu, Lee Gilyoung, Shin Yoosung, Han
Sooyoung… All of them were gathered in one place. They were those who
survived because of Kim Dokja or those who owed Kim Dokja.

"Anyone, does anyone know? Please say something! Master! How is Dokja
ahjussi?"

The party members relied on their intuition to find someone who could
explain the situation. However, the only person who could answer was
silent. Yoo Joonghyuk was staring at the collapsed Dark Castle with his
mouth shut.

Dark Castle collapsed, like history disappearing. Kim Dokja was in there.
He died there.

Yoo Joonghyuk stared while confirming the fact over and over again.

Kim Dokja was dead. How could such a thing happen? Yoo Joonghyuk was
unfamiliar with not knowing.

"Yoo Joonghyuk-ssi! Please say something! Please!"

Yoo Joonghyuk stared blankly at Lee Hyunsung who was shaking him. The
first regression and second regression… he had never seen Lee Hyunsung
make this face.

Yoo Joonghyuk rarely remembered the expressions that his party members
made when they lost someone really precious. It was because he was
always the one making such expressions. He was the only one who
survived until the end of this tragedy and despair.

By the way, this life was different. There were still many people by his
side. He was suffering through someone's death with them.

"Yoo Joonghyuk-ssi!"

"Master!"

Everyone was staring at him. They wanted him to say that it wasn't too late.
Still, Yoo Joonghyuk couldn't give an answer to these faces.

"I also don't know."

He destroyed their last remaining hope. Sadly, this was the role left to Yoo
Joonghyuk.
"I don't know what happened to Kim Dokja."

In fact, he could tell them more. Banishment from the scenario. He could
share the information he knew. Or maybe he could testify to the feeble
hopes he might have.

However, Yoo Joonghyuk didn't do this. He knew that talking about it
would just be telling the party members,

'Kim Dokja is dead. You can't do anything for Kim Dokja'.

Some people said more by not speaking. A few people accepted Yoo
Joonghyuk's silence while others rejected it. Nevertheless, everyone
understood the silence.

"Dokja hyung said so! He isn't dead! He will live again! Then why…!"

"Yoo Joonghyuk-ssi! Please tell me how to save Dokja-ssi!"

Yoo Joonghyuk shook his head at Lee Gilyoung and Lee Hyunsung's cries.
If there was a way to save Kim Dokja, he would've already done it. There
was nothing he could do. It wasn't just him, it was everyone.

[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' feels a great
emptiness.]

[The constellation 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' is lying down.]

[The constellation 'Seo Ae Il Pil' has broken his pen.]

[The constellation 'God of Wine and Ecstasy' is looking at the abyss.]

.

.
[Constellations on the Korean Peninsula are mourning the death of one
constellation.]

[Constellations on the Korean Peninsula remember someone's name.]

Yoo Joonghyuk had never seen so many constellations talking about a
single constellation. The arrogant constellations were expressing emotions
other than frustration or pleasure.

They became aware of new feelings. The night sky was shining with more
colour than any of his previous regressions.

Sadness, great despair, sorrow… The night sky, made up of many
constellations, was shining sadly.

Maybe Kim Dokja was hope for them as well. It was hope to show a
different story. Something that could make a difference in the Star Stream.

'There aren't many ways'.

Looking at the dazzling star in the sky, Regressor Yoo Joonghyuk had a
thought.

'If I regress now…'

The ability to restart his life was like the button of a nuclear missile that
could be pressed at any time. Yoo Joonghyuk was able to go back in time
after dying and make better choices with the information he had of the
future.

If he returned now then Kim Dokja might revive again. However…

–Yoo Joonghyuk, wake up. Don't think things will improve if you repeat
them a few times.

What if Yoo Joonghyuk went back and there was no Kim Dokja? Or what
if Kim Dokja didn't act like this again?
Yoo Joonghyuk was afraid of something for the first time.

The Kim Dokja of this life might only appear in this life. Shin Yoosung of
the 41st regression never talked about Kim Dokja and he never met Kim
Dokja in his past few lives. Even if he went back to the past, the Kim Dokja
of this life might not return.

–Thus, live this round properly.

The choice that had always been possible was now irreversible. He met
Kim Dokja in his third regression and they became companions. Then he
lost Kim Dokja.

–Don't imagine that you will get better if you throw away this round.
Maybe this is the round where you will see the end of this world as a
'human'.

Yoo Joonghyuk got up from his spot and bit his lips. Only these words
remained. Just as everything in the Star Stream was a story, Yoo Joonghyuk
couldn't help acknowledging that Kim Dokja's words were part of himself.

[Huh, why aren't you moving? Didn't you receive the system message?]

The dokkaebi dispatched from the bureau looked down at them from the
air.

[Aha, I see. Everybody is mourning 'his' death.]

The party members resented his ridiculing tone but not everyone was the
same. Jung Heewon barely maintained her calm and asked,

"…How is Dokja-ssi?"

[He has been expelled from the scenario.]

"Can I ask what that means? Is he dead or alive?"
[I also don't know. However, it isn't possible to survive being expelled from
the scenario, whether it is an incarnation or constellation. That is all I
know.]

Even a constellation couldn't survive. The party members stiffened at the
words and their expressions became colder than before. Lee Jihye retorted.
"Isn't there a way? A way to save…!"

[There is nothing you can do. Honestly, it's amazing that you still have this
type of mindset. I will give you one piece of advice. Don't think about
unnecessary things and focus on the scenario in front of you. You haven't
escaped from Seoul Dome yet.]

The dokkaebi sneered and flicked his fingers. Then messages once again
poured from the air.

[The escape scenario has been given.]

[Seoul Dome will be closed soon! You have half a day to escape from
Seoul Dome.]

[The escape path is automatically provided.]

[You will die if you don't escape from the dome within the time limit.]

"Dammit…"

The party members looked at each other but there were no solutions on
their faces. In any case, there was nothing they could choose.

"…Let's move."

They started to move along the specified path. They ran, swam or crossed
railings as they constantly headed towards the outskirts of Seoul. Finally,
the route markers ended and they faced a group of people.
"These people…"

All the remaining incarnations of Seoul Dome were gathered there. There
were approximately 1,000 people.

Some faces were familiar. Min Jiwon waved her hand towards this side and
there was also the reclusive Han Donghoon. They were all saved by Kim
Dokja.

Yoo Joonghyuk and the party members lightly nodded at the people they
recognized.

"…Here."

The party members stopped at the same time and stared up at the inner wall
of the dome. It was a huge cage that had been trapping them so far. Now
they had a chance to escape from this prison. Everyone was excited but
nobody took a step outside.

They were like a canary that couldn't easily fly out of the wide open cage.

Instead, the people were looking around for something. One by one, the
gazes gathered. All eyes soon gathered on one person.

It was Han Sooyoung who opened her mouth first. "Yoo Joonghyuk."

Yoo Joonghyuk faced Han Sooyoung. She didn't say anything but Yoo
Joonghyuk read her eyes.

'Don't waste the opportunity that Kim Dokja gave you'.

Yoo Joonghyuk blinked slowly and stepped forward. Numerous people
were waiting for him.

It was to celebrate the moment they were finally freed. Yoo Joonghyuk was
troubled as he gazed at the group focused on him.
Yoo Joonghyuk had been in this position several times in his past lives. He
was sometimes eloquent and sometimes a charismatic leader. It wasn't hard
to find the words to give to the crowd.

Then why? He didn't want to say such things this time. Instead, he said,
"…I won't give up on this life."

Perhaps there was no one here who would understand his words. In the
midst of the terrible loneliness that came from this face, Yoo Joonghyuk
declared.

"So don't give up either."

He didn't know if it had been delivered or not. Yoo Joonghyuk turned away
from the crowd and slowly walked to the inner wall of the dome. Then…
Bang!

Just one.

Bang!

Then two.

His angry fists struck the wall. Large cracks spread through the inner wall
of the dome, centered on the point that was in contact with his fists.

It was a wall that couldn't be overcome after the scenario started. The wall
collapsed slightly and a gap that was the size of a human was made. It was
a landscape that always existed but couldn't be overcome.

Yoo Joonghyuk took the first step into that landscape.

"Let's go."

He stepped towards a scenario without Kim Dokja.
「 In the darkness, the lone Kim Dokja finally woke up. 」
               Chapter 190: Ep. 36 - Story Horizon, II


"…Uh."

「 The bones of the body seemed to be crushed and the skin was stiff, like a
dead animal's skin. 」

I listened to the Fourth Wall's words as I slowly woke up. The obnoxious
voice of the Fourth Wall was now welcome.

「 I am alive. Kim Dokja thought this. 」

I heard Fourth Wall so the plan seemed to be a success. In fact, I couldn't
really say it was a success.

It was natural. The 'fate' they gave me was the death of 'Incarnation Kim
Dokja'. It was natural that the 'constellation' Kim Dokja wouldn't die.
If I was going to disappear so easily, I wouldn't have built up my stories
and become a constellation. The problem was that I lost my body and
survived as a 'constellation'…

"…Where am I?"

The surrounding area was filled with ruined buildings and roads. It was a
familiar scene.

"This…?"

Not long after I spoke, I realized the situation I was in. I looked up at the
air. The night sky had always been filled with the light of countless
constellations. Now there was nothing there.

I was surprised by the deep words I was speaking to myself. I watched the
night sky and laughed blankly. "Haha…"

Usually, numerous indirect messages from the constellations should've
appeared.

For example, the Great Sage, Heaven's Equal who liked it when I talked to
myself or the Abyssal Black Flame Dragon… there was also the Demon-
like Judge of Fire who liked me for some reason. It was normal for
someone to answer but no one answered my monologue.

There wasn't the Bald General of Justice polishing his head, the One-Eyed
Maitreya who would throw his eyepatch if he was bored or the shameless
Slumbering Lady of Fine Brocade.

The messages of the constellations disappeared and only a laughably
terrible loneliness was left behind.

「 Kim Dokja thought: I'm really alone. 」

[You are currently expelled from the scenario.]
I slowly looked around the surroundings. Despite being expelled from the
scenario, living beings would go to the nearest 'outside the scenario' area.

[You are currently in an area outside the scenario.]

The outside the scenario area that I was currently standing in was a very
familiar place to me.

「 Seoul. 」

This place was Seoul's Gwanghwamun square. It was the place where
War of the Kings took place and I crushed the Absolute Throne. The fact
that Seoul had become an area outside the scenario… The party
members… thankfully, they escaped unharmed.

I looked at the place where the former Seoul Dome was located and felt
overwhelmed. The place that used to be covered with a translucent
membrane was now covered by a thick barrier.

Now the 'Seoul' scenario was completely over. The party members were
moving onto new scenarios without me and making new stories. From
there, they would continue to live.

…Maybe this was how it turned out.

「 Kim Dokja was glad but also somewhat lonely. 」

I thought about the party members for a moment before slowly turning
around.

「The lonely Kim Dokja had something to do. For that reason, he chose a
miserable death. 」
「 While walking on the streets of Seoul, Kim Dokja was immersed in his
memories. Whenever he went, he saw where he performed the scenarios
with his party members. Kim Dokja once again realized that he had become
part of Ways of Survival. He was obviously living this story. 」

"…This is very touching but shouldn't you stop now? How long are you
going to keep muttering?"

「 Kim Dokja was irritated by the poor Fourth Wall. 」

At first, it felt good to have someone beside me. However, I didn't feel
happy about having everything I did explained.

「 How much time has passed? Kim Dokja wanted to ask but no one could
answer. 」

"Dammit. You can answer me."

I scolded him before deciding to look at my condition.

[Many of your stories have been damaged.]

[Your current body is completely collapsed.]

I had survived by using my status as a constellation but I had completely
lost my physical body. In other words, my current existence wasn't 'flesh'
but a mass of incomplete stories.

[Your current body is in a very dangerous condition.]

[Methods to preserve your body can't be found.]

It was an uneasy state where I could completely collapse if anyone touched
me. This wasn't living.

I decided to try everything I could.
[Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint isn't available in this area.]

…As expected, it didn't work.

[You can't communicate with your incarnation.]

This also didn't work. I was expecting it but I was really weird because it
didn't work out. It felt like I was living alone in an area where no
communication was possible.

Of course, my actual situation was worse than that.

[You can't use the channel system.]

Since I was banished from the scenario, I naturally couldn't access the
channel and my contract with Bihyung was cancelled. I stared at the sky
without stars and felt empty freedom.

…Now I was really alone. Once I realized this fact, a chill started to creep
in.

「 Nobody sees me and I can't see anyone either. 」

No, I wasn't completely alone.

「 In the midst of this, Kim Dokja suddenly realized. He felt a sense of
existence through someone's eyes. 」

"I'm not thinking such philosophical things, Idiot. Rather, how long are you
going to keep this up?"

「 The stupid Kim Dokja doesn't know. Why the great Fourth Wall is doing
this hard work. 」

…What?
"Why can't you just explain? What the hell are you? You are a skill right?"

「 The stupid Kim Dokja is talking to the air. 」

It was a real jerk.

「 Stupid Kim Dokja… 」

"Can't you stop? Do you want me to turn the skill off?"

Then a sound was heard in the air.


「 The Fourth Wall asks, 'Th en should I qui t?' 」

I was a bit surprised. This brat, it could express itself more clearly now?
Come to think of it, last time…

"Yes, stop. I don't want to be bothered right now."

[The exclusive skill 'Fourth Wall' is silent.]

The next moment, I regretted my choice. I felt the air around me freezing. It
suddenly penetrated deeply into my bones. I felt the air in my lungs
clogging up.

"Cough…?"

At this moment, something belatedly came to my mind. It was the reason
why Vedas and Olympus sent me to the outside the scenario area.

It was due to this exact situation. It was a plot to kill 'Incarnation Kim
Dokja' and deal with 'Constellation Kim Dokja'.

"K-Kuoooock…"
I tried to scream but there was no sound. I could breathe but I couldn't
breathe. It felt as if someone had squeezed my lungs and my breath was
blocked. My head turned blank and my thoughts were erased one by one.

The Star Stream was a world of stories. There were no exceptions, whether
it was for incarnations or constellations. Every being existed through a
'story'.

[The speed of the damage to your stories has increased!]

[Your existence has started to vanish.]

In a place with no 'stories', nothing could exist. Even me.

'Damn, save me!'

I shouted while fearing that I would disappear. I could finally see why the
Fourth Wall had such a big mouth. It kept speaking in order to save me. In
a place where there were no stories, it kept me alive… It kept telling me
'stories'.

[The exclusive skill 'Fourth Wall' is activated.]

「 The Fourth Wall says, "Je…rk." 」

I managed to start breathing again.

"Pant, pant…"

I knew that being banished from the scenario was terrible but I hadn't
expected it to be this much.

Indeed, even Cheok Jungyeong couldn't survive outside the scenario
without the help of a nebula… damn, I thought too shallowly about the
situation.
I thought I could move onto the first target area somehow if I gave up a few
stories…

It would've been hard for me to live if it hadn't been for the Fourth Wall.

「 Kim Dokja thought: I should never turn off the Fourth Wall again.

」 I couldn't refute the words in my miserable mood.

"…By the way, how long can you keep it up?"

「 The Fourth Wall says, "No t lon g." 」

Intense sparks appeared as the Fourth Wall spoke. Indeed, it would be
strange that the Fourth Wall could cope alone with something that required
the probability of a nebula.

I didn't have much time. If I couldn't finish my task in a timely manner, I
would die here.

At this moment, a noise was heard from somewhere. It was reminiscent of a
vacuum cleaner…

「 Kim Dokja knows what this is. 」

"Yes, I know. The scenario cleaners."

The appearance of a cleaner meant a major 'clean-up' of the scenario area
had begun.

「 Kim Dokja thought: Since the cleaning has begun, the Great Demon of
the Horizon will soon reveal itself. The hyenas who wander through the
ruins of the scenario can't afford to miss out on these delicious ruins. 」

It was amazing to read. However, before I met them, I had to find
something first.
「 Kim Dokja picked up his pace. 」

I staggered and gradually sped up. Things reminiscent of small clouds were
wandering around the streets. They were the scenario cleaners.

They were ones to watch out for but I ran without worrying. In any case,
the cleaners were low and their recognition range was narrow. If I carefully
avoided them, it wouldn't be difficult to reach the target point without being
noticed.

I headed south of Gwanghwamun. Euljiro 3-ga, Chungmuro, Dongdae-gu,
Yaksu, Geumho Station…

Like a salmon, I passed by the places I had been. Finally, I arrived at Oksu
Station.

There, I faced the broken Dongho Bridge. I watched the broken bridge and
memories passed through my head. This was the place where Yoo
Joonghyuk dropped me into the mouth of an ichthyosaur.

I didn't know if he was doing well right now. Well, he had Han Sooyoung
to help him.

…I had to hope.

I leapt lightly across the broken bridge. In the past, it was a bridge that
could only be crossed using Deus X Machina. Now a single leap was
enough.

It was a moment that showed how much had changed from the beginning of
the scenario.

However, I still had a long way to go. The things I had to cross were
waiting for me at a distant much greater than the gap of this broken bridge.
Finally, I reached a half broken subway. This was the start of all the
scenarios. I looked at the appearance of the subway before entering and
looking through the ruins.

How long did I look? I finally found what I was looking for. It was an item
box that was shining white. There was a short message left on the item box.

–Kim Dokja, can I trust you? It was left as you requested. Thank you for
being an incarnation of my channel.

It was very obvious who wrote the message.

–Please, be alive.

Of course. I wouldn't die. I opened the item box. The box contained
300,000 coins and the items I asked to be purchased. [A new attribute has
been acquired.]

[The item 'Dokkaebi Egg' has been acquired.]

[The item 'Unbroken Faith' has been acquired.]

…

I grabbed all the items and left the subway. That guy was coming in the
nick of time. I sat on the bridge and waited.

Soon, that guy would come.

As I thought this, someone appeared on the horizon where the story ended.
He was an old man with a giant lump on one cheek. He walked towards this
side with a strange expression. It was like he knew I was here.

"Are you the Demon King of Salvation?"
I looked at him for a moment before turning my gaze towards the light of
dawn outside the dome.

I thought of the nebulae that would be waiting for me beyond that light.
Maybe they would think I was dead by now.

Olympus, Vedas, Papyrus…

I remembered every one of them. All the constellations who laughed at the
stories of the incarnations and finally made their own entertainment.

Just wait a little bit.

「 I will pull all of you down from that fucking heaven. 」
                 Chapter 191: Ep. 36 - Story Horizon, III


This sentence appeared in Ways of Survival.

「 The great demons who live in the 'horizon of the story'. They aren't
demon kings or demon species, they are great demons. They are those
who hate the dokkaebis as much as they seek and crave stories. 」 Yes,
this sentence.

「 If you are expelled from the scenario, there is only one thing to look
forward to. It is to hope for mercy from the Great Demon of the Horizon.
」

The Fourth Wall made it clear for me and I had nothing to say. I looked at
the Great Demon of the Horizon.

He gave off a very old impression. At first glance, I feel like a vagrant but it
wasn't hard to recognize them. It was because every Great Demon of the
Horizon had a big lump on their cheek. Due to that, some people called
them the 'wenny¹ man'.

Light sparks appeared in the air and the wenny man stepped back.

"…It is unusual. I can't see your information with the Great Demon's Eyes."

There was a yellow glow in the eyes of the wenny man. It was an attempt to
dig up my personal information.

Great Demon's Eyes. Anna Croft had the same eyes as the wenny man. It
was natural. I'm sure that he was the one who gave Anna the information on
the Great Demon's Eyes.

The Great Demons of the Horizon were incomparable dangerous compared
to Bihyung. I would be eaten if I underestimated him even a little bit.

I deliberately delayed before opening my mouth. "My information can't be
read by the prophet. Isn't your information network a bit slow?"

The wenny man frowned like his ego was hurt. "…Did you know I
was coming?" "Yes."

"How?"

"You probably came to grab this."

I pulled out the dokkaebi egg. The wenny man's eyes shook. He knew what
this egg contained.

"The soul is mine." At the same time, the great demon's lump started to
swell ominously. "I sent this soul here from another parallel dimension. I
have ownership of the soul."

He took one step closer while I stepped back.
"What are you talking about?"

"…The soul should've returned to me from the Underworld. You
intercepted it. I hope you return the soul before it is too late."

"Return? What was this bullshit? Is there a method to handle lost items in
the Star Stream?"

The wenny man still stayed in the distance as he stared at the egg with deep
greed in his eyes.

I looked down at the egg. The presence in this egg was the Shin Yoosung
from Yoo Joonghyuk's 41st regression.

In a sense, the Great Demon of the Horizon was right. The person who
turned Shin Yoosung into a disaster and sent her to this dimension was the
wenny man in front of him.

The wrinkles on the wenny man's face increased. "If you want to play with
words…"

"Let me ask her directly. This kid has her own free will."

I didn't hesitate to tap on the surface of the egg and ask, "Yoosung, he is
your master. What do you think?"

The egg shook steadily. "Hrmm, I see. It is a no?"

"…Hey."

I ignored the wenny man and asked the egg again. "Then who are you?"

The egg shook even more. I nodded as if I understood.

"Yes, a soul can't belong to anyone. Just like no one can be the master of
the story."
No one could be the master of the story. A sharp look crossed the face of
the wenny man who heard this. The Great Demon's Eyes were spinning. He
smiled like he found it interesting.

"How funny, Demon King of Salvation. Do you intend to negotiate with me
now?"

I was caught. I smiled and replied, "That's right."

"…Okay. Your behaviour so far has been interesting. However, if you want
to negotiate, give me the egg first."

"Don't you know what a negotiation is? This is a problem. I need this kid."

"You don't know the value of that egg."

"No, I know."

The egg was glued tightly to my hand, like it didn't want to leave. I lightly
patted the egg.

"Beings born from this egg can make a channel."

"…Do you know what that means?"

"It means I can broadcast outside the authority of the bureau."

The wenny man faintly shook at my words. His confused fingers were
heading for his beard.

I added, "In other words, this egg has the power to make countless stories.
Isn't that why you want this egg?"

The wenny man was extremely surprised and he was silent for a moment. It
felt as if he was trying to search my heart. However, he couldn't find see
inside me when even the Great Demon's Eyes couldn't see anything.
"…Are you going to rebel against the Star Stream?"

"Rebel? Who knows? Does the bureau manage all of the Star Stream?"

"Sometimes a part is the same as the whole."

"I don't think that is true but… okay. If it is an answer you want…"

The eyes of the wenny man were turning like a camera lens. I knew what he
wanted so I pointed to the night sky and deliberately spoke like a
revolutionary.

"I will destroy the world of the fucking dokkaebis."

The face of the wenny man distorted. I knew what this creepy expression
meant. This was his 'smile'.

"I like it."

It was simple to gain the favour of the wenny man. I just had to blame the
dokkaebis.




The most widely known story about the Great Demons of the Horizon, or
the 'wenny man' was probably the story about the 'old man with a wen'.

It was a story we all heard at least once in our childhood.

A good-hearted wenny man got rid of his growth thanks to the dokkaebis
while a bad-hearted wenny man got on more lump of growth because of the
dokkaebis.

I looked at the lump on the wenny man and asked, "Then are you on the
good side or the bad side?"
"Humans always wonder about it. There is no guarantee I will take your
side just because I am good."

"Well, you have a lump so you are naturally bad."

"That folk tale has spread across the world. Stories handed down aren't
always accurate."

"It is becoming increasingly clear that you are bad."

The wenny man shook like he was having a seizure. According to Ways of
Survival, the 'lump' acted as a warehouse for storing stories. Countless tales
inside that lump were waiting to find a new owner.

The wenny man looked at his system window that shook like a
pendulum and told me, "You asked for two things." I nodded.

"One is to go back to the scenario. The other is to acquire a new
'incarnation body'.

"That's right."

The 'wenny man' acted in places the dokkaebis' channels couldn't reach and
played a role similar to the Star Stream's black market trader.

They got rewards for sending the exiles back to the scenario and they also
saved unique items that the channel couldn't obtain. Of course, the price
was very expensive.

"I can help you with both."

"Okay, then help me."

"Give me the egg in return."

"No."
"Then I can't help."

Damn, it was back to the start. It seemed that they were firmly attached to
the dokkaebi egg. I decided to firmly hammer in the nail.

"I told you, I can't give you the egg. You can't use it even if you take it. The
kid will only listen to me."

"Don't tell me… the egg grew by eating your story?"

"That's right."

"Mixing a dokkaebi with your stories, you are a filthy person."

"Shut up. I'll give you something else."

"What can you give me?"

"A story. Isn't it something you want in the first place?"

Only the 'stories' were valuable in the Star Stream. Therefore, the wenny
man received 'stories'.

"…You are very confident. What type of story can you give me?"

"I'll show you."
I opened the list of my stories.


  [List of Stories]

  King of a Kingless World.

  Person who Opposes the Miracle.

  One Who Showed Contempt for a Streamer.

  One Who Hunted the King of Disasters.

  One Who Killed an Outer God.

  Demon King of Salvation.

  …

  Silla Allied Forces.

  Bug Slaughter.



I never thought I would've collected so many stories. Of course, there were
only six that were legendary grade and above, but it was a start.

Perhaps I was the only one who had collected this number of stories by the
10th scenario.

In fact, the wenny man showed a hint of admiration. "I knew you were
great but this is… really amazing."

He didn't hesitate to admire every story, like a guest in a luxury store. In
particular, his eyes were filled with a deep 'greed' when he saw the
legendary stories. The colour of the lump was red, seeming to show his
excitement.

"It won't be hard to replace the egg."

"Of course."

"Do I have to pick only one?"

"For now."

Of course, it depended on the value of the story. There were some I had no
intention of trading all of them. That was equivalent to giving away
everything that made me a constellation.

Then the wenny man picked a story without hesitating. "Then I will pick
One Who Killed an Outer God."

"…Do you have no conscience?" It is the only semi-myth that I have."

The value of a semi-myth-grade story couldn't be converted into coins. No
matter how important the deal with the Great Demon of the Horizon, I
couldn't give him the semi-myth-grade story.

Moreover, One Who Killed an Outer God would be useful when meeting
another outer god.

The wenny man smacked his lips like he knew he had made an excessive
demand. "Then this one isn't bad either. I will choose King of a Kingless
World."

I shook my head. "It is my birth story. I can't give it to you."

"I see. Then Demon King of Salvation…"

"You want to give me to give you what made me a full constellation? My
status will be demoted."
"…It is unfortunate. Then how about Person who Opposes the Miracle?"

"There is a place I have to use that later. I'm sorry."

The dumbfounded wenny man stared at me with frustration. "Then what
story are you going to give me?"

"I'll give you this. Silla Allied Forces."

It was a historical-grade story that I got from helping Slumbering Lady of
Fine Brocade and the Silla constellations. The wenny man's face wrinkled.
"Giving me that isn't worth anything."

…Wasn't this too much? The Slumbering Lady of Fine Brocade would shed
tears if she heard this. It was a great story where Silla joined hands with the
Tang Dynasty to hit at the Han ethnic group.

"Then how about Bug Slaughter?"

"It is better than before but it is still a common story."

"I'll give you both of them. If necessary, the other historical-grade stories as
well…"

"Can I take it that you have no intention of trading with me?"

Damn, he wasn't an idiot like Bihyung. Bihyung was the one who changed
the compensation rate from 10% to 0%.

I continued to hesitate and the wenny man smiled vaguely. "I don't know
how you are still holding onto your existence but do you have enough time
left?"

I could feel that my body temperature had dropped more than before. The
interval between the Fourth Wall's words was gradually increasing.

[Your body is collapsing.]
I hadn't gained as much as I could from the wenny man and my existence
was in a fairly precarious situation. This collapse would accelerate unless
I returned to a scenario right away or at least received a new body. 「 The
stupid Kim Dokja thought: Damn, what story should I give him? 」 …I
was feeling frustrated so don't bother me at this time.

「 At that moment, a story caught Kim Dokja's eyes. 」

What caught my eyes… eh? I momentarily hesitated. Come to think of it,
there was this story.

"Then how about this?"



[1] Wen – growth or swelling on the skin. "Hokburiyeonggam" is the tale
of an old man who, with the help of dokkaebi, loses the big lump on his
neck, and another old man who, instead of losing his deformity, was given
another lump.
              Chapter 192: Ep. 36 - Story Horizon, IV


It was a legendary story but at the same time, there was no special function.
Nevertheless, the existence of the story itself was enough to attract the
attention of the wenny man.

"This story…?"

"How about it? Do you like it?"

The wenny man stared at the story with eyes full of disbelief. His eyes
trembled as if such a story wasn't possible. The long fingertips touched the
window and the contents of the story started to play.

Peok! Peok! Peeeok!

The intermediate dokkaebi Paul was being pounded by my fists. Every time
the face of the dokkaebi was battered, an expression of shock crossed the
wenny man's face.
The story 'One Who Showed Contempt for a Streamer'.

Even if this story was given, I had five stories above the legendary level
and my status wouldn't be jeopardized. Naturally, it was a story that the
wenny man was bound to love. They were those who like to swear at the
dokkaebi and was bound to like stories beating the dokkaebi up.

"Kuk, kukuk… Ahahaha!"

The wenny man soon let out a burst of laughter. I waited until he had fully
enjoyed it.

"Good, I'll take this. It is a very pleasant story."

"Then do we have a deal?"

"It is still lacking. The story you gave is rare but it has almost no functional
value.

…I figured this would come out. I quickly added, "Then I'll give you Silla
Allied Forces as well."

"…It is still insufficient. If you want to continue the transaction, you have
to change the contents of the deal."

"Change it? How?"

"As I said earlier, you asked for two things. One is to return to the scenario
and the other is to get a new 'incarnation body'."

I thought for a moment before asking, "Is this story enough to only cover
one of them?"

"That's right. To be exact, I can only help you get an incarnation body."

Gaining an incarnation body. This was naturally important. However…
"Why can't you return me to the scenario? Can't you originally help with
this much?"

"You talk like you know something."

"I've heard some things."

Rather, I had read about it. Cheok Jungyeong was excluded from the
scenario and I remembered what the nebula Hongik paid.

The wenny man stared into my eyes and said, "Hmm… normally this price
would be enough but the current situation is a bit special."

"Special?"

"The bureau and nebulae are nervous due to everything you have done."

I somehow understood what he was talking about. The wenny man kept
speaking. "Returning an exile to the scenario is a lot more expensive than
you think. It is one of the most intensive consumption of probability in the
entire Star Stream. Still, as you know, I have a close relationship with the
'eyes' of the probability.

"In a situation like this where many eyes are watching, you will have to pay
too much probability."

"Yes. Furthermore, I don't know the reason but the branch manager of the
bureau, Baram has come out and all existing transaction windows are
blocked. At present, the straight route of return to the scenario is almost
completely blocked. I can't afford it, even if you pay a bigger price."

I couldn't go straight back to Earth…

The situation wasn't as smooth as I thought. The wenny man looked at me
and asked, "Do you just want an incarnation body? This is a legendary story
so I can give you a decent body. There are a number of healthy incarnation
bodies that I have recovered from the Murim side."

Incarnation bodies from Murim. It was an enticing proposition. However, I
shook my head. No matter how good the body, it would be futile if I
couldn't return to the scenario.

A new incarnation body could stop the collapse for a while but if I didn't
return to the scenario, the collapse would still persist.

The wenny man was making such a suggestion because he knew this. Once
my new incarnation body was broken down from the exile penalty, he
would try to take my other stories with a new deal.

I decided to push harder. "I have to go back to the scenario. By any means.
It is more important than getting an incarnation body."

"Hrmm… it is difficult."

"Earth isn't possible then is it okay to go to other scenarios?"

This was how Cheok Jungyeong escaped from the Korean Peninsula
scenario. There was no reason I couldn't do it.

However, the wenny man shook his head. "There are a few places to search
but it isn't good. Moving to an escape scenario requires a greater
probability."

"…Is it really like this? Are you being greedy?"

I deliberately waved the story window through the air. The sight of the
intermediate dokkaebi Paul being punched shook slightly.

"It is a rarer story than you think. What type of incarnation would strike a
dokkaebi in a world controlled by them?"

"Hmm…"
"Imagine if you put this in your lump and boast about it to your friends."

The wenny man agonized over it for a long time. He thought and thought
about it.

[Your existence is at stake.]

[Acquire a new incarnation body or return to the scenario.]

[Your existence will soon collapse.]

Finally, the wenny man opened his mouth. "There is one place that you can
go."

"Where?"

At this moment, an eerie light appeared around the wenny man's mouth.

"The Demon Realm."

His tone sounded as if he was saying something terrible. The wenny man
saw my expression and laughed.

"You don't have to be so scared. The Demon Realm is also a place where
people live. Besides, there is enough demonic energy in your body that it
won't be noticeable if you go there."

"There are different areas of the Demon Realm. Where are you going to
send me?"

"The 73rd Demon Realm. It is a place without a ruler. It is also a place
where the losers of the scenario have gathered since a long time ago."

The 73rd Demon Realm. If I remembered correctly, it was one of the
scenario areas that overlapped with the Earth scenario. I nodded.

"Well… it isn't bad."
"Instead, I won't be able to supply you with an incarnation body if I send
you there."

"However, I will return to the scenario?"

Entering the scenario area didn't mean I could return to the scenario. It was
because I had already finished the scenario. In other words, I had to get
help to enter the scenario.

Then the wenny man shook his head. "It is too unreasonable. I can only
send you to the 73rd Demon Realm."

"What nonsense is this?"

"I will give you some information instead. You will need a lot of luck and
effort but if you use this information, you will be able to get an incarnation
body and return to the scenario."

"It looks like a losing deal for me."

"Still, it is all I can offer."

I pretended to think for a moment before slowly nodding. Now I had no
other option.

"Okay, I will accept that deal."

I had decided so there was no need to waste any more time. I immediately
pulled out the story and gave it to him.

[You have paid the story 'One Who Showed Contempt for a Streamer'.]

The wenny man nodded. "The price has been received."

The wenny man swallowed the story that he had received from me. Then
his lump shone blue. He smiled with satisfaction and took a deep breath.
It was as if he was sucking all the air around him. I looked closer and
realized he wasn't just swallowing air.

The time and space around him was being sucked inside. The lump swelled
by several times before there was a loud roar. Along with the roar, a space
poured out of the wenny man's mouth.

The space that came pouring out created a long, elliptical passage.
Beyond this passage, the landscape of a different world was shining.
"Quickly enter. It has a very short duration, unlike a portal." I jumped
into the passage without hesitation.

[You have been transferred to a new time and space.]

It felt like he was jumping through the universe. Stars passed like countless
meteor showers.

I was flying through the night sky of the Star Stream. Numerous scenario
areas that had become fragments of the story flew around me.

[The Star Stream has noticed your presence.]

For a moment, there was a gaze on me.

[The Star Stream has accepted your presence.]

Then the gaze disappeared. A small current seized my body but that was all.
Perhaps the necessary probability was paid by the wenny man. After a short
space journey, I felt the gravity of a powerful story pulling at me.

[You have reached an area adjacent to the scenario!]

I rolled across a dust covered ground with a groan. The impact affected my
body as the areas touching the ground started to crack little by little.
[Your existence is collapsing.]

[Your stories are damaged.]

[You need a new incarnation body!]

Damn. I hurriedly got up from the ground but the hell had already begun.

"Kuheook…"

Letters started to flow from the cracks in my body. The most dangerous
area was my heart.

[Your birth story is leaking out.]

If I didn't seal the wounds and save my body, all my stories would collapse
and I would die.

I hurriedly looked around.

That guy said he would send me to a place where I could save my body.
There must be something here that could make up the incarnation body.

The moment I looked around, my expression hardened.

"This place…?"

There was a huge pile of garbage around me. Then as if he had been
waiting, I heard the voice of the wenny man.

–Perhaps by now, you have arrived in the 73rd Demon Realm and you are
facing the horizon of the scenario.

The horizon of the scenario. I knew this name. It was a place where the
wastes excluded from the scenario, like me, were forcibly thrown by the
scenario cleaners.
I shouted as I looked at the debris rolling around. "No, wait a minute! This
is a dumpster!"

–You will be able to obtain an incarnation body that can be used from there.
Of course, you have to find useful components. Well, I don't know if you
can get them.

"Dammit…

The wenny man wasn't planning a fair deal with me from the beginning. If I
was to die, he would come here and retrieve my stories.

–I hope you can find something good from the horizon.

I hesitantly sat down. Letters kept falling from my heart. If this continued, I
would die in less than 5 minutes.

「 After a moment, Kim Dokja's expression started to change. 」

I slowly looked around. It was for certain. I couldn't feel the eyes of the
wenny man at all.

「 The confused eyes became calm and the mouth, that was open like a
fool, slowly closed. Soon, Kim Dokja restored his clothes and muttered. 」

"It's hard."

「Kim Dok ja's act ing is wro ng. 」

"…Did you notice?"

I slowly looked down. It was pretty annoying but I had to act to avoid the
wenny man's doubts.
「 His purpose was to come here in the first place. If he wants to get what
he wants while hiding as much as possible, he has to act this much. 」 I
listened to the Fourth Wall as I searched the surrounding area.

"…I think I came to the right place."

As the Fourth Wall said, I planned to come here from the beginning. It was
why I put on a death show in front of the constellations.

I climbed the garbage pile and started to look around.

"Kuek, it hurts…"

However, it wasn't easy to maintain my sanity due to the piercing pain in
my heart.

[Your birth story is collapsing.]

Everything else was clearly acting but this pain wasn't false. I desperately
held onto my consciousness while thinking of sentences from Ways of
Survival.

「 It was Yoo Joonghyuk's 111th regression. Yoo Joonghyuk was expelled
from the scenario and reached a place where he could build up his power.
」

「 The 73rd Demon Realm, the horizon of the scenario. 」

「 At the dumpster, Yoo Joonghyuk got his new 'body'. 」

Nevertheless, no matter how hard I looked, I couldn't find a story that could
be the materials for a new body.
In the first place, the horizon of the scenario was a place where broken
stories converged. There was no way I could find a usable body in this
place. At least, through a normal method.

"Activate an attribute effect."

[The effect of the Lamarck's Giraffe attribute has been activated.]

Lamarck's Giraffe was an evolutionary attribute that I purchased for
300,000 coins. It was an attribute left behind in Bihyung's item box.
Finally, the time had come for the consumption of coins to be worth it. [The
privilege 'Evolution Factor Search' has begun!] [Searching for story
fragments that you can absorb!]

I slowly closed and opened my eyes as different things started to become
noticeable around the garbage dump.

[Story fragments have been detected!]

The fragments were shining with a white light. At least for me, this place
wasn't a 'dumpster'.

「 The right arm of the poor sword master who was stabbed in the back by
a colleague. 」

「 The terribly damaged frontal lobe of a grand wizard. 」

「 The heart of a young gold dragon who was torn to death by an outer god.
」

According to the setting of Ways of Survival, the privilege of Lamarck's
Giraffe was to construct the body by absorbing broken stories.

"…Then I am starting."
I slowly reached out towards a red heart fragment.
               Chapter 193: Ep. 36 - Story Horizon, V


The texture of the dull quilt touched skin.

Jung Heewon didn't know how long it had been since she enjoyed a luxury
like this. Everything was peaceful. She didn't need to be afraid of being
attacked by monsters in the night or watch out for humans trying to steal
her items.

However, Jung Heewon was well aware that this peace wouldn't last long.

"Jung Heewon-ssi! Please open the door!"

"I'm asking you for an interview!"

For a week, reporters had been clamouring in front of the house. She could
glimpse flashes of light through the curtains. In front of the ruthless gazes
of the cameras, Jung Heewon felt a strong sense of deja vu.

"…It isn't just the constellations who are voyeurs."
[The constellation 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' is chuckling.]

[The constellation 'Secretive Plotter' agrees with your thoughts.]

Jung Heewon felt a new sense of emotion at all the gazes on her. Before the
scenario began, the forms were different but there were similar things.

The voyeuristic gazes and the struggle for survival. In this sense, the
scenario might be around before the 'scenario' even started. Nobody knew it
was a 'scenario'.

Through the window, she saw the broken city area and the blocked Seoul
Dome. It had already been a week since they left Seoul Dome but Jung
Heewon couldn't believe she was out of the dome.

"Heewon unni! Did you just wake up?"

"Ah yes, Jihye."

Jung Heewon smiled helplessly as Lee Jihye burst through the door.

It had been one week after the escape from Seoul Dome. Many things had
happened in the meantime.

Jung Heewon and the group were assisted with homes by the provisional
government in the Gyeonggi area and were invited to the institute to answer
a few questions. They were obvious questions.

What happened inside Seoul Dome?

Were the rumours on the Internet true?

How many people were like them and what ideas did they have?

What were the constellations and the scenario?
At first, Jung Heewon faithfully answered the questions as the
representative. Then over time, the whole thing became annoying.

She wondered what was the point in doing this?

The South Korean government had already disappeared. The provisional
government, made up of some lucky parliament and city council members,
had no idea what had happened. They still firmly believed that the 'state'
system would be meaningful in the face of future scenarios. For those who
were still stuck to old beliefs despite the new era, Jung Heewon had
something to say to them.

–Take off your suits and your ties first.

–Huh?

–They aren't good outfits to run away in.

Jung Heewon glanced at Lee Jihye. In any case, the party members were
the only ones she could believe in. "What about Yoo Sangah-ssi?"

"She is in a room with the kids."

The problem was that the party members weren't well.

Lee Jihye spoke in a dark voice,

"…The loss of Dokja ahjussi is a big blow."

Honestly, things were uncertain when he was with them but once he was
missing, everyone was lost. This was Kim Dokja to the party members.
Everyone's purpose was survival but it was Kim Dokja who decided the
path of survival. It was natural for the party members to lose their direction
and scatter.

"I wish I had the manual that Soldier ahjussi mentioned."
"Have you heard from Hyunsung-ssi yet?"

"…He was called to the army on the first day and there is still no news."

Lee Hyunsung was originally a soldier and it was natural for him to be
called by the army. Lee Jihye whined.

"He is really foolish… I wouldn't have gone. What use is the army in this
world?"

Jung Heewon agreed with Lee Jihye's words but she didn't want to scold
Lee Hyunsung. Everyone had different ways of dealing with loss. The
children stayed in the room while Lee Hyunsung returned to the army.

If it was just that…

[The following scenario will start in three days.]

Jung Heewon gulped as she saw the message floating in the air. Three days
later, hell would begin again.

The more complicated problem was that the scenarios in the future were
likely to be completely different from what they had already been through.

[You can now respond to the call of the sponsors and receive the personal
trials they have set.]

[Personal trials are treated as hidden scenarios and can be replaced the main
scenario if it overlaps with certain main scenarios.]

[Scenario substitution is available only until the 25th main scenario begins.]

They passed the tenth scenario and opened the 'personal trials'. Jung
Heewon didn't have a sense of what they were yet.

Lee Jihye spoke in a comforting manner. "Don't worry too much. Master
said it isn't a big deal for the moment."
"How about Yoo Joonghyuk-ssi?"

"I don't know where he went after Kim Dokja's song. He is unlike the real
Master…"

Certainly, Yoo Joonghyuk's reaction to Kim Dokja's death was puzzling.

Yoo Joonghyuk stayed in his room like a broken person for a while before
suddenly disappearing, saying he would be back in three days.

"Han Sooyoung-ssi?"

"She went to talk to the government officials this morning. She said it is
time to reap the seeds that were sown…"

"The government? What can she expect from them?"

Then something belatedly came to her mind.

–If something happens to me, unconditionally follow Han Sooyoung.

They were words that Kim Dokja once left with her. Why did they have to
move with Han Sooyoung? However, there must be a reasonable
explanation since Kim Dokja said this.

Jung Heewon got up and the surprised Lee Jihye asked, "Are you going
out?"

"Yes. I can't continue staying inside here. We should also get ready."

"Then I'll go with you."

Both of them didn't have a hesitant nature once they decided on something.
Lee Jihye and Jung Heewon headed straight out of the house. They opened
the front door and the shutter sound poured towards them.
"Jung Heewon-ssi! I'm a reporter from Georyo Ilbo! Only one word.
Please!"

They weren't the only survivors.

Nearly 1,000 people came back from Seoul Dome. Some of them
contacting the living and spoke about the terrible few months they lived.

The reporters continued to find the party members despite accumulating
enough stories. The reason was simple. Among the 1,000 survivors, Jung
Heewon and the others were celebrities who were at the center of the
scenario.

"Jung Heewon-ssi! What happened inside there?"

"I heard it was helpful that you learnt kendo. Is that true?"

"There is a rumour that you were a candidate for the national team…"

Jung Heewon looked at the reporters pushing their microphones towards
her. The government had told her not to tell the media what happened. She
had been saving her words so far because she didn't find it easy to talk.

Then… why? Today, Jung Heewon felt like saying something.

"You are curious about what happened inside there?"

Jung Heewon let go of Lee Jihye's hand and looked at the banner waving
outside.

[Yangcheon-gu's Hero! Celebrating the safe return of Judge of
Destruction Jung Heewon!] …Hero? Her?

Yangcheon-gu had long since disappeared. Nevertheless, this banner was
hung and Jung Heewon couldn't withstand it anymore.
"I'm not the hero you think I am. I wasn't a candidate for the national team
and I didn't do well in kendo."

Jung Heewon spoke into the microphone like she was talking to the whole
world.

"Before the destruction came, I was just a bartender working at a cheap
bar." Her words caused a stir among the reporters. Nobody could believe it.
Someone scoffed and someone else looked a bit jealous.

In front of these gazes, Jung Heewon felt strangely free. She wasn't the old
'Jung Heewon' anymore. Jung Heewon realized it with all these eyes on her.

The reporters kept asking her questions.

How could a bartender become one of the last survivors?

How could she survive and how did she become the Judge of Destruction?

[The constellation 'Bald General of Justice' is looking at you with sad eyes.]

[The constellation 'One-Eyed Maitreya' is reminded of someone by your
words.]

The indirect messages of the constellations came from all over the place.
Jung Heewon opened her mouth without understanding her feelings.

"Do you know Kim Dokja?"

[The constellation 'Maritime War God' is nodding.]

[The constellation 'Seo Ae Il Pil' remembers the name.] [The

constellation 'Last Hero of Hwangsanbeol' remembers him.] The

voices of the reporters followed after the constellation.
"Kim Dokja?"

"Who is that?"

"I seem to have heard it before."

Jung Heewon thought it was funny. They didn't know. Of course, they
could never know.

Jung Heewon lightly breathed in and said, "The last survivors didn't survive
with our own strength."

She suddenly felt like crying as she spoke. The reporters didn't know
anything and kept asking questions.

"What are you saying?"

"The name 'Kim Dokja' isn't on the list of survivors?"

"Why didn't Kim Dokja-ssi come back with you?"

"Where is that person now?"

Where was he? Jung Heewon didn't know. However, if she had one wish…

"That person…" Jung Heewon stared at the Seoul Dome. "He'll be back.
Definitely."




「 At this time, Kim Dokja opened his eyes in the Demon Realm. 」

"Heeeeeeok!"
I screamed as I vomited and opened my eyes. The sound of my heartbeat
was unfamiliar.

A golden aura appeared around my heart and rough magic power was
emitted. It might be broken but it was still the heart of a dragon hatchling.
The strong magic power of the transplanted material was enough to stun
me.

If I could use this properly, I wouldn't be lacking magic power in combat
for a while.

[The attribute 'Lamarck's Giraffe' has allowed you to absorb the power of
the broken story.]

In fact, absorbing a broken story was a dangerous idea. It would've been
impossible for me without Lamarck's Giraffe.

「 Lamarck's Giraffe isn't acknowledged among the other evolutionary
attributes because it is less effective. However, it has the fewest side-effects
and doesn't absorb the weakness of the story. 」

If I had obtained Darwin's Demon, another evolutionary attribute, I
would've been killed the moment I ate the gold dragon's story.

This absorption effect was good because my safety was guaranteed. I didn't
have multiple lives anymore.

[The story fragment 'Broken Heart of a Young Gold Dragon' has been
acquired.]

The original name of this story fragment was 'heart of a young gold dragon
who was torn to death by an outer god'. However, I didn't absorb the 'torn to
death by an outer god' part.

This was the advantage of Lamarck's Giraffe. The absorption rate of the
story was low but the weakness wasn't absorbed.
[Your new body is being constructed.]

[The creation of a new body will delay the collapse of your existence.]

[This effect is temporary and it is recommended to quickly return to the
scenario.]

Magic power flowed from my new beating heart and I could breathe a bit.
At the very least, the tragedy of losing my birth story wouldn't happen
anymore.

The reconstruction of my body would start from now on.

I started to eat 'right arm of the poor sword master who was stabbed in the
back by a colleague'. Rather than tearing off flesh, it was closer to peeping
at a story that broke as soon as it was seen.

[The story fragment 'Right Arm of the Poor Sword Master' has been
acquired.]

I didn't know if it was just my imagination but I felt that I could use the
sword a bit better.

[The attribute 'Lamarck's Giraffe' has reached its saturation limit.]

[Drop the saturation level to absorb new story fragments.]

I felt better after eating two story fragments and sat down on a pile of
garbage.

"…It is a bit cold."

It was less painful than before but the cold continued to prickle at my skin.

The durability of my body had increased but the 'exile penalty' hadn't
disappeared. I felt a big emptiness and loneliness from the loss of the story.
I seemed to know why people wanted to hear, see or read something over
and over.

Then a slight warmth started to flow through my body.

[Someone is talking about you.]

…Talking about me?

[Your story is being created on Planet Earth.

I could see what happened. Someone was talking about me on Earth.

Who was it? It couldn't be Yoo Joonghyuk. Lee Hyunsung? Jung Heewon?
Or Shin Yoosung?

…I didn't know. Still, it was funny. Someone was telling my story.
Someone still remembered…

[The new story 'Kim Dojega's Legend' has been created on Peace Land.]

…I hoped they would at least get my name right. I looked up at the night
sky where the stars were invisible.

This was the horizon of the story. I couldn't see the stars and the stars
couldn't see me. Thus, the arrogant stars wouldn't know.

In a place they couldn't see, the story that was going to destroy them had
just begun.
     Chapter 194: Ep. 37 - Landscape of the Demon Realm, I


"The Fourth Wall said, Whe re is thi s place?"

「 Don't co py m e. 」

I was walking through the horizon of the story. To be exact, I had already
been walking for four days. Anyone who walked through the endless piles
of trash would feel like talking to the wall.

I muttered towards the fragments of the story. "Kim Dokja thought. I'm
going to pick that up."

Since there was a considerable amount of space left in the Infinite
Dimension Space Coat, I stored all the stories I picked up in it. Then the
Fourth Wall replied,

「 I di ot. 」
It was comforting to not be speaking to myself. I didn't know the identity of
the Fourth Wall but it clearly wasn't an enemy. Rather, it was the one
saving me from the exile penalty…

「 Sl, ee, py. 」

"Hold on a bit more. You should say something to make it easier."

It was hard to survive the exile penalty even after gaining a body and there
still seemed to be no end to the piles of trash. Maybe this pain would
continue until I returned to the scenario.

[Some absorbed stories are causing a configuration conflict.]

Lamarck's Giraffe might be an evolutionary attribute with relatively few
side effects but the story balance was causing my incarnation body to creak.
It wasn't serious yet but if I fought or did unnecessary actions, my body
might collapse again.

…Well, nothing was easily solved. This was why I didn't rush despite
wanting revenge on the nebulae.

[The scenario area is getting closer.]

The first thing I had to do was enter the scenario of the Demon Realm. The
wenny man threw me to this place but I knew how to get the scenario here.

I already had a rough plan. The route I was currently following was exactly
the same as Yoo Joonghyuk of the 111th regression. Therefore, the plan
shouldn't go wrong unless there were unusual variables in the middle.

…Speaking of which, there was a lot of work in Yoo Joonghyuk's 111th
regression.

It was around the time that the author of Ways of Survival fell into a slump
for a while.
It was just after passing the 1000th chapter and I remembered leaving a
comment with advice on various things. I didn't know if it was because of
my comment but a new person suddenly appeared and the story changed…

Suddenly, the Dokkaebi Egg in my arm wriggled. I absorbed some of the
story fragments and stroked the egg.

"Yes yes, you are cute."

I felt the soul I saved awakening to a new life. It was very strange. The egg
would probably hatch in one month. At that time, my plan would be in full
swing.

By the way, once this kid hatched, she couldn't be called Shin Yoosung…
what should I name her?

「 At this time, Kim Dokja heard a sound in his ears. 」

I crouched behind a garbage pile and held my breath.

It wasn't just one or two that I felt. There were at least dozens of maybe
hundreds of individuals. I peeked out to check the situation. I saw actions
that didn't feel alive at all. Beings similar to humans were searching the
piles of stories. Their identity was clear.

They were the Removal Slaves. They took orders from the rules of the
Demon Realms, collecting the story fragments from the surrounding
horizon to be used as fuel. They had very little intelligence and wouldn't
attack unless threatened first.

「 Kim Dokja thought: The fact that the removal slaves are moving means
there is an 'industrial complex' nearby. 」

The industrial complexes were like cities in the Demon Realm. They were
factories that created energy by grinding broken fragments of stories and a
residential area would surround the factory.
If I remembered correctly, the closest industrial complex would be the
Syswitz Industrial Complex.

"Move faster! We are running out of fuel today!"

I was surprised and hid behind the garbage pile again. A demon with small
wings and a single horn was flapping his wings and giving orders.

It was a supervisor of the industrial complex. The fact that he came here
meant the scale of the 'gathering' was quite large.

Then a removal slave approached the pile of trash that I was hiding behind.
I faced it without any attempts at avoidance.

"Grrrr…?"

The removal slave that stared at me with dumb eyes had the appearance of
a chimpanzee, not a human. Perhaps its planet was destroyed and it was one
of the species abducted here.

They were those who lost their scenarios and relied on other beings to live.
I saw the stigma '6424' on his arm.

[The effect of the 'Demon King Candidate' has been activated.]

Demon King Candidate. It was an attribute I got from the 73rd Demon
King scenario.

Then I started to hear words that were hard to understand.

–I, want, to, stop.

What?

–Kill, me.
The desire to be free filled its eyes as if this existence itself was simple. I
gazed into the pathetic eyes for a moment and sighed deeply.

「 Kim Dokja thought: I guess there is only one way. 」




After a while, I stood with the other removal slaves at the entrance of the
industrial complex. The items, including the space coat, were hidden deep
inside the pile of stories I was carrying.

In other words, I was naked now. It was inevitable since I had to look like a
removal slave as much as possible. In case of an emergency, I stitched the
stigma '6424' of the guy who died on my left arm.

"Next!"

My plan was simple. I would enter the industrial complex by mixing in
with removal slaves. It was because the screening of the removal slaves
wasn't as strict as other travelers.

"What, today's yield is zero?"

However, the supervisor was more of an obstacle than I thought. I gulped as
I saw the supervisor explode right in front of me.

"Hey, you over there. Take this brat. Put him in the fuel tank."

The supervisor threw the removal slave like he was handling a machine
part.

The supervisor was Demon Baron Chechefen. He was a lower grade than
the nobles I met in Dark Castle. Those in Dark Castle might have more
stories but a baron was a baron. He was a guy I could kill without much
strain.
"Next! 6424!"

The problem was what would happen after I killed him. The masters of the
industrial complexes were the top 'dukes' of the Demon Realm. A duke was
more likely to notice when the supervisor of an industrial complex was
killed.

Needless to say, it was dangerous to deal with the top nobles of the Demon
Realm with my current incarnation body.

I could use the Demon King attribute candidate but I didn't want to attract
attention from the beginning.

In any case, I couldn't help feeling nervous for a variety of reasons as I held
out my collection basket. If things became twisted here, my future plans
would become considerably harder.

"W-What? You have brought a lot!"

Fortunately, the supervisor's face flushed red after seeing all the stories I
brought. I wondered if he would find the items I hid in the pile of fragments
but I didn't think he was such a meticulous person. The supervisor flapped
his wings and shouted,

"Everybody, take a leaf from his book! Huh? Don't you know that the
recent yield isn't good? At this rate, all of you will become fuel!"

The supervisor's bluff caused fear to fill the eyes of the removal slaves. No
matter how much they lost, the fear of dying remained.

"Well done 6424! Come in!"

[You have entered a scenario area.]
I escaped from the supervisor's eyes and left the group of removal slaves.

I searched through the pile and wore the items one by one. I stored what I
needed and discarded the rest.

I walked along the street and soon afterwards, a large square appeared.

Humans were wandering around. There were also elves, ajins and
sometimes demons.

It was right to call the Demon Realm a place where people lived. Not only
did humans come from different dimensions, but a multitude of species also
lived here.

There were merchants selling various things and people bargaining to buy
them. A similar village to Paradise appeared. It was a place where people
lived and stories gathered.

I suddenly recalled a sentence from Ways of Survival.

「A city surrounded by a huge wall.

The low slate roofs created an unbalanced skyline.

Sometimes vehicles with steam engines were seen passing through the
street.

It was a city with a mixture of civilizations at various levels.

Most constellations didn't watch this place but it was also home to life. It
was a place where everyone was living together with their own scenarios.

This was the industrial complex. 」

Sure enough, it was just as depicted. I might say these words when
witnessing the Demon Realm's industrial complex for the first time.
The name 'Demon Realm' made this peaceful scene inconceivable.
However, this place wasn't much different from 'Earth' where humans
gathered.

To the people who thought such things, I wanted to tell them a sentence
from Ways of Survival.

「 If you think about it in reverse, it might mean that the human world is
just as terrible. 」

Yes, these words. I was reminded of the contents of Ways of Survival and
immersed in deep emotions.

The 73rd Demon Realm's Syswitz Industrial Complex. Here I had to meet a
character who would fight with me against the nebulae. Of course, they
didn't know they were going to do this…

[Some absorbed stories are causing a configuration conflict.]

…I might need to move more quickly than I thought. To make matters
worse, the exhausted Fourth Wall could no longer hold on.

「 Sleep y. 」

Eh? Hey, wait a minute?

[The exclusive skill 'Fourth Wall' has temporarily entered a silent state.]

Dammit, at this time? Suddenly, the cold permeated my body and sparks
started to appear.

The exile penalty made my body unstable and some people around me
noticed my presence.

"An e-exile!"
People scurried away from me like I was infectious. I quickly moved off
the main streets. Time was running out.

『 Three Ways to Survive in a Ruined World. 』

In this place, I had to find the story's second 'protagonist'.
    Chapter 195: Ep. 37 - Landscape of the Demon Realm, II


"Uwah! An exile!"

"What, how did he get in?"

The incarnations who saw me yelled.

I ran through the crowds and hid myself in the shadows of the city. Due to
the exile penalty, pieces of the story fell from my body like blood. The area
around my right arm and heart was stabilized from the absorption of new
story fragments but the rest was different.

The incarnations probably saw this and realized I was an exile.

"Where are you going? Shouldn't we report it?"

"Well… he will die soon. Let's just go."
It wasn't strange. This wasn't the first time they had seen an exile. They
were afraid of exiles because they didn't know what the exiles would do.

I leaned against an alley wall and the people looking at me quickly
dispersed. The magic locomotive that appeared also played a role in
calming the situation.

The incarnations found the locomotives covered with ominous black paint
and withdrew in dismay.

"Back off! A noble is coming!"

A locomotive was running through the center of the industrial complex. I
didn't know for certain but it seemed to be a guest from another industrial
complex. Maybe a high-ranking noble of the Demon Realm was on board.
A person as strong as Reinheit of Paradise might be riding on that
locomotive.

I didn't know what was going on but it was rushing towards the factory for
some reason. The locomotive accelerated without caring there were
incarnations crossing the road. The frightened commoners started
grumbling.

"It looks like Gilobat's locomotive. Hasn't it been seen often?"

"How would I know? It is the work of the noble scum."

"We need to know this time. There is a story that the 73rd Demon Realm is
being integrated."

It was a fairly interesting story so I focused my hearing on the drifting
words.

"The Demon Realm is being integrated? Those dukes are moving their
heavy asses?"
"Yes, Melledon and Bercan are moving. Won't Syswitz be really nervous?"

At the mention of the duke who governed the 73rd Demon Realm, the other
incarnations also intervened in the conversation.

"Hah! That rumour was real? But… we haven't had a demon king ruling
this realm for thousands of years?"

"Then this time, the demon king will emerge from our turf?"

Questions poured out and the incarnation who first brought it up spoke in
an embarrassed manner.

"I don't know for sure. Rumour has it that a message from an oracle is
passing among the demon kings. The emergence of a new demon king…"

"The dukes seem to think they will be the one."

I saw a similar conversation in Ways of Survival. It was time for this type
of rumour to emerge. I had come at a great timing.

Demon king…

I looked at the locomotive moving away. The industrial complexes also had
ranks. The 'nobles' were those who dominated the industrial complexes.

The 'citizens' were the incarnations at varying levels. The citizens who lost
their stories and fell were the 'removal slaves'.

Now there were only these three classes but the story was completely
different once a demon king came.

Demon king. A ruler who governed a demon realm, a person with absolute
power in one world. There was no way for the species here to disobey the
demon king.
In the demon realms, the demon kings had the same powerful status as a
narrative-grade constellation. Perhaps the dukes of the 73rd Demon Realm
were trying to keep the emergence of such a demon king in check.

Once a demon king emerged, it was only a matter of time before the current
power system collapsed.

However, a demon king must be created. It was why I came to the Demon
Realm.

–The second piece of information. Look for the Etika Clock Store'.

A new message arrived and I raised my head to look at the sky. In the
darkness, the faint energy of the wenny man could be heard. Fortunately,
the wenny man wasn't lacking common sense.

There was a saying among the dokkaebis that 'they learned morality from a
wenny man' but this was because the dokkaebis hated the wenny men… –
There you will be able to obtain what you want.

I nodded lightly and the wenny man disappeared again.

The Etika Clock Store. It seemed the wenny man was aware of the method
to get the scenario of the Demon Realm.

In fact, there was information on the clock store in Ways of Survival. Even
so, I asked for information from the wenny man in order to not attract
unnecessary attention. It was necessary to move in accordance to
probability.

I looked down at my left arm that was about to break. I couldn't get the
scenario right away just because I was going to the clock store.

Instead, there was a way to alleviate the exile penalty. The Etika Clock
Store was a place that existed for that purpose from the beginning.
I moved without delaying.

It wasn't here. Not this alley.

I pulled up my collar so that the broken story wasn't visible and ran through
the alleys of the industrial complex.

However, I couldn't find the clock store. It was natural. There was no such
thing as a clock in the Demon Realm. Such things were only meaningful to
beings with lives as short as humans.

It would've been easier to find if I could read Ways of Survival. There was
no way to read the text file because there was no smartphone. If I knew this,
I would've asked Bihyung to prepare a smartphone for me in advance…

In the end, should I take the risk and ask someone for the location of the
Etika Clock Store?

Suddenly, someone hit me in the shoulder. "What the hell is wrong with
your eyes?"

"Ah, I'm sorry…"

"So what if you're sorry? Damn, I dropped the parts because of you! Shit!"

The person was roughly 15 years old. A beautiful young man was glaring at
me with cold eyes while carrying mechanical parts.

"Uh… well, I'm sorry."

I was wondering if it was necessary to curse but the boy spoke faster than
me.

"If you're sorry then quickly pick them up!"
I was overwhelmed by the fierce words that poured from the handsome lips
and picked up the fallen parts. It felt like the old 'Kim Dokja' had suddenly
emerged.

I guessed I picked up the parts too quickly, causing the boy to laugh.
"Damn, I'll let you off this once. Be careful next time."

The boy took the parts, glanced at me with distinctive eyes and rushed
forward again. Then why? I saw his face and felt like I had been hit in the
back of the head with a hammer. It wasn't because I was scolded by
someone younger than me.

That guy…

Like every fantasy novel, there were pretty and handsome characters in
Ways of Survival.

Among the pretty and handsome characters, there were those who were
described as 'equivalent to Yoo Joonghyuk'. Kyrgios Rodgraim who I met
in Peace Land was such a case.

By the way, this world contained people who were more beautiful than
Kyrgios. In such cases, what expression should be used?

「The boy was so beautiful that Yoo Joonghyuk would be slapped in the
cheeks twice. 」

In addition, this description was only attached to three people in Ways of
Survival.

"I found you."
There was a huge road and the entire shelf of the store was broken. Damn,
this was already the third time. It was also a shelf with work on it.

Aileen, the watchmaker of Etika, suppressed a curse and asked with a calm
smile. "What are you doing?"

"What am I doing? Shouldn't you already know after experiencing it three
times?"

"No, that's what I want to say. What do you want from a clock store

owner?" Aileen was nervous as she confronted the two demons in front of

her.

Demon Baron Melen. Demon Earl Silocke. The two demons were famous
nobles in the Syswitz Industrial Complex. One of the demons laughed as he
stretched out elongated arms.

"Keuk!" Aileen groaned as she was hit in the jaw.

The demon earl Silocke laughed as he carefully examined the wound left on
Aileen's white skin.

"You're definitely not an ordinary watchmaker. However, you're not great
enough for the duke to visit three times. This isn't three humble visits to a
thatched cottage. Do you know what a 'lying down dragon¹' is?"

"…I didn't know who that is but didn't I make it for you last time? This
time I can't help you."

The air inside the clock store started to freeze. It was the power of a demon
noble. Aileen trembled as her face turned pale with fright.

"What is this Aileen? Is this a personal loan?"
Someone was standing in front of the clock store. Silocke saw the young
man standing at the door and frowned. "You are the foul-mouthed guy of
the clock store. Do you want to be executed?"

"I'll take care of him." Demon Baron Melen grabbed the boy's neck and
lifted him up.

The beautiful boy looked down at Melen, who told him. "I feel it every time
I come but you are really pretty."

"I feel it every time I see you but you are really disgusting."

Melen's left hand hit the boy's belly. There was the sound of something
bursting but the boy's eyes didn't change at all. Melen stared into those eyes
and laughed. "This is enough to become the duke's concubine."

"What is the hourly pay? If it isn't sufficient then I won't go…"

Once again, there was the sound of something being hit. Aileen's expression
hardened as she looked at the boy's bloody mouth.

"Let's take him hostage." Then the demon removed his hands like he
had been joking. "Huhu, who would do such a thing? We are
gentlemen." The young man fell to the ground and groaned.

"So the offer will be rejected? Can I tell the duke?"

"Yes. I'm sorry but…"

Surprisingly, the atmosphere smoothed out and Aileen sighed deeply. She
hadn't wanted to do this task. If she accepted the job, she would be
sacrificing thousands of citizens.

Then Silocke nodded like he understood. "Then I will receive the taxes that
you are behind on. The duke asked me to do this."
"Tax? Until now, I have been tax-exempt…"

"It was until now but not anymore."

As expected, there was no way she could just walk away. Aileen bit her lip
until it cracked as she asked, "…How much?"

"50,000 coins."

50,000 coins.

It was a huge amount of Aileen. It might be different in other scenario areas
but coins were one of the most valuable currencies in the Syswitz Industrial
Complex.

"There are almost no constellations here! Such a huge amount of money…"

"I will take this little boy if you don't pay. If he becomes a concubine then
you can get 50,000 coins."

The threatened boy was unconcerned and whistled at the threat. "Wow!
50,000 coins! Aileen, don't pay the tax and get the money."

"…I will make that cheeky mouth scream soon."

"Really? Shit, I'm looking forward to it."

Despite the young boy's words, Aileen's expression was filled with despair.
She had a long relationship with this boy and knew that no matter his dirty
words on the surface, deep inside he was thinking differently. An ultimatum
emerged from the mouth of the demon earl.

"Aileen Makerfield. Accept the duke's proposal. For reference, this is the
last offer."

Aileen was the chairman of the citizens. She could get to this position
because of her strong heart. Aileen hesitated before opening her mouth.
"I…"

Rattle.

Then someone entered the clock store.




"What?"

The first thing that greeted me wasn't the owner of the clock store. I saw the
demon nobles who were uncomfortable with the uninvited visitors. I had
roughly heard the situation outside and knew what was going on.

The beautiful young man was lying on the ground with eyes full of hatred.

I replied while staring closely at the beautiful boy instead of the demons.
"A customer…"

My answer was polite but the demon' expressions turned fierce.

"Is it a citizen? I don't know where you came from but leave. We're
collecting taxes now."

"Taxes… making a lot of money and paying higher taxes. Why is it
suddenly making a low amount of money and paying higher taxes?"

"What?"

I passed by the demon nobles and approached the shopkeeper.

"Hey! Wait!"

The bewildered demon nobles stretched out their arms to grab me but they
didn't reach. The demon nobles made expressions of surprise as I lightly
shook them off. Instead of dealing with them, I glanced at the clocks on the
broken shelf. I carefully picked up one of them.

"There are many good things."

Aileen seemed to sense something and approached me. "…There are
always good things. A good owner rarely appears."

I couldn't help smiling. This was really the tone of Ways of Survival.

The planet Lindberg's magic engineer, Aileen Makerfield. I glanced at the
nervous Aileen.

Inside her, the needle must be ticking. Would the suspicious customer who
suddenly appeared be the rope of hope or the person who dropped her into
hell?

I decided to relieve some of her worries. "I would like to order something
special. Can you make one for me?"

Aileen's eyes grew bigger at my words. There was only one type of
customer who would come here for a 'special' thing.

Aileen saw the demon nobles and asked carefully, "…What is the
commission fee?"

I smiled at her before staring at the demon nobles who were staring at me.

"50,000 coins."


[1] In Romance of the Three Kingdoms Liu Bei visited Zhuge Liang
thrice and recruited him as an adviser.
    Chapter 196: Ep. 37 - Landscape of the Demon Realm, III


"Wait a minute, you are…!"

The eyes of the beautiful young man grew wider as he recognized me.
Before the young man could open his mouth again, the quick-witted
Aileen hurriedly accepted my coins. "50,000 coins. Okay."

"I-Is it really 50,000 coins…?"

The astonished boy's mouth dropped open as he glanced between Aileen
and me.

50,000 coins weren't that big in terms of the scenarios but it was a
substantial amount in the Demon Realm.

It was an area that the constellations hardly ever visited due to the demon
kings. Of course, by my standards, 50,000 coins was petty cash.
[The 'Kim Dojega's Legend 1st Part' has been completed on Peace Land.]
[The pioneers of the area are preaching faith in you.]

[15,000 coins have been acquired.]

I even received coins in real time. This was the good thing about being a
constellation. Even without the sponsorship, I made money just by being
famous.

The stiffened demon nobles belatedly reacted. "Who are you?"

I looked at their information.

Demon Earl Silocke and Demon Baron Melen. They were moderately
wellknown collectors in the Syswitz Industrial Complex.

"I understand, Customer."

Usually, I would bow politely but courtesy was just counterproductive to
these guys. They were hyenas who liked to eat those who showed weakness
or fear.

"You, now…!" The demon baron, Melen raised his energy at my tone.

"Let it go Melen." Silocke watched the situation and dissuaded Melen. The
earl looked like he was eating with an unwelcome guest.

[The character 'Demon Earl Silocke' is looking at you with curiosity.]

[Your understanding of the character 'Demon Earl Silocke' has

increased.] I didn't miss this opportunity to use a skill.

[The exclusive skill, 'Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint' has been activated!]

Then I started to hear Silocke's thoughts.
「 This guy can easily pay 50,000 coins. 」

「 A citizen can never pay this amount. Besides, look at that relaxation.
50,000 coins is obviously a pittance for him. 」

「 Who is this? This is the first time I've seen him in the area. Wait a
minute, that demonic energy… 」

「 Don't tell me…? 」

It was going as I thought. No, it was better. In any case, the Syswitz
Industrial Complex was bursting with stories about the new demon king. If
so, it wouldn't be bad to leak misleading information to them.

I spoke in a voice full of bravado. "You must've already guessed."

I spoke in Yoo Joonghyuk's tone and Silocke's complexion changed. He
nodded as if his thoughts were correct and then spoke politely to me.

"Noble demon, I am belatedly greeting you. Do you happen to be visiting
from the Gilobat Industrial Complex?"

"It looks like your ears are working properly."

"However, you didn't give any notice that you were visiting this area…"

"Do I have to tell my route to someone like you?"

"That… I'm sorry."

He was convinced by my short answer.

「The right to move without prior notice. He must be at least a
marquisgrade. 」
「 There is nothing good about getting entangled with the Gilobat
Industrial Complex. 」

After the brilliant misunderstanding, Silocke bowed to me and elbowed
Melen. "Let's go."

"Huh? But…"

"We only needed to get it."

Melen belatedly nodded at his superior's sober judgment. Melen took
50,000 coins from Aileen and warned in a fierce voice.

"This time you got lucky. Don't expect it to happen next time, Aileen."

The two demon nobles left the watch store. Maybe Silocke would report
this to his boss immediately. It didn't matter. I couldn't think up to there.

The clock store was filled with energy once the storm passed. It was the
beautiful boy who broke the atmosphere. "…Isn't this considerably big?
Who the hell are you?"

He looked up at me with sparkling eyes and I smiled quietly.

"What is your commission?" Aileen belatedly came to her senses and asked
me. "That… by the way, are you a noble?"

The demons had misunderstood but there was no way Aileen should
misunderstand.

I shook my head. "I'm not a demon noble."

"Then…?"

I quietly took off my coat as an answer. Sparks appeared and the broken
story fragments fell down. Shock appeared on Aileen's face as she checked
my body.
"…An exile? Then the special request…!"

"That's right."

Aileen's face was white because she could guess the scale of my story with
one glance.

"I-I've never had a story of this magnitude."

"Only you can do it. You are the 'story expert' of the Syswitz Industrial
Complex."

Aileen's expression shook at the words 'story expert'. As my consciousness
started to collapse, I grabbed her shoulders and added,

"Fix me, Aileen Makerfield."




My consciousness flickered while I sensed Aileen and several strangers.
There were a few voices following me.

"How can an incarnation have a story of this magnitude…?"

"Who is he?"

"…There are a mixture of stories that don't fit the norm. Oh my god. Isn't
this a legendary story?"

"Is this really an incarnation? I don't think this is the status of an
incarnation."

"He ate these dangerous fragments and are still alive…"
I wouldn't have suffered so much if the level of Lamarck's Giraffe was
higher. If the absorption rate was high, it would be possible to neutralize the
effect of mixing story fragments.

However, that wasn't my current situation. Like the human immune
response, different stories were attacking each other to defend themselves.

"We need to stabilize this as soon as possible…"

Aileen's voice was tense.

Aileen Makerfield. According to Ways of Survival, she was a magic
engineer on the planet Lindberg. She studied for a long time and learnt that
the essence of this world was the 'story'.

She didn't achieve transcendent but she was one of the few incarnations
with the attribute of Story Expert.

My consciousness flickered a few more times. Then strength gradually
started to return to my body. The chills caused by the exile penalty were
reduced and the pain of my body alleviated.

The Right Arm of the Poor Sword Master and Broken Heart of a Young
Gold Dragon didn't collide with the other stories and safely permeated my
body.

Indeed, it was a good choice to visit Aileen.

I finished checking my body and slowly opened my eyes. There was the
beautiful ace of a young boy in front of me.

I felt it before but he really was pretty. It was better to express his
appearance as a girl than a boy.

"Wah!" The surprised young man suddenly screamed.
I tried to slowly raise my body but I couldn't move. Looking closer, my
body was tied to the operating table. It seemed to be a technique to suppress
the power of the story…

I looked around and found that there was only the boy. Perhaps he was a bit
relieved to know I was tied up and the boy opened his mouth. "Hey, what
are you?"

No, this situation was better. I needed some time along with these guys
anyway. I told him, "What do you think? You like quizzes."

"…Who said that?"

"In any case, make a guess."

Intrigue filled the eyes of the young boy. As expected, it was a good catch.
The young man thought about it before asking me, "Are you a returnee?"
"Returnee? Why do you think that?"

"It doesn't make sense for a common citizen of the Demon Realm to have
such a large amount of money."

"It's okay. Continue."

"You said that you're not a demon and I don't think you are a normal
incarnation. You also have many rare stories. You seem to be somewhat
strong. Then there is only one answer."

"Hrmm…"

"How is it? Is my reasoning correct?"

I looked at his brightly shining eyes and somehow wanted to make fun of
him. "Your reasoning is right but you need one premise."

"What's the premise?"
"The premise is that all returnees are strong."

The beautiful young man's expression became strange at my words.

"What do you mean by that? Don't you know what a returnee is? They are
those who returned to their planets after gaining a powerful strength from
another dimension or planet. How can those people be weak?"

"I don't know. You haven't met all returnees in the world, right?"

"That…"

"For example, some returnees might not want to return because they hate
their planet."

The expression of the young boy hardened.

"You are frustrated because you moved to a different dimension several
times but didn't get much power."

"…"

"You got a new body but you don't have any talent."

"…Wait."

"You became frustrated by your lack of talent and decided to sit still in one
place and live an ordinary life."

"…Who are you really?"

I grinned and opened my mouth. "Hayoung. Are you happy with your life
in the Demon Realm?"

"What?"

Grumbling, Laziness, Sloth, Lethargy…

Who would see this guy's information and think he was the second
protagonist of Ways of Survival? If Yoo Joonghyuk saw this, his pride
would be hurt by the fact that his name was on the same list.

"H-How are you…?!"

However, Jang Hayoung wasn't originally like this. He tried and tried again,
but the results weren't good. A huge 'wall' was always obstructing him. The
results didn't match the process.

"Oh, you don't use your real name here. Should I call you Aslan?"

"How do you know my real name?" The surprised Jang Hayoung backed up
towards the wall.

I looked at him and recalled old memories.

–Author-nim. I think it is better to create a new character…
If I hadn't left the comment at that time…

Would Jang Hayoung exist in today's world?

–In addition, it should preferably be a pretty girl…

Maybe this was why I felt responsible for this guy. I didn't know if the
author created this character because of me. However…

–The setting, hrmm. Since Joonghyuk is a regressor, it is enough if the new
character is a dimensional mover.

At the very least, if I hadn't left this comment, the second protagonist
wouldn't have to keep moving dimensions.

"You're not without talent. You just don't know your talent."

"What? W-What does that mean?"

I was just opening my mouth again when the door burst open.

"Is that Aslan? What's the fuss?"

"A-Aileen!"

Aileen saw Jang Hayoung's face and glanced at me. "What are you? What
did you do to him?"

I shrugged without saying anything. Some people could be seen behind
Aileen. Maybe there were members of the Syswitz Civil Council. They
were the last conscience against the duke's ambitions. I liked such people.

I could deal with Jang Hayoung later. I needed to take care of this side first.
"Duke Syswitz…"

"What?"
"He is ambitious. He refused a high-ranking position in another demon
realm and came to this remote area."

The members of the civil council glanced at each other at my words.

I stared at Aileen and said, "Maybe Duke Syswitz asked you to make him
giant soldiers. Is that right?"

"Eh?"

"That guy, he got a taste when he went on a tour of the Demon Realm.
That's why he is making such an unreasonable request. He doesn't know his
subjects."

"H-How do you…!"

The members of the civil council were greatly confused by the information
I knew. The surprised Aileen seemed to be stiffening. I didn't miss this
chance.

"You have refused him three times and next time he will take you by force.
Are you ready?"

The faces of Aileen and the citizens darkened at my words. It was certain.
They were powerful on their own planets but they couldn't compare to a
duke of the Demon Realm.

I enjoyed the silence before saying with a grin. "If you listen to my
conditions, I will stop the duke for you."

It was puzzling for them. The exile who suddenly appeared not only knew
this information but also offered a ridiculous proposal.

It was Aileen who struggled to shut her mouth. "You… who the hell are
you?"

Yes, it started from here.
I wish I could say that I was 'Kim Dokja' but that wasn't possible yet. If I
revealed my name here, the constellations on Earth would know I was still
alive.

Then… let's go back to the original work. I recalled the 111th regression in
the novel and declared in a voice as evil as possible.

"My name is Yoo Joonghyuk. I am here to become the 'demon king' of the
73rd Demon Realm."




[Your notoriety is spreading in the 73rd Demon Realm.]

Yoo Joonghyuk stared up at the sky the moment he heard the message.

"…What?"

Of course, the sky didn't answer. Then Yoo Joonghyuk's expression
changed strangely.

Yoo Joonghyuk thought about something for a moment before staring at the
sky with disbelief, muttering, "Kim Dokja?"
    Chapter 197: Ep. 37 - Landscape of the Demon Realm, IV


Yoo Joonghyuk's comment on becoming the 73rd demon king was a line
from Ways of Survival.

I watched the reactions of the council members with a bit of excitement.

"That, I mean…"

It was strange. In Ways of Survival, everyone had clearly gone, "Ohhh!"
Everyone didn't show the dramatic reaction I expected. Then I heard a
voice.

「 The demon king of the 73rd Demon Realm! There was a man who spoke
such words. Irene and the other members of the civil council were in great
shock. 」

That brat, when did it wake up? It said it was sleepy and then went away…

「 On the other hand, Kim Dokja felt somewhat stronger. 」
…Eh?

「 It was a habit he had since his school days. In important moments of his
life or in moments when his self-esteem fell, Kim Dokja would say, "I am
Yoo Joonghyuk."」

I had a bitter taste in my mouth as I endured the harassment of the Fourth
Wall, who exposed my black history, Damn, I couldn't do anything to this
brat.

"The council members should leave for a moment. I have to talk to him for
a while."

Aileen thought about something before making a decision. Jang Hayoung
and the members of the civil council disappeared out the door. Aileen
dragged a chair over to my operating table.

I asked her, "Can you release this first? I'm not in a state where I can talk."

However, Aileen didn't release my straps. It meant she didn't trust me yet.

"You said you would become the demon king."

"Yes." I nodded once.

"Do you know what that means?"

"It literally means to be king of the 73rd Demon Realm."

"And?"

"It means I will receive excessive attention from the other 72 demon kings."

In fact, I was a bit nervous. I didn't have a very favourable relationship with
the demon kings yet.
Aileen looked at my face and sighed. "I took a peek at your stories while
treating you… I don't know what the hell are you are thinking."

"What's the problem?"

"…Duke Syswitz is strong. Maybe even stronger than you think."

Aileen's tone was calm, unlike her previous confused appearance. Indeed,
there was a reason she survived for so long in the Demon Realm.

"It is natural. He is a duke."

The dukes were the more powerful existences after the demon kings in the
Demon Realm.

They were located at the top of the Demon Realm. Some of them had the
power approaching the highest level of the historical-grade constellations
and they certainly weren't shallow opponents. Aileen's evaluation was fair.

"I understand your confidence. I've already confirmed that you have
amazing stories.

She had repaired my stories and had a certain estimate of my strength. Time
was short so she couldn't identify all the stories I had hidden. She probably
saw a few legendary stories at most. This meeting might be because she
saw some possibilities in my stories.

Aileen continued calmly, "First, I need to know that you are a trustworthy
person."

"I will make an Oath of Existence."

"The things we talk about here can't leak out."

We made an Oath of Existence with our hands facing each other. It was an
oath made on their souls. The person who broke this oat would die from
their soul burning up. I had previously made this oath with Yoo Joonghyuk.
I opened my mouth, "I don't want you to talk about my identity."

"I'm aware of that. Don't worry. All council members who participated in
the repair share the oath."

Aileen let out a small sigh and then opened her mouth like she was
whispering. "Our civil council has been waiting for an opportunity to
destroy the Factory."

The Factory was the core of the industrial complex and the backbone of its
power. Trying to destroy this place was an obvious goal.

I had read it in Ways of Survival but I decided to ask. There was no way to
read Ways of Survival immediately so it was important to get the
information directly.

Aileen asked, "Are you going to drive out the nobles?"

"Yes."

"You are a returnee. Why bother interfering with the ecology of the Demon
Realm?"

"I'm not a returnee."

In a sense, there was no word more accurate.

"I see."

Not all returnee completed the dimensional movement scenario and
returned to their hometown. Some returnees failed the scenario and some
hated their homes. Those who gave up returning to their homes had to make
a new home. No matter how terrible a place was, they chose to live there.

"There have been several attempts to kill the duke," Aileen told him.

"It looks like they failed if he is still alive."
"…It wasn't a bad plan. Until they all failed. Some of them were masters
from the First Murim and others were the strongest people on their planet."

"How did you get those people?"

"It was a similar situation to you. They failed or were expelled from their
home scenario."

It was a fact I already knew. This was the reason why Aileen treated the
'exiles'. It was a means of collecting stronger citizens to fight against the
ruler of the Syswitz Industrial Complex. She used the attribute Story Expert
in this form.

Aileen shook her head with a slightly weary expression. "Most of them
couldn't even make it through the escorts, let alone reach the duke."

"Are there many escorts?"

"In the Factory, there are hundreds of barons and lower ranked nobles.
There are 10 earls and two marquis."

The many escorts were a problem.

A lower-grade noble was still more powerful than average incarnations. In
addition, all those earl level or above could operate the power of the story.
The biggest problem was that the duke would be stronger than the sum of
all the escorts. I replied like it was inconsequential.

"It is worth a try."

"The other exiles said that as well."

"I'm stronger than they are."

Yoo Joonghyuk would say this and I was currently Yoo Joonghyuk.
However, Aileen didn't know who Yoo Joonghyuk was.
"If you were really strong, you wouldn't have failed the scenario."

There was no way to refute it right now. The situation was too complicated
to explain right now. Even so, Aileen still had some expectations towards
me. "First of all, I'd like you to prove your skills."

"Something like this?"

I released the straps on me like I had been waiting. The straps broke with a
loud sound. Aileen seemed surprised but didn't panic. "…The other exiles
did that as well. I have to make sure you can deal with the nobles."

"What do you want?"

"A suitable opponent has visited Syswitz."

"You are talking about the envoy from the Gilobat Industrial Complex?"

"Yes."

I laughed. "I can see what you are thinking."

Aileen nodded. "I'm sorry but this is the only way."

The 73rd Demon Realm was currently in a confused state due to the
rumours of the demon king. The meeting between the Syswitz Industrial
Complex and Gilobat Industrial Complex was designed to calm the chaos.

"The most dangerous enemy is always the closest ally."

If I could take advantage of the opportunity to ruin the alliance, it was
possible to divide the Syswitz Industrial Complex.

Aileen was looking at the long-term and didn't want to miss this chance.
Even if it failed, there wouldn't be significant damage.
However, I didn't intend to be exploited. "Let's make a deal first."

"Okay. What are your conditions?"

"Please repair my body every time I ask. Of course, it is for free."

I had to constantly consume story fragments until my physical body became
stronger. I didn't know when a collision between stories would occur. For
the time being, I needed Aileen's help.

"That is nothing if you succeed. That's all?"

"There is one more thing." In fact, this was the main point. "Give me a
'scenario'."

"…Scenario?"

This was the reason why I visited the Syswitz Industrial Complex in the
first place.

"I need your revolutionary scenario."




The Demon Realm was an area that wasn't popular with constellations since
ancient times.

It was due to the bad relationship between the constellations and demon
kings. In the first place, most incarnations who entered the Demon Realm
were 'losers'.

I left the operating room and the first place I saw was the pub where the
citizens gathered.

"Shit, this alcohol tastes sour."
The sighs of the citizens came from all over the place. It was late in the
evening.

The workers and incarnations who came back from working all day at the
Factory gathered over drinks. Their faces were distorted from the bitter
aftertaste. The alcohol of the Demon Realm was more bitter than Earth. I
remembered reading about it in Ways of Survival.

「 Kim Dokja thought: Who among them is the revolutionary? 」

In the Demon Realm, the scenarios still progressed. The Star Stream didn't
neglect the story of any area. In particular, one of the main scenarios here,
the 'Revolutionary Scenario' was a scenario that the dukes of the Demon
Realm were also watching.

–I don't know how you know about that scenario but it is hard for me to
help you right away. I don't know who the 'revolutionary' are. Without the
identity of the revolutionary, it isn't possible to transfer the scenario.

–Do you have no information at all?

–Even if I receive information, the revolutionary will change every month.
Honestly, who would confess to being a revolutionary? It is unknown who
is a spy…

These were Aileen's words. Still, if my prediction was correct, the
revolutionary was definitely among them.

「 The Revolutionary scenario is the main scenario of the Demon Realm.
The scenario number is different every time but those who welcome the
scenario event are fixed. They are the ruling classes of the Demon Realm.
」

I felt fortunate to have the Fourth Wall at this time. I might not have the
Ways of Survival txt but it would remind me of my memories.
–The citizens here remember what happened to the last person who
declared himself a revolutionary. That's why you shouldn't poke around
people. Everyone will be nervous.

Aileen told me this but I couldn't wait. My body was repaired and I could
hold out against the exile penalty, but this was only for a few days.

「 Kim Dokja thought: I have to get the Revolutionary scenario so I can go
back to the original scenario. 」

At this moment, a strange voice entered my ears.

"Excuse me, this is the first time I'm seeing your face."
     Chapter 198: Ep. 37 - Landscape of the Demon Realm, V


I turned around and saw the owner of the pub staring at me with curious
eyes. I replied as naturally as possible. "I just entered yesterday."

"It is good to see you. Life in the industrial complex is hard but our hearts
are good. I don't know where you're from but this isn't a bad place to settle
down. Care for a drink?"

"No, I don't like to drink."

"Huhu, going to this place when you don't know how to drink. You are an
unfortunate friend."

I heard this and was reminded of when I first joined Mino Soft." Han
Myungoh said something similar when I first told him I couldn't drink
alcohol at the restaurant.
Come to think of it, where was Han Myungoh now? He received the curse
of Demon King Asmodeus and there was no way to confirm his life or
death… I somehow felt down as I remembered those tiring days.

"I don't like drinking but I like the appetizers served with alcohol. Do you
mind if I order side dishes?"

"Of course. We have deep fried demon's claws, fried demon tripe and…"

I smiled. "Stop making fun of me."

"Haha, busted."

"Give me the best you have. How much?"

"Five coins only."

It was an insanely low price. It was a price that the small constellation of
Peace Land could afford. I thought for a bit before asking, "If I pay double,
can you make it doubly delicious?"

"Hahah, I can make it triply delicious."

I handed over 50 coins without speaking and the owner's eyes widened.

"…10 times is a bit tough but I'll try."

Unlike what he said, the owner seemed to be a skillful chef because a
pleasant smell was coming from him. My expectations were slightly
inflated as I anticipated appeasing my hunger. I couldn't help it when
thinking it was time to eat real food.

I ignored my stomach for a moment and sighed. I had been working so hard
that it wouldn't be hard to have a rest.

"How great. Is that the place called Earth?"
A bunch of incarnations were looking at the screen hanging from the top of
the pub.

It was a video recording from a dokkaebi's channel. It was a familiar scene
and then a familiar voice started to flow out.

–Ahjussi!

It was a scene from the Seoul Dome scenario. It was a record of the tenth
scenario, the 73rd Demon King. I heard Shin Yoosung's voice coming from
the screen and a corner of my heart was pained.

I raised the collar of my coat so it half covered my face and watched the
video.

"The scenario impact is awesome. Isn't it as rumoured?"

"Don't you think it is the most popular scenario area lately?"

"The incarnations in that neighbourhood must be very prosperous!"

Almost all the mass media in the Demon Realm were under the control of
the wenny people.

The wenny people couldn't open channels directly like the dokkaebi so they
couldn't earn income through donations. Instead, they stole the recording
material and distributed them all over the world.

"Shit, I don't think the degree of difficulty is that high. I can also do that
much!"

"Stop speaking nonsense. If you were there, you couldn't even make it to
the fifth scenario."

"Uhuh, no?"
They watched the screen and the 73rd Demon King scenario started to
gradually change.

–Uriel, you know. This is just a story.

It felt really strange to see my lines flowing from the screen.

–You must've seen many people die in the meantime.

It was the moment when Uriel was very sad…

I looked around and saw that some incarnations were in tears.

Anger, despair or sighs.

"Shit, it's so sad…"

…It was a strange feeling. It wasn't their scenario but they sympathized
with the stories I had experienced. Their faces looked like they received
comfort.

Maybe it wasn't just the constellations who needed stories. The stories were
necessary for everyone.

"…Will we be able to do that if we return to our home scenario?"

"Rampert, do you want to go back?"

"If I can go but I can't."

"Kulkul, just ask the wenny man. He will send you at any time."

"…Is that a joke? I don't want to become a disaster for my home."

Disaster. At this point, the air inside the pub became tense. However, it was
only for a moment. Everyone was reluctant to talk about this topic and
quickly changed it.
"Here it is. Side dishes that are 10 times more delicious."

I smiled slightly and accepted the side dishes. It was simple fried chips and
noodles. I could tell they were tasty dishes without tasting them due to the
savoury smell.

I grabbed the plates and looked around. I could see a small head focused on
the screen, just like everyone else. He didn't know I was near and was close
to tears.

I clicked my tongue and sat down beside him. "Why, do you miss it?"
"Hiik!" His surprised appearance was very cute. He was exactly as I
imagined. I pressed on Jang Hayoung's shoulder as he tried to slip away.

"Don't be so wary. I just want to eat together."

Jang Hayoung stared at me doubtfully and obediently sat back down. He
judged that I couldn't hurt him because there were many incarnations
around. Jang Hayoung hesitated before opening his mouth first.

"Is your talk with Aileen over?"

"Yes."

"What did you talk about?"

"You don't need to know."

"…By the way, is that special cuisine?"

"Eat if you want."

Jang Hayoung moved his fork like he had been waiting. The noddles
disappeared into Jang Hayoung's mouth. Come to think of it, this guy had
the Shameless skill.

"Well, it is worth eating."
Jang Hayoung ate more than half my head in a flash.

"…By the way, are you from Earth?"

"Yes."

My face never appeared properly on the screen. It was as if someone
deliberately touched the screen. My face distorted like it was hit.

That jerk Bihyung, why did he edit my face like that? In any case, it seemed
that Jang Hayoung didn't recognize me.

"…How was it?"

"It was awful."

Jang Hayoung nodded, understanding everything with these words alone. A
tragic investigation wasn't necessary for those who had experienced the
scenario.

"Are you on the screen right now?"

"I will come out."

"Where?"

"I'm coming now."

The screen zoomed in on the handsome face of Yoo Joonghyuk.
Fortunately, my coat was dirty enough to look similar to his black coat. He
might really believe it if I insisted moderately…

However, Jang Hayoung's expression wasn't very good.

"There is no resemblance…"

"That is me."
"No. You are like dough made by anyone while a god was carving him for
a thousand days…"

"I am an exile. The stories on my face have crumbled."

"No matter how many stories you lose… your lie should make sense."

…Damn. I felt bad but I still needed to achieve my purpose. Yes, I'm not
him. Still, doesn't he look cool?"

"Yes."

"He also fights unbelievably well."

"Really?"

"I'll let you meet him when we go to Earth. I'm very familiar with him."

My words caused Jang Hayoung's eyes to shake. Perhaps Jang Hayoung
would have no choice but to cross over. In Ways of Survival, Jang Hayoung
was a person who admired Yoo Joonghyuk. If I persuaded this guy in
advance and encouraged his will to return…

"Why would I want to meet him?"

"Eh? No, just…"

"Rather, I'm more interested in that."

"Who?"

"Over there."

On the screen, I saw a figure surrounded by dark demonic energy. A man
was staring at his companions with sad eyes. His face wasn't completely
visible but I was well aware of who it was. It was me.
I stared at Jang Hayoung's sparkling eyes and wondered what this was all
about.

"You can't even see his face?"

"Why does that matter?"

I was feeling confused when shouts suddenly came from various parts of
the pub.

"Waaahhhh!"

"No! Open your eyes, Demon King of Salvation!"

"Damn! My tears won't stop!"

[Your reputation is strengthened in the 73rd Demon Realm.]

[1,500 coins have been acquired.]

No, I was this popular? I suddenly regretted doing the Yoo Joonghyuk
cosplay. Now I couldn't say that person was actually me.

–Let's meet again, Yoo Joonghyuk.

Finally, the scenario reached the end and people started to cry. Some people
were so moved that they couldn't get out of these feelings.

Jang Hayoung muttered with an ecstatic expression, "Ah, too bad he
already has a girlfriend."

My heart sank. "What? Who?"

"The Demon King of Salvation. Do you happen to know him?"

"I know him but…" I frowned as I looked into Jang Hayoung's beautiful
eyes. Clear eyes and white cheeks. A beautiful cream-coloured face.
However…

"Aren't you a man?"

If I remembered correctly, Jang Hayoung was a man. The damn writer of
Ways of Survival accepted all my comments and changed just one thing. It
was this guy's gender.

Jang Hayoung raised his eyebrows and frowned. "Earth is the only place
that judges by the cover."

I was about to respond when the pub owner suddenly turned off the lights.
Then he declared to the whole pub in a very low voice, "Night is coming."

At these words, a deep silence spread through the pub. It was a silent that
was much more sensitive and sharper than when the word 'disaster'
emerged. Jang Hayoung faced me and brought a finger to his lips.

"Shhh."

Looking closer, it wasn't only this pub. Other pubs and stores on the street
had closed their doors and turned off the lights. Suddenly, all sounds
disappeared.

It was as if all of the industrial complex was submerged deep in the ocean.
In the streets where every person had disappeared, the dreary sound of
flutes was heard. Some citizens blocked their ears in order to avoid hearing
it.

At this moment, I was reminded of something.

「 There is a special 'Night' in the Demon Realm. 」

I listened to the Fourth Wall and recalled the setting of Ways of Survival.
「 All citizens of the industrial complex are afraid of the nobles. It isn't
simply because the nobles are strong. It is due to this 'Night' that comes one
every three days. 」

"Please just pass by. Please…"

Someone muttered. How long had it been? I could hear the window
freezing as something passed through the street.

Every citizen held their breaths and pretended they were invisible. There
were those who lowered themselves and stared down at the table. The
shadow of a giant scythe passed over the frozen window.

「 At Night, the executioner appears in the industrial complex. 」

「 If the citizens have the revolutionary, the nobles have the executioner.
」

They were the source of the citizens' fear and the inability to resist the
nobles, as well as the reason why the dukes could maintain their position in
the industrial complex.

It was due to the existence of the Executioner. The moment the door of the
pub opened, people tightly closed their eyes. A scratchy voice came from
the deep darkness.

[Who is the revo lu tion ary?]

The appearance reminded me of a reaper and it was twice the size of an
adult male. I couldn't see his face because of the black cape but I could
sense his power from the eerier aura that flowed from him.

[The target is under the protection of the current scenario.]

[The target is currently invincible.]
No existence could resist the Execution during the Night of the industrial
complex.

The owner who gave me food and who those who watched the scenario
were looking down at the floor with tired expressions.

Today the Executioner chose this pub as his place of execution. In this
place, someone would surely die.

[Who is the revo lu tion ary?]

Every time the executioner's scythe slammed into the ground, people curled
up. It was like a play. I stared carefully and the surprised Jang Hayoung
pulled at my collar.

"Don't make eye contact."

At the small sound, the Executioner looked this way.

"Shit…"

To be exact, it was at the cursing Jang Hayoung. Jang Hayoung started to
shake as he stared at the approaching Executioner. His intuition told him
that he was facing his death.

I touched the completely frightened Jang Hayoung's head and stood up
slowly. Jang Hayoung's mouth dropped open with surprise and the
Executioner stared at me with ominous eyes.

「 Kim Dokja thought: What would Yoo Joonghyuk do? 」

If he was here, he would've never exposed himself. Yoo Joonghyuk
would've hid himself until he found a situation where he could benefit the
most.
He would've completed all types of investigations in order to participate in
the industrial complex's scenario and figured out who the revolutionary
was.

「 Kim Dokja thought: That's why he regressed hundreds of times. 」

The Executioner aimed his scythe at me and spoke in a creepy voice.

[Who are you?]

The moment that everyone in the pub focused on me, I opened my mouth
and spoke in a voice they could all hear.

"I am a revolutionary."
            Chapter 199: Ep. 38 - Fake Revolutionary, I


[Someone has made a 'Revolutionary Declaration'.]

Among the many scenarios in the Demon Realm, the status of the
Revolutionary scenario was large. The only existence that could threaten
the dukes sitting at the highest points of the industrial complex.

A revolutionary. This existence was the hope and legend of the citizens. At
the same time, it was also despair.

That's why the moment I spoke, countless people around me held their
breaths. Their faces wondered if they had heard correctly.

"Why are you so startled? Weren't you looking for the revolutionary?"

My shameless words caused the confusion on people's faces to become
consternation. At the same time, there was a message that only I could hear.

[You aren't a 'revolutionary'.]
It was an obvious message. Right now, I was an exile who was outside the
scenario. I couldn't be the 'revolutionary', who was the backbone of the
main scenario of the Demon Realm, when I didn't even have a scenario in
the first place. It was originally supposed to be like this.

[Your declaration has affected the main scenario of the Syswitz Industrial
Complex.]

As you know, the most important thing in the Star Stream was the
'probability'.

[A re volu tion ary?]

The thick chains covering the scythe were revealed. The executioner took
one step forward and I couldn't help feeling nervous.

Honestly, I currently had no way of killing the executioner. Nevertheless,
I didn't back down. I had to do it here. "Yes, I am a revolutionary."

[Why did you re veal your self?]

"If I stay back, someone else will die."

Jang Hayoung and the other citizens were staring at me with wide open
mouths. I waited nervously as I watched the incoming executioner.

…It was time for the effect to appear.

[Many citizens admire your courage.]

That's it.

[Your noble courage affects the development of the scenario.]

[You have caused a big influence on the scenario.]

[The scenario will temporarily assign you a status.]
[You have become a 'self-proclaimed revolutionary.]

[If an existing revolutionary dies, you will be given the position.]

This was a stepping stone for me to enter the scenario.

[The hidden scenario 'Self-Proclaimed Revolutionary' has been acquired!]

It was the first time that a scenario acquisition message was so welcome. It
might be a hidden scenario and not a main scenario, but it was sufficient for
the moment.

The hidden scenario of the 73rd Demon Realm. It was a secret I wouldn't
have known if it wasn't for Yoo Joonghyuk's countless failures.

"You! Wait! Are you really a revolutionary?"

"Hey!"

The people were unable to control their fear and cried out. However, the
timing wasn't good. Finally, the executioner started to move. Black smoke
emerged from the executioner's mouth and wound itself around my body.

[The Syswitz Executioner has placed a mark of death on you.]

[You have been identified as the scapegoat of the Night.]

People saw the mark appear around me and shouted, "Get out of the way!"

"Waaaaahhhhh!"

The fragments of the broken table scattered in the air and the scythe of the
executioner cut the space in front of it. I dodged the scythe by a hair's
breadth. It would've been difficult to avoid if my body wasn't repaired but
now the story was different.

[The exile penalty is slightly alleviated.]
There was a warmth in every breath that I let out. There was a mild aura
around my body and the chill was gone.

I dodged a series of moves from the executioner. Indeed, the difference
between having a scenario and not having a scenario was great. It might be
a hidden scenario but the presence of a story changed the liveliness of my
existence.

[Revo lution ary?]

The executioner was a bit surprised by my movements and his momentum
changed.

[The space has temporarily been closed.]

[You can't escape from the pub.]

I smiled bitterly. This was why numerous powerful people couldn't resist
the executioner. There was no way to escape from the executioner in the
industrial complex.

Was that all?

"Dodge you idiot!" As Jang Hayoung shouted, energy was fired from the
executioner's scythe.

「 No citizen of the industrial complex can resist the Executioner. 」

[The execution will take place.]

His special skill Execution ignored the defense of the opponent and death a
fatal blow. No matter how strong the citizens, they could never endure one
blow from the executioner's scythe.

The executioner's scythe was just about to cut through my body. In my
hand, Blade of Faith cried out violently.
"I'm sorry but I'm not a citizen."

Magic power emerged from the heart of the gold dragon and the Purest
Sword Force wrapped around my fingertips.

"I told you. I am a revolutionary."

Well, I was still a 'self-proclaimed' one. The dazzling white-blue energy
collided with the executioner's scythe and tremendous sparks occurred. In
the midst of these gorgeous effects, a message was heard.

[You aren't a main scenario participant.]

[You aren't a citizen.]

[You are an exile.]

[You are affected by the 'Execution' effect of the scenario.]

As expected, I knew it.

[The effect of 'Execution' is neutralized.]

The moment I blocked the blow from the scythe, the surrounding
incarnations shouted, "H-He blocked a blow from the executioner!"

"Is he really a revolutionary?"

Those who didn't know my identity were watching the situation with eyes
full of distrust.

[Your scenario contribution has increased.]

The executioner misunderstood me and energy burst from his body.

[In so lent…!]
I talked as if to provoke him. "Don't play around. I know you are only
strong at Night."

[What?]

"Once this Night is over, you will surely die." I spoke while twisted
Unbroken Faith in my hand. "I will surely kill you."

The scythe flooded towards me dozens of times. The executioner wasn't
weak just because Execution didn't work. It would just take him a longer
time to dispose of me.

Thus, it was too early to say that the situation was better.

"I can't protect everyone so leave here!"

Everyone other than me could escape this place because they didn't receive
the effect of the 'mark'. Among those running out of the pub, I saw Jang
Hayoung turning to look back at me.

I quickly glanced at him before using Bookmark.

"Selecting the fourth bookmark, 'Lycaon Isparang'."

[The exclusive skill 'Way of the Wind Lv. 10 (+1) is activated!]

It would be easier to win if I used the fifth bookmark, Kyrgios, but winning
this fight wasn't my goal in the first place. No, I couldn't win.

[The target isn't affected by your attack.]

[No one can kill the Executioner until the Night is over.]

My blade slashed at his collar but this was the only message I received in
return. His execution didn't affect me but my attacks couldn't hurt him
while it was Night.
I had to change the plan. The surrounding pub area was ruined and the
power of the wind started to surge. The dozens of scythe shadows flying
through the air became stuck as the wind blew.

On the other hand, my movements became more active. The balance of
speed was breaking. His movements were always slower than me and I was
always one step faster than him.

This was the essence of Way of the Wind that had reached its limit. It was a
force that controlled all acceleration in the space.

"You are slow like a slug?"

[Ku a a a ah.]

The scythe of the angry executioner started to randomly move through the
air. Normally I wouldn't be hit by such attacks.

However, the goddess of luck from Olympus laughed at me and one scythe
accidentally entered the range.

"Ick!"

The moment the unexpected blow was about to strike me in the side, my
right arm suddenly twisted into a strange shape and I blocked it.

[The talent of the sword master that sits in your right arm is shining!]

I was surprised as well. I didn't think the fragments of the story worked in
this way.

[The user of the incomplete story has made your body's status unstable.]

[Your stories might be at risk if you continue fighting excessively.]
I bit my lips. The coldness was once again coming back. I had acquired a
hidden scenario but I couldn't use excessive force to deal with the
executioner.

I shouldn't continue fighting against it. I had to buy time while avoiding it
as much as possible. At least until this damn Night was over.

[You will di e.]

I didn't respond and kept using Way of the Wind. It would've been nice if
Yoo Joonghyuk was here. If I had the help of a transcendent then I could
easily endure this long Night.

However, no one was here.

Judge of Destruction Jung Heewon.

Steel Sword Lee Hyunsung.

Maritime Admiral Lee Jihye.

My lovely kids, Lee Gilyoung and Shin Yoosung.

Han Sooyoung… well, she wouldn't have helped if she was here.

Here, I was alone. I believed in the information I knew and the stories I had
built up. Myself as well.

There were screams from the nervous people as the executioner's
movements started to become slightly dull. I started mocking him. "What,
are you tired?"

I knew an invincible person like this would never feel exhaustion. It was
more annoyance than exhaustion. My words were actually to hide my
condition.

[Bookmark's duration is about to expire.]
The time that I could use Way of the Wind was 30 minutes at most. In the
first place, Bookmark wasn't a skill that could last a long time.

By the way, the executioner was laughing. There was a creepy sound effect
and dozens of executioners appeared. The most terrible thing about the
Night was that there wasn't one executioner. All executioners in the Syswitz
Industrial Complex gathered in this small pub and stared at me.

[Your mis take.]

He deliberately consumed time while collecting his colleagues. It was to
definitely kill me during this Night.

I watched the movements of the executioners surrounding me and modified
my posture.

This was unavoidable. It was impossible to run away from them even if I
used Way of the Wind.

"No, you are the one who made a mistake."

However, 30 minutes was enough to achieve my goal. I watched the
incoming scythes and opened my arms.

Numerous scythes broke through the air towards my body. Some
incarnations closed their eyes and sighed bitterly. This soon turned to cries
of surprise.

The scythes that should've surely pierced me and torn me apart. The scythes
stopped in the air.

[Wh at?]

The confused executioners looked at the weapons in the air with stupid
eyes. I suddenly recalled a sentence from Ways of Survival.
「 There are two ways to withstand Night in the industrial complex. 」

「 One is to run away from the executioners until the end of the Night. 」

「 And the other one… 」

"Have you forgotten? There isn't only the evolutionary and executioner in
this scenario."

This was followed by a message in my ears.

[Someone is using their vitality to protect you.]

「The second way to survive the Night is with the help of the Guardian. 」
As expected. I thought this would lead to the hidden 'guardian' coming out.
Aileen said that even the council members didn't know who the
revolutionary was.

This meant that other incarnations didn't know the identity of the
revolutionary. In other words, they couldn't protect the revolutionary when
they didn't know the revolutionary.

Yet what if I declared myself the revolutionary?

[The guardian was successful and the mark of death has been released!]

The executioner could only use the mark of death once in one night. The
mark had been released so today's execution was over.

The executioner spoke in a bloodthirsty voice. […Your luck is go od.]

"You better be careful. Next time we meet, it will be daytime."

The executioners gritted their teeth and scattered one by one. The dreary
sound of the flutes disappeared and the darkness went out like a tide.
Outside the pub, the incarnations were staring inside with passionate eyes.
The arrogant Jang Hayoung was glancing this way with shocked eyes. I
wondered if I should say something before eventually shrugging and
waving my hand.

"N-New revolutionary! A new revolutionary has appeared!"

Along with the citizens' shouts, the short Night was finally over. I looked at
the citizens and had a thought.

One of them would be a 'guardian'. The future scenarios must be performed
with the guardian.

I looked up at the sky and it was still dark. I sometimes saw a few stars but
they were so dim I couldn't see them properly.

Uriel, the Great Sage, Heaven's Equal…

It would've been nice if those guys were watching but unfortunately, there
was no message. Still, I should be satisfied with today.

[No one died tonight.]
