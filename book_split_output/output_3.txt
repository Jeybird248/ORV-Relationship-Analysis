100: Ep. 20 – Disaster of Floods, III


There were bright lights in the sky that shot all over Seoul.

Some lights went to the north while some went to the west. However, the
width of the scattering wasn't large. Most of the lights were gathered in
central Seoul. It was evidence of where the incarnations were gathering to
prepare for the scenario.

"Finally a contract! I will also have a contract!" The incarnations waiting in
the area cried out enthusiastically.

I wasn't the only incarnation who survived this far without a sponsor. Soon
little stars emerged over the heads of the incarnations without a contract.
The number of stars represented the number of constellations who wanted
the incarnation.

[Sponsor Selection]

–Please select your sponsor
–Your chosen sponsor will be your strong supporter.

Perhaps by now, all the unsigned incarnations would be seeing the same
thing I was. Of course, mine was probably a bit different.

  1.       Prisoner of the Golden Headband.

  2.       Abyssal Black Flame Dragon

  3.       Secretive Plotter

As expected, there was the Prisoner of the Golden Headband and the
Secretive Plotter. I felt sorry to keep rejecting them but it couldn't be
helped.

…This Abyssal Black Flame Dragon was here again. He had Han
Sooyoung so why did he keep coming to me?

  4.       Seo Ae Il Pil

  5.       Bald General of Justice

  6.       King Heungmu the Great.

The great people of the Korean Peninsula also lined up. Seo Ae Il Pil was
probably Ryu Seongryong…

Ah, our Samyeongdang also came. In addition, there was the fox Kim
Yushin. Did he think I would really choose him?

The list continued.

   21.     Goryeo's First Sword

   22.     God of Wine and Ecstasy
Anyone who was called Korea's best swordsman could be Goryeo's First
Sword. Then there was Dionysus… Olympus had also stepped into the race
for Kim Dokja. I felt a bit confused as the list continued. It was because
unexpected constellations kept appearing.

    48.    Black Light of Guidance

    49.    Scribe of Heaven

    50.    Ruler of Revenge and the Apocalypse

I didn't remember all the modifiers so I only had dim memories of Black
Light of Guidance and Ruler of Revenge and the Apocalypse.

However, I was certain about Scribe of Heaven. That guy, he was a
powerful constellation of the absolute good system. The archangel
Metatron. Based on angelic authority, this guy was ranked much higher
than Uriel. This was the second heavenly being. Dammit, what type of
constellations were watching me?

…

The hundreds of stars above my head formed a magnificent spectacle. It
was a brilliance that seemed like it would light up all darkness near it. Some
incarnations stared this way with soulless expressions.

"That…"

"What is that person?"

Shin Yoosung stared above my head in a blank manner and muttered,
"Ahjussi, you are like a Christmas tree."

[Constellations who love the Korean Peninsula want you to keep your
promise.]

[A number of constellations want to see your faith.]
In the end, it came. I take a deep breath and called to Bihyung.

'Bihyung'.

[What?]

'How many are there now?'

I had made a promise to the constellations when fighting off Dokgak. If the
number of subscribers to the channel reached 10,000 before the Sponsor
Selection ended, I would choose a sponsor.

[9,812. No, 14… 16.]

The number of constellations continued to rise. Bihyung's tone became
tense.

[There are three minutes left to complete the Sponsor Selection.]

Now the result would be determined in three minutes.

[The constellation 'Bald General of Justice' is looking nervously at you.]

Unfortunately, there was no point looking at me desperately.

[There are two minutes left to complete the Sponsor Selection.]

[The constellation 'Bald General of Justice' has sponsored you 200 coins.]

[The constellation 'Seo Ae Il Pil' has sponsored you 300 coins.]

[The constellation King Heungmu the Great' has sponsored you 300 coins.]

The sponsorship competition was finally starting. It was a natural choice for
the constellations if they wanted to stand out.
[Some great constellations above narrative-grade constellations are clicking
their tongues.]

[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' has sponsored you
5,000 coins.]

This was the exact development I hoped for. Good, good. Give me more
money.

[The constellation 'Scribe of Heaven' has sponsored you 30,000 coins.]
…As expected of Metatron. It was an entirely different class. It should be
obvious since he was a chancellor of heaven.

[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' is looking at the
constellation 'Scribe of Heaven'.]

[There is one minute left to complete the Sponsor Selection.]

I asked Bihyung. 'How many now?'

[9,973… 76, 77.]

It had finally reached a breathtaking level.

[9,981… 84.]

30 seconds left.

[9,993.]

20 seconds.

[9,998.]

[A few constellations are holding their breaths.]

10 seconds.
[9,999…]

5 seconds, 4 seconds, 3 seconds…

[The Sponsor Selection has ended.]

Then I let out a light sigh. I gazed at Bihyung who opened his mouth with a
smile.

[I'm really sorry everyone.]

[Many constellations think it is ridiculous!]

There was no use in yelling.

[Current number of subscribers: 9,999]

The screen that floated next to Bihyung showed reality. Some incarnations
saw it and their mouths dropped open. Shin Yoosung asked, "Ahjussi, are
you a star on Youtube?"

Maybe it was similar. I spoke in a shameless voice towards the sky. "It is
too bad. I would've selected a sponsor if there were 10,000 constellations."

[Many constellations wonder who you would've chosen.]

Then Bihyung intervened.

[This information can't be revealed to protect the privacy of the

incarnation.] Well done Bihyung.

[A number of constellations are rioting!]

The sky above Yongsan-gu distorted and lightning started to fall towards
the innocent people. Sparks filled the air. The dokkaebi's power to influence
probability could also block the constellations' wrath.
[Now now, all constellations. Please calm down. Unfortunately, the
event had to be cancelled because we are lacking one person…] Then
Bihyung glanced at me and continued. [As an apology, I will create a
compensation event.] The lightning temporarily stopped.

[Perhaps you are thinking this? Shit, what should I do if it continues like
this?]

[Many constellations are listening to the dokkaebi Bihyung's words.]

[I understand your thoughts. So! I will punish the incarnation who didn't
choose anyone in the second Sponsor Selection! However, I will only do
this if the constellations are in favour of it…]

[Many constellations are in favour of the dokkaebi Bihyung's words.]

Bihyung nodded with satisfaction. Shin Yoosung stared at me with
a dumbfounded expression. "What is happening?" "Don't be upset
by the events unfolding."

"Ahjussi, why didn't you choose a sponsor?"

"Well, it isn't time yet."

Honestly, I was a bit shaken when I saw Metatron but if I chose someone
here, everything I had done would be in vain. I couldn't enter under anyone
else. This was the only way.

"Yoo Sangah-ssi. Take the kids and hide."

"…Do you have an idea?"

"Of course. Never come out unless I signal to you."
[A new bounty scenario has arrived!]

[You have become the target of the bounty scenario.]

As expected, the bounty scenario began.


  [Bounty Scenario – Punishment]

  Category: Bounty

  Difficulty: A



  Clear Conditions: Brutally kill the incarnation Kim Dokja. The more
  brutal his death, the more coins you can receive.

  Time Limit: 20 minutes.

  Compensation: 40,000 ~ ????? coins.

  Failure: ―


Anyone who saw it would think I was the fifth disaster. It was 40,000 coins
to kill one person. Shin Yoosung paled when she received the scenario. "…
Ahjussi?"

Yoo Sangah grabbed Shin Yoosung who was reaching for me and retreated.
At almost the same time, the incarnations in the area discovered me and
started to flock. There was the 'target' mark floating above my head.

"Crazy! 40,000 coins?"

"Hey, get that fucker!"
[Many constellations are enjoying the development of the scenario.]

The constellations angry at my choice loved the way I was being chased
like a rodent. Everybody had forgotten about the '10,000 event'. Yes, this
was the nature of constellations.

Bihyung glanced at me and communicated with a nasty expression.

–I didn't realize it would turn out like this.

'I knew. I used to do this when working at the game company'.

The only way to appease angry users was to open a new event. Bihyung
shivered and murmured.

–Is this okay? If it is noticed… I really will receive a Probability
Conformity Request this time.

In fact, it was an obvious channel manipulation that the number of
subscribers didn't break through 9,999.

It was because from the beginning, Bihyung's #BI-7623 channel only
accommodated 9,999 viewers.

I wouldn't be able to escape if someone like Dokgak provoked a fight.
Fortunately, there was no one like that present. The low grade dokkaebis
had been on guard since the last incident.

'I decided to take the chance'.

It was still a dangerous method. There was no doubt that some smart
constellations would doubt this. The number stopped exactly at 9,999. This
defied coincidence. Thus, an event to shift the attention of the constellations
was needed.

The constellations hated annoying things and were vulnerable to fun. I used
the current Punishment event to take advantage of that.
Bihyung opened his mouth and spoke to everyone.

[Constellations, please note that the incarnation Kim Dokja can receive a
penalty if coins are sponsored.]

The moment he spoke, my body suddenly became heavy.

[A selfish constellations has given you a speed penalty.]

[500 coins have been sponsored.]

The more coins I received, the more penalties that would be inflicted on
me. The incarnations, who normally never would've been able to follow
me, were right on my tail.

"Everyone seems blinded by the coins. Right?"

I smiled and wielded Blade of Faith.

"Uwaaah!"


[A constellation who wants your misfortune has given you an attack
penalty.]

[500 coins have been sponsored.]

My attack power was halved and the incarnations didn't die. I was actually
glad about this. I didn't want to kill them,

[A constellation who wants your death has given you an defense penalty.]

[500 coins have been sponsored.]

The fucking sponsorship. A dagger flew from somewhere and hit my arm,
causing terrible pan. My arm would've been cut off if it wasn't for the
Infinite Dimension Space Coat.
[A few constellations feel sorry for your adversity.]

There were also constellations who supported me. Thank you for your tears.
I grabbed my injured arm and ran to the southwest of Yongsan-gu.

If I was right, the meteorite where the Disaster of Floods slept was in that
direction. The energy of the meteorite showed it was close to hatching.

[Bihyung. What the hell is this?]

[What's the matter? It is simple entertainment before we enter the game.]

Another dokkaebi's voice was suddenly heard. Now Bihyung was speaking
in a strong manner.

It was a sharp contrast to my heavy body. Just a bit more…

A river finally appeared.

"Hold it!"

I barely managed to escape from the clutches of other people and plunged
into Han River. The other incarnations knew what was in Han River and
couldn't easily follow me.

"This crazy guy!"

The 7th grade ichthyosaurs swarmed like they had been waiting. They
wanted to make my feeble self their food.

[Many constellations are filled with joy.]

I had a thought as I watched the ichthyosaurs. I didn't have any talent. No
matter how hard I trained, I wouldn't become as skilled as I wanted.
However, I didn't want to use that as an excuse to say I was weak.

[The exclusive skill 'Bookmark' can now be activated.]
The way that I could become stronger was different from other people.

['Character Bookmarks' is activated.]

[Available Bookmark Slots: 4]

[Bringing up the list of available bookmarks.]

"I will release Demagogue Cheon Inho from the 3rd slot and add Beast
Tamer Shin Yoosung."

[The number three bookmark has been activated.]

A bright light surrounded my body and the smell of the monsters changed.
Some smells were friendly while some were filled with hostility. I realized
that there was a world I didn't know. After all, it was sensitivity to the
world that determined how a person read it.

[The level of the Bookmark skill is low, shortening the activation time.]

[Activation Time: 30 minutes]

[Your understanding of the character is significant. You can select some of
her skills to import.]

One of the far-off ichthyosaurs synched with me and complex circuits were
forming in my head.

[Advanced Diverse Communication Lv. 3 has been activated.]

[Taming Lv. 9 has been activated.]

Blood flowed from my nose. This was how the kids always felt. I slowly
opened my mouth, "Come, Queen Mirabad."
            Chapter 101: Ep. 20 – Disaster of Floods, IV


The ichthyosaur queen cut through the water. The grandeur of her
streamlined body filled Han River. The confused incarnations immediately
moved away from Han River.

"Uwahh, shit!"

"What is this?"

There was a feeling of solemnity as I faced her. I was facing the ruler of a
species. I once again felt how great Shin Yoosung and Lee Gilyoung were.

"Come down."

The queen's whiskers touched the water at my words. Once again, it was
unreasonable to have the same effect even with the same skill. It was
similar to when I used Lycaon's Way of the Wind. I approached her and
climbed up using the scales.
The body of the queen shook like she was rejecting my touch. This was the
limit for me. Honestly, it felt like my frontal lobe was burning from the
connection with the queen.

I left the incarnations hunting me behind and opened my mouth, "Let's go."

Then my struggle with the queen began. As if she was playing with me, the
queen swam through the water regardless of my breathing.

"Ahah!" I gasped for air, looking like a wet mouse. "This…!"

The surrounding ichthyosaurs poured towards me like they were amused.

[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' is laughing at you.]

My control was a mess but the queen was moving in the direction I wanted.
It was southwest of Yongsan-gu. It was Nodeulseom, one of the few islands
in Han River. If I remembered correctly, this island was the place with the
most potential for the Disaster of Floods to hatch.

「 The fifth disaster hatched on an artificial island in Han River. 」

Ways of Survival was a novel where the year wasn't specified.

Therefore, I didn't know exactly what year Ways of Survival was based on.
I thought it was close to the year I lived in but it had been serialized for 10
years and the technology development wasn't right. There was little
mention of modern devices in Ways of Survival and sometimes there were
no fixed geographical names used.

This situation was an example.

'An artificial island in Han River… where the hell is it?

Nonetheless, I was able to determine that it was Nodeulseom due to the
description and the size of the meteorite.
My thoughts were interrupted by the queen's sudden stop. I rolled down and
was thrown on Nodeulseom. Queen Mirabad glanced at me before
disappearing into Han River. She was a heartless jerk.

[The exclusive skill 'Bookmark' has been turned off.]

"Uweeeek."

The world turned around as I coughed out the river water. I raised my head
and the landscape of Nodeulseom spread out in front of me.

I had never been to Nodeulseom before but something felt strange. The
trees on Nodeulseom looked like they were before the world was ruined.

The ichthyosaurs disappeared and the incarnations were preparing to cross
the river. I could see some of the incarnations flying through the sky. I hid
behind a tree and held my breath as I watched them.

"Where is he? Didn't he obviously come here?"

I didn't think there would be so many people who had learnt Flight
Maneuvers. These jerks weren't regressors. Why did they adapt so fast?
Many of them landed on Nodeulseom and looked around.

"Hyung, let's look around. I don't have any confidence facing him alone."

"I agree. Did you see all the stars above his head? He is a monster."

"Hero-like traits aren't necessary when dealing with a monster."

"…Will he be as strong as the king in the west?"

It was a conversation discussing how to kill someone. I thought it was too
shameful to compare me to Yoo Joonghyuk. I wanted to hide until the end
of the time limit but someone showed up from the forest on the island.
"Ahjussis should be careful. Get off this island if you know what is good
for you."

It was a strong voice. The girl dressed in a black hoodie over her uniform
walked towards the men.

"Who are you?"

"A young person who is unafraid…"

"My armmmmm!"

"Uwaaaah!"

Her sword moved through the air and the men who had their arms cut off
screamed. One of the relatively younger incarnations shouted.

"It is her, the Duke of Loyalty and Warfare!"

"What? Why is that girl here?"

"Run! Run away!"

The incarnations hurriedly used Flight Maneuvers but their talent wasn't as
high as I thought. A couple were decent. However, the Duke of Loyalty and
Warfare wouldn't make just anyone his incarnation, even if they were a
descendant of his friend.

The girl pointed her sharp blade at me. "Ahjussi, are you going to come
out? Why are you hiding when you have the target mark on you?"

That reminded me, I still had the arrow above my head. I sighed and left the
forest with both hands raised. "Are you going to kill me?"

"I'd like to but Master will be sad." The long-haired girl, Lee Jihye put
away her sword with a laugh. Her strength had increased in the 10 days we
hadn't met.
Lee Jihye saw my injured arm and said to me. "How have you been? I don't
think you have been well."

"Then why ask? I thought you had returned to Daepong High School. Why
are you here?"

"Master picked me up a few days ago. I don't know how he found me."

Yoo Joonghyuk? I knew that Lee Jihye was a key member of Yoo
Joonghyuk's party but to go there and find her…

I looked at her physical body stats using Calm Observation. The total value
was roughly over 160. Her strength and physique seemed slightly lower but
she had reached the limit on her stats for the fifth scenario.

Moreover, Demon Slayer and Sword Training had improved further. It
seemed that all characters in Ways of Survival grew faster when they
weren't around me. Did they all have a mental block because of me? "What
about ahjussi's party? Have you meet Heewon unni?"

"The others are waiting in Yongsan-gu. I haven't met Heewon-ssi yet."

"Too bad. She wanted to see you."

Come to think of it, Jung Heewon and Lee Jihye were in similar positions. I
looked around carefully and asked, "Did you come with Yoo Joonghyuk?"

"Huh? Why does ahjussi know everything?"

At this moment, I heard a sound from the edge of Nodeulseom.
Incarnations who had been fighting the ichthyosaurs finished and
approached the island.

Some came on duck boats and some swam. Some of them came on boats or
used special skills. They looked like group tourists.
"I found him! There he is!"

I was the tour product. Lee Jihye became angry when she saw the
incarnations. "Why did you drag that bunch of trash here?"

"I brought them to catch the disaster."

Some people were preparing themselves for the disaster but not everyone.
Those who didn't belong to any groups were hiding all over Seoul, waiting
for someone to clear the main scenario. Then they would take action in the
resulting power loss.

The last disaster couldn't be broken by such a flimsy determination. If
everyone didn't fight together…

"Why did you do that? There is no point."

"Huh?"

"There won't be a disaster. Master is taking care of it." My eyes stared at
Lee Jihye with disbelief. "The last disaster won't be dangerous at all.
Instead, useless people can't enter the island… shit, they are entering."

Lee Jihye once again pulled out her sword. This was the reason why she
controlled the island. Lee Jihye wasn't the only one controlling entrance to
the island. A large person waved towards an incoming ship.

"Everyone, you aren't allowed inside here. This is a danger zone!"

"What? Who are you?"

"A lieutenant of the 6502 unit…"

"What nonsense is this?!"

A flying blade was caught in the man's hands and he stated, "…It is
dangerous to resist the authorities."
"Y-You!"

The lieutenant wore a suit reminiscent of a giant bear and had a dirty beard.

"I will take you to a safe place."

The lieutenant lifted the man with one hand and threw him to the other side
of Han River. The man flew across Han River at a great speed and landed
on the other side.

The lieutenant asked, "Is there anyone who needs guidance?"

"Crazy! A monster!"

The lieutenant facing the incarnations had tired eyes, like a mountain had
piled up on his shoulders. It was a face that looked terribly weary.

「 It is hard… .」

「 I think I will die… 」

「 Dokja-ssi, where are you? 」

"Lee Hyunsung-ssi."

At that moment, Lee Hyunsung looked at me. His expression was like he
found an oasis in the middle of a desert.

"Dokja… Dokja-ssi?" Lee Hyunsung came towards me. I instinctively took
a step back. "D-Dokja-ssi! It's me! Lee Hyunsung!"

I was about to open my mouth when another group of incarnations
disembarked.

"There he is! Catch him!"
Lee Hyunsung's expression distorted. "I… told you it is a danger zone!"

He turned around and slammed his fist into the ground.

[The character 'Lee Hyunsung' has used the stigma 'Great Mountain Smash
Lv. 5'.]

The entire island of Nodeulseom shook as the edges exploded. I was
captivated by the second scene of incarnations flying. That Yoo Joonghyuk
bastard, how did he raise a person?

I asked the delighted looking Lee Hyunsung, "Where is Yoo Joonghyuk?"

Lee Hyunsung's expression became slightly sad. "Oh, he is in the middle of
the island. That…"

"I will be right back. Then we will talk."

I ignored Lee Hyunsung's desperate gaze and ran to the center of the island.
There were many things I wanted to ask Lee Hyunsung but now wasn't the
time. I had to check something quickly.

How long did I walk through the forest? I finally saw a huge meteorite
stuck in the center of the forest. The size of the meteorite was
overwhelming compared to the other ones. The red aura on the surface
implied a sure destruction. There was a woman standing in front of the
meteorite.

"Oh, you are…?"

My expression changed at the sight of Lee Seolhwa when the person I was
looking for emerged from the rear of the meteorite.

"Yoo Joonghyuk."

Yoo Joonghyuk stood there calmly, exuding a steady presence. I asked him,
"What are you doing right now?"
"You must know because you have Future Sight."

I was speechless at the calm answer. The yellow meteorite stuck in the
middle of the huge disaster meteorite. I immediately noticed why Yoo
Joonghyuk wanted to come here quickly.

"Are you feeding the guide meteorite to the disaster?"

"The guides will only interfere later. It is better to kill them while we can
handle them."

Once again, my ominous feelings were always right. This bastard was
trying to hatch the disaster early. He was Lee Seolhwa's lover for a reason.

"No, why? Putting aside the guide, why are you trying to wake up the
disaster early? Have you finally gone crazy?"

There was slight disappointment in Yoo Joonghyuk's eyes as he replied,
"You don't seem to know a lot this time."

"What?"

"This disaster was my colleague in a past life."

Who didn't know this? Yoo Joonghyuk declared with an arrogant
expression, "That's why this disaster is safe."

…Safe? Several thoughts passed through my head.

…Joonghyuk. Yes. Sometimes he was too naive.

[The Disaster of Floods has hatched.]

I had forgotten for a while because I received his help several times. This
guy in front of me was someone who barely took a step towards the end
after dying over one hundred times.
             Chapter 102: Ep. 20 – Disaster of Floods, V


The situation became clear. This Yoo Joonghyuk believed in something he
shouldn't have.

I shouted towards Lee Seolhwa, "Lee Seolhwa! Take the kids and escape
from this island right now. The Disaster of Floods is different from the past.
We must fight her together. If we don't all fight―"

"Kim Dokja, don't disturb me if you don't want to die." Yoo Joonghyuk
came up behind me and grabbed me by the neck. All of a sudden, my body
lost strength and my knees fell to the ground.

I bit my lip and exclaimed, "Yoo Joonghyuk, listen to me! The Shin
Yoosung waking up now isn't the Shin Yoosung you know. Once you meet
her…"

I wanted to say more but my voice suddenly changed into a squeaky sound.
Dammit. I used Hit a Pressure Point to gradually relieve the energy that
Yoo Joonghyuk had released into my blood.
Now I had to subdue him…

Of course, no one in Seoul could subdue Yoo Joonghyuk. No, there was
only one. That person was coming right now.

[The Disaster of Floods is waking up.]

Along with the message, a green light emerged from the meteorite. Finally,
the hatching of the meteorite began.

I heard the voice of the intermediate dokkaebi.

[The incarnations of Seoul are really hot-tempered. Other areas aren't so
eager to wake up the disaster and are struggling to avoid the disaster…]
It was difficult for Bihyung to stall any longer.

[Do you miss your first companions? Now, prepare to face the disaster.
Your companions are waiting for you in the other world.]

[A new main scenario has arrived!]


  [Main Scenario # 5 – Disaster of Floods]

  Category: Main

  Difficulty: SS

  Clear Conditions: Kill the Disaster of Floods, Shin Yoosung.

  Time Limit: ―

  Compensation: 100,000 coins, ???

  Failure: The fall of Seoul.
The large meteorite split apart and revealed the interior that was
reminiscent of a womb. A completely nude woman was trapped inside like
a fossil.

It was a mysterious woman with pure white skin. Her beautiful hair was
tied up in a ponytail and wrapped around her body. This was the
appearance of the adult Shin Yoosung.

"A girl?"

"What is this? That is a disaster?"

Lee Jihye and Lee Hyunsung stopped while some incarnations secretly
looked at her. They seemed to feel the severe gap in power.

[The exclusive skill 'Fourth Wall' has offset your mental shock.]

The Disaster of Floods was different from other disasters. Unlike other
disasters who were weakened by the early hatching, the Disaster of Floods
had no such thing. The Disaster of Floods was stronger the earlier she woke
up.

The moment that Shin Yoosung opened her eyes, white fur grew all over
her body. The white fur was reminiscent of an animal's pelt and covered her
body in the form of clothing.

Shin Yoosung slowly emerged from the meteorite and stepped on the
ground. She was like a child taking her first step. She had just taken a step
when everyone around her was frozen.

She was a species with a different strength. Even the strong ones among the
incarnations found it hard to move. However, there was a person who
wasn't troubled by her pressure at all.

"I have been waiting, Shin Yoosung."
Shin Yoosung slowly turned towards the man.

"…Captain?" It was a short encounter but Shin Yoosung instantly realized
something. "Captan was waiting for me… this isn't the first time you have
seen me? Right?"

Yoo Joonghyuk nodded. "I need your help."

"Before that, what regression are you on now?"

"Why are you wondering?"

"I need to know."

Yoo Joonghyuk hesitated for a moment before replying. "The third time."

"Ah, I see… Then you met me in the second regression. Right?"

"Yes."

She was the reason why Yoo Joonghyuk could reach the 46th scenario in
the second regression. It was thanks to the Disaster of Floods in front of us.

The Disaster of Floods was Shin Yoosung from the 41st world line. She
came to the past because of the Yoo Joonghyuk of the 41st regression. Shin
Yoosung was abandoned by his world, travelled for many years and
eventually descended into a scenario of the past Earth.

"This is the third regression. I gave you information last time but you still
failed?"

"That's why I need more information."

The second regression Shin Yoosung chose Yoo Joonghyuk and gave him
all the information she knew. It was a final consideration for the Yoo
Joonghyuk that she knew. It was only for the second regression.
Shin Yoosung opened her mouth. "…It took thousands of years."

I could feel countless years of fatigue piled up in Shin Yoosung's
expression.
The things done by the 41st round Yoo Joonghyuk were worse than murder.
Thousands of years. This period of time was enough to make a person
collapse and for their ego to wear down. Shin Yoosung endured all that
time and finally became a disaster.

"Captain, do you know how hard it was for me? I endured all these years to
comply with your request."

"…What do you mean?"

"I wanted to see Captain."

Yoo Joonghyuk didn't see the despair in Shin Yoosung's smile. He opened
his mouth in a nonchalant manner. "Give me all the information from the
41st regression. Did the future me say anything?"

I wanted to shout at him but my voice wouldn't come out. Shin Yoosung's
eyes were as calm as the eye of a storm. Only I could read the turbulent
emotions hidden deeply in her eyes.

「 Nothing has changed. 」

Thanks to Yoo Joonghyuk, Shin Yoosung moved alone in the labyrinth of
worlds for over 1,000 years. She worked 200 years for the sake of
humanity. She kept her promise to defend the world for 200 years. Then for
another 200 years, she remembered Yoo Joonghyuk and her companions.

Throughout the years, Shin Yoosung used the handful of memories to
protect herself. However, questions rose the more she remembered.

「 What does all of this mean? 」
Time erased her cause and sense of justice. Once the cause disappeared,
only the poor human truth remained.

She felt resentment towards Yoo Joonghyuk who turned her and her
companions into a tool of 'regression'. Loneliness and despair of losing the
world permeated her bones. Shin Yoosung hated Yoo Joonghyuk who made
her into this.

"Captain has never changed."

"Don't say unnecessary things and turn over the information. I don't have
time."

"What are 'we' to Captain?"

"…What?"

"I did everything for you. I gave you one chance. However, Captain is still
here." She graciously helped Yoo Joonghyuk in the second regression.
"You will keep going forward. You will turn people like me into tools and
abandon me in the terrible labyrinth of worlds. It is all because of that
goddamn sense of justice. I hate you for living in this world alone."

Now Shin Yoosung was facing the Yoo Joonghyuk of the third regression.

"There is only one thing I'm going to tell you. Captain can't save anyone."
Shin Yoosung laughed. "Your third regression ends here."

Light emerged from Shin Yoosung's hands the same moment I was able to
release myself using the pressure point. I ran with all my strength and was
hit by the ether storm.

"Get out of the way Yoo Joonghyuk!"
My belly was split open and my mind became blank. A massive crater
formed in the center of the island. Me and Yoo Joonghyuk jumped into the
air and then rolled along the ground for a while.

It hurt. Shit. It really hurt.

"…Kim Dokja?" The surprised Yoo Joonghyuk looked down at my fallen
self.

My breathing was fast and the sky had turned yellow. It was true that I had
been lucky so far. The world was originally like this. Only one thing had to
go wrong for the world to be destroyed.

"Kim Dokja!"

Bastard, there was no need to make a big fuss. I smiled at Yoo Joonghyuk
and told him, "Hey, kill me. You usually want to kill me."

"What do you mean?"

"There is one minute left so I'll let you kill me. Kill me."

Yoo Joonghyuk looked at my belly. I wanted to touch my belly but it felt
like nothing was there. Blood constantly emerged from my mouth and I was
dizzy enough to vomit. I kept struggling to breathe.

[The exclusive skill 'Fourth Wall' has offset some of the pain.]

If it wasn't for Fourth Wall then I might be weeping. I couldn't feel it last
time because I died in one blow.

"Wait Kim Dokja! It isn't too late."

"It is too late."

"It isn't!"
"If you kill me now then you can gain coins. I'm already dying. Just kill
me."

Yoo Joonghyuk made an expression that I hadn't seen for a long time. It
was the expression he made when he first saw me on the subway.

"I can't do it."

My vision blurred. I could see Yoo Joonghyuk trying to stop the bleeding
but I had already lost too much blood. More than anything… my internal
organs were gone. There was no way I could live. It was unreasonable even
for Lee Seolhwa. My consciousness slowly scattered into the air like a
collapsing sandcastle. [You have died.]

.

.

A moment later, a system message was heard.

[Current karma points: 100/100]

[You have enough karma points to use the privilege.]

[The privilege of the King of No Killing is activated.]




As expected, I opened my eyes in the darkness. It was this state again. It
was a truly dirty feeling.

[Due to a collision error with your exclusive skill, the privilege of King of
No Killing would be delayed.]
[Thanks to your death, your consciousness has been completely liberated
from the constraints of your body.]

[Exclusive skill, Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint stage 3 has been
activated!]

I heard familiar messages in the darkness. The next moment, a screen
appeared in front of me. It was the third person observation.

「 "Flood." 」

It was like the intermediate dokkaebi said. The Disaster of Floods was more
than the other disasters combined. Shin Yoosung gave an order and the air
distorted, making monsters pop out.

Monster Gate, the main feature of the legend grade attribute Beast Lord.
The numerous monsters domesticated by her as she travelled the
dimensions were being released as nightmares on Earth.

「 "Tear, break, destroy." 」

Many 7th grade and 6th grade species could be seen. There were even some
comparable to the 5th grade fire dragon.

「 "It is time for the disaster." 」

Nodeulseom exploded and waves covered Han River. The confused
incarnations became the food of monsters. The late-arriving 'kings' started
giving orders. Then I saw a person with a fearsome aura behind Shin
Yoosung.

「 "I'm going to kill you, Shin Yoosung." 」

…This crazy bastard? Yoo Joonghyuk's ether blade moved through the air
with a terrible sound.
Shin Yoosung avoided the attack and smiled lightly. 「 "Your level of
Breaking the Sky Sword is quite high already? However, you can't beat me
no matter how you try. At most, it is this level?"

"You must turn in this round."

"We'll see. I won't die now. It might be possible if it was 10 years later."

"I will kill you."

"…Captain, aren't you too agitated? What is the reason?" 」

I quietly prepared 1st person protagonist's point of view. In the current
situation, it was best to transfer to Yoo Joonghyuk's body. I didn't feel good
but it would be a bit easier to deal with the disaster if I transferred to this
guy.

「 "Something is strange. Are you really Captain?" 」 Then Shin
Yoosung's eyes shifted to my dead body. 「 "Who is that person? I haven't
never seen such a person before." 」

Yoo Joonghyuk stayed silent. He just swung and swung his sword. This
was his only answer. How long did he swing his sword?

Yoo Joonghyuk slowly opened his mouth.

「 "…That guy." 」

Shin Yoosung's face gradually filled with doubt and disbelief. The silent
Yoo Joonghyuk finally spoke.

「 "He is my companion." 」
      Chapter 103: Ep. 21 – Things That Can't Be Changed, I


「 "…Captain, what did you just say?" 」

I came to my senses because of Shin Yoosung's disbelieving voice.

「 "Say it again. What did you say just now? What? Companion?"

"…"

"That man is your companion?" 」

Yoo Joonghyuk didn't reply to the voice filled with distrust. I was surprised
as well but Shin Yoosung's shock was devastating. The Yoo Joonghyuk
with a strong ego had called me his 'companion'.

「 "Yes." 」
This suddenly scared me. No matter how I thought about it, he wasn't
someone who would call me a 'companion'. Didn't this bastard know I was
going to be resurrected?

[The constellation 'Maritime War God' is touched by your companionship.]

[The constellation 'Bald General of Justice' is blushing at your
companionship.]

[500 coins have been sponsored.]

Yes, now I understood. Yoo Joonghyuk, he was looking for coin
sponsorship. It was a little strange to see that Uriel wasn't involved but he
must be targeting sponsorship by one of the constellations.

I became convinced as I watched him bleeding. Considering that this was
his third regression, it wasn't impossible for Yoo Joonghyuk to say the word
'companion'. In the early rounds, he had called Lee Hyunsung and Lee
Seolhwa 'companions' when they died.

It hurt to think about the large number of coins he would be receiving right
now. I couldn't help my emotions becoming cold. Damn, I should've said
that line.

「 "Captain, how can you say that?" 」

Of course, Shin Yoosung didn't know Yoo Joonghyuk's thoughts and
looked as if the world had collapsed.

There was no choice. The 41st regression Shin Yoosung…

She never once heard Yoo Joonghyuk call anyone his companion. Shin
Yoosung's fist hit Yoo Joonghyuk's blade.

Despite the clash between the body and the weapon, the thing that received
damage was Yoo Joonghyuk's sword. It was the SS-grade Splitting the Sky
Sword. Putting aside the special options, the durability and strength were
one of the best. Yet this sword was damaged by Shin Yoosung's fist.

In the end, the Splitting the Sky Sword failed to overcome the shock and
was bent. The mighty Splitting the Sky was helplessly deflected.

「 "How dare you say this in front of me?" 」

Shin Yoosung shouted and didn't use any special skills. She just threw a
punch that contained ether condensed to the limit.

Yoo Joonghyuk coughed up blood and flew back at this blow. Her attacks,
her speed and her variations. Shin Yoosung was superior to Yoo Joonghyuk
in all aspects.

The Red Phoenix Shunpo and Breaking the Sky Sword that Yoo Joonghyuk
was proud of faded in front of Shin Yoosung.

There was the terrible sound of the body breaking and Yoo Joonghyuk was
pushed back. It wasn't a matter of talent but a matter of time.

Despite being weakened by the descent, the 41st Shin Yoosung was the
Beast Lord who was close to the limits that Shin Yoosung could reach. On
the other hand, the current Yoo Joonghyuk was in the early stages of Yoo
Joonghyuk's growth.

「 "Why call him a companion? Is it because he sacrificed himself for you?
Just because of this?" 」

Blood emerged without stopping. However, Yoo Joonghyuk didn't give up.
He didn't stop and kept wielding his sword. That jerk, why the hell was he
fighting?

I watched the bleeding Yoo Joonghyuk and became increasingly frustrated.
Shouldn't he run away after realizing something was wrong? Wasn't that
what he normally did?
Once again, Shin Yoosung opened her mouth.

「 "Then what about me and the others? Jihye unni and Hyunsung oppa.
Seolhwa unni? What the hell are the people who fought with you?"

"I… I don't know what you're talking about."

"What?"

"There is only one thing I know." Yoo Joonghyuk wiped the blood from his
lips and said. "You killed my companion in this round. Thus, you will also
die." 」

Damn, this time I couldn't help feeling touched.

[Excessive immersion has restricted some of the features of Fourth Wall.]

I was fooled by his acting. Yes, I read Ways of Survival for this taste.
Come to think of it, I had been in tears when Yoo Joonghyuk said
something similar to Lee Hyunsung.

I suddenly felt restless. A mere reader became a companion of the main
character, Yoo Joonghyuk.

Shin Yoosung looked at Yoo Joonghyuk with a face that seemed to have
lost everything.

「 "You can't be like this…" 」

An ominous aura filled her surroundings. It was a process where emptiness
turned to betrayal and betrayal turned to anger.

「 "You are changing. I can't tolerate it." 」

Ether filled Shin Yoosung's fists. I wanted to watch a bit more but I was
filled with a sense of crisis.
[Excessive immersion leads to a profound increase in the proficiency of
Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint.]

If this went wrong then Yoo Joonghyuk would really die. I couldn't let him
be killed here. I quickly switched the mode of Omniscient Reader's
Viewpoint.

It was from third person to 1st person protagonist's point of view.

[Changing your viewpoint to first person.]

…

[Changing to the 1st person protagonist's point of view has failed.]

What? Why?

[You have failed to meet the conditions to change the viewpoint.]

It felt like I had been hit in the back of the head. There were two conditions
to use 1st person protagonist's point of view.

One, I must be dead and in an out of body state. Two, the target and I
should be thinking about each other.

The first condition was met but the problem was the second condition. That
jerk wasn't thinking about me right now?

Then what was with all the running amok because of revenge? I watched
Yoo Joonghyuk who was frantically attacking and became stunned.

「 "Die. I will kill you." 」

…That bastard, was he thinking about anything? Shin Yoosung watched
Yoo Joonghyuk and opened his mouth.
「 "It can't be helped. I was going to finish it quickly but I changed my
mind." 」

Shin Yoosung smiled like she was a devil.

「 "I will finish off Captain's world in the most terrible way." 」

Shin Yoosung's eyes shifted away from Yoo Joonghyuk. My heart sank the
moment I followed her gaze. Shit, I really couldn't wait here and watch. If I
couldn't transfer to Yoo Joonghyuk then someone else…

At this moment, a sharp sensation crossed my mind. An unexpected
character was thinking of me.

…Could I transfer to this person? Was it possible? Ah, that's right. It was
because Yoo Joonghyuk said those words. Yes, maybe it would be better to
transfer to this person. I don't know, let's just try it.

I started projecting my mind towards that person. Then after a while. My
vision shook and I became dizzy.

[Changing your viewpoint to first person.]

My consciousness was sucked to another place.




'Companion?'

The first time she heard it, Shin Yoosung questioned her ears. Companion.
How was this possible? This was Yoo Joonghyuk, not another person.

Shin Yoosung couldn't understand the emotion that blossomed deep inside
her heart. It was an emotion she had forgotten for a thousand years.
Yoo Joonghyuk, companion.

She didn't know what had happened to Yoo Joonghyuk. But if it was
true, perhaps the Yoo Joonghyuk of that time towards her… Shin
Yoosung touched the ground without realizing it.

'It is low'.

Shin Yoosung thought so. Thus, I thought so.

"This is your last chance." She couldn't tolerate such a lowly thing. "If you
take your words back then I will send you away without any pain. Say it.
Say he isn't your companion, just someone you know."

The bleeding Yoo Joonghyuk didn't answer despite his condition. Shin
Yoosung had crushed one arm and his legs were weak. Even so, Yoo
Joonghyuk's eyes were still alive.

Shin Yoosung stared at Yoo Joonghyuk and gritted her teeth before giving
an order. "Hold onto Yoo Joonghyuk."

The 6th grade sulfur mummies that had passed through the Monster Gate
started moving. Their white bandages grabbed Yoo Joonghyuk's body and
Yoo Joonghyuk's limbs were pulled as if they were going to be torn apart.
Shin Yoosung declared, "Captain, I'll kill them one by one. Captain, you are
the one who chose the most painful way."

Shin Yoosung walked towards the edge of the island, leaving Yoo
Joonghyuk alone.

"Kill her! She is the disaster!"

The incarnations climbing up from the water discovered Shin Yoosung.
Shin Yoosung waved her hands towards them. The incarnations were
touched by the light that came from her hands and were torn apart like wet
newspaper. There was no time for them to scream.

"Flood."

Monsters poured from the Monster Gate at her order. Two of the most
powerful monsters were standing behind her like they were guards.

The 5th grade sea species, King Masswood. The 5th grade behemoth,
Heavy Metal Bean.

They were monsters who could cause small disasters in this world. She was
about to speak when a sharp strike came from the side.

"Where are you going?"

It was a flashy sword. The person wielding it wore a black hoodie over a
slim skirt. Shin Yoosung immediately recognized who she was. Demon
Slaying was burning in Lee Jihye's eyes.

"You dared to make Master look like that?"

The majesty of a great constellation emerged from Lee Jihye's body. It was
the power of a person who was stronger than anyone in the sea. Shin
Yoosung noticed the stigma that Lee Jihye wanted to use. This place was a
river.

"…Your Majesty."

The moment she started reciting a passage, transparent ships emerged from
every corner of Han River.

"I still have 12 ships…!"

12 ships appeared on Han River, scattering the water. It was a sight that
made people speechless. The stigma of the Duke of Loyalty and Warfare,
Ghost Fleet. Despite the oppressive aura of the ships, Shin Yoosung just
smiled like she had missed it.

"…Indeed. This is Unni's skill."

"Unni? You are a lot older than me!"

"However, you still have a long way to go. The captain should be on the
ship. Why are you in a place like this?" Shin Yoosung reached her in an
instant and touched Lee Jihye's chin. There was no time for resistance.
"Poor Unni. You don't know anything."

"Shit! What is this speed?"

Lee Jihye hurriedly retreated but she couldn't escape Shin Yoosung's speed.

"You don't know. Yoo Joonghyuk will use you and abandon you. You will
die."

Lee Jihye's blade flew towards Shin Yoosung. Shin Yoosung lightly
grabbed the blade.

"You, who wanted to be acknowledged by Yoo Joonghyuk, died in the sea
you loved so much. You were horribly slaughtered by the Japanese who
hated your sponsor."

"Everybody, attack with full power!"

The 12 ships started firing the moment Lee Jihye shouted. Shin Yoosung
laughed as she watched the flying shells.

"Do you know what Yoo Joonghyuk said after losing you?"

The shells hit Shin Yoosung's body. There was the loud sound of an
explosion. Shin Yoosung emerged from the smoke and kept talking.

"In the future, sea battles will be a bit difficult."
The countless shells didn't damage Shin Yoosung's white fur armour. It was
one of Shin Yoosung's unique skills, her strongest defense skill called Beast
King's Sensitivity. The white fur wrapped around her didn't tolerate even a
single scratch.

"Don't worry Unni. That won't happen this time."

Shin Yoosung laughed.

"I'll send you away without any pain."




    Chapter 104: Ep. 21 – Things That Can't Be Changed, II


Shin Yoosung's right hand quietly rose towards the sky.

"Cry, King Masswood."

Then the ichthyosaur king behind her quietly raised his body. The king of
the ichthyosaurs, the King Masswood used Ice Breath. Han River instantly
froze and the ghost fleet firing their shells gradually lost their function. The
fleet was unable to move.

"Unni, I will give you one piece of advice. The ghost fleet is nothing
without water."

Everything happened in an instant. Shin Yoosung's fist moved as well.
There was the sound of something popping. Lee Jihye lost her sword and
flew through the sky.

"Of course, it is useless to give the advice at this time."

The bleeding Lee Jihye flew away and had already lost consciousness. King
Masswood's Ice Breath had spread completely across Han River.

"Aaaagh! What?"

The incarnations crossing the cold water shrieked. The hundreds of people
were destined to be frozen along with Han River. It was a person watching
nearby who saved the helpless incarnations.

[The character 'Lee Hyunsung' has used the stigma 'Great Mountain Smash
Lv. 5'.]

Lee Hyunsung's abnormally inflated right arm hit the frozen river. His right
arm seemed to burst as he used Great Mountain Smash to break up the ice.

His efforts were rewarded. The surface of the cracked Han River collapsed
and the influence of Cold Breath weakened. The incarnations took the
opportunity to climb onto Nodeulseom.

"Wahhhh!"

"Attack!"

Shin Yoosung saw Lee Hyunsung standing in the middle of them and
smiled sadly. "Yes, Hyunsung oppa. I knew you would be here."
"…You know me?"

"You were our most reassuring shield. You saved my life many times."

Shin Yoosung gestured and the huge chimpanzee behind her hit his chest
and walked forward. The 5th grade behemoth, Heavy Metal Bean. He
stomped his hind legs and the nearby incarnations rolled around on the
ground.

Lee Hyunsung rushed towards Heavy Metal Bean. Lee Hyunsung's swollen
arm hit the Heavy Metal Bean's steel muscles. Lee Hyunsung's power was
amazing. He wasn't pushed back by the 5th grade behemoth despite his
blood vessels bursting and blood flowing from his mouth. No, he was rather
overwhelming.

Shin Yoosung kept speaking to Lee Hyunsung. "You are the same as ever.
Hyunsung oppa. One of Yoo Joonghyuk's most loyal…"

"…Who are you?"

"You saved the lives of countless people and protected Yoo Joonghyuk to
the end. Then you were hit with the breath of the iron blood dragon and
scattered into a handful of ashes."

"What…?"

"Do you know what Yoo Joonghyuk said then?" Shin Yoosung's tongue
was a sharp scalpel that transplanted the wounds she received onto another
person. "I lost a bad shield."

Shin Yoosung saw Lee Hyunsung's changed expression and struggled with
a solitary pleasure. 'Yes, you should feel this too. The pain I felt, the sights I
saw. I won't unleash all of them but you should understand this too'.

However, she didn't know. This round of regression was different from
what she knew.
Lee Hyunsung hit the Heavy Metal Bean and opened his mouth. "I don't
know what you're talking about but I don't follow Yoo Joonghyuk."

"What?"

"I am in Kim Dokja's party."

"Kim… what?"

The Heavy Metal Bean fell to the ground with a loud sound. Shin
Yoosung's expression hardened and she approached Lee Hyunsung.

"What are you talking about?"

There was a popping sword and Lee Hyunsung flew through the air. Shin
Yoosung had punched Lee Hyunsung in the belly. The ether storm pierced
through Lee Hyunsung's solid skin and he flew to the middle of Han River.

The blow was hard enough to cause all his organs to rupture. The Lee
Hyunsung of the third round would no longer be able to live. However, a
question remained in Shin Yoosung's head.

It was a name she had never heard of before. Kim Dokja… Who was he?

Shin Yoosung tore off the heads of the incarnations rushing towards her
and slowly walked towards the frozen river. The frightened incarnations
fled and were torn apart by the claws of monsters. Little by little, despair
filled the eyes of the people.

A sense of resignation spread through the incarnations facing the
impossible disaster.

"Shoot!"

Of course, there were some people who tried to resist. The kings grouped
up and used long distance skills to fire arrows and ether bullets. Shin
Yoosung knew them.
King of Beauty, Min Jiwon.

The Maitreya King Cha Sangkyung.

The Neutral King, Jeon Ildo.

It was strange. They were those who originally shouldn't be alive or had
already gone under Yoo Joonghyuk's leadership. It was because all kings
other than Yoo Joonghyuk should've been incorporated into one throne at
the end of the fourth scenario.

Then what the hell was this?

"Attack! There is only one enemy!"

Who the hell was this army under? Where had the Absolute Throne gone?
Who was governing this world?

It was at this moment that she felt killing intent. The ground where Shin
Yoosung was standing was frozen.

…Ice Breath?

She reflexively looked behind her and saw a large serpent pouring its breath
towards her. It wasn't the King Masswood. She raised her right hand and
the King Masswood moved.

Two ichthyosaurs roared at each other as they collided.

The king and queen bit at each other, turning the entire Han River into a
huge battlefield. An ichthyosaur the size of a dragon was fighting King
Masswood. This ichthyosaur, Shin Yoosung knew its identity.

"…Queen Mirabad?"

She knew that the queen was on Earth but there was no reason to attack her.
No, what was this?
"Are you the future me?" A voice was heard.

She looked back and Shin Yoosung's mind became blank. The nostalgic
days shook her soul.

"Save ahjussi!"

The girl shouted while a woman tried to stop the girl.

"Yoosung, no!"

Shin Yoosung recovered from the shock and noticed everything.

"Haha… yes. I knew it."

Shin Yoosung moved towards the girl. She knew why Yoo Joonghyuk had
done this. He was a human who would just any means and methods to
achieve his purpose.

"Yoo Joonghyuk, you son of a bitch…"

"Yoosung, flee!"

Yoo Sangah simultaneously activated Hermes Walking Method and
Arachne's Spiderweb. Shin Yoosung's eyes narrowed.

'…Olympus?'

However, Yoo Sangah's dagger didn't reach Shin Yoosung. Shin Yoosung
made a simple hand gesture and the flying monsters gathered around the
gate flew towards Yoo Sangah. In a flash, Yoo Sangah disappeared into a
horde of monsters.

Shin Yoosung ignored Yoo Sangah and approached the little girl. The girl
looked up at her with fear and anger. The girl wasn't able to move an inch.
Shin Yoosung raised a hand to the girl's cheek.
"Yoo Joonghyuk really did find the 'me' of this world."

"Uh, ah…"

"He tried to kill the little 'me' to stop me. Right?"

A terrible joy filled Shin Yoosung's head. The faded hatred and anger
quickly returned to their place. There were some things that couldn't
be changed no matter how many times a person went back to the past.
The 'disaster' Shin Yoosung laughed. "Hello, my past self."

The moment her hand moved, a strong blow came from the rear and
swallowed up Shin Yoosung. The dust rose and a giant praying mantis
appeared.

"A 6th grade insect king?"

"Titano! Do it!"

The sickle attacks of the praying mantis turned the ground into tofu. It was
a scary attack. Of course, it wasn't an attack that could kill a disaster.

"Get lost."

The ether condensed in Shin Yoosung's right arm and drilled a hole in the
titanoptera's stomach. The praying mantis spilled green blood and fell to the
ground.

"Titano!"

The outraged Lee Gilyoung jumped from the head of the praying mantis. A
yellow mucus emerged from Lee Gilyoung's body and spread into the air.

"Go! Antinus!"
A wind parasite emerged from Lee Gilyoung's body. It was a 5th grade
parasitic species. Shin Yoosung was startled.

"…Antinus?"

Shin Yoosung knew this presence. It was because she destroyed Chronos
before coming to Earth. Antinus was the from the dominant species on
Chronos. She was a monster in the form of a queen.

Shin Yoosung couldn't believe it. The child had dominated Antinus?

"You are better than expected, Kid."

After her moment of surprise, Shin Yoosung grabbed the parasite in her
hands. Antinus' mucus that was touching her fingertips started to burn
black. It was natural. The guides had bodies that couldn't resist the
disasters.

"You have the talent to tame a guide. You are a child with the talent of a
Lord. Right? He also found…"

Lee Gilyoung shouted without caring about her questions. "What did you
do to Dokja hyung?" "What?"

"Where is hyung?"

Lee Gilyoung's fist hit her belly. It was a direct blow but Lee Gilyoung was
the one whose wrist broke. He was a great talent but the opponent was too
terrible. Shin Yoosung grabbed Lee Gilyoung's neck and lifted him into the
air.

"…Who is Dokja?" Blood poured down the struggling Lee Gilyoung's face.
"Say it. Otherwise I will kill you."
At this moment, a booming sound was heard in the distance and shells fell
towards the ground where she was standing. Shin Yoosung jumped lightly
and avoided the shells. The Ghost Fleet started firing again? How?

"Gilyoung!"

She could see Lee Jihye and Lee Hyunsung running in the distance. Doubt
filled Shin Yoosung's head…

It was strange. Surely those were deadly blows. How were they still alive?
Did her strength control fail? Her?

Shin Yoosung feel annoyed and inserted more strength into the hand
holding Lee Gilyoung's neck. In any case, it was better to ask them.

"Goodbye Kid."

The moment she increased her grip, pain spread in her head. She was
startled and dropped Lee Gilyoung to the ground. Her trembling right hand
was wriggling abnormally.

Surely she wasn't infected with a parasite? No, it was impossible. A 5th
grade parasite couldn't interfere with a returnee. Then what was this?" Why
wasn't her body listening to her all of a sudden?

Then she heard a voice. 「 Stop, Shin Yoosung. 」

Strangely, Shin Yoosung found something deep inside her react the
moment she heard this voice. One side of her heart started to ache like
crazy. She didn't know it. It was obviously a voice she didn't know.

"…W-Who the hell are you? Get out of me!"

What was this nostalgic feeling? Shin Yoosung grabbed her head like she
was resisting her own senses.

"You! Get out of me!"
She was filled with the desire to vomit as unknown memories revolved in
her head. The films of the worlds were becoming tangled together.

「 Yoosung. 」

She was distracted by the voice when the young Shin Yoosung approached.

The young Shin Yoosung's lips moved. "Ahjussi, are you there?"
    Chapter 105: Ep. 21 – Things That Can't Be Changed, III


Controlling the body of a disaster? I didn't intend on this from the
beginning. Originally my plan was something else. I decided to modify the
plan the moment my mind transferred to Shin Yoosung's body.

[Exclusive skill, Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint stage 3 has been
activated!]

[The 1st person supporting role viewpoint has been activated.]

To be exact, I had to modify it.

「 …I can't admit it. 」

「 Then what am I? How long have I lived? 」

「 What can I get for returning? 」
In the midst of Shin Yoosung's turbulent pain, I saw the world with her
eyes. I breathed through Shin Yoosung's nose and killed people with Shin
Yoosung's hand. I expressed Shin Yoosung's thoughts with her voice. I was
Shin Yoosung.

[The exclusive skill, 'Fourth Wall' is shaking!]

Then I met Lee Jihye. I knew the moment I met her that Lee Jihye would
die here. Thus, for the first time I tried something that I hadn't done before.

[The 1st person supporting role viewpoint interferes with the behaviour of
the character.]

[The exclusive skill, 'Fourth Wall' is shaking ominously.]

There was an electric current in my head followed by tremendous pain. Yet
the moment Shin Yoosung dealt the decisive blow, I was able to pull back
her right hand. It was a fine adjustment so Shin Yoosung didn't notice, but I
definitely did it.

Lee Jihye didn't die.

[Your understanding of the character 'Shin Yoosung' has increased.]

The same thing was repeated with Lee Hyunsung. My mind had become a
bit ragged but I thought that I might be able to do something. I poured more
of my heart into it and increased my grip on Shin Yoosung's body.

Finally, it happened when Shin Yoosung grabbed Lee Gilyoung's neck.

"W-Who are you?"

I succeeded in controlling Shin Yoosung's right hand.

[You have a very high understanding of the character 'Shin Yoosung'.]
Someone else's arm moved according to my will. It was an amazing
experience.

"…Ahjussi?" Shin Yoosung asked.

"Get out of me!"

Shin Yoosung's right arm under my control starting shaking. The
abnormally deformed arm turned black and swollen, like the blood vessels
were bursting. The young Shin Yoosung rushed to grab the blackened arm.

"Ahjussi, you're in there right? Ahjussi!"

The young Shin Yoosung grabbed my right arm. At this moment, a strong
spark entered the right arm. It was a spark similar to a probability storm.
The surprised people came running but the sparks blew them away.

The 'disaster' Shin Yoosung and the 'young' Shin Yoosung saw each other
at the same time. The wave of memories were gathering.

「 "Ahjussi." 」

「 "Captain." 」

It wasn't possible. If the 'Disconnected Film' theory was correct, the two
people shouldn't have a shared history.

「 "You… can kill me. It's okay." 」

「 "I wanted to survive." 」

When I thought about it, the Disconnected Film theory only applied to
'characters'. I came from outside the novel. What if my existence played a
role in connecting their memories? What if I connected the two films?

I could feel both Shin Yoosungs holding my hand. The third round and the
41st round. The two different times were facing each other.
「 "Is it worth it for me to live?" 」

「 "Then what is the value of this life?" 」

"No! This… these memories…"

The panicked disaster Shin Yoosung stuttered and bit on her blue lips. A
mighty energy was being created inside Shin Yoosung's body.

There was the sound of something tearing and the young Shin Yoosung was
thrown away from the right arm.

Shin Yoosung was damaging her own body in an attempt to get me out.
Blood flowed from her and her combat power started to rapidly drop. The
balance of her flesh was being broken due to the excessive magic power.

「 Shin Yoosung! Wait, stop this! 」

"Aaaack!"

Shin Yoosung grabbed her head and struggled to expel me. I shared her
senses and felt like I was going crazy from the nausea and pain. Shin
Yoosung's mind was blank.

I was troubled for a moment. If this continued, the disaster Shin Yoosung…

Dammit!

.

.

My consciousness left Shin Yoosung's body and all five senses disappeared.

[The skill conflict error is normalized.]

[The delayed privilege of the King of No Killing has reappeared.]
[Your body is resurrected from death.]

…

Maybe this wasn't the right choice. However, I wanted to give it a try.

[A constellation who likes to change gender is sad.]

I would always regret it if I didn't.

[The recreation of your flesh has begun.]

[The exclusive skill 'Fourth Wall' offsets the mental shock caused by your
death.]

[Compensation is being prepared for the Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint
stage 3.]

It was my second resurrection after dying from the fire dragon.

I felt my nerves being reconstructed and struggled once again. The
regenerated lungs filled with air and the optic nerves were connected,
restoring my vision. The abstract activity of the mind was transplanted onto
the cerebral cortex.

[The privilege of the King of No Killing has been completed.]

[100 karma points have been consumed.]

[The wastes of your flesh have been completely removed and the
performance of your body has increased.]

[Physique and magic power has increased by 2 levels each.]

[You have exceeded in overall stats limit for the scenario.]
Fortunately, it was the second resurrection and I didn't have an unseemly
appearance.

I looked around and saw my scattered items and clothing. It was lucky that
no one had taken them. I started putting on my clothes when I heard an
eerie voice behind me.

"…Kim Dokja?"

Ah, come to think of it, that bastard was right beside me. I looked back and
saw Yoo Joonghyuk staring at me with disbelief. His shoulders were still
covered with the sulfur mummies' bandages.

"How on earth?"

I sighed. I couldn't explain about the King of No Killing here so I said
something else. "…Don't say that you will kill me again. I really will die
this time."

"Kim Dokja, you…!"

"I will explain it later. There is no time."

I swung the Blade of Faith and freed Yoo Joonghyuk from the sulfur
mummies' bandages. The sulfur mummies shrieked and stared at me. Then I
activated Way of the Wind through Bookmark.

I carried the injured Yoo Joonghyuk on my shoulder and rushed towards
the frozen Han River.

From afar, I could see incarnations fighting with monsters. There was a
black aura rising from Yongsang-gu, Seoul. It was for certain. The disaster
Shin Yoosung was over there.

"Ahjussi?"

"Dokja-ssi!"
I found my party members running towards me. I put Yoo Joonghyuk down
on the ground and ordered.

"Take a break."

Then I ran straight towards the disaster Shin Yoosung.

"Dokja-ssi, it is dangerous."

"It's okay." I stopped Lee Hyunsung and moved forward. "Shin Yoosung."

The Disaster of Floods was sitting down while holding her head. Blood
flowed down and hit the ground.

I was certain that the incarnations didn't dare approach because of the
terrible aura she was emitting. Right now, everyone could kill the current
Disaster of Floods if they combined forces.

"You… who… are you?" The disaster Shin Yoosung looked at me with
trembling eyes. "It's all ruined… because of you… this isn't the round that I
know."

The soul that had lasted over a thousand years was shaking with fear.

"No, not at all."

The change began with Yoo Joonghyuk and then her spirit started
collapsing the moment she encountered the Shin Yoosung of the past.

She hated Yoo Joonghyuk. Her anger had accumulated over a thousand
years. The strong emotions had crumbled at the memories she received.

Maybe this hope could change the world. It was the small bit of hope that
the disaster Shin Yoosung saw. It might be very small but hope could
overwhelm despair.
I approached Shin Yoosung and knelt down beside her. Shin Yoosung
stared at me.

"You have done well." I kept thinking about what she would most want to
hear. No such thing had appeared in Ways of Survival. I could only come
up with the words myself. If I was Shin Yoosung… "I've been waiting for
you for a long time."

Shin Yoosung's eyes shook uneasily. "…You have been waiting? Who are
you?"

"A person who wants the same world you do."

At this point, Shin Yoosung's eyes changed drastically.

「 I… 」

Little by little, Yoo Sangah touched my shoulder.

"Dokja-ssi."

I nodded and got up. My companions were looking at me. I looked at them
and opened my mouth.

"Everyone."

I liked the Disaster of Floods episode. I loved all the characters who
appeared in this episode and valued them. Perhaps that was why I hoped for
this episode to not happen.

"I won't kill the disaster."

I thought about it. In the original third round, the Disaster of Floods died
after the young Shin Yoosung was killed. However, I wondered if there was
another ending to this episode that I didn't know about. It was an ending
that had never been attempted.
"I won't accept any arguments. This time, I hope you will listen to my
suggestion."

"Ahjussi, what is this bullshit?"

There was no time limit for the fifth scenario. What if the Disaster of
Floods gave up her role and what if we didn't hunt the disaster?

Perhaps this scenario would just continue without anyone dying. Some
people understood while others looked confused. The first one who nodded
was Yoo Sangah and then Lee Hyunsung opened his mouth.

"You must have an idea. I will follow Dokja's will."

"It is fine if that's what hyung wants. But can I hit her as much as she hit
Titano?"

"Damn, do whatever you want. Since when hasn't ahjussi done what you
wanted? But is it okay?"

I listened to the party members' words and then looked at the young Shin
Yoosung.

"I…"

The girl had tears in her eyes. Perhaps Shin Yoosung had seen it,
everything that her future self experienced.

Thus, it was cruel to ask the young Shin Yoosung about what to do with
Shin Yoosung. I stroked the child's hair and finally looked back at the
disaster Shin Yoosung. She had a distorted expression like she was a
wounded beast.

"You will spare me? Don't make me laugh. Who are you to say that?"

The only thing she had left was her pride.
"I have lived through the 41st round of regression. I remember everything
that no one in this world knows. What do you know? How did I spend that
time? How can I forget all of that?"

The words of the future Shin Yoosung stopped. It was because Yoo
Joonghyuk was watching her.

"…"

In this moment, Shin Yoosung realized the real meaning of what she said.
Being lost among worlds. Losing her loved ones. Nevertheless, living in
that world again. There was only one person in this world who understood
her grief.

"Every regressor lives hating the things that haven't happened yet."

Regressor Yoo Joonghyuk started talking.

"That guy will be a bad person in the future and I should kill him. That
person will kill my companion in the future and I should kill him. That
person will be my companion in the future and I should save them."

I could read the emotions in Yoo Joonghyuk's eyes. Since I was able to read
them, Yoo Joonghyuk felt strange to me for the first time. I had never seen
such an honest Yoo Joonghyuk.

"It is a future that hasn't happened yet. I know they don't remember me and
that they haven't done anything yet. Still, I believed and acted like they did.
That's how I lived. It is because everything clearly happened to me and I
can't live by denying it."

Anger returned to Shin Yoosung's eyes.

"Yes! It is because you lived that way! My companions…"

"So you also live that way, Shin Yoosung."
"…What?"

"If you want, I will bear your hatred."

I couldn't say anything because I was too saddened by Yoo Joonghyuk's
words.

"Survive this round for the sake of killing me."

Yoo Joonghyuk spoke some final words. Perhaps this was the warmest that
Yoo Joonghyuk could be.

It was the first time I noticed that Yoo Joonghyuk's back was so big and
wide. His back was wide and lonely.

Shin Yoosung stared at Yoo Joonghyuk with her mouth wide open.

Ironically, she understood the man who she hated for thousands of years
due to all the years she lived.

"Captain… wait. Captain!"

I was able to feel the ripples in Shin Yoosung's heart.

「 …Is this really okay? 」

「 Keep going for this reason. 」

「 This world, you don't have to abandon it… 」

Some anger hadn't disappeared and some sorrows hadn't been erased.
However, as long as she lived, salvation would come one day.

I told Shin Yoosung, "Shin Yoosung, this is your 'round' now."

I couldn't change anything when I was a reader. It was because I was a
reader that I could change it now. I thought I could change it.
At least, until the voice of the intermediate dokkaebi was heard.
    Chapter 106: Ep. 21 – Things That Can't Be Changed, IV


[I'm sorry but that's a bit difficult.]

I thought it was time for this guy to come out. It was the fucking
intermediate dokkaebi. This guy managed the entire Seoul scenario and
couldn't help moving at this time.

However, I was a bit confident. "Why is it difficult? We aren't breaking the
scenario's rules."

[Spare the disaster? Are you insane? You must want to die.]

"No, it is the opposite. I am doing this to live."

The voice of the intermediate dokkaebi became harder.

[Don't you know that this is a violation of the rules? The content of the
scenario is to kill the disaster. If you don't stick to the scenario…]
"Don't worry. I will kill the disaster." Everyone looked at me the moment I
said these words.

"Ahjussi, what are you…?" In particular, Lee Jihye looked at me like I was
a psychopath.

It wasn't strange. I previously said I wouldn't kill the disaster and now I said
I would. Most of the party members were waiting for my next words. I felt
a bit flattered by the trusting silence.

"Just not right now."

[What?]

"The scenario doesn't indicate a time limit. Then it is up to us when we
want to kill the disaster." The intermediate dokkaebi looked like he had
eaten Chinese medicine. "Thus, there is no need to rush."

The disaster Shin Yoosung looked up at me with a bemused expression.
She hadn't known that such a thing was possible.

[The constellation 'Scribe of Heaven' is looking at you with strange eyes.]

The agitation of the constellations could be felt. There weren't many
episodes that rebelled against the scenario, even when I searched all of
Ways of Survival. That's why it was of great interest to the constellations.

This was particularly true in situations where the distinction between good
and evil was ambiguous. The number of subscribers from the absolute good
or absolute evil constellations would rise in an overwhelming manner. It
was their daily routine to discern the good and evil of the characters.

[I can't allow it.]

"Are you going to interfere in another scenario? Have you forgotten what
happened last time?"
[…]

My confidence came from the fact that this was a main scenario, not a
subscenario.

It was also the fifth scenario that was scaled to engulf all of the dome,
making it difficult for the intermediate dokkaebi to change the criteria of
the scenario. In addition, the intermediate dokkaebi had already received
disciplinary action from the bureau.

He must be afraid of being punished again and didn't have much chance of
winning this fight against me.

I saw Bihyung biting his nails nearby and told him, 'Be prepared. If
something happens, you are the only one I can believe in'.

–Dammit, why should I?

'Don't forget that we will die together'.

Bihyung settled down and the intermediate dokkaebi opened his mouth.

[Very interesting. But it won't turn out as you think.]

Yes, I knew he wouldn't give up easily.

[Not all incarnation in Seoul Dome are the same as you.]

The intermediate dokkaebi flicked his finger. Then system messages
popped up.

[A new sub-scenario has arrived!]

I knew what he was thinking. If he couldn't touch the main scenario then he
would set up the sub-scenario.

[From now on, I will double the bounty on the disaster.]
The original compensation was 100,000 coins and it was doubled, which
meant 200,000 coins. It was an amount that could make someone rise to
the top of Seoul Dome in an instant. It was enough to risk their lives… For
some reason, no incarnations came running.

"Don't move."

"Cherish your lives. If you don't want to die like moths!"

The powerful kings were controlling the incarnations. They were King of
Beauty Min Jiwon and Maitreya King Cha Sangkyung. There was also the
Neutral King, Jeon Ildo.

[The constellation 'Maritime War God' is proud of the incarnations on the
Korean Peninsula.]

Of course, there were forces that the kings couldn't control but they also
didn't act. They had already seen the power of the disaster. It was natural
that a small number of people wouldn't act, regardless of whether the
reward was
100,000 or 200,000 coins. There was also our party covering the disaster
Shin Yoosung…

[…How disappointing. The incarnations of Seoul Dome are cowards.]

There was an ominous feeling in the air. The intermediate dokkaebi was
thinking about how to make this situation worse. I had to act quickly. At
this point, I had to go for victory.

"Do you yield? Honestly, won't everyone be satisfied?"

[Everyone will be satisfied?]

I didn't say anything else. I'm sure the intermediate dokkaebi understood
without me saying anything.
[Haha, I see. Is that what you were thinking? I heard from Dokgak but you
truly put on a great show.]

The reason for the existence of the dokkaebis was the scenarios. They were
the scenarios that many constellations responded to and many constellations
liked.

In the world of the Star Stream, there was only one case where there was a
miracle that reversed the scenario. It was if the majority of constellations
saw the scenario and wanted to change the direction of the scenario.

[…Certainly, violence isn't the only stimulus.]

I tried to appeal to the constellations with disaster Shin Yoosung's situation.
I chose words to avoid the filtering and continued to ignite the
constellations by exposing information. I made them sympathize with the
disaster Shin Yoosung.

It was all to support my rebellion. As a result, this whole situation was
created. Indeed, I could hear the messages of the constellations in my ears.

[The constellation 'Bald General of Justice' respects your will.]

[The constellation 'Last Hero of Hwangsanbeol' admires your

will.] Everything was going as planned.

"If you understand then can you decide now? Give me the reward or
continue with the fifth scenario."

There was no problem with continuing the sixth scenario even if the fifth
scenario hadn't ended. It was possible to run multiple main scenarios. If the
dokkaebi was smart then he should stop while the constellations were
satisfied.
[Incarnation Kim Dokja. You are the smartest and scariest out of all the
incarnations I know.]

I felt a strange sense of incongruity from the dokkaebi's expression.

[However, it is this cleverness that is grabbing at your ankles.]

"…What does that mean?"

The dokkaebi's following words weren't for me.

[Okay Constellations. Now I will show you the story you have been waiting
for.]

Sparks filled the air. The intermediate dokkaebi was moving the scenario.

[The intermediate dokkaebi has intervened in the scenario.]

[According to the scenario contract, control of the 'Disaster of Floods Shin
Yoosung' has been transferred to the intermediate dokkaebi.]

Shin Yoosung's expression started to change at the system messages.

"N-No. Wait. I… aaaack!"

A black aura rose from disaster Shin Yoosung's body. I hurriedly shouted,
"Wait! What are you doing?"

[I am fulfilling the contract. This is a cog in the scenario.]

I only realized now what he was trying to do. It was the scenario
enforcement right. It was the power to control the fate of all 'parts' involved
in the scenario. I knew it existed in Ways of Survival but I didn't think it
would be used immediately.

[The personality of the character is forcibly changed.]
[The personality of the character 'Shin Yoosung' will be fixed to 'evil'.]

The disaster Shin Yoosung was becoming a monster. I bit my lip. The
scenario enforcement generally wasn't used because the dokkaebi
consumed a lot of probability. But to use it now…

[Many constellations are cheering the development of the scenario.]

[Many constellations hate your new drama.]

It could only be used if many constellations agreed to this development.
Dammit, why?

"Dokja-ssi?"

"Hyung!"

The party members nervously approached my side. They realized that
something was wrong. However, I couldn't understand. Why had the
constellations suddenly turned their backs on me?

Bihyung's expression was dark as he looked at the sky.

–Sorry, I tried to persuade them but it didn't work.

'Why…'

–Your reputation is worse than you expected.

The intermediate dokkaebi said, [Arrogant incarnation. Do you think the
constellation would be that easy?]

…Then what about all the favourable indirect messages?

[Well, humans originally have the habit of believing what they want to
believe.]
I had misjudged due to the indirect messages that popped up one after
another.

[Many constellations are laughing at your decision.]

[Some constellations have withdrawn their support for you.]

That's right. Not all constellations sent indirect messages. Only a small
number of constellations sent messages.

[Many constellations are wary of your intentions.]

It might be natural that public opinion was bad towards me. I cheated them
through a trick and canceled the event. The constellations probably already
knew that Bihyung's channel had a capacity of 9,999. They knew but had
been deceived by my scenario. Now they were no longer fooled.

[Constellations of the Korean Peninsula are looking at you sadly.]

[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' is looking at you with
compassion.]

Maybe I was too shallow when I thought about the constellations.

[It seems like your luck ends here, Incarnation Kim Dokja.]

"Ahhhhh!"

A disturbing aura flowed from the body of Shin Yoosung who had been
forced to become evil. It was a killing intent that felt like it could melt
flesh. The incarnations screamed and fled. I could see Yoo Joonghyuk
pulling out Splitting the Sky Sword in the distance.

[I hope you put on a good show till the end.]
I slowly withdrew from the disaster. Shin Yoosung's face distorted sadly. It
ended up like this. I quickly glanced at Yoo Joonghyuk. Things had turned
out this way and it was obvious what choice he would make.

"Wait a minute, Yoo Joonghyuk."

"You have failed."

"Don't touch the child." I hid the young Shin Yoosung behind my back. "I
won't forgive you if you touch this child."

Yoo Joonghyuk glared at me. "There is no other way."

A way… I bit my lips until they bled.

"There is a way. We need to show the constellations their favourite
scenario."

"What do you mean?"

"Defeat the disaster."

Yoo Joonghyuk's expression hardened. "It is suicide Kim Dokja. Are you
going to be a pushover?"

I saw Shin Yoosung turning into a demon and destroying everything around
her. I didn't want it to be like this. This wasn't the ending I wanted. This
damn world, even resisting a scenario became another scenario.

[Many constellations are excited by your words.]

[Many of the constellations want an exhilarating

melee.] Yes, they wanted to see this.
"Support me Yoo Joonghyuk. I will stop the

disaster." I had to give it a try.

"Kim Dokja, you…"

"I can do it."

I blinked slowly and the option I had postponed emerged in front of me.

[You have experienced the first person supporting role viewpoint.]

[You can take one of the supporting role's skills.]

[Presenting the list of available skills.]

[Please select a skill to acquire.]

I opened the list and picked an option without hesitation.

"No. 3, Beast King's Sensitivity."

[The exclusive skill 'Beast King's Sensitivity' has been acquired!]

As if waiting, an ether storm emerged from disaster Shin Yoosung's hands.
It was the ether storm that made a hole in my belly and made Yoo
Joonghyuk incapable of fighting.

I protected my party members and received the storm head on.

[The exclusive skill 'Beast King's Sensitivity Lv. 3' has been activated.]

A pure white fur cloak. It was a unique skill of Beast Lord Shin Yoosung.
More than half of my magic power was consumed activating it and I
became dizzy, but I succeeded in receiving the attack of Shin Yoosung. The
dignity of Beast King's Sensitivity didn't lose to the mighty storm.
Yoo Joonghyuk frowned. "You stole her skill but it is still impossible."

"I know."

I looked at disaster Shin Yoosung. Despite her nature being set to evil and
losing control of her body, her eyes were filled with emotions. She told
him.

「 …It's okay. Kill me. 」

Who could swing a sword after seeing those eyes? The woman who
wandered for over a thousand years and suffered. I had to kill her now.

This was the price I paid for failing to change the story… For the first time,
I felt resentful that Ways of Survival had become reality.

"Open your eyes and watch carefully." I looked up at the sky and declared.
"This is the scenario you wanted."

[The exclusive skill 'Bookmark' can now be activated.]

Now that Shin Yoosung was in her final phase, it was an unwinnable fight.
In the end, it was a fight that no one could win.

['Character Bookmarks' is activated.]

[Available Bookmark Slots: 4]

[Bringing up the list of available bookmarks.]

"I will release Delusion Demon Kim Namwoon from the 1st slot and add
Judge of Destruction Jung Heewon."
     Chapter 107: Ep. 21 – Things That Can't Be Changed, V


[The level of the Bookmark skill is low, shortening the activation time.]

[Activation Time: 30 minutes]

[Your understanding of the character is significant. You can select some of
her skills to import.]

Shin Yoosung ran towards me and I ran towards her. No one wanted to kill
each other and there was no sincerity. This was only a fight for the
constellations' amusement. Everything was a scenario and therefore
everything was fake. However, the result of this battle was that someone
was going to die.

['Judgment Time Lv. 5' has been activated.]
The activation skill was level 5. It seemed that Jung Heewon had
been training hard. Jung Heewon wasn't here but it wasn't bad. [The
constellation 'Scribe of Heaven' is embarrassed.]

[Constellations of the Absolute Good system are deep in thought.]

It was natural to be confused since someone who wasn't a judge had used
an unauthorized skill. Yet they were bound to give me permission. It was
because the presence in front of me was obviously evil.

[The Absolute Good constellations have agreed to the use of this skill.]

A hot aura sprang up from deep inside my body. It was a blind sense of
righteousness that would punish all evils in the world. The history of the
archangels who fought a holy war with the great demons passed through
my head in pieces.

–Punish evil.

Judgment Time was originally a skill used by the great valkyries. Thus, the
user of this skill received the archangels' favour.

The madness that excluded everything other than the narrow definition of
justice wriggled in my brain. Jung Heewon felt like this every time she
killed other people for me. It was terrible.

A wave of unrivaled magic power burst out from the Blade of Faith. The
ether blade resonated and moved in a straight line towards Shin Yoosung.

Blood splashed from the shoulder of the surprised Shin Yoosung. The Beast
King's Sensitivity that wasn't damaged by the shells of the Ghost Fleet was
finally torn. Drops of blood fell onto the white fur.

Hour of Judgement. The user of this skill couldn't be defeated as long as the
enemy was 'evil'.
Now all my stats rose to the point where I could resist the disaster Shin
Yoosung. Judgment Time was a fraudulent skill. There were only a few
skills in all of Ways of Survival that could give such crazy buffs.

"Everyone attack!"

I might've become stronger but Shin Yoosung's skill masteries were still
ahead of me. Thus, I needed help.

"When she is attacking normally, support using ranged attacks. When
trying a wide range attack, be sure to get behind me!" The party members
nodded at my words.

"If you don't have ranged support then kill the monsters emerging from the
Monster Gate. It is urgent as well."

In fact, it was because monsters were still emerging from Shin Yoosung's
Monster Gate that Yongsan-gu was almost on the verge of collapse.

"Everyone fight!"

The kings ordered and the full-fledged battle began. The forces of the kings
blocked the monsters coming from the Monster Gate. Most of them were
7th grade species and were quite daunting. Fortunately, the incarnations
didn't seem to be greatly pushed back.

"I'll take care of that monkey."

Lee Hyunsung ran towards the 5th grade Heavy Metal Bean.

"I will take Yoosung's king."

Lee Gilyoung moved with the young Shin Yoosung.

Queen Mirabad controlled by Shin Yoosung roared and some of the insect
kings' subordinates that Lee Gilyoung summoned rushed towards the King
Masswood. The cold breaths of the ichthyosaurs poured towards each other
and Lee Jihye stepped forward.

"Ahjussi, leave the covering fire to me."

"I'll block her movements."

Lee Jihye fired the cannons and Yoo Sangah made a trap with Arachne's
Spiderweb, keeping the movements of the disaster Shin Yoosung in check.
Of course, it was only a small help.

The shell bombardment barely damaged her and Shin Yoosung just tore
apart the web. It was better than nothing.

"Yoo Joonghyuk. Can you fight?"

Apart from me, only Yoo Joonghyuk could follow the movements of Shin
Yoosung and endure her attacks to some extent.

"…Don't worry about me."

Yoo Joonghyuk spilled blood on the floor as he stood beside me with the
Splitting the Sky Sword. He might've already used Recovery because his
condition seemed better than before. There wouldn't be long until he
received the backlash of using Recovery.

I asked, "How many minutes do you have left?"

"30 minutes. You?"

"I am the same."

It was only possible to use Bookmark for 30 minutes. Thus, I had to end it
in only 30 minutes. The black aura flowing from Shin Yoosung's body
thickened. It meant that her physical stats were increasing due to the evil
energy.
Yoo Joonghyuk's expression hardened. "…It seems that she joined hands
with a great demon to cross worlds."

Yoo Joonghyuk's guess was right. In fact, now her soul was mortgaged to a
great demon. Then that great demon turned her over to the damn dokkaebis.

[Hahaha, interesting. Very interesting.]

The intermediate dokkaebi sounded pleasantly surprised.

[The scenario is now like this.]

It was a battlefield were blood splattered and flesh was damaged. The
destruction of Seoul Dome, which I wanted to prevent, was approaching
with every second.

[Many constellations are excited by the battle.]

"Let's go."

Yoo Joonghyuk launched himself quickly along with his words. Shin
Yoosung puffed up and blew a breath towards us.

Beast King's Breath. It was an ether storm of destructive that was
comparable to the 5th grade sea species' Ice Breath.

"Avoid it!"

Yoo Joonghyuk invoked Red Phoenix Shunpo to the extreme and escaped
from the attacks of the disaster Shin Yoosung. I didn't avoid the attacks like
Yoo Joonghyuk and used Beast King's Sensitivity instead. I felt genuinely
impressed with Yoo Joonghyuk's combat senses.

The disaster was a disaster but Yoo Joonghyuk was a monster. It was only
Yoo Joonghyuk who could resist the disaster without the Judgment Time
buff. He was a strong, cool, ruthless regressor. I was relieved that he was
currently on my side.
"Do it properly, Kim Dokja!"

"I'm doing it!"

"Dammit…"

I just needed to approach and deal a blow, but it wasn't that easy. After
several successful attacks, Shin Yoosung became more violent.

She was in a berserk state and kept firing the ether storm. Her magic power
might be depleted but I was barely able to withstand it with Beast King's
Sensitivity.

Yoo Joonghyuk had dealt some blows but the damage hardly accumulated.
How long did we exchange blows? It had been already 20 minutes when I
came to my senses.

Yoo Joonghyuk's physical strength dropped sharply and the magic power
potions I drank like juice were running out.

Strong. I never thought I would struggle so much despite using Hour of
Judgement. My stiff body creaked violently. The side effects of Judgment
Time were gradually being felt.

[Hahaha! This is a really nice scenario. Constellations, don't you agree?]

I listened to the voice of the intermediate dokkaebi and moved forward with
all my strength. The fur of the Beast King's Sensitivity flapped like crazy.

My skin became black from the ether storm. One step, two steps. I got near
but time wasn't on our side. I wouldn't be able to do enough damage before
the 30 minutes was up.

Then something happened inside Shin Yoosung's body. Her body shook
like she was struck by lightning and her dark eyes temporarily recovered its
senses.
「 Attack me. 」

The disaster Shin Yoosung was controlling her body with her will.

「 Stop me. 」

I didn't say it but I heard it.

「 Protect this 'round'. 」

I broke through the temporarily weakened ether storm and ran forward with
Yoo Joonghyuk. I swung my sword and blood splattered from Shin
Yoosung's body.

[The constellation 'Scribe of Heaven' is looking at you.]

I did my best not to show the worst performance.

[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' is looking at you.]

Shin Yoosung screamed as she was cut by the blade and the storm blew
Yoo Joonghyuk back.

"…Go, Kim Dokja."

I pierced through the gap that Yoo Joonghyuk made. The Blade of Faith
dug exactly into Shin Yoosung's shoulder without hesitation.

Magic power ran through the blade and ripped through the Beast King's
Sensitivity. Then Shin Yoosung's left arm was cut off.

Blood fell. I stared into Shin Yoosung's face. Just like in Ways of Survival,
Shin Yoosung was smiling. I realized that she deliberately allowed herself
to be hit by my sword.
[A number of constellations can't take their eyes off your battle.]

"Dammit…" I smiled weakly and the sword fell from my hands.

Shin Yoosung laughed.

「 Don't you look stupid? 」

She grabbed me and threw me to the ground without any screams of anger.
However, it didn't hurt. It wasn't an attack.

「 Do you want to continue? 」

"Yes."

I swung my sword towards her and Shin Yoosung fired a breath at me
again. It was like an answer to a question. We frantically damaged each
other.

"It can't continue like this."

My Beast King's Sensitivity was losing its effect because I was lacking
magic power. Hour of Judgement strengthened my body to the limits but it
was just a temporary crutch. Blood flowed and the world spun because of
dizziness. However, I didn't stop. The damage was definitely accumulating.

[Some constellations reluctant towards you have become curious.]

Go crazy.

[Constellations roaming the battlefields are paying attention to your battle.]

Make a lot of fuss.

[Constellations of the great battlefields praise your will.]

Just wait until the day I go and pull out your tongues.
How many more blows did we exchange? My weakened body staggered
back.

[There are 30 seconds left for Bookmark.]

Some internal organs were damaged and a broken rib kept irritating my
lungs. I did the best I could yet the disaster was still strong. The recovered
eyes of Shin Yoosung were once again turning black.

In any case, this Disaster of Floods seemed stronger than the original novel.
The disaster Shin Yoosung looked at me with anxious eyes.

「 It isn't enough. 」

She couldn't commit suicide. The intermediate dokkaebi wouldn't allow her
to die that way. This was the limit that she could penalize herself. I was also
at my limit in a different way.

「 How are you going to stop me? 」

"Don't worry. They'll come soon. The person who will stop you."

From the beginning, I had no intention of killing Shin Yoosung with my
own hands. It was impossible for Yoo Joonghyuk in his current state. There
was still one person remaining who could kill her.

The moment Shin Yoosung's mouth was about to open, the ground around
her exploded.

There was the distant roar of artillery. A woman dressed in a blue prison
uniform appeared from the north. The monsters split apart and troops
advanced to this side. A woman in a mask stood in the middle and
commanded the army.
The King of Wanderers. I thought she had gone somewhere but she had
been taking care of the monsters as she advanced from the north. However,
they weren't the one I was waiting for.

I looked at a person who was running this way. The woman turned this way
and asked, "Sorry, am I late?"

"Just a bit late."

"Stop pretending. Aren't you still alive?"

The Judge of Destruction. 10 days later, Jung Heewon was much more
restrained than I knew. She lightly patted my shoulders and moved.

"Leave it to me and take a break."

A red aura rose as she activated Hour of Judgement. It was much more
powerful than the skill I stole. Jung Heewon was the last card I had left. If
this failed…

Had I done enough damage to Shin Yoosung? Would Jung Heewon finish
the job well?

"What are you so worried about?" Jung Heewon asked with a smile.
Confidence that was different than usual filled her voice. It wasn't just
Judgment Time that she believed in.

[The constellation 'Scribe of Heaven' is talking to himself.]

[The constellation 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' shows hostility towards
Jung Heewon's sponsor.]

That reminded me, Jung Heewon had a sponsor. Who had she chosen? Shin
Yoosung watched Jung Heewon with shaky eyes.

「 You… 」
"I roughly know the situation. My sponsor was making a lot of noise along
the way." Jung Heewon faced Shin Yoosung with sad eyes. "Thus, there is
no need to worry."

Jung Heewon lightly swept her sword in front of her. Flames started to rise
from the places her hands touched.

It was early in the morning. On a night where the darkness of Seoul was the
darkest, Jung Heewon's blade burned. The flames on the blade were
brighter than any flames I had seen. It was the holy white flames of a
stigma that would punish all evil.

[Hell Flames Ignition.]

I naturally knew this stigma very well. I remembered the description of the
stigma from Ways of Survival.

In some cases, it was one of the greatest stigmas of Ways of Survival and
boasted powerful destructive power comparable to the stigma of The Great
Sage, Heaven's Equal.

Hell Flames Ignition was the stigma of Demon-like Judge of Fire.

Jung Heewon laughed coldly. "I will finish this damn scenario."

The archangel Uriel chose Jung Heewon as an incarnation.
    Chapter 108: Ep. 21 – Things That Can't Be Changed, VI


Jung Heewon ran forward. Her muscles were strengthened by Judgment
Time to the limit and the Demon Slaying buff gave her a sharp edge.

Along with Uriel's Hell Flames Ignition, her combat power was enhanced
to the most ideal form.

The blazing flames of judgment. They weren't judging Shin Yoosung. Even
so, it was Shin Yoosung who would receive the flames.

[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' is watching the battlefield
with sad eyes.]

Jung Heewon's blade declared the opening.

[The character 'Jung Heewon' has used Hell Flames Ignition Lv. 1.]

The stigma was only level one but the hell flames burned through Shin
Yoosung's ether storm.
The power of a great demon, the Beast King's Breath poured out but Jung
Heewon didn't care. She just grasped her sword as firmly as possible and
drew a line connecting the sky and earth. The Beast King's Breath turned to
smoke as soon as it met Hell Flames Ignition.

Someone muttered, "Oh my god, what is that?"

Hell Flames Ignition was a stigma that could evaporate the sea of a planet
when it reached the final level. When the 'Messiah' appeared in the original
novel, it was Uriel who opened the way in preparation for him.

The archangel feared by all demons, the great demons' enemy that was
closest to a great demon.

Shin Yoosung nodded as she saw Jung Heewon rushing through the flames.

「 I see. Uriel. You were waiting for this. 」

The disaster didn't back down in the presence of the terrible archangel.

「 It is enough to make an ending. 」

No, she looked rather relaxed. It was as if she had finally fulfilled her duty.

The ether wrapped around Shin Yoosung's fist and the flames that clung to
Jung Heewon's blade collided. Shin Yoosung stumbled and Jung Heewon
pushed forward without missing this gap. No matter how good the
overlapped skills, the powerful buffs would have a short duration.

Jung Heewon was well aware of this and accelerated her attacks. The
surrounding land was affected by the holy flames.

Shin Yoosung persisted despite being long exhausted. She was like a
seasoned actor playing the last performance of her life as she tried her best
to live.

[Many constellations are excited about your design.]
The constellations that came over from Dokgak's channel were excited.
[15,000 coins have been sponsored.]

The hateful donations of the constellations rose sharply. Affection and
hatred were just a moment of entertainment for the constellations.
Unfortunately, the story that lasted a moment for them was a life for
humans.

[Constellations of the Korean Peninsula are looking at you sadly.]

In front of the many watchers, I drew the ending of this scenario by myself.

[The constellation 'Secretive Plotter' is focused on your choice.]

In the meantime, Jung Heewon had turned the Beast King's Sensitivity into
rags and the flames of Hell Flames Ignition were gradually burning Shin
Yoosung. Injuries were also piling up on Jung Heewon's body. It was a
close match but victory wasn't on the side of the exhausted Shin Yoosung.

Jung Heewon ignored all defenses and plunged through the ether storm,
stabbing her sword into Shin Yoosung's belly.

A bright blaze of flames surrounded Shin Yoosung's body. The holy flames
burned at the energy of the great demon in her body. The black aura coming
from her turned to smoke.

Blood splattered from the place where the sword was pulled out. Shin
Yoosung looked down at her blood like it was a prop on a stage. It was
finally settled.

I suddenly saw the collapsed King Masswood and Heavy Metal Bean. The
Monster Gate had closed and the fight against the monsters was ending. I
approached Shin Yoosung.

Control of her flesh had come back but her body wasn't normal. Shin
Yoosung looked down at her body and stated.
「 …I am dying now. 」

In normal cases, the Beast Lord wouldn't die from these wounds. The Beast
King's Vitality was as good as Yoo Joonghyuk's Recovery. Unfortunately,

she was hit by Hell Flames Ignition.

The flames of hell were deeply embedded in her body, burning her vitality
to extinguish all evil. Uriel's stigma was a fire that never burned out until all
the evil was gone.

[The exclusive skill, 'Fourth Wall' is shaking!]

[Due to excessive immersion, stage 2 of Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint
will always be activated.]

The fire was inside her body and Shin Yoosung would never survive. Shin
Yoosung watched me and smiled weakly. "I'm glad to be here during this
round of regression. It was good to hear Captain say those words."

「 It hurts. I'm going to disappear like this. 」

"Now I can die in peace. Something really might change."

「 I don't want to die… 」

The omniscience was a curse. Knowing someone's heart meant always
deceiving someone.

She smiled and stared up at the air. There was an intermediate dokkaebi
with a stiff expression. "I'm going to die now. Isn't it okay as a drama? This
was a great scenario."

[Some constellations are nodding.]

[Some constellations are complaining.]
The intermediate dokkaebi was silent. Well, he hadn't expected this. The
scenario was completed but it wasn't as he intended. Now he would pay for
what he intended.

I looked back and saw Yoo Joonghyuk approaching. He asked, "Is she
going to die?"

"…Perhaps."

"You must be lacking hatred."

This bastard was really…

Yoo Joonghyuk pulled out his sword. I was about to stop him from trying to
kill Shin Yoosung when his Splitting the Sky Sword stopped. The cold
blade was supporting Shin Yoosung's head. Shin Yoosung said, "Hold on
until the end. I will die soon Captain."

Shin Yoosung's thoughts flowed into my ears.

「 There is something I want to hear from you. 」

「 Just once. 」

「 I wish to hear it just once. 」

They were words that could never be said. Yoo Joonghyuk couldn't hear
these words and spoke nonchalantly. "I have something to ask."

"What is it?"

I felt miserable as I saw the anticipation on Shin Yoosung's face. It was
because I knew her expectations would never be rewarded.

"Who is the great demon that helped you cross over to this world?"
She stared blankly at Yoo Joonghyuk for a moment before laughing. "…
Captain is the captain to the end."

「 You don't change. 」

"Tell me."

"Have you heard of the 'Great Demon of the Horizon'?"

「 That is why I admired you. 」

"I know the name."

"If Captain's luck is bad, you will meet him soon. However, never fight
him. It is almost impossible for Captain to kill him…"

「 For a long time, a really long time… 」

Her earnest sincerity didn't reach its target and I struggled. I wanted to say
something. This stupid Yoo Joonghyuk, who couldn't hear the vivid voice
in front of him. The moment I opened my mouth, Shin Yoosung's hand
grabbed me.

Yoo Joonghyuk kept speaking. "I will remember."

Yoo Joonghyuk turned around at these words. Then Yoo Joonghyuk's inner
thoughts were conveyed to me.

「 I will get revenge for you. 」

I trembled at the sadness in these words. I looked down at disaster Shin
Yoosung. I see. This person was already aware of it. She didn't need to hear
it to already know.

Something was pouring down from Shin Yoosung's eyes. For the first time,
I thought that Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint might not be omniscient.
「 Goodbye, Captain. 」

「 Good job. 」

「 I'll leave it to you. 」

「 Rest. 」

Only a few stray sentences were left as I stared at the two people. Their
thoughts had definitely reached each other. I clearly read this story. Then
Shin Yoosung started to scatter into ashes.

「 Pretty… 」

The young Shin Yoosung approached me and held onto me. What did she
feel when she saw her future self disappearing? No matter how many books
I read, there were some emotions I couldn't reach. The disaster Shin
Yoosung smiled at me and the young Shin Yoosung.

「 …I'm envious. 」

The lower body of the disaster Shin Yoosung had almost disappeared. The
speed of her destruction was accelerating.

[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' has closed her eyes.]

[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' is sighing.]

As the constellations watched her, I kneeled and grabbed the hand of the
disaster Shin Yoosung. Shin Yoosung was surprised by my unexpected
behaviour and looked at me.

I invoked Beast King's Sensitivity with my last remaining magic power. It
was to pass on a gift to her.
The mysterious senses of the beast kings touched and for a short moment,
Shin Yoosung's soul was connected to mine. It was a sensibility that only
beasts shared.

The passing wind whispered something. It was a story that neither the
constellations or dokkaebi could hear. The dying Shin Yoosung's eyes
widened like she couldn't believe it.

「 …Are you serious? Really? 」

Fortunately, the message was properly delivered. Her chest had already
turned to ashes and now she had no voice left.

「 Why… 」

Tears slowly filled her eyes. She tried to tell me something but the cold
wind stopped her. The connected films of two worlds were breaking again.

The pieces that she was made of turned to ashes and scattered. Her eyes,
nose and mouth. Her voice. The person who lived over one thousand years
scattered into pure white ashes like snow.

The ashes like a trail as it disappeared into the sky. It was like a distant
journey or even a dance.

I looked up at the faint traces drifting in the air. I couldn't believe it was real
and the young Shin Yoosung held onto me tightly.

"Did she really die?"

I steadied my heart.

"Can't you change it? Really?"

Then she nodded.

"Ahhh. Ah…"
Lee Gilyoung grabbed my sleeve and wiped his eyes with it. Yoo Sangah
was crying and I didn't know why but Lee Hyunsung was also tearful. Yoo
Joonghyuk didn't cry while only Lee Jihye didn't know the exact situation.
"…Why is everyone crying? I am also sad."

My forehead was cold and sleet was falling from the misty sky. There was
no snow or rain. The cold sensation relieved the people. It was funny.
Humans felt most alive when they confirmed the death of another.

"Ah…"

The people of Seoul Dome collapsed once their tension disappeared. There
were people laughing, crying or feeling angry.

The donations of the constellation flowed here and there. The responses
were different but there was one thing they all agreed on.

The 'Disaster of Floods' Shin Yoosung had died.

There was a frozen intermediate dokkaebi staring up at the sky. Bihyung,
who had been watching silently, finally opened his mouth.

[Intermediate dokkaebi. The scenario has ended.]

[ How? This… ]

[If you don't do it then I will end it.]

A moment later, a message was heard.

[The fifth main scenario is activated!]

[The compensation settlement is being prepared.]

Finally, the scenario declared her death. The future Shin Yoosung had died
and the disaster was over. This was the conclusion of the fifth scenario.
Everyone thought so and believed so.
.

.

.

To be exact, everyone except me had to believe this. From beginning to
end, everything had to be a perfect drama. It was a drama that declared
things couldn't be changed.

A tragedy that followed the constellations and scenario. This was the only
way for the 41st regression Shin Yoosung to escape from the damn
scenario.

At this moment, the young Shin Yoosung's hand heated up.

"I will kill…" The girl's eyes were fixed on the intermediate dokkaebi
floating in the air. "That dokkaebi, I'll kill him."

I was trying to restrain her when sparks flew in the air. The sky was
crumbling and a portal was opening.

Two white dokkaebis emerged from the portal. The low-grade dokkaebis
found the two dokkaebis wearing white armour and backed away at once.
It was natural.

These dokkaebis were people that all dokkaebis hoped to never meet. The
bureau. They were the dokkaebis of the Executive Branch, responsible for
investigating the 'probability' in scenarios. The two dokkaebis had a
fearsome atmosphere as they approached the intermediate dokkaebi and
arrested him.

[ …Executives. What are you doing?]

An executive dokkaebi declared to the shocked intermediate dokkaebi.
[Intermediate dokkaebi 'Paul'. You shall be arrested for violating the Star
Stream regulations.]
              Chapter 109: Ep. 22 – Three Promises, I


The Executive Branch's emergency arrest.

According to Ways of Survival, an emergency arrest was only possible
when a dokkaebi acted in a manner that severely violated the probability of
a scenario.

[Intermediate dokkaebi 'Paul'. From now on, you will be led to the
Executive Branch. You will remain silent about all scenarios and be
deprived of all progress in the main scenarios.]

The expression of the intermediate dokkaebi Paul kept changing.

[You will lose the achievement points of all the scenarios you have built up
and will be demoted to a low-grade dokkaebi after your punishment…]

[D-Demoted? Wait! Wait a minute!]
The intermediate dokkaebi Paul hurriedly shouted. He made an outraged
expression and looked at the dokkaebis around him.

[A sudden demotion? Shouldn't you tell me what I did wrong?]

[Are you really asking because you don't know?]

Another dokkaebi of the Executive Branch asked. Paul hesitated for a
moment at the dignified voice before continuing.

[I don't know. What the hell did I do wrong?]

He even had the audacity to move forward.

[Look at the constellations. Aren't they all happy? Didn't the scenario end
brilliantly?]

The executive dokkaebi frowned at Paul's confident words.

[There is no problem with the probability. I used the scenario enforcement
with the consent of the constellations and the constellation also…]

[…This is the problem with streamers. They sing songs of the
constellations.]

Not all dokkaebis respected the constellations. It was because among the
dokkaebis of the Executive Branch, there were some who had once been
constellations.

They were constellations but they lost their characteristics and were forced
to live as dokkaebis. They were the dokkaebis of the Executive Branch.
Paul continued despite his customers being insulted.

[Your words are going too far.]

[Don't panic Paul.]
[You might be an enforcer but I can't tolerate insults to my customers.]

Paul rode the momentum and continued.


[I can guess why the executives came here. It is probably because I used the
enforcement rights.]

[The scenario enforcement can only be used when the majority of
constellations support the probability of the scenario.]

[I'm aware of that. Otherwise, there is the risk of a probability storm. But
the constellations' satisfaction is high…]

[Satisfaction? Paul, look at yourself and tell me.]

Paul looked down at himself and he paled.

[T-This…?]

The space around him was filled with blue sparks. It was the forerunner of a
probability storm.

[Why am I receiving a probability storm…?]

The probability storm was a punishment for going against the flow. The
probability of the world now wanted to erase Paul's existence. The enforcer
dokkaebis laughed.

[The enforcement right is a power that demands the greatest amount of
probability from a dokkaebi. Did you think you would be safe using this
authority for such a crude development?]

[That, that isn't the case!]

[Paul. You had a chance to end the scenario without using the executive
rights. It was a fresh development I had never seen before. Why did you
stop it? Thanks to your brutality, an emergency was dropped on Seoul
Dome's bureau.]

[T-That… no, wait a minute. I exercised the enforcement rights according
to the opinions of the constellations!!] Paul looked around.

[C-Constellations! Didn't you agree with my development?]

However, no constellations answered.

[…Constellations?]

The numerous indirect messages from the constellations died out.

[Unbelievable… Why?]

All the constellations who supported his development had left the Korean
channels.

The executive frowned. [You stupid fool. Can't you see that the
constellations are gone?]

Many of the constellations who wanted to kill me and who instigated him
had left the Korean peninsula in large numbers once it turned into a 'drama'.

It was natural. It was strange to keep watching when an unwanted
development occurred. In fact, Bihyung's channel lost close to a third of its
subscribers.

The remaining ones were:

[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' is looking at the intermediate
dokkaebi 'Paul'.]

[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' is chuckling at the
intermediate dokkaebi 'Paul'.]
[The constellation 'Secretive Plotter' is mocking the intermediate dokkaebi
'Paul'.]

…

They were all constellations who didn't agree with the intermediate
dokkaebi's development.

[N-No. I can't be destroyed in this way. Executive!]

[Don't worry. You won't be destroyed.]

[W-What does this mean…?]

A glimmer of hope appeared on Paul's face.

The executive dokkaebi said something that turned off the light completely.

[You will be given a worse punishment than destruction. Our bureau
received a large probability debt because of you.]

[The executives will use Dokkaebi Paul's Redemption Code.]

Then the body of the dokkaebi Paul was forcibly pulled into the world. The
intermediate dokkaebi Paul trembled. His true voice emerged because he
lost his broadcasting rights.

"T-This is a conspiracy. It can't be like this!"

Then Bihyung spoke from beside him,

[This is why you didn't want to finish the scenario quickly.]

"Bihyung!"

In the end, Paul exploded. Paul held the Redemption Code and pointed at
Bihyung.
"Executives! Arrest him as well. I have evidence that his channel broke the
rules of the Star Stream!"

[He will naturally come along as well.]

Paul's expression brightened. However, the people of Korea knew that
people should listen to the dokkaebis' words to the end.

[It is because he is the dokkaebi who called us.]

"W-What… don't tell me?"

The executive dokkaebi said.

[Yes, the dokkaebi who reported you is Bihyung.]

Bihyung briefly waved towards the red-eyed Paul. The executive smiled
coldly.

[Dokkaebi Bihyung. He is a very good dokkaebi. Look at his humility. He
has the integrity of a streamer who ignores everything and immerses
himself in the scenarios. It is different from you and the dokkaebis who
only wear luxurious clothing.]

Bihyung had a shy expression on his face. He didn't know that his poverty
would help him in this way.

"N-No! That guy Bihyung is…!"

[Shut up.]

Paul screamed terribly from where he was tied to the Redemption Code.
The executive dokkaebi kept talking.

[You have been punished twice before. This is your third time. You are
familiar with the third punishment, right?]
"T-This is ridiculous! Do you think my superiors will allow this? You are
making a mistake right now. If you touch me…"

[I will listen to your bullshit after going to the bureau.]

A glowing portal appeared in the air. It was finally time to say goodbye to
the intermediate dokkaebi. Perhaps I wouldn't see him in the future
scenarios anymore. Paul's eyes glared at me. A flame burned inside me the
moment I met his eyes.

[The 'Fourth Wall' is shaking due to your high emotions.]

The Shin Yoosung of the future had scattered into ash. She might've been
saved if it wasn't for the intermediate dokkaebi.

She could never return to her time but she might've been able to live in this
new world. The intermediate dokkaebi trampled on that last possibility.
That was why I opened my mouth. "Wait a minute."

He might receive the death punishment but I couldn't be satisfied. My
words shocked my party members.

[…Are you calling us?]

The dokkaebis were surprised. They didn't expect an incarnation to stop the
dokkaebis of the Executive Branch. The executive dokkaebi looked at me
quietly and opened his mouth.

[That's right. You are the incarnation Kim Dokja. Right?]

The other executive dokkaebi laughed.

[Do you know this person?]

[He is a famous incarnation in this area. He is one of the strongest
incarnations on the peninsula but he hasn't signed with a sponsor.]
[Hoh?]

I watched the leisurely dokkaebis and spoke to Bihyung through the
Dokkaebi Communication.

'Bihyung. I'll give you 100,000 coins'.

–What?

Bihyung's eyes widened.

'Promote me to a platinum member of the Dokkaebi Bag'.

–No, why all of a sudden?

'Just do it'.

–Shit…

I looked at the executives and rushed Bihyung. Bihyung sighed and started
to manipulate something in the air.

[100,000 coins have been consumed.]

[Congratulations! You have become a platinum member of the Dokkaebi
Bag!]

Originally, there would be splendid special effects for the promotion but I
asked Bihyung to omit it. Unlike the gold membership that could be
obtained for 5,000 coins, the treatment of platinum members were different.
[Yes, Incarnation Kim Dokja. Why did you call us?]

The executives didn't know about my promotion and asked me again. These
dokkaebis were really big and I was nervous facing them. They might've
fallen but some of them were originally great people.
I breathed lightly and opened my mouth. "I am requesting the Dokkaebi
Solo Meeting Right."

[What?]

The executive dokkaebis were confused by my words. Then laughter soon
emerged.

[Only platinum members can ask for the solo meeting right… Don't tell
me?]

"That's right. Please check it."

The two dokkaebis looked at each other again. They manipulated the
system to identify a few things and soon let out a cry of amazement.

[It is real.]

[How can an incarnation become a platinum member?]

"Aren't I qualified now?"

The executives hesitated for a moment before nodding.

[That's right. What do you want with the solo meeting right? The platinum
qualifications allows you to meet with a senior dokkaebi. The appointment
schedule…]

"I don't want that. The dokkaebi I want is currently with you." I pointed a
finger at the dokkaebi I wanted. "I want a solo meeting with the
intermediate dokkaebi Paul."
              Chapter 110: Ep. 22 – Three Promises, II


The two executive dokkaebis glanced at each other. How long did this last?
Then the two dokkaebis burst out laughing at the same time.

[Kuk. Ahahaha!]

[Interesting. Don't tell me…]

The smart executives seemed to have noticed something. Paul watched the
scene with a puzzled expression.

[I will allow a solo meeting with the dokkaebi Paul.]

[The free solo time is 20 minutes.]

The executives of the bureau agreed to my request like it was interesting. I
figured they would do this.

Originally, the executives didn't like streamers. They were closer to the
'subscribers' than the 'streamers'. The moment they spoke, a transparent
dome formed around me and Paul. The original 'solo meeting right' was a
space for constellations and dokkaebis to secretly meet.

[The solo meeting with the intermediate dokkaebi Paul has begun.]

However, the usage could be changed according to the user. I saw Bihyung
talking to the executives outside the dome.

Paul was trapped with me and revealed his hostility. "Why did you want to
see me? Did you want to pick a fight?"

His body was still affected by the executive dokkaebi's Redemption Code.
As long as the code existed, Paul wouldn't be able to use his own power as
well as the authority of a dokkaebi. In other words, the person in front of
me was completely helpless.

"Don't bluff. I know your current situation."

Paul winced and withdrew to the edge of the dome. Yet there was still a
smile on his face. "Haha, I see. I know what you are thinking. Do you want
to get revenge for that slave?"

"…"

"How funny. Don't you know it is a superficial human desire? Yes, you can
try it once. I don't know how you found about the solo meeting rights but
this is a place where we can't hurt each other. No matter how hard you
try…!"

I ran to him and punched him as hard as I could. Blue blood emerged from
his nose and the person who couldn't grasp the situation screamed and
belatedly collapsed. I told him, "I can't kill you but I can beat you to a
pulp." "Keooook! You dare…!"
"Yes, now your true nature is emerging. I don't want to hear those
disgusting honorifics."

"Heok, kuheok…"

"Is this the first time you are feeling pain? You must've never been beaten
up like this after living as a dokkaebi."

"K-Kuhut! Kuhuhut…" Paul was still smiling despite his blood
dripping down. "You made a mistake just now. There are special rules
in place to prevent people like you from exploiting the solo meeting
rights." Then the system message arrived like it had been waiting.

[You have injured the dokkaebi in the solo meeting space.]

[500 coins have been consumed as a penalty.]

These dokkaebi, they were really great. They prepared a penalty in case the
constellations tried anything. It was a coins penalty. However, I was aware
of the penalty and just shrugged.

Paul laughed as he wiped off his blood. "Foolish human. You are bringing
destruction on yourself with your anger. Yes, try to hit me as many times as
you like. The coins you have at the moment…"

"How much coins do you think I have?" Paul fell silent. "Isn't it strange?
How could I become a platinum member when I am an incarnation?"

I grinned at his shaky eyes. "I have a lot of coins. I made a lot of money
thanks to you."

My fists descended towards the pale Paul. The damn scenarios I
experienced so far passed through my head.

[Coins Possessed: 205,902 C]
I remembered Shin Yoosung's dying appearance. These were among the
things I told her:

–That dokkaebi, I'll beat you to death.

This was the first promise I would keep.

[500 coins have been consumed as a penalty.]

Once again, my fist moved and his nose was broken. I didn't say that it was
someone's share. In the first place, this couldn't be anyone's share.

[500 coins have been consumed as a penalty.]

"Kuaaak! A-An insignificant human dares…!"

Peeeok-!

[500 coins have been consumed as a penalty.] "Y-

You won't be safe if you do this to me…!" Peeeok-!

[500 coins have been consumed as a penalty.]

"I'll kill you! I will surely kill you…!"

Peeeok-!

[500 coins have been consumed as a penalty.]

"W-Wait a minute! Wait! Stop…"

His frightened body curled up and I stopped my fists for the first time. For a
moment, hope filled his eyes.

"Y-Yes. You thought well. There is nothing about doing this here…"
I watched him hurriedly speaking with honorifics and asked, "Did you
stop?"

"What?"

"When Yoosung asked you to stop, did you?"

I quietly looked down at him. He didn't say anything and just looked at the
ground. Then he raised head and stared at the sky. He felt resentment for
the ones who made him like this.

"This doesn't mean anything! Your dead companion won't come back to
life!"

My dead colleagues wouldn't come back to life. He was right.

"It means something." However, I raised my fist to the trembling guy.
"So what if she is dead. Shin Yoosung would've done this as well."
Peeeok-!

Paul's fangs protruded as he rolled across the ground.

"Lee Hyunsung would've done so as well. Yoo Sangah and Lee Gilyoung
also."

My fist slammed into his belly.

"Maybe… that bastard Yoo Joonghyuk…"

My companions outside the dome were looking this way.

Shin Yoosung was forming fists with red eyes. Lee Jihye and Lee Gilyoung
were shouting something. Lee Hyunsung's eyes were red as he made a
serious expression and Yoo Sangah was staring at me with wide eyes. Yoo
Joonghyuk was the last one I looked at before glancing back at Paul.
"I-I am outside the scenario! You can't earn coins by doing this! It won't
benefit you!"

Coins…

Yes, only the dokkaebis would think like this. Some stories would become
coins. Some stories wouldn't become coins.

"Maybe that is true."

None of the constellations had made a bounty scenario, nor was there a
subscenario. However, this behaviour was meaningful. Nobody was making
me do this.

"I'm not intending to get any benefits from this."

"W-What?"

Since the fall of the world, coins had become the principle behind every
human's actions. They moved if the constellations gave coins and didn't
move if there were no coins. Still, humans often moved regardless of
whether there were coins or not.

"You don't know it but humans are animals that seek for the meaning of life
through these things."

"W-What…kuoock!"

I raised my fist and started beating him again.

Peeeok-!

The subsequent punches crushed his face, ribs and joints. I didn't have to
control my power because there was no fear of him dying. One blow was
the best blow. Every time bones broke, something exploded inside of me.
[500 coins have been consumed as a penalty.]

In fact, I knew.

[500 coins have been consumed as a penalty.]

I knew very well. No matter how hard I beat him up, it wouldn't give me
any comfort over Shin Yoosung's death. The dead Shin Yoosung would
never see this sight yet I still moved my fists. I hit and hit him again.

Peeeok-!

It was just like Yoo Joonghyuk. He kept repeated his regressions until the
last moment, even if no one knew his cause.

[500 coins have been consumed as a penalty.]

Then the message of a constellation was heard.

[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' is excited about the
unseen development.]

[500 coins have been sponsored.]

I stopped punching for a moment and stared up at the sky. Even this was a
story to the constellations.

"It isn't an act this time."

[You have returned the 500 sponsored coins to the constellation.]

[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' is very embarrassed.]

Think of it as a free service. Now things would be good for me.

[The constellation 'Secretive Plotter' is interested in your actions.]
[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' is thrilled with your actions.]

I started punching again. There were only the sounds of the dokkaebi's skin
bursting and intermittent groaning.

The constellations silently watched what I was doing. No one gave me any
coins but I could feel them watching me. Sometimes, this alone was
sufficient.

"U-Uhhh… I was wrong. S-Spare me! P-Please! Please!" Paul couldn't
endure it anymore and dragged his body to the edge of the dome.

The wall of the dome made a faint sound but the executives didn't respond.
Rather, they were pleased with my actions. Maybe they would be saying
something like this:

「 That coin making bastard. 」

「 Damn streamer scum. 」

The executive dokkaebis didn't like streamers. The executives who evolved
from constellations were good at fighting but had no talent in leading the
scenarios.

Shortly after, Paul's body became completely ragged. I grabbed at his
bloody neck. At this point, I asked what I really wanted to know. "Where is
Shin
Yoosung's soul right now?"




Dead souls that were part of the scenario couldn't escape from the confines
of the contract, even in death. It would've been different if the contract itself
had been destroyed.
The intermediate dokkaebi Paul opened his mouth after he was hit a few
more times.

[T…That. I also don't know. You borrowed the power of an archangel
and… our contract was destroyed…]

Indeed, it was like this. The dokkaebis had been handed the 'disaster Shin
Yoosung' by a great demon. In the course of the transfer, the strings of the
contract were created using the great demon's power.

Then Uriel's Hell Flames Ignition had burned those strings. In other words,
Shin Yoosung's soul was now floating around the world.

[Y-You. Absolutely, can't, regain, companion… Her soul, soon, the
labyrinth…]

Paul finally collapsed.

[The 'Dokkaebi Solo Meeting Rights' has ended.]

The transparent dome disappeared and the executives whistled.

[Oh, you are in terrible shape even before the disciplinary hearing.]

They glanced at me before moving away with delighted smiles. I watched
Bihyung hurriedly chase after them and asked,

'Did you get back the money?'

–Of course. But didn't you use too many coins?

'I still have a lot left'.

I hit Paul exactly 124 times.

[Coins Possessed: 143,902 C]
Bihyung sighed as he glanced at me.

–I won't be able to communicate with you after entering the bureau. I will
keep the channel open so don't get into trouble in the meantime. Please.

Watching Bihyung act like a mother-hen, I thought to myself that this was
good. Because without him, there wouldn't be anyone who'd question the
things I'd do from now on.

[The scenario error will delay further compensation settlement.]

The administrator of the main scenario had completely left the scene and
the scenario development was likely to be stagnant for a bit. It should only
be a day or two but that was enough time.

I looked up at the dokkaebis disappearing into the portal and recalled the
last conversation I had with Shin Yoosung.

–Don't worry. You won't die.

–What do you mean?

–I can help you resurrect. I've resurrected twice so it isn't as bad as you
think.

In fact, I tried to avoid using this method until the end. After all, according
to the design, she must 'die once'. There was also no guarantee that she
could revive again.

–I don't know how long it will take. If you just wait and don't give up, I will
surely revive you.

If Shin Yoosung's soul had fallen in to the labyrinth of the world, it was
almost impossible to revive her again. However, that wasn't necessarily the
case. She would surely survive if I could regain her soul. The problem was
'how' to find her soul.
I suddenly looked back at Yoo Sangah. "Yoo Sangah-ssi."

"Yes."

Shin Yoosung's soul might enter a new world line but in the all, all souls
escaped from this world through the 'Underworld'.

I remembered some constellations related to the afterlife. All of them were
in a place I didn't dare touch or were beyond my reach. Still, there was one
person that I could talk to.

"Can you call the Abandoned Lover of the Labyrinth here?"

Yoo Sangah hesitated for a moment before nodding. After a while, faint
sparks appeared around her. It wasn't the previous method of directly
descending due to the increased probability consumption but it was certain
that Ariadne nestled inside her.

I opened my mouth. "Olympus. I want to do business with you."

The sparks bouncing around the area were rough. Well, our last encounter
wasn't great. This time, I had to make concessions. I took a deep breath
before getting to the point.

"Let me meet with the King of Hell."

Now it was time to keep the second promise.
             Chapter 111: Ep. 22 – Three Promises, III


I could see Olympus's answer from Yoo Sangah's expression. She became
red and then paled. Based on Yoo Sangah's eyes, I thought I was too hasty
in bringing up the story.

"That…Dokja-ssi."

I wondered what she had heard to make her hesitate while watching me. I
felt sorry for some reason.

"Can you tell me what the sponsor said?"

Sparks flew from Yoo Sangah's body. Ariadne seemed to be running wild. I
waited a bit until the situation calmed down. I hadn't realized the aftermath
of the three questions and answers would be so large. The sparks soon
subsided and Yoo Sangah spoke in a mixed voice. "The Father of the Rich
Night isn't someone who can be easily met…"
The Father of the Rich Night. It was the modifier given to King Hades, one
of the three head gods of Olympus.

One of the three head gods of Olympus, he resided in a famous place that
the '12 gods of Olympus' couldn't enter. Hades was far too great for Ariadne
to contact him.

I quickly thanked her. "Thank you Yoo Sangah-ssi."

"By the way, Dokja-ssi…"

The smart Yoo Sangah probably already knew that the Father of the Rich
Night was Hades. She had a vague idea of why I was looking for Hades.

The story of Orpheus, who visited the Underworld in order to revive his
wife Eurydice, was a famous myth in South Korea.

"…Is it possible?" Yoo Sangah wondered.

As a rule, resurrecting the dead was impossible.

I was subjected to the probability correction of the King of No Killing
effect, but in most cases, there was no such correction. It was the same for
Shin Yoosung. If resurrection was possible then Yoo Joonghyuk wouldn't
have needed to regress.

Yet if I could somehow obtain her soul…

"I can't tell you the details right now. I'm sorry."

I didn't want to speak about my future plans in a situation where the
constellations were staring at me. There were many constellations who
disliked me due to the previous situation.

I threw the bait and now I had to wait and see if they bit. The important
thing was to be patient.
I looked at the people around me and opened my mouth. "Shall we organize
things?"

Then my party members approached me one by one, as if they had been
waiting. Shin Yoosung and Lee Gilyoung were with Lee Hyunsung, while
Lee Jihye stood in a distant place with a slightly sulky expression.

I heard the voice of a low-grade dokkaebi.

[I am the dokkaebi 'Youngki', who will temporarily take charge of the
compensation settlement.]

He was a newbie dokkaebi and spoke in a slightly stiff voice. [I

will now settle the additional compensation for the fifth scenario.]

Perhaps all the higher level dokkaebis had disappeared.

[You have received the 'Ellain Forest's Vital Energy'.]

People caught the small fruit that fell from the air.

[This is the most popular recovery item in the Star Stream. Even if you are
seriously injured, you can recover quickly by eating this and sleeping.]

It was the first time I had seen such a polite dokkaebi and it was hard to
believe. Then dokkaebi talked to me and some other people.

[Additional compensation for the key contributors will be given this
evening. Thank you for all your hard work. I hope you cheer up in the
following scenarios.]

The voice disappeared and I watched all the people holding the fruit.
Characters I didn't know would be dead and some people would be dying
right now. Still, we survived. The party members weren't sure if they should
feel grateful or sad. Once this happened, someone was bound to act as the
representative.
I stared at them and slowly opened my mouth. "Everyone, you have
suffered."

The moment when nothing was decided only remained for a moment.
Sadness was sadness and happiness was happiness. If we made decisions
then at least these moments would remain meaningful.

"You really struggled."

Relief slowly filled the party members' faces as I didn't say anything about
rewards. They deserved it.

Lee Jihye was the one who spoke first. "…By the way, it was really
shocking ahjussi. You looked cooler than Master for a moment? I
acknowledge you."

Then Lee Hyunsung and Jung Heewon also opened their mouths.

"…It was wonderful."

"I felt refreshed."

…These people, this was all they wanted to say to me? A wry smile
appeared on my face as they started making a fuss. The biggest crisis of the
beginning scenarios was over and Seoul was protected. For the time being,
Seoul wouldn't be threatened until a few scenarios had passed.

"Dokja-ssi also suffered." Yoo Sangah stared at me and smiled brightly.

Maybe this was the reward given to me.

There was the sound of something hitting me and Shin Yoosung placed her
forehead against my side. Lee Gilyoung was somewhat disgruntled but he
didn't say anything. I placed my hand lightly on Shin Yoosung's head.

…Yes, this as well.
In the evening, the additional compensation for the main contributors
began.
There were three main contributors who received additional compensation.
They were me, Jung Heewon and Yoo Joonghyuk.

[The additional compensation for the fifth scenario is a B-grade skill.]
Someone else might say that a B-grade skill as a reward wasn't right, but it
was actually balanced. A low alphabet letter didn't mean the skill was
useless.

In addition, the scenario compensation was in the form of a 'free choice'. In
other words, I could choose the B-grade skill I wanted. There was a skill
that was difficult to acquire among the B-grade skills and I had to get it.

[Do you want to see the list of B-grade skills?]

It was a list with tens of thousands of skills. I was able to avoid a difficult
choice because there was a skill I thought of from the beginning.

[Do you want to receive the B-grade skill Lie Detection as

compensation?] I nodded and there was a faint glow as additional

messages appeared.

[The exclusive skill 'Lie Detection' has been added to the skills list.]

I finally obtained it. It had been really frustrating not having Lie
Detection…

I looked back and saw that Jung Heewon was having a hard time picking
something.
I asked Lee Jihye who was next to me. "Hey, do you know where Yoo
Joonghyuk is?"

"Ah, he was going somewhere with Seolhwa unni."

…Lee Seolhwa? Lee Jihye looked at me with pitying eyes, as if she knew
what I was thinking.

"…Sigh, it isn't what ahjussi thinks."

"…"

"Really. I watched the whole time. It is completely different from the two
of you. I'm certain."

I had a headache. Speaking of which, it was certain that they were lovers in
the second regressions but I couldn't remember in the third regression. Yoo
Joonghyuk had a long road to walk. So where the hell did he go? Was it to
pick up his younger sister?

[The sixth scenario will start in three days.]

A system message was heard. I think I knew what Yoo Joonghyuk wanted
to do. The sixth scenario was when we finally encountered incarnations
from other domes.

He was a restless guy so he probably went to get some hidden skills and
items that he couldn't get in the last regression.

There were still some hidden scenarios in Seoul Dome. It was a bit
upsetting that they would be taken away by Yoo Joonghyuk but it was
better than he eating up skills.

Moreover, he needed to be stronger than he was now to make the rest of the
scenarios easier.

"Ah, that's right. I have a message for ahjussi from Master?"
"For me?'

Lee Jihye nodded as she grasped her sword and declared in a serious tone.
"Kim Dokja, the oath period is over."

My heart sank. The Oath of Existence. I had forgotten about it.

–Then swear you won't hurt me until the fifth scenario is over. If you can't
do that, I really won't help you.

–I swear.

We had made this oath. That guy… surely he hadn't left me alive because
of the oath? Then I remembered strange nonsense.

–I won't kill you. I will hit you once.

I couldn't help gulping. Surely this wasn't his plan? Was he going to learn a
skill to hit me?

"By the way… what oath did the two of you swear?"

"Shut up."

Yes, it would somehow be okay. Above all, I had the Beast King's
Sensitivity used by the disaster Shin Yoosung. It was also level 3.

…I had Way of the Wind through Bookmark and there were also my strong
companions.

I met Lee Jihye's eyes as she said. "You know that I won't help you against
Master, right?"

"I wasn't expecting anything from you."

Instead, I looked at Lee Hyunsung. I was really impressed when he told
Shin Yoosung that he was part of my party, not Yoo Joonghyuk's. Lee
Hyunsung gazed at me with perplexed eyes before opening his mouth.
"That…Dokjassi."

"Yes."

"To tell you the truth, I'm a bit scared of Yoo Joonghyuk-ssi."

"…Ah, it's okay. I understand."

Come to think of it, Lee Hyunsung's strength was because of Yoo
Joonghyuk. Dammit. However, it was too early to be frustrated.

I also had Jung Heewon. She was someone who didn't appear in the original
novel and I raised her with my own hands.

Then Jung Heewon scratched her head and said, "I don't know what this is
about but I won't get involved in the fight between the two of you."

"…Huh?"

"I won't disturb the two of you… what the hell is this?"

[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' is making a loving smile.]

I suddenly got a chill down my spine. What was that angel thinking?

[The constellation 'Scribe of Heaven' is watching Demon-like Judge of Fire
with solemn eyes.]

[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' has jumped and changed her
expression.]

"Dokja-ssi." I looked up with astonishment and saw Yoo Sangah smiling
calmly at me. "Don't worry. Joonghyuk-ssi isn't a bad person."

"…I hope so."
"I'm sure that he is a good friend."

I heard Yoo Sangah's words and inwardly sighed. I didn't know why but I
thought of Han Sooyoung at this time. Apart from me, she was the only one
who knew what type of person Yoo Joonghyuk was. Well, she wouldn't
have protected me even if she was here…

The scenario was over but I didn't know what she was doing now. We
finished organizing the surroundings and collected items.

It became late in the night and Yoo Joonghyuk still hadn't returned. Instead,
Jung Heewon went to scout and returned with welcome things.

I was amazed. "There was still some left?"

Jung Heewon had six bottles of beer and soju with her. She said with a
smile. "Let's have a drink as a memorial."

We set up a campfire and sat down. I quickly hit Lee Jihye's hand as she
grabbed a beer.

"You're a minor."

"…There are no laws now. Why does it matter if I'm a minor?"

"Drink cider with the kids."

In the meantime, I took a quick swallow of the alcohol. Jung Heewon had
red cheeks as she drank while Lee Hyunsung snored like a bear after
drinking a few beers. He was weaker to alcohol than he looked.

"The mood…"

Lee Jihye secretly drank a few cups and collapsed with a red face.
Surprisingly, Yoo Sangah had already drank four bottles of soju. I couldn't
see any signs of her being drunk.
"I'm a heavy drinker."

Come to think of it, I had never seen Yoo Sangah drink at a work party.

"…It is hard to get drunk."

There was sorrow in her words. The company had a few men who wanted
to do something to Yoo Sangah while she was drunk. Maybe this was the
first time she could drink while at ease.

"Isn't it okay for today?"

Perhaps it was because she was paler than usual that I looked away with
shame.

There was a lonely moon in the sky and the cries of monsters couldn't be
heard today. The other drinking groups around us were making loud noises.

I wanted to drink well in this situation but I also thought it was because of
this situation that I had to drink.

It was a world where everything couldn't be endured without drinking.
Then small sparks appeared around my glass. The surprised Yoo Sangah
looked at me.

I nodded. It was a good thing I hadn't drank too much alcohol. The alcohol
poured down onto the ground.

[The constellation 'God of Wine and Ecstasy' wants to talk to you.]

Olympus had finally taken the bait.
                  Chapter 112: Ep. 22 - Three Promises, IV


The God of Wine and Ecstasy. The only person who used such a modifier
was Dionysus, one of the 12 gods of Olympus.

[The constellation 'God of Wine and Ecstasy' is humming.]

I couldn't hear the song but I could see the drops of alcohol dancing to an
unknown melody. The bubbles moved like they had life, forming numerous
notes on the ground. The notes repeatedly moved between me and Yoo
Sangah.

Yoo Sangah looked at the notes carefully and opened her mouth. "It is the
puppy waltz."

"Can you read musical notes?"

"A little bit."

Yoo Sangah cocked her head and continued speaking.
"Why did Chopin suddenly appear?"

I didn't have a clue. It was strange that Dionysus knew about Chopin in the
first place. No. According to the original story, he was someone with great
interest in the musical culture of later generations. It wasn't strange.

The notes formed a circle and then arrows that pointed towards the
remaining soju bottles. Yoo Sangah wondered, "…Is he telling us to drink
more?"

"Let's drink." There was no other way to interpret it. "Yoo Sangah-ssi, drink
only a little bit. At least one person should be sane."

I needed someone to protect my teammates if I became drunk. I could wake
up Lee Gilyoung and Shin Yoosung, who only drank cider, but I wanted to
let them sleep well.

"Dokja-ssi can't drink well?"

"I'm not a strong drinker."

I lightly tapped my glass against hers and drank the soju. The alcohol
entered my body and made me feel hot. However, the notes didn't stop.

"…I think I should drink more."

I drank a few glasses in succession. Heat rose from inside me and I could
feel the redness in my face. The movements of the musical notes became
more active. No, did it look more active because I was drunk? Yoo Sangah
smiled. "It is nice to drink with you. I was a bit lonely."

Thus, I drank a few more cups. I felt a bit better as a mellow smell rose. I
suddenly turned around and found that I was very close to Yoo Sangah. I
had obviously been quite far away…
I was mistaken. The sound of breathing was harsh. I didn't know if it was
my breathing or the breathing of Yoo Sangah. Yoo Sangah's shoulder
lightly touched mine. "Dokja-ssi."

"Yes."

It was clearly a face free of makeup but it was hard to find any blemishes.
Yoo Sangah slowly leaned towards me. Her face was getting closer and
closer.

A pair of quarter notes and eighth notes danced intensely around us. My
heart started to beat faster at the touch against my shoulders.

…Wait, something was strange.

[The exclusive skill 'Fourth Wall' has offset some of the drunkenness.]

The message popped up and my mind cleared. Yes, this couldn't happen in
reality. Yoo Sangah wasn't such a person. It was only possible because this
was Ways of Survival. I firmly held Yoo Sangah's shoulder and urged her,
"Yoo Sangah-ssi, stay alert."

"Huh? Ah… ah?" The startled Yoo Sangah blinked. Her face turned red for
the first time. "I-I, what did I…?"

As expected, it wasn't Yoo Sangah's will. I was in a slightly miserable
mood as I opened my mouth and spoke towards the notes hovering on the
ground. "Stop playing and get straight to the point."

The notes all stopped at the same time. It was a serene silence, like the
midnight festival had suddenly stopped. The alcohol bubbles fell to the
ground and sparks flew. Then the bubbles formed one string of words. –
You are no fun.
I was a bit surprised by the letters written on the ground. A few words
written in bubbles on the ground might not seem great, however it was
extremely difficult for constellations to communicate with incarnations in
Ways of Survival. It was why the constellations used the dokkaebi channels
to convey 'indirect messages'.

In the first place, spreading messages to Earth without the help of the
dokkaebis was only possible among the highest-class constellations and the
consumption of probability was huge. The probability of the world was
sensitive to 'language'.

I heard a faint cry from the Great Hole in the sky. The god of this world had
noticed Dionysus' existence. The fact that he delivered a message directly
without going through an incarnation meant he had confidence in his
backer… As expected, the 12 gods of Olympus were different.

I opened my mouth in a deliberate provocation. "If you are so confident
then come and talk to me in person."

Then the string of words moved.

–I don't like those with tentacles. They are annoying to fight. If I go down
myself, everyone will die.

In fact, I hadn't expected anything. Seoul would be turned into powder if
the 12 gods of Olympus really descended.

–My mother died that way because of my father.

Yoo Sangah saw this sentence and whispered to me. "…What does this
mean?"

"Maybe he is talking about the myth of his birth."

As far as I knew, Dionysus' parents were Zeus and Princess Semele of
Thebes. Hera was jealous of Zeus and Semele and disguised herself as
Semele's nurse, encouraging Semele by saying the following. 'Zeus might
be a fake. Ask him to show you what he really looks like when he is in
Olympus'.

Semele was fooled and demanded that Zeus do this. Then she died from
Zeus' brilliance.

Yoo Sangah listened to the story and cocked his head. "Uh… isn't it a bit
different from the story I know? As far as I know, his mother isn't the
princess of Thebes…"

I was a bit surprised by Yoo Sangah's knowledge. I wondered if she had a
level 1 degree in myths, not just Korean history. Of course, I didn't have
such a degree.

The string of words changed like it was amused.

–Hrmm. You humans know me very well.

As Yoo Sangah said, Dionysus' birth myth was twofold. One was the
version where Princess Semele of Thebes was his mother. The other
version had Hades' wife, Persephone as his mother.

I asked Dionysus, "I'm curious. Which of the two versions is real?" –

Is it important?

"It is important. There is a reason I need it to be the latter."

In fact, Jung Heewon's suggestion to drink was an attempt to lure Jung
Heewon.

Dionysus was the son of Persephone. If this myth was correct, Dionysus
could probably contact Persephone, Hades' wife.

–Rude human.
The string trembled.

–Still, I like rude humans.

In fact, I already knew which myth it was. Dionysus' story was mentioned
in Ways of Survival.

–There used to be a human as foolishly brave as you. He was someone who
played the lyre very well. He didn't end up well.

"I'll be different."

–I can open up the entrance of the Underworld. The Father of the Rich
Night doesn't like me but the goddess of the Underworld will listen to me.
However, it is very dangerous and there is no guarantee you will come back
alive.

"It's okay."

–Good. I like eager people.

I became nervous due to the excellent atmosphere. Dionysus was a
constellation whose thoughts I could never predict.

–Keep this in mind. I can only give you 12 hours. If you don't come back in
that time then you can never return to the scenarios.

I became dizzy and then suddenly felt drowsy. I realized what was going
to happen. Damn, this was why he made me drink. I hurriedly spoke.
"Yoo Sangah-ssi, wake up the kids." Perhaps these were my last words.

[A new hidden scenario has arrived!]

The moment I closed my eyes, the drops of alcohol seemed to be laughing.

–I hope the Father of the Rich Night will listen to you.
[The constellation 'God of Wine and Ecstasy' is guiding your soul.]

[You are free from the physical restraints of your body.]

Many colours passed through my mind and it was like I was on drugs.
There was a sharp pain from my forehead and then a faint voice was heard.

[Who is this?]

[…Interesting.]

[The soul of an incarnation is walking in the world of the constellation?]

[You will regret it.]

The voice spoke negative words. Perhaps it was someone from Olympus.

[The exclusive skill, 'Fourth Wall' is activated.]

The noisy voices disappeared like they had been muted.

[The soul of a living person has entered the Underworld.]

[The judges of the Underworld have noticed your presence.]

Once I heard the last message, countless traces disappeared from my
surroundings. The world turned around quickly and my body sank heavily.
After a while, it felt like I had reached somewhere. It was hard to move but
I could guess what I would see when I opened my eyes.

The air of the Underworld was sticky. The sand at my fingertips was cold.
Perhaps I was at the river of the Underworld that Hades ruled. There was
Acheron River flowing towards Hades' palace and the Underworld boatman
Charon would be waiting for me. And…

"Hey! Wake up! What are you doing here?"

Something dull hit my head and it felt like oil was being poured on me. I
took deep breaths as I sat up. Someone fumbled at my body, grabbing my
neck and lifting me up.

"A newbie? I've never seen this face before."

I had also never seen this face before. It was a man with a rough face and
big muscles. The people in the surroundings were gazing at us.

"He looks fine? Check his body. He might've brought something with him."

"Hey, don't touch. If he fell here then he must be a mess. Have you
forgotten the crazy person who came a while ago?"

"That crazy jerk was a bit special. Are people like him common?"

I let the people to talk among themselves and looked around. It was a
spacious place where a scorching heat could be felt. Judging by the
infestation of ghosts, this seemed to be the Underworld.

Frames made of the metal of the Underworld were all over the place and
there were also furnaces for smelting metals. It was a factory-like
atmosphere. The dead spirits were enslaved in the Underworld and
making something. At first glance, it seemed like a giant robot… What
was this place?

"Hey, are you ignoring me now?"

I ignored his words and slowly twisted his arm that was holding me.

"W-What? This strength…!"
I couldn't waste time dealing with these small fries. I decided to check the
hidden scenario that I had received.
  [Hidden Scenario - Scenic Walk]

  Category: Hidden

  Difficulty: A+

  Clear Conditions: Avoid the eyes of the judges and return safely to the
  ground.

  Time Limit: 12 hours.


  Compensation: 10,000 coin

  Failure: You will be forced to become a resident of the Underworld.



The scenario checked out. The time that Dionysus said was accurate. Then
why was I here? I should've fallen at Acheron River.

"T-This bastard! Daring to look down on us…!"

The big man was just about to punch my head when I heard a voice from
behind me.

"Over there, what's going on? Did something funny happen?"

"U-Uwaaah!"

"Haha, let me in on it as well. Huh? I'm bored to death because I've been
working on the Gundam every day."

"Run away! Run away!"
The people surrounding me started to shrink back. It was like herbivores
meeting a predator. I looked to the side where the voice came from. It was a
young man with a slim body and bangs covering his forehead. The young
man discovered me and moved towards me.

He peered closely at me and muttered with an aghast expression. "…Why
are you here?"

I couldn't understand his words for a moment. This person knew me?

"What? You can't recognize me? Have you really forgotten?"

The young man lifted his bangs and I recognized him.

…Dammit. Come to think of it, the Underworld was a place where the dead
came. I hadn't even thought about it. Of course the people I killed would
come here after dying.

"Ah, don't be so vigilant. Aren't we both dead?"

The curious young man's eyes came closer. There was a mean and cruel
look in them. I only saw him for a short time but it was an unforgettable
impression. The man smiled. "Yes, who the hell killed you? Please open
your mouth. Huh?"

The person who died in the first scenario, Delusional Demon Kim
Namwoon was in Hades' domain.
              Chapter 113: Ep. 22 - Three Promises, V


I looked around and discovered what this place was. Then I felt despair.

Damn, there was no doubt. This place was…

"You don't have to be so nervous. I won't bite if you get closer." Kim
Namwoon told me and I sighed.

I was certain. It was Tartarus, the famous prison of the Underworld. I
glanced at the three-headed monster guarding the entrance of the prison. It
was a cerberus, a mythical monster dog. Two of its heads were dozing off
while one head was acting as lookout.

"That son of a bitch. It should be a 4th grade monster. There are even
stronger ones downstairs." Kim Namwoon spoke like he was a guide to
hell.

He was right. This was how it was described in Ways of Survival. The
strongest prisoners were trapped in the lower floors of Tartarus, meaning
the size of the cerberus became bigger with each floor you descended. Kim
Namwoon chuckled and asked, "What do you think of hell?"

I watched his attitude and opened my mouth. It was natural to be nervous
when this psychopath had changed. "I have something to ask."

"What is it?"

"Is there anyone else beside you?"

"There is ahjussi."

"I'm not talking about me."

I closely watched the faces of the ghosts passing by. There were no faces
that I recognized. For example, the Disaster of Questions or people like
Song Minwoo.

Kim Namwoon told me, "I don't know. I was the only one from the subway
who came here."

Hades' Underworld was just one of the myriad worlds. The dead
incarnations probably went to different Underworlds according to their
beliefs or random characteristics. It was the same for Myung Ilsang and
Song Minwoo.

I kept an eye on Kim Namwoon's expression as I asked, "Has a young
woman come here recently?"

"Young woman?"

"She has white hair in an um… ponytail. She is really pretty."

Kim Namwoon frowned for a moment before suddenly giggling. "Aha, now
I understand."
I listened in case he had seen Shin Yoosung.

"Ahjussi, you died trying to save a woman?"

"…"

"This is the problem with people like you. Dying because of love… do you
think you are in a fairy tale?"

"Did you see her? Just answer that."

"Of course I haven't see her. How can I see your dear girlfriend?"

As expected, Shin Yoosung's soul hadn't come here. Perhaps she still hasn't
crossed the Acheron River. She was a soul that came from another world.
She would stay here for a while before being deported out of the world. All
I had to do was get to her soul before then.

"What are you doing here?" I asked.

"I was making something. Now ahjussi is going to make it with me." Kim
Namwoon shook the ashes off his hand and pointed to something. "It is that
thing. Doesn't it look like a Gundam?"

I stared at it. The appearance resembled the figure of a giant. The huge
weapon was finished off with a black, glossy metal and it breathed slowly
like a living creature. It was a weapon prepared for the most terrible war in
the myths.

The Giant Soldier. Hades was already preparing for Gigantomachia. It was
different from the 12 gods of Olympus who played around, ate and fought
using the excuse of preparing for Gigantomachia. Come to think of it,
Hades was a constellation of the Greek myths but he wasn't part of the
Olympus nebula.
Then a loud noise was heard from outside the entrance. Kim Namwoon
grabbed my shoulder. "Come on. Come with me."

"Why?"

"Can't you see the manager coming? There is a place where I am working.
Go there and pretend to hammer. You have to move quickly if you are a
newcomer. Understood?"

I knew this much. If this place where really Tartarus's slave smithy then I
knew something about it. That's why I wasn't surprised by Tartarus.

Kim Namwoon bit his lips. "Why are you looking at me like that?"

I tried not to say it but I couldn't help myself. "Don't you have any thoughts
about me?"

"What thoughts?" Kim Namwoon thought about it for a moment before an
eerie smile appeared on his face. "Aha, are you afraid of me?"

"…"

"You think I will get revenge. Right?"

It would be abnormal if I wasn't scared. I killed the person who was a
psychopath in the original novel, even more than Yoo Joonghyuk. Now he
suddenly acted friendly with me. I was strange if I wasn't scared.

"Haha, don't be afraid. Is it necessary to be wary when we have both
already died? I also changed a lot after coming here. I had a lot of time to
reflect."

I was speechless. The Delusional Demon Kim Namwoon reflecting was as
impossible as Yoo Joonghyuk becoming a girl. I knew it was a lie but I still
activated Lie Detection as a last courtesy for him. In any case, it was a skill
that I acquired to use.
[You have confirmed that the statement is true.]

…What? I was taken aback and stared at him. Kim Namwoon cried out,
"I'm telling the truth Why don't you trust what I am saying? Aren't I living
in atonement? I am even thankful that you killed me."

"Why?"

"A meal is served when it is time to eat. I can sleep when it is time to sleep.
I don't have to go to school and won't be nagged at by my parents… It is a
bit hot but this place is the best."

He was talking about Tartarus in hell. "Besides, I can assemble the
Gundam if I get bored. Isn't this good?" He saw the Giant Soldier as a
gundam. "It is thanks to you. I'm serious. Really thank you." This guy was
really crazy.

[The character 'Kim Namwoon' has a favourable impression of you.]

Damn, I couldn't not believe it when these system messages came up.

"Then come this way quickly. There is no time."

I was led by Kim Namwoon towards his workshop. His tools were placed
along the workbench and I could see the metal that the gundam was made
out of. It was a metal of the Underworld. I felt that this was a setting for this
person's chuuni disease.

Kim Namwoon said, "They're coming. Listen."

The cerberus started barking.

Grrrr…

My bones seemed frozen when I heard the sound. The administrator
holding a whip and bat passed by the cerberus and entered Tartarus. It was
a subordinate of Hades wearing a black cloak. He didn't look as strong as
the judges but it wouldn't be good if I was caught.

I stood and pretended to be hammering. Kim Namwoon was giggling next
to me. The administrator went to a platform at the entrance and cried out in
a scratchy voice.

–Tell all the slaves on the 1st floor. There will be an unannounced
inspection.

Kim Namwoon frowned and grumbled, "These jerks are always the same. If
they have nothing to do then an inspection…"

However, the administrator's next words shut Kim Namwoon up.

–There is an illegal intruder in the Underworld. It is said that the soul of a
living person crossed Acheron River.

The ghosts had confused expressions. The administrator's words continued.

–If the Great Death finds out about this, terrible things will happen to you
as well. This inspection is to find the impure intruder. It isn't a formal one
so don't be nervous. Everyone stand in place.

Dammit, the progress was faster than I expected. In this case…

Kim Namwoon's complaints could be heard. "This is really stupid. Even if a
living person came here, why would they hide in Tartarus? When someone
comes in, they can't go out. Right?"

"…"

"Ahjussi?"

"Uh, yes." I replied one beat late.
Kim Namwoon watched me and muttered in a dumbfounded voice. "I just
want to ask you. Perhaps they are talking about ahjussi…"

"Right."

"Shit." Kim Namwoon threw the hammer and laughed. "Wow, it is amazing
that you are a living person. I have been talking to someone alive?"

It was an expression where he didn't know to be angry or amused. I sighed
and asked, "Is there anywhere to hide here?"

"Shit, you want to hide in a prison? If you can't find anywhere then hide in
the gundam over there!"

I looked at the Giant Soldier. I really could hide in there. The problem was
that it was already close to a 'living creature'. I was likely to be digested if I
went inside.

"Has that been completed?"

"Not yet. There is something wrong with the core. Are you really going to
hide in there?"

"No."

"Good thinking. Ahjussi will disappear if you go inside there."

"…I thought you were grateful?"

"I'm only good to people who are also dead. I'm sorry that we met when
you are a living person. Ahjussi, you should die soon and come back
again."

Kim Namwoon spoke like I was in a terrible position. As we were talking,
the administrator had neared this area. If the Giant Soldier had been
completed then I could've beaten the cerberus and gone straight to Hades'
palace. Now that was impossible.
[Due to the effect of your exclusive attribute, memories from the books you
have read will become stronger.]

I desperately searched through the contents of Ways of Survival. Yoo
Joonghyuk had visited the Underworld in the mid to late regressions. What
had he done at the time?

「 "Tell this to the king. I will take the Great Soldier." 」

「 "If you don't want to die then tell everyone to get lost." 」

…Dammit. He was a crazy bastard. I liked it when I read it but it didn't help
my situation at all.

Facing Hades' judges head on. This thing was possible for the regressor
Yoo Joonghyuk. He had that type of power and opportunity. Yet I…

No, wait a minute. Why couldn't I do it like him? The direction of my
thoughts suddenly changed. Of course, I couldn't really act like Yoo
Joonghyuk.

However, there were many courageous ways I could resolve this. Why
couldn't I be caught by the judges? Would I fail the hidden scenario and
become a resident of the Underworld? No, perhaps the judges would see
Hades' behaviour and try to destroy me?

I was a fool. There was no need to worry if I solved one issue. The
administrator finally came to our workshop. I faced him.

Then the administrator asked, "Who are you?"

"The one you are looking for."

At this moment, a light shone in the administrator's eyes. The sharp sound
of metal was heard from somewhere. I felt my body gradually freeze and
my back was cold. If I looked back now then Hades' judges would grab me
by the neck.

I resisted the freezing cold and opened my mouth. "You should think
carefully before killing me." I didn't have Yoo Joonghyuk's strength but I
had something he didn't. "If you kill me now, you will surely be defeated
during Gigantomachia."

The administrator's eyes shook and the chill subsided for a moment. I didn't
miss this moment and looked up at the Giant Soldier.

"Tell the Father of the Rich Night. I know how to finish the Giant Soldier."

A fearsome silence descended. The area around my neck was slowly
freezing but I didn't resist.

This was a test. The ice came down from my neck to my shoulders and
chest. I didn't panic. A little bit more. Just a bit more. Finally, the cold
reached the edges of my heart. Suddenly, it stopped like magic.

Then a message appeared in my head.

[The hidden scenario has been updated.]

.

.

After a while, I was guided by the judge towards Hades' palace. I looked
back as I moved away and saw Kim Namwoon behind the cerberus. I
waved my hand towards Kim Namwoon, who stared blankly at me.

Stay well in hell, Namwoon.
              Chapter 114: Ep. 22 - Three Promises, VI


Kim Namwoon's last look remained with me but I hadn't come to rescue
him in the first place. Besides, why should I save him when he liked Hell?

The legless judge climbed the stairs quietly, like a ghost. Some of the
symbolic bodies along the way looked at me with interested eyes. Were
they constellations who dwelled in Hades' palace? I didn't know. It wasn't
all constellations here.

The judge seemed aware that I was drifting off and spoke without looking
back.

[You will lose your way if you don't follow along well.]

It was a scratchy voice that made me feel uncomfortable. Still, it was the
correct advice.

I looked at the judge before shifting my gaze to the ceiling and opening my
mouth slightly. 'Hey, can you hear me?'
It was a small whisper that the judge couldn't hear.

'I know you're listening'.

This wasn't Earth but Hades' Underworld. I was curious. Did the dokkaebi
channel work here? Then a faint voice entered my ears.

–…Yes.

There was a reply on the dokkaebi communication. It wasn't Bihyung's
voice.

'Are you a new dokkaebi?'

–Yes. I am the low-grade dokkaebi Youngki. I am temporarily serving as
an administrator while Bihyung is at the bureau.

Dokkaebi Youngki. Perhaps it was the dokkaebi who dealt with the
compensation settlement for the fifth scenario during the day. I got straight
to the point.

'Why aren't you doing your work properly?' –

Huh?

'The hidden scenario has updated but why aren't you letting me know the
contents?'

I came to this terrible place and should at least get compensation.

–Ah, t-that…!

It turned out that this dokkaebi was a beginner. I could see how good
Bihyung was at handling things. He just slightly lacked intelligence… The
dokkaebi went silent for a long moment before stuttering.

–E-Excuse me…
'What is it now?'

–How do I update the scenario?

I was speechless for a moment.

'Why is a dokkaebi asking a constellation?'

–B-Bihyung told me to ask Kim Dokja-ssi if I'm not sure of anything.

That bastard Bihyung made me an advisor?

–P-Please wait a moment! I'll ask another dokkaebi about it. Ah, and…

'…What else?'

–I'm sorry but would you like to receive the backed up indirect messages? It
was the first time I was in this situation…

I reluctantly nodded. I never expected a day would come when I missed
Bihyung. Then messages exploded in my head.

[The constellation 'God of Wine and Ecstasy' rejoices in your plight.]

[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' is excited about your
adventure.]

[The constellation 'Secretive Plotter' is wondering how you will escape.]

[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' prays that you can return
safely to your companions.]

…

As expected, the constellations were enamored with watching me. On the
other hand, some were admiring the scenery.
[The constellation 'One-eyed Maitreya' admires the Underworld.]

[The constellation 'Bald General of Justice' is greatly shocked by the
appearance of the Underworld.]

[The constellation 'Bald General of Justice' begins to doubt his religion.]

…

This was a spectacle for some constellations. Not all constellations could
come to Hades' castle.

[12,000 coins have been sponsored.]

I got 12,000 coins just from showing Hades' palace. It was a huge profit.
This was like illegally filming private land.

Some time passed. The silently walking judge finally opened his mouth.

[We've arrived.]

The door opened and a huge banquet hall appeared. The interior wasn't
visible because it was dark. The judge disappeared and the door closed.

A small light appeared in the middle of the dark hall. An oval antique table
was waiting for me. There was a splendid statue that could be seen as a
statue of the king. The table contained many dishes that stimulated the
salivary glands.

There was a woman looking at me at the end of the table.

[How interesting. A living soul has come to this castle. Furthermore, you
also brought unpleasant observers… Today is a really special day.]

I immediately recognized who she was. In Hades' palace, there was only
one existence who could occupy the seat of the hostess. I bowed and
opened my mouth.
"It is an honour, Queen of the Darkest Spring."

Queen of the Darkest Spring. She was Persephone, Hades' wife and the
famous queen of the Underworld.

[You know my modifier. You are a polite incarnation.]

"You're overpraising me."

[The even more interesting thing is that your soul didn't shake when you
heard my true voice.]

Come to think of it, I didn't feel much when I heard the truth voice of the
constellations.

Persephone was a constellation that was at least narrative-grade. Due to the
difference between us, my soul should've been damaged or destroyed the
moment I heard her true words.

Moreover, I previously heard the words of Kim Yooshin, a historical-grade
constellation…

[The exclusive skill, 'Fourth Wall' is strongly activated.]

It was the first time that 'strongly' was attached to the skill message.
Perhaps my unconscious mind saw this situation as 'unrealistic' due to the
person I was meeting.

[Sit down, Incarnation Kim Dokja.]

I thanked her for the hospitality and sat across from her. Honestly, it was an
unexpected favour. The aroma of sweet delicacies tickled my nose.

I looked around but only Persephone was sitting at the table. "The king…?"

[The king is uncomfortable with your sudden visit. That's why I thought it
would be better for me to talk to you.]
It ended up like this. I had expected it. There hadn't been a single
incarnation who had met the three heads of Olympus. Besides, I didn't play
the lyre well like Orpheus.

"Do you mind if I ask you a question?"

[You can ask.]

"Is this your true body?"

[Of course it is a symbolic body. My true body isn't something that a human
like you can withstand.]

I quietly gazed at Persephone's symbolic body. She looked like an old
woman.

…It was a terrible hobby. Honestly, I had to think like this. Persephone
smiled softly.

[You don't like older women like this?]

"That isn't the problem."

It didn't matter if she looked like a grandmother or grandfather. The
problem was that she looked exactly like the 'grandmother' on the subway
in the first scenario.

[If you feel uncomfortable then I can change to someone else.]

Persephone's appearance slowly changed into Yoo Sangah's image. It
wasn't the usual Yoo Sangah. This Yoo Sangah wore a black Chinese dress
and a garter belt, with seductive eye makeup…

I turned red just staring at her face. Dammit, did she peep at my dreams?

"Just be the grandmother."
Of course, Persephone didn't listen to me.

[There isn't much time so get to the point.]

"You don't know?"

[I heard a bit from my child but it has more meaning to hear it directly from
you.]

Her child must mean Dionysus. I nodded and took a deep breath before
explaining. "I'm looking for a woman's soul. I don't know if you've heard
but I'm ready to make a trade."

[Soul… it is an outdated idea.]

Her eyelids lowered as she seemed to think of something. Before long,
Persephone's long fingers moved and she started to slice the steak on her
plate.

I patiently waited. It proceeded slowly. The fork firmly held the meat as the
knife moved slowly back and forth, slicing the meat with care. The red
juices flowed out as a clean section was cut. The fork carefully moved the
meat that it had pierced.

Persephone made a face like she was worrying about whether to eat it or
not. She seemed to have forgotten about me.

I was about to open my mouth when she opened her mouth first. Of course,
it was to eat the steak.

[There is no such thing as a 'soul' in this world.]

Souls didn't exist. It was a matter that all modern physicists would agree on
but the problem was the person saying it was a god. It was a god of
Olympus, who had long defended the logic of the souls.

I said sarcastically, "Plato and Aristotle would rise from the grave."
[They are constellations right now so they wouldn't be in their graves.]

"I didn't come here to play around."

[I'm not playing around. Incarnation Kim Dokja. The soul doesn't exist. It is
just an illusion created by humans who want the continuity of themselves.]

"Then what about the people in the Underworld? Aren't they souls?"

She pointed to the steak she just cut.

[They are like this.]

The steak slowly entered Persephone's mouth. She took her time chewing
the meat, like she was relishing it. Her red lips glistened enchantingly.

[Well, it is very special. Why don't you try it once?]

The same steak that she ate appeared in front of me. I looked down at it and
said after a moment. "I don't want to."

[Are you going to be rude?]

"Yes. I'm really sorry but I have to be rude."

It would surely be tasty if I ate it. There were at least 12 pages in Ways of
Survival describing the taste. However, at the end of a long description, the
following sentence was written:

「 It wasn't until the end of the regression that Yoo Joonghyuk regretted
eating the food. 」

Those who ate the food of the Underworld couldn't return to Earth.
Persephone seemed to read my mind and laughed.
[The people of the Underworld aren't as terrible as you think. Most of the
known theories are false. You can go out of the Underworld at any time as
long as you have the permission of the king. It is a similar concept to a
'career soldier' in your world.]

"The military life was the most terrible memory in my life."

[Is that so? Don't the males in your country say that they should stay in the
army? That's why I thought it wasn't a big deal. I guess it was a
misunderstanding.]

I didn't know why the goddess of another country knew so much about
Korean mean. Persephone continued speaking.

[Incarnation Kim Dokja. You will be treated better than you imagined.]
"The person who advised me to be a professional sergeant told me
something similar."

[Did he recommend a steak like me? For example, the steak currently in
front of you. Do you know what will happen if you eat it?]

"I can taste the juices of a cow."

[You can become a 'sword master' right now.]

I thought I heard wrong for a moment. Sword master. It was a higher
realm that only returnees who left this world could reach after hard work.
[The pasta next to it. You can become a 'great magician' if you eat it.]
…This pasta?

[The soup? It can make you an SSS-grade hunter.]

This… it was a wonderland instead of a hell?
I couldn't help gulping. I could get power to overcome the current Yoo
Joonghyuk if I just ate this meat.

[You still won't eat?]

I slowly moved my fork and picked up a piece of the steak. The moment
my fork pierced the meat, strange scenes flashed in front of my eyes. It was
the memory of a man training alone with a sword.

「 I can't be weak. I have to learn the sword. 」

「 I will strive to become stronger. 」

「I-I finally did it! I did it! 」

There were only a few scenes. I was surprised and put down the fork. This
wasn't a dead cow that I was poking.

"This is…?"

Persephone nodded.

[Yes. This small piece of meat. It is the soul that humans believe in.]

She once again ate the meat. I belatedly understood why Persephone said I
could become a sword master if I ate this. I stated, "…It contains the
memories of the sword master."

[Memories? No. To be more precise…]

She paused for a moment to pick her words.

[It is a story.]

The sight of her licking her lips gave me goose bumps.

[It is the story that is the favourite food of all constellations.]
             Chapter 115: Ep. 22 - Three Promises, VII


I got goose bumps as I heard the words that came out of the constellation's
mouth. Those who were crazy about stories ate the stories. This was the
nature of constellations.

[Death is the end of the story. Just as a cow that has become a steak can't
revive, the dead can't revive. Their story is finished.]

"I know there are exceptions."

[They are false folklore. There are no exceptions.]

It was a lie. There was a saying for this in Greek mythology. "Can you
swear on the Styx River?"

She naturally couldn't swear. For the first time, anger filled Persephone's
expression.

[…The soul you believe in is just a crude lump of a story.]
"I want that crude lump of a story."

[A person who looks backwards in the Underworld will feel regret. You
need to understand that the time has passed.]

If she was taking such a hard line then I had to use the trump card I had
saved.

"Queen-nim. Time isn't necessarily about 'going forward'. I thought you
knew that."

At this moment, the world turned grey. A vast killing intent filled the whole
hall. For a moment, I felt that I had seen Persephone's essence. My mouth
didn't open but I wanted to scream.

Souls didn't exist? Wasn't it my soul that was feeling creeped out right
now? Sweat dripped down my back as the killing intent disappeared.

Persephone smiled like nothing had happened. [Huhu… how interesting. As
expected from the child that Olympus calls a singularity.]

Her smile was subtly different from before. I could feel it without speaking.
From now on, I could get to my goal.

"I know it isn't just that. I have seen the Giant Soldier in development in
Tartarus. If you make a deal with me, you can shorten the time it takes to
use it…"

[That is the story. Gigantomachia is an important issue but the Giant
Soldier can be completed on time without your help.]

I was speechless for a moment. She was a truly formidable goddess. It was
Persephone's turn.

[However, I might consider this deal if you tell me how you know the
information…]
"It is difficult. To be honest, I don't know how to explain it."

I felt sorry for Shin Yoosung but this wasn't possible. My plans for the
future were finished if I revealed this. Persephone gazed into my eyes to
gauge the truth of my answer. Then she muttered in a strange voice.

[Indeed, ■■■ ■■■…]

…What? The next second, the messages of the constellations exploded in
my ears.

[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' is doubting his ears.]

[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire''s eyes have widened.]

[The constellation Scribe of Heaven points out the Queen's rashness.]

[The constellation 'Secretive Plotter' is immersed.]

Persephone frowned.

[The uninvited guests should stay quiet.]

I asked with a shocked expression,

"What did you say just now?"

[Ah, it isn't a big deal.]

I was really confused.

…■■■?

I couldn't pronounce it properly but her words sounded like filtered
information. It generally happened with information not made public yet in
the scenario. However, the filtering wasn't triggered if a person already
knew the information.
It didn't make sense. There was information I didn't know despite reading
all of Ways of Survival? No, maybe…

[I'm sorry but I'll end the entertainment here. I have no reason to make the
deal with you. I can use other methods to find out your information.]

The light reflected in a creepy manner off the knife. I didn't feel like
knowing why.

[I keep thinking this but… you look delicious.]

Persephone suddenly approached and grabbed my chin. I refrained from
pushing back my chair and smiled.

"Will you be able to handle the storm that will occur if you harm an
incarnation in the middle of the scenario?"

[Hrmm. You are disrespectful. Do you think I can't afford this probability?]

"The constellations watching me also won't tolerate it."

Persephone laughed. [Do you think the king will be afraid of such trivial
constellations?]

Of course, Hades deserved to be this arrogant. Still, the word 'trivial'
shouldn't be used in such a way.

[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' swings his rod as if he
has been provoked.]

[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' pulls out her sword with cold
eyes.]

[The constellation 'Secretive Plotter' is excited and encouraging the
situation.]

Persephone also pulled out her power.
[I see. Do you want to try it now?]

The ceiling of the hall started to fill with dark clouds. Red and blue sparks
occurred like a thunderstorm and white flames spread throughout the
banquet hall. This was the battle between constellations.

A huge aura rose from Persephone's symbolic body. I would explode if this
continued.

I calmly opened my mouth. "You said you liked stories."

The atmosphere of the constellations softened for a moment at my words.

"Then how about a different deal?"

[The constellation 'Secretive Plotter' is listening to your words.]

Persephone stared at me.

"If you help me, I will show you the most interesting story in the world. A
story that is incomparable to the steak you just ate."

[Does that mean I can eat it?]

"If you like gourmet meals, I think no more meals are needed. This story
will be enough."

Persephone noticed what I was trying to say and laughed.

[…Are you planning to take the money without letting me eat?]

"I will let you have a taste. However, if you eat me now, you will regret it
for the rest of your life."

[Why?]
"You would think it would've been more delicious if you hadn't eaten

it." Persephone looked intrigued. […How can you be so sure?]

"I can stand against time-defying beings without a sponsor."

Persephone's eyes shook lightly.


"I have destroyed a returnee and prevented disasters without the help of the
god of this world. And so far, only five scenarios have passed."
Persephone's bit her lower lip in a tantalizing manner.

"As a living soul, I entered the Underworld and encountered you like this.
Aren't you curious about what I will do in the future?"

[You speak very well. But…]

Persephone lowered her gaze and continued.

[It doesn't seem to be a deal?]

"You can call it a courtship."

[…Huh?]

I smiled.

"I'm serious. I'll show you stories you have never seen before and stories
that you can't endure wondering about."

Maybe it was wrong to think about making deals with constellations. They
were those bound by eternity. They couldn't make serious deals with trivial
incarnations. If so, it was better to say ridiculous and far-fetched things. At
the very least, it would make an impression.
Like all myths, the gods were more moved by a handful of sincere words
than a hundred words of deceit. In fact, Persephone's expression wasn't bad
at all.

[Hrmm, it is difficult. This is why males are…]

"Of course, it isn't courting you but courting the Father of the Rich Night."

Persephone's eyes widened at my words and she burst out laughing. She
stepped away from me and slowly crossed her legs to sit on the table. Her
coy eyes swept over my body.

[How interesting.]

It was frightening that she was posing like this with Yoo Sangah's body.
Persephone stared into the dark air and slowly closed her eyes. It was only a
moment but it felt like hours of heavy silence. I was about to choke on the
weight of the silence when she spoke.

[I'll give you a task.]

It finally came.

[You want to show me an interesting story? If you succeed, I will let you
find the soul you want.]

Then a system message popped up.

[A new hidden scenario has been activated.]

There were a few myths that came to mind when I heard her words. That
reminded me, Heracles performed something called the '12 Tasks'.
Persephone's eyes shone.

[I want to see it once. The children of Olympus often do it but I haven't
been able to watch it since meeting my king.]
"What task is it?"

[Your task is to cut off the head of the snake.]

"…Snake? Do you mean the snake with multiple heads?" I asked in a
slightly timid voice.

It was because 'that snake' was a 2nd grade monster. Persephone shook her
head.

[I'm not talking about the hydra. Only Heracles can kill it. The snake you
have to kill is somewhere else.]

"However, I can't go far because of the scenario."

[Don't worry. The snake will be wherever you go.]

Persephone lightly flicked her fingers and a screen popped up in the empty
air. There was the message that the channel was connected and I realized
what this screen was.

…Was this how the constellations watched us? A vast green forest filled
the entire screen. It wasn't long before I figured out what this place was. It
was the stage for the sixth scenario that was about to start. Wait a minute.
What was this?

「 Ahjussi, pull out some of the wood over there and make a place to rest.
Aren't you good at that? 」

「 I'm not good at clearing land. Dumb female. 」

I stared at the screen. The two people were the missing Gong Pildu and Han
Sooyoung. How was this possible? The sixth scenario hadn't started yet? I
could feel Persephone staring at me.
[How about it? Do you want to try it? It might be hard but it is a worthy
task.]

I recovered my spirit. I could sense the 'snake' that Persephone wanted me
to kill. I slowly nodded.




The incarnation left and darkness came to the hall.

Persephone remained alone, staring at the rest of the feast before opening
her mouth.

[Clear it away. It doesn't taste good.]

Hands appeared in the darkness and quickly took away the plates.
Persephone watched as the food went straight into the garbage can. Sword
master, SSS-grade hunter, 10th circle magician…

She was already tired of these delicious tastes. Then a voice came from the
darkness.

–Persephone. Why did you do that?

It was like the space itself was talking.

[Oh, my shy husband is finally

talking.] –I asked you why. [Hades,

you wanted this.] –I never said that.

Persephone stared into the darkness.
[You rarely like incarnations. I think you particularly like that child. Am I
mistaken?]

–Why do you think so?

[It was because you didn't kill him when he entered the Underworld.]

The darkness was silent for a moment.

[You always felt envious that Zeus had Heracles. This time, I read a bit of
your mind.]

Persephone looked down at her hands for a moment before making a fist.

[Honestly, it was amazing. There were some constellations I couldn't afford
to go against. They are all chasing after one incarnation…]

A screen appeared in the darkness. However, the channel's signal was
unstable and the video didn't appear immediately. The darkness gazed at the
screen and opened its mouth.

–There will soon be signs of the later days.

The later days. Persephone listened to these words and opened her mouth
with a mixture of distrust, doubt and anxiety.

[…Will the later days really come?] –

Perhaps.

[You will still be with me at that time right?]

Hades didn't answer. The warm darkness just carefully wrapped around her
symbolic body. Persephone felt the darkness and said.

[I am very excited to see what story that kid will show me.]
Her eyes watched as Kim Dokja moved through the darkness to leave the
Underworld. Kim Dokja moved forward without looking back.

Persephone laughed lightly, as if he was cute.
             Chapter 116: Ep. 23 - Abandoned World, I


I was guided by the judge towards the exit of the Underworld. The exact
location wasn't known because my eyes were covered with a blindfold. We
seemed to go up and then down. After a long walk, the judge took off the
blindfold.

[Follow along this path.]

I opened my eyes and saw a dark and narrow road. Perhaps this was the exit
that didn't require going through Charon, the ferryman.

[You should look in 'front'.]

"What does that mean?"

I looked around but the judge had already disappeared.

I had no choice but to start walking along this path. The light faded and
darkness settled around me. I was using the walls to orienting myself
initially, but the walls soon disappeared. My only frame of reference was
gone and I felt like a ship floating on the ocean without any buoys.

The myth of Orpheus suddenly popped into my head. What would happen
if I looked back? Then a faint light appeared in the darkness.

[You are afraid of what is behind you. That's why you are a pitiful child.]

It was a message from Persephone.

[Keep this in mind. In order to find the 'front', you must know where the
'back' is. It is because the front can only exist when there is a rear.]

Speaking of which, the judge had said something similar. However, just
because the words made sense didn't mean I suddenly gained enlightenment
and could make enormous changes.

[It looks like you need some motivation…]

The stream of light in the air stretched out like it was hesitating.

[Okay. I can't bring you to the beginning of the world labyrinth but this
much should be possible.]

I suddenly felt something. The string of light disappeared and a small
firefly appeared in front of me. It was a distant light. It was a very fragile
and shimmering light. Nobody told me anything but I knew what this light
was.

–You…

It was Shin Yoosung of the 41st regression.

–Ah, ahh…

I could tell how long she had been waiting just from her voice. If she was
already at the beginning of the world labyrinth then the concept of time
would be different. It wasn't long by my standards but it might've already
been a few years for Shin Yoosung.

The small light shivered a few times before speaking in a hesitant voice.

–Ahjussi.

Perhaps she was influenced by the memories of the young Shin Yoosung.

–…C-Can I call you that? No…?

The way she called me was a bond. It was a wish to be tied somewhere.
Perhaps 'ahjussi' was the last lingering attachment of the 41st regression
Shin Yoosung. I smiled softly.

"You are currently older than me. Is it still okay?"

The soft light once again trembled. The light gently touched my face. There
was warmth in that gesture…

My heart felt pained. She must've been waiting for a long time. Even so,
this child had to wait longer.

"I'm sorry but I can't save you now."

The light moved up and down like she understood.

–Don't overdo it. My story now…

"It isn't over yet." I spoke without giving her time to finish. "You have
suffered for so long and it can't end like this."

–Why…

"I will never let that happen."

The light stared at me. She trembled in a confused and pathetic manner.
–I got to know ahjussi through the memories of this world. But ahjussi…
why are you so good to me? Does ahjussi know me?

I didn't answer. We got to know each other through different means. Just as
the 41st regression Shin Yoosung knew me through the memories of her
younger self, I knew her through Ways of Survival. Nevertheless, I couldn't
explain this.

–I feel strange. I definitely don't know ahjussi but when I'm with you, I feel
like I understand everything about you. As if you are a 'god'…

If I was really a god, then I was the most incompetent god in the world. The
most helpless god in the world who knew everything but couldn't explain
anything.

Shin Yoosung's light was rapidly fading away. I couldn't see her but I
seemed to know what she looked like.

–Please save me, please…

"I will."

The tail of the light shaking in the air became smaller and I reached out
towards the light. I felt like my heart had been imprisoned. I could feel Shin
Yoosung's despair. The long wait…

My heart ached with an indescribable grief. Little by little, Persephone's
words made sense. There must be something behind in order to go ahead.
This was my 'back' and at the same time, the 'front' that I had to face.

Maybe this was how Yoo Joonghyuk felt. He constantly returned to the past
but was only able to move forward.

The moment I was certain of my direction, the environment stabilized. A
string of light appeared in the scattered darkness.
[I held her for a while with my power but you don't have much time left if
you want to save her.]

I remembered the faint warmth of Shin Yoosung. Persephone continued
speaking.

[Please keep this in mind. Humans are 'stories'. By the time you get her
back, no one knows how much of her story will remain.]

After that, I was pulled towards somewhere. The cries of ghosts receded
and the sensations of my body returned one by one. I could feel the warm
sunlight on my eyelids. I felt a dampness and opened my eyes to see a
familiar face.

"…Ahjussi?" The young Shin Yoosung was watching me. The child's clear
eyes reassured me. Her wild heartbeat gradually slowed down.

I had returned. I breathed slowly and the muscles of my body regained their
function.

[The hidden scenario - Queen of the Underworld has ended.]

[You have earned 15,000 coins as an achievement reward.]

The compensation for the updated scenario was also received. The
dokkaebi had done his job properly.

[The constellation 'God of Wine and Ecstasy' congratulates you on your
safe return.]

I saw the indirect message and my anger belatedly soared.

This bastard Dionysus, I wouldn't have to go through all this trouble if he
hadn't placed me in Tartarus. I was stuck in Tartarus with Kim Namwoon
and almost had to spend the rest of my life making the gundam.
[The constellation 'God of Wine and Ecstasy' is asking you for
reconciliation.]

[7,942 coins have been sponsored.]

7,942? What was this pig-like apology? Well, I'll let it go since he still gave
me coins.

[There is one new hidden scenario.]

I immediately confirmed the newly arrived hidden scenario.


  [Hidden Scenario - Snake Hunt]
  Category: Hidden

  Difficulty: S-

  Clear Conditions: Hunt the target in the sixth main scenario area.

  Time Limit: Until the end of the main scenario.

  Compensation: 80,000 coins, the trust of the Queen of the Darkest
  Spring.

  Failure: No access to the Underworld.


As expected, Persephone's task was presented in the form of a hidden
scenario.

[Once the target gets close, the scenario alarm will be automatically
triggered.]

A snake hunt. The target wasn't specified, but I could guess it was the
'snake' from the next scenario.
I slowly raised my upper body and Shin Yoosung asked anxiously,
"Ahjussi, are you okay?"

"Yes. I'm fine."

"Sangah unni asked me to watch you…"

It reminded me of what I told Yoo Sangah before I collapsed.

"Yoo Sangah-ssi?"

It wasn't difficult to find Yoo Sangah. Yoo Sangah was curled up on the
ground and fast asleep. I looked at her sleeping face and recalled
Persephone's image. Then my face became hot.

…

By the way, the Chinese dress and garter belt… it was really great.

"Unni fell asleep just before you woke up."

"Ah."

"She told me to tell the others if you didn't wake up."

The series of words ignited guilt inside me. I could see dark circles
under Yoo Sangah's eyes. She must have a hangover as well… Chinese
dress? Garter belt? Shit, I was garbage.

"Are you awake now?"

Jung Heewon and Lee Hyunsung approached me. They were covered in
sweat and seemed to have come back from a morning spar.

Jung Heewon told me. "Dokja-ssi is awake so we are ready to go."
"Ready?"

"The other people have already started."

Come to think of it, there weren't as many people around as there were
yesterday. I asked, "What happened overnight?"

"The sixth scenario has been announced."

…Already? I didn't have a chance to ask when a huge string of words
appeared in the sky.

[Survivors are advised to gather in Yongsan Station.]

We packed up and left.

We were already in Yongsan so it wasn't hard to go to the station. I carried
Yoo Sangah while Jung Heewon and Lee Hyunsung were responsible for
the remaining luggage.

Lee Gilyoung and Shin Yoosung followed us while staying far apart from
each other. I didn't know where Yoo Joonghyuk's party had gone.

We soon arrived near the station which was already crowded with
survivors.
I couldn't believe there were still so many people who survived in Seoul.
Everyone was watching the huge screen floating in the air.

"Ah?"

"This place?"

The party members and I looked up at the screen together. It was the same
screen I had seen in the Underworld. Monsters were running around in the
lush forest. They were clearly fantastical monsters, but they looked like
they were part of a giant ecosystem.
There were already some incarnations on the screen. Some of the people
who had started hunting laughed as they cut off the head of a monster.
These dokkaebis. They edited it well like it was a tourist destination.

Someone spoke. "Eh? Aren't they Japanese?"

If I remembered correctly, the sixth scenario was an event scenario with
another dome. The man who appeared on the screen was Izumi, a famous
incarnation of Japan.

The Tokyo Dome was faster than us so they would've reached the sixth
scenario earlier. In many ways, it could be said that South Korea had a
relatively unfavourable start.

[A new main scenario has arrived.]
            Chapter 117: Ep. 23 - Abandoned World, II


Along with the message, the contents of the scenario emerged in my head.
  [Main Scenario #6 - ????]

  Category: Main

  Difficulty: ???

  Clear Conditions: ???

  Time Limit: ???

  Compensation: ???

  Failure: ―


"Eh? There isn't a difficulty level or clear conditions."

"…What the hell do they want us to do? Why is everything question
marks?"

The confused people summoned the window several times but the contents
of the scenario were still covered with question marks. I wasn't surprised
because I already expected this. It was because this scenario…

"Only a few people will be able to complete this scenario." A tall,
middleaged man standing near me declared.

"You…"

"It has been a while, Kim Dokja-nim. This is the first time I am greeting
you formally."

…This ahjussi was here as well. I wanted to speak but the man asked me to
shake hands first.
"I am Jeon Ildo and I'm called the Neutral King."

"I am Kim Dokja."

The Neutral King, Jeon Ildo. He was one of the few kings remaining in
Seoul who survived the Absolute Throne struggle, along with the Maitreya
King Cha Sangkyung and the King of Beauty Min Jiwon.

I had been impressed with Jeon Ildo. He was the only king who gave up the
throne of his own will.

"During the struggle for the throne and this time as well. I was very
impressed with Dokja-nim's performance. You don't know how much my
sponsor talks about Dokja-nim. Half the time it is about Dokja-nim."

He gave a good-looking smile. That reminded me, who was his sponsor? I
immediately used a skill.

[The exclusive skill, Character List is activated.]

It was a summary list that only contained the attribute and sponsor.

[The settings of the summary list have been changed.]


  [Character Summary]

  Name: Jeon Ildo

  Exclusive Attributes: Clumsy Intellectual (General), the Neutral King
  (Hero)

  Sponsor: Expert at Playing Both Sides
…Now that I saw it, I had a question. Of course it would be this
constellation. Expert at Playing Both Sides seemed to be an old-fashioned
person with complicated internal relations but it was actually the modifier
of a 'king'.

[A constellation who advocates neutral diplomacy has revealed his
modifier.]

[The constellation 'Expert at Playing Both Sides' shows good intentions
towards you.]

It was the modifier for Gwanghaegun, a king of Joseon famous for his
neutral diplomacy.

Jeon Ildo had the title of Neutral King for a reason.

I said to him, "Tell me more. Why did you say that only some people can
carry out the scenario?"

"Ah, you didn't know."

The kings had quickly obtained information. Of course, I knew it the best
but I still needed to listen to them. Maybe things were different from the
Ways of Survival that I knew.

"According to information provided by the low-grade dokkaebis this
morning, the participants of this scenario are going to be volunteers."

"Volunteers?"

"Yes. This scenario doesn't require everyone to participate. There is also no
penalty for not participating. It is incredible considering the scenarios we've
experienced so far."

It was like what I expected. I pointed at the screen and asked, "Will the
participants be going there?"
"That's what I heard."

I could hear relieved voices all over the place after Jeon Ildo's words.

"What? Not all of us have to go?"

"Shit, I'm glad. I saw those monsters… why are they so big?"

At this point, the incarnations were divided into three broad categories.
First, there was the type that furtively watched. Most of them didn't have an
affiliation and probably thought they could survive by hiding.

However, this idea was wrong. After a while, Star Stream scenarios'
difficulty would rise exponentially. Perhaps these incarnations would face a
terrible future in exchange for not participating in the scenario.

"…Isn't it interesting?"

Then there was the second category. They had somewhat adapted to the
harsh environment of the scenarios. People strengthened their resolve by
looking at the screen or checking their equipment in advance. Maybe they
would be able to survive in the meantime.

Finally, the third category…

"Jeon Ildo-nim! Where are you?"

There was a shout from outside the crowd. Jeon Ildo looked at his watch
and groaned. "The time has already come."

"You can go. I'm fine."

"No, I can't go alone. It doesn't make sense."

"…What do you mean?"

"Dokja-nim, I actually came here to find you."
"Find me?"

Jeon Ildo nodded. "A world without kings."

He looked around. It was only a moment but it felt like many people's gazes
were focused here. Jeon Ildo gave a mysterious smile as if he noticed the
gazes.

"The kings left in this unfortunate world are waiting for you to come."

This was the third category. They were the people who used others in order
to survive.




I followed Jeon Ildo to the kings' gathering place.

They gathered at the central platform of Yongsan Station and the meeting
room was covered by a big tent. There were dozens of guards around the
tent. Every one of them was formidable. They were the elite troops of the
kings. They were probably hunting the monsters in other areas while we
were fighting Shin Yoosung.

"I'm sorry but only the kings can go inside." The sentries stopped us and I
looked back at my party members.

Jung Heewon and Lee Hyunsung understood the situation and nodded. I left
Yoo Sangah with Lee Hyunsung.

"Dokja-ssi. Scream if anything happens. Understood?" Jung Heewon told
me.

I smiled at her and opened the door of the tent.

[Sound Wave Blocking is activated in the area.]
They even had Sound Wave Blocking? There seemed to be a pretty good
assortment of people. I walked in and saw a round table in the wide space.
There were a few biscuits and beef jerky on the table.

The chairs that people were sitting in were different. Some were plastic
chairs, some were wooden chairs and there was even a sofa. Still, no matter
where they sat, it was definitely a throne.

The surviving kings were here.

"You said that our group has an advantage? South Korea will be a
latecomer. Do you think we can deal with those who are already present?
However, it will be different if our group goes. I will go…!"

The booming voice of the middle-aged man faded away at my appearance.
All the kings were staring at me.

"The last king has come." King of Beauty Min Jiwon stated.

I lightly greeted her and looked around at the kings. Yoo Joonghyuk wasn't
here, obviously. Apart from me, there were a total of five people present.

King of Beauty, Min Jiwon.

The Maitreya King, Cha Sangkyung.

The Neutral King, Jeon Ildo.

The King of Wanderers.

Those were four people, and the remaining person…

It was strange. I didn't know him?

"Who is this person?"

"I am Kim Dokja."
"Oh, you are… hum, hum. I am the president of Yeouido, Yoo Hyunho."

Yeouido's president? The president already died. What was this bullshit?
Min Jiwon added in a sour voice. "…Yoo Hyunho-ssi isn't a king but he
leads a large force. That's why he is here."

"What king? Do you really think this is the Joseon Dynasty? We are living
in the era of a democracy. Please wake up!" I quietly activated Character
List.


  [Character Summary]

  Name: Yoo Hyunho

  Exclusive Attributes: Corrupt Politician (Rare)

  Sponsor: Master of Manipulating State Affairs

  Exclusive Skills: Bribery Lv. 5, Military Command Lv. 4, Corrupt
  Power Lv. 6, Control of the Masses Lv. 7…


I suddenly remembered. A politician who survived the first scenario. There
had clearly been such a person in several regressions. Usually Yeoido was
erased during the monster flood so he was lucky this time.

[The constellation 'Maritime War God' is angry with the corrupt officials of
Joseon.]

[The constellation 'Bald General of Justice' hates the incarnation Yoo
Hyunho.]
These messages probably had something to do with Yoo Hyunho's sponsor.
A master of manipulating state affairs who lived during the Joseon period…
I would've been able to ask Yoo Sangah if she was here.

"This person called Lee Sookyung is attending for a similar reason. I don't
know if you've heard but she is called the King of Wanderers."

The King of Wanderers looked at me. She was still wearing a mask. I stared
at the mask for a moment before turning my head to the left.

"There is no need for introductions. I would like to know why you called
me here."

Jeon Ildo sitting at the center of the table spoke after hearing my words.
"We are here to select the representatives who will participate in the sixth
scenario."

This was their purpose. Yoo Hyunho spoke after Jeon Ildo. "The people
gathered here are those with the greatest forces in Seoul Dome at present.
Kim Dokja-ssi is relatively small but you received the great honour of a
special invitation due to your contribution to the scenario."

"Ah, is that so?"

Special? Honour? What a ridiculous guy. He hid somewhere while I cleared
the scenario… Now he wanted to say these words?

Yoo Hyunho looked around and kept speaking. "Once again, it is time for
us to stop being barbarians. For a while, we went back to the primitive era
and repeated the struggles of society. However, our essence is that of
citizens who act according to strict social contracts! Then wouldn't it be
better to pick the next scenario participants using the democratic process?"
It was a dog barking but it sounded convincing because he mixed in several
right words. Min Jiwon replied, "What democratic process are you talking
about?"

"Like I said before, I think it is right to allocate the participants according to
the size of the force."

Jeon Ildo immediately retorted. "I know that Yeouido's group is the greatest
simply looking at numbers. That proposal isn't fair."

"Jeon Ildo-ssi, I am saddened by your words. Aren't we all Koreans? It
doesn't matter if a certain amount of people from a particular group is
selected. Once we enter the scenario, we will be facing foreign opponents.
Then the group we belong to won't matter. Are we going to fight each other
when the enemy is in front of us?"

He truly was a politician but Jeon Ildo wasn't that easily persuaded. "If it
doesn't matter who is picked then there isn't a reason to pick from your
group."

"Uhum, according to the democratic process, we have many powerful
people…"

I became annoyed when I heard it. "We are here to talk about this? I don't
know why we are picking people in the first place. Just send everyone who
wants to go."

"We originally thought like that but things changed."

"Changed?"

Min Jiwon nodded. "The scenario has a limited quota."

Limited?
"The kings received a message from the dokkaebis but you must not have
received it yet."

At this moment, a system message flashed in my head.

[Seoul Dome's initial quota is 10 people.]

[The size of the subsequent quotas will be decided depending on the
incarnations in the scenario.]

Oh, this was why they were fighting. Unlike the other incarnations, the
kings knew how important it was to get a strong start early in the scenario.
If they could put their own forces into the initial quota then they thought the
initiative of future scenarios would come to their group. In the end, this
place was going to become a battelfield over kings' positions.

"My group will go. I heard there are a lot of Japanese people in the
scenario area. I think it is right for me to take the lead as a descendant of
Silla." "No, I will go. Baekje had many wars with Japan since ancient
times."

"That's Baekje. Your sponsor is from Later Baekje."

"What does that mean? Of course I have to go. How can I believe in your
antiquated sponsor…"

"Everyone, wait a minute. Please calm down…"

Jeon Ildo came forward but couldn't calm the chaos down. I looked around
with a sigh and saw the King of Wanderers. She was watching me without
saying a word. I could see a slight smile below her half mask.

I had to settle this. The arguing kings had a fierce atmosphere like there was
going to be bloodshed.
"There is no use in us arguing about this now." The kings looked at me the
moment I said these words. Yoo Hyunho's eyes held a wordless question,
'What do you mean by that?'

I could feel the ground starting to tremble slightly, and picked up a biscuit
from the table. Now he was coming. Why did he always show up late?

"The last king hasn't come yet."

The moment I broke the biscuit, one side of the tent exploded and the
selfstyled president of Yeouido fell down with a scream.

"Kuaaak!"

A person appeared behind Yoo Hyunho. I glanced through a hole in the tent
and saw dozens of collapsed guards behind him.

This was our regressor. His temper was the same, no matter the regression.
The peculiar ferocious eyes swept through the group and soon focused on
me.

"K-King!" Some of the kings gasped.

Then the king, Yoo Joonghyuk opened his mouth. "I will announce the
people who will participate in the next scenario."
            Chapter 118: Ep. 23 - Abandoned World, III


There was no room for disagreement. For him, the representatives selection
wasn't a subject of discussion but a presentation.

"Speak now if you have a complaint."

There was no way to express dissatisfaction towards such a fearsome
killing intent. The kings knew Yoo Joonghyuk's strength and trembled
without even thinking about rebellion. Ah, except for one person.

"G-Get out! Now!" Unfortunately, the self-styled President of Yeouido
had never heard about the Supreme King. The politician didn't pay
attention to rumours. "Where did you come from…?" Kwajik!

"Kuaaack!" Yoo Hyunho screamed as his hand was crushed. "My hand! My
hand!"

Kwajijik!
"Kuaaack! Bodyguards! Where are my bodyguards?"

Yoo Hyunho struggled for help but there was no one here who could help
him. Yoo Joonghyuk's stood on his back, not leaving him any room to
breathe, and it only took a few moments until Yoo Hyunho passed out.

Once everything became calm, Yoo Joonghyuk opened his mouth. "I didn't
think so. Then I will announce the roster."

The faces of the kings became tense. Yoo Joonghyuk truly was great.
Taking the reigns of power so easily…

The kings quickly fell from the 'picking' position to 'being picked'. I
grabbed a beef jerky from the table and waited for Yoo Joonghyuk's words.

Min Jiwon stared blankly from next to me.

「 How can you be so calm? 」

I'm sorry but I was in a different situation from them. It was because I was
someone Yoo Joonghyuk recognized as a 'companion'. He threatened me by
saying that the oath was over but he did acknowledge me.

Yoo Joonghyuk opened his mouth. "The first one will naturally be me."

Well, it was obvious. How could he not be on a list created by himself?
Behind Yoo Joonghyuk, the rest of his party members had appeared. Lee
Jihye and Lee Seolhwa.

Lee Hyunsung and Jung Heewon also looked inside with anxious eyes. In
particular, Jung Heewon was about to jump inside, but a look on my face
stopped her.

Yoo Joonghyuk continued. "The second person will be Lee Jihye."

I thought the second one would be me so I was naturally surprised. Well, I
originally wasn't his companion so his other party members might be
disturbed if he called me first. He might look cold but he looked after his
people. I could understand that sentiment.

Lee Jihye couldn't hide her joy as she smiled at me.

…Still, it was a bit annoying.

"The third is Lee Seolhwa." Lee Seolhwa nodded and came forward.

Every time a person's name was called, the faces of the kings darkened.
They all felt an ominous feeling. Yoo Joonghyuk's list was a fixed list.

「 There are seven people remaining. We still have a chance. 」

「 The Supreme King only has three party members. He will have to
choose other people. 」

「 We are the strongest among the remaining people… 」

I could tell by their faces what they were thinking. Me? Of course, I wasn't
worried. I would naturally be on the list. Maybe I would be next…

"The fourth one is Lee Hyunsung."

…What? Lee Hyunsung became pale as his name was called.

"Y-You mean me…?"

Yoo Joonghyuk ignored the words and looked at the next person. "The fifth
is Jung Heewon."

"…It's me?" Jung Heewon's eyes widened with surprise. It was unexpected
that he chose Jung Heewon over me. This bastard was picking from my
party?

"The sixth is Lee Gilyoung."
"…Uh? Huh?"

Then Yoo Joonghyuk looked at Shin Yoosung who was next to Lee
Gilyoung. Shin Yoosung hid behind Lee Gilyoung with fearful eyes.

The confused Lee Gilyoung was stunned for a moment but he stood in front
of Shin Yoosung like he made a decision. Yoo Joonghyuk looked down at
the two children with an unreadable look before turning his head away.

"Then…" Yoo Joonghyuk's eyes finally stopped on me. Yes, it was finally
my turn. Did he deliberately leave me until the end? As expected from a
main character, he knew how to direct a show.

"…You can take care of the rest."

I coughed on the beef jerky. Yoo Joonghyuk looked around the tent before
turning to leave, like there was no more work to be done. This was it?
Really?

…Then what about me? Why was he looking at me like that? I belatedly
chased after him but Yoo Joonghyuk was already gone. How long did I
stand there?

Jung Heewon stood in the distance and asked me carefully. "Weren't the
two of you friendly?" I thought so.

[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' is laughing with delight.]

Lee Jihye also added in a strange tone. "Ahjussi, didn't you meet with
Master last night? I thought you would be the first on the list…"

"What do you mean?"

"Last night Master said he was going to see you?"

"Last night?"
"It was around one or two o'clock? Were you sleeping?"

I thought about the time. It was between one or two o'clock in the morning.
I think it was just before I went to the Underworld. "I was awake at that
time but Yoo Joonghyuk didn't come."

"That's strange? He definitely went to find you. He was also a bit angry
when he came back."

"Angry?"

"You know that look Master makes when he is angry. Like he is
contemptuous of a person…"

I pondered on the memories of that time. What was I doing right before I
went to the Underworld? Ah, yes. A memory came to mind. At that time, I
was drinking with Yoo Sangah. Dionysus poured alcohol and made the
atmosphere strange, then… uh…um.

[The constellation 'God of Wine and Ecstasy' is making a playful
expression.]

[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' is laughing with delight.]

[500 coins have been sponsored.]

I felt a bit complicated as I explained what happened. The party members
looked surprised. Jung Heewon stared at me with narrowed eyes.

"…You kissed Yoo Sangah-ssi?"

"No, that's not it… what did you hear?"

"Was it really Dionysus? You weren't pretending to be drunk?"
"It was because of Dionysus and nothing happened."

Jung Heewon looked at me with suspicious eyes.

…Why was this brought up?

"Hrmm… perhaps Yoo Joonghyuk-ssi saw it? That's why his mood is
bad…"

"Yoo Joonghyuk isn't that type of person."

"Even if Yoo Joonghyuk-ssi witnessed Dokja-ssi's kiss scene, I don't think
there is a reason to feel angry…"

"It wasn't a kiss." I grumbled and Lee Jihye exclaimed with a smile.

"Ah! I think I know…"

[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' says it is a companionship.]

Jung Heewon cocked her head. "…Companionship?"

Lee Jihye dealt a big blow. "What is Unni's sponsor? They think it is just
companionship?"

"What do you mean?"

"Companions, I think I understand." Lee Hyunsung unexpectedly
interrupted. "Come to think of it, I would also feel offended if I saw Kim
Dokja doing that."

[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' has snorted at the unexpected
remark.]

"…Yes? Why would Hyunsung-ssi feel bad?" Lee Jihye looked like she
was going to get a nosebleed.
Lee Hyunsung's expression was serious. I was nervous about what
bombshell words Lee Hyunsung would say. "We are risking our lives in
every scenario. Yoo Joonghyuk-ssi trains his body every morning to
prepare for the following scenarios. I trains severely every day to protect
his companions."

"…Huh?" Lee Jihye made a strange expression at the unexpected answer.
Jung Heewon listened to Lee Hyunsung's words with a doubtful expression.

"If a companion is blinded by sexual desire in such a situation then I would
be in a bad mood. I would also feel betrayed. Yoo Joonghyuk might not be
a soldier but he is a very austere person. Such a person would react
sensitively when people aren't disciplined. It would feel like their priorites
are wrong." "Um… it make sense." Jung Heewon agreed.

[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' is disappointed with her
incarnation.]

[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' resents Lee Hyunsung's
wrong companionship.]

I heard Lee Hyunsung's words and thought it was true. A scene from Ways
of Survival suddenly came to mind. I opened the text, searched Yoo
Joonghyuk's third regression and was able to find evidence.

「 Pathetic person. You sell yourself to women with one glance. 」

「 Those with strong sexual desires are excluded from my list of
companions. It is easy for them to make mistakes. 」

It was really unfair if Yoo Joonghyuk had actually misunderstood me. It
wasn't even a kiss. Damn, I couldn't tell him it was a misunderstanding
now…

"Kim Dokja-ssi? We want to pick the rest of the people." Min Jiwon
suddenly approached me.
I looked back and saw the other kings watching me.

"The Supreme King picked six people and there are four spots remaining."

"We have to pick four…"

Yeouido's group had already been destroyed and now there were five kings
remaining. The Maitreya King Cha Sangkyung noticed and opened his
mouth first.

"Hum, there are only four spots and the remaining people are…"

"Why don't we decide it with a match?" I was the one who gave the
opinion.
"We will just be wasting time arguing among ourselves. Everyone wants to
fill the spots with their own forces so let's fight. The king who wins will
decide the remaining spots."

The kings glanced at each other at my words. A moment later, the reply
was heard.

"Okay."




Once again, the Neutral King declared that he would abstain.

"I'll stay behind. Someone should stay here and lead the people…"

It was a wise choice. If they couldn't get ahead in the scenario then it wasn't
a bad idea to build a strong base here instead. In addition, people didn't
know it yet but there was a scenario for the incarnations left behind. The
dokkaebi who loved strong stimuli couldn't let the incarnations live
peacefully.
The King of Wanderers also raised her hand to express her intention to
abstain. The other kings seemed surprised but thought i was fortunate that
their competitors had reduced. Min Jiwon looked at me and declared
confidently.

"The same method as before won't work."

Maybe she knew that I won the Absolute Throne with my stockpile of
coins.

…Did I seem that shallow? We exchanged blows. It took less than five
minutes before the match was over.

Who won? There was no need to ask.

"No way… I thought only the Supreme King was a monster. How did you
become so strong?"

Cha Sangkyung was bloody while Min Jiwon gasped as she spoke. Yes, it
would've been easier if I had done this from the beginning.

I shrugged and stated, "The initial quota is 10 people so everyone should
wait. The second round will start soon."

"…Hah, you use every means. Who will you send?"

"One will be me and she will be the other person."

Shin Yoosung's eyes brightened at my words. She had been worried about
being left alone.

"The remaining two are…I am thinking of someone."

"It isn't me?"

"No, it isn't Min Jiwon-ssi."
"Tsk… I see."

Min Jiwon got up from the dusty ground. The depressed kings left their
spots one by one. I gave a command to my party members. "Please leave
first. I need to do something. Meet me in front of the station later."

The party members nodded and left the tent, the crowded interior becoming
empty in an instant.

…

After a bit more time, only one person besides me was left in the tent. It
was a masked woman. Then her mouth opened for the first time.

"It seems like you have many friends."

I hesitated to the last moment. I didn't want to talk to her. However, I had to
ask for her help to get the person I needed in the next scenario.

I took a deep breath before saying to the King of Wanderers. "It has been a
long time, Mother."
            Chapter 119: Ep. 23 - Abandoned World, IV


The King of Wanderers smiled slightly at my words. "It has been a long
time? I saw you last time."

"We just passed by each other at the time."

So far, I had seen the King of Wanderers twice. The first was when Han
Sooyoung and I destroyed Song Minwoo and the second was when the
Disaster of Floods was killed.

This was the third time…

The King of Wanderers slowly took off her mask. As expected, it was
really her.

I asked, "When did you get out?"

"A little while ago."
We looked at each other for a moment. My mother and I didn't look alike.
No matter how hard I looked, it was only a face in the late 30s. When I was
a child, I often heard that she looked like my older cousin. Of course, that
was when I still had my father.

"Did you live in Seoul?"

She replied, "I came to meet someone I knew."

"Then you were accidentally caught in the Seoul Dome?"

"Yes."

"You have been released. Why are you wearing the prison uniform?"

"Let's see? Perhaps it is out of a desire for atonement?"

"…Atonement? You?"

"Every human is a prisoner. They have their own prison."

I stared at my mother. That shameless tone… She really hadn't changed.
She told me, "Can't you say any words of thanks? You would've had a
harder time without me."

…Certainly, she helped. My mother led her forces north to the disaster. It
was great, no matter how weak the disaster. In fact, I believed that she
would do it properly. I hated my mother but I also knew my mother well.

"You are meeting your mother but you don't seem happy."

"Do you really want me to be?"

"A little bit."

[The exclusive skill 'Lie Detection Lv. 1' is activated.]
[You have confirmed that the statement is false.]

How funny. I knew it was a lie but I still had to check. I said, "You have
survived. You are a great survivor."

"It is thanks to the story you told me."

"…I guess so."

"You are the only one who came to the prison to see me and told me about
the novel you read."

That was correct. I never had a proper conversation with my mother during
all the times I visited her at the prison. I only talked about Ways of
Survival. Once I became tired of it, I stopped visiting. "I didn't have
anything else to say apart from the novel." "How can that be?"

"The novel was all I had."

An image of the past came to mind before disappearing. If there hadn't been
Ways of Survival or the author who wrote the story, perhaps I wouldn't be
in this world right now. This story was the only comfort to the Kim Dokja
who didn't have a mother or a father.

My mother muttered, "It is at most a fantasy novel…"

"In the end, you survived thanks to that novel."

We stared silently at each other for a moment.

[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' is looking at you with
excited eyes.]

[The constellation 'Secretive Plotter' is looking at you with strange eyes.]

[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' is watching you with sad
eyes.]
I was the one who broke the silence first. "What attributes did you get? It
might be related to the novel I told you."

"Should I tell you?"

"Yes, if you still think of me as your child."

"I wonder if you think of me as your mother."

"A little bit."

[The character 'Lee Sookyung' has used 'Lie Detection Lv. 1'.]

['Lee Sookyung' has confirmed that the statement is false.]

Dammit. My mother already had this skill. There was a hint of sorrow in
my mother's expression. I had no way of knowing if it was acting or not.

She asked, "Are you still holding a grudge against me?"

"I'm not here to talk about that."

"Your father was the bad guy."

"I know."

There were certainly 'bad people' in this world. One type used violence
against their wives, illegally gambled and threatened their family's
livelihood.

My father was a bad person. I knew it, my mother knew it and South
Korea's laws said it. However…

"Your actions weren't right just because my father was a bad person."

"There are things we have to sacrifice for a better life."
"There is no such law in South Korea. There is a law that any human who
commits murder should go to prison."

"You think life is that simple because you only read novels."

"For me, reality was more like a novel. Because of you."

At this point, it already wasn't a normal conversation between mother and
son. This was why I didn't want to talk to her. I knew what would happen
when we talked. We knew too much about how to hurt each other.

I changed the topic. "Do you know why I was looking for you?"

"Why don't you tell me?"

"I can tell when you are lying, so stop beeing coy."

My mother smiled lightly.

"You have prisoner №406, right? Lend that old woman to me."

"…Wouldn't it be better to take the incarnation with Jeon Woochi as a
sponsor than this grandmother? I have many useful incarnations."

"Jeon Woochi's incarnation is your companion. Besides, the grandmother
will be of more help."

My mother stared at me for a moment before nodding. "Certainly, she
might be useful because of the opponents. By the way, how do you know
the sponsor of №406?"

"I can't say."

"Do you have a skill that lets you sponsors?"

I couldn't say anything to my mother. "Are you going to lend her to me?"
"I'll lend her. Instead…"

I was a bit afraid of what she would say next. My mother would
probably suggest a deal I couldn't imagine at all. She said with a faint
smile, "Next time, introduce me to your friends." I was struck
speechless.

…Shit. It was a perfect blow. My mother was the best at making bad people
worse.

"Dokja-yah. Make sure to look properly at reality. Even if fiction becomes
reality, you mustn't think of fiction as reality."

[The exclusive skill, 'Fourth Wall' is shaking violently!]

I only heard a few words but my entire world seemed to shake. I knew for
sure. This person was the strongest reminder of the reality I hated.

"Do you understand?"

[The stigma 'Self-Rationalization Lv. 1' is activated.]

Disgusting. Now she wanted to act like a mother. Too many rivers had been
crossed to go back now.

[The exclusive skill, 'Fourth Wall's' shaking has subsided.]

I couldn't bear it anymore and stood up. "That's right. I think that fiction is
like reality. Why? It is because I have always been living that way."

"…"

"Maybe it seems pathetic to you. However, know this. At least I didn't sell
'reality as fiction' like you did."
I left the tent with these last words. Cool air entered my coat's collar and
reached my body. I looked in front of me and saw the slightly startled Yoo
Sangah.

"I-I'm sorry… Dokja-ssi was late…"

It was difficult. No, rather than difficult… It was shameful.

"Did you hear everything?"

Yoo Sangah bowed her head in a deep apology. The crown of her head
could be seen.

I eventually sighed. "Would you like to take a walk?"

We walked along the platform of Yongsan Station. It was definitely a cold
wind but the temperature changed when it touched my cheeks. I never had
time to wash my hair, yet Yoo Sangah's hair smelled nice and fresh.

I asked, "How is your hangover?"

"It's okay. By the way, I heard that you carried me on your back. I'm sorry.
I troubled you."

"It was because you were looking after me."

We were silent for a moment before I opened my mouth. "Do you think it is
strange? Why are a mother and son talking like that?"

"That's not true."

She was lying. It was extremely strange.

"Do you want to know?"

Yoo Sangah's eyes shook for a moment. "…If you don't mind."
I smiled bitterly. Yes, now was the time to talk. I took a deep breath before
saying with exaggerated calmness. "My mother killed my father."

Strangely, my words sounded ridiculous. I spoke like it was someone else's
story.

"She went to prison for her sin."

I continued speaking.

"My father… it is shameful to say this, but he deserved to die. Domestic
violence, gambling, laundering money… my mother and I lived in fear
every day. There wasn't a single day without bruises. He hit me too
sometimes. Then one day, my mother made up her mind and it happened."

"Ah…"

"I thought it was quite well-known at the company. Yoo Sangah-ssi didn't
know?"

There was no answer from Yoo Sangah. She had belatedly realized that she
had touched a wound she shouldn't have touched.

"Do you feel even stranger now? What she did was illegal, but you are
wondering why I would hate my mother for that."

"No! I'm not Dokja-ssi so I don't fully understand…"

"Honestly, do you think I should forgive her?"

Yoo Sangah couldn't say anything. It couldn't be helped. The touched
wound had already burst.

There was an awkward silence before I spoke again. "Do you know the
book called the Underground Killer? It was previously on the Kyobo
bestsellers
list."
I brought up the book out of the blue, so Yoo Sangah thought I was trying
to switch the topic and replied awkwardly, "I think I've heard of it. Wasn't it
an amazing bestseller?"

"It was an essay written by an abused woman in prison after she killed her
husband. It was praised by critics at the time. They said that a Korean
version of Notes from Underground had come out. Of course, it was
completely overrated."

Yoo Sangah's face suddenly darkened. She had noticed. I hadn't changed
the topic at all.

"That's right. My mother wrote it."

Yoo Sangah's lips dropped open.

"I still remember the time a bunch of reporters waited in front of my house.
They kept asking me if the essay was real."

"…"

"I remember everything my classmates said. They told me that my mother
made money by selling murder."

"Dokja-ssi…"

"My relatives also said this. My mother is a murderer. How dare she slip
her face into the newspapers?"

Yoo Sangah wanted to say something but I kept going.

"It was a bit hard because of this. No, it was hard for a long time."

"…"
"I could bear to be the child of a murderer. However, it is different to be
sold as a story. It is a different matter when my life was turned into money
by someone."

I looked at the sky. It wasn't night but I was more certain than ever that the
distant constellations were watching me. Perhaps this story was meant for
them as well.

However, no constellations sent me coins. Should I be glad? I didn't know.

"Do you still think that I should forgive my mother?"

I didn't want an answer. I didn't want her to understand in the first place.
Maybe this was the ugliest form of violence I could do against Yoo Sangah,
who grew up in a well-off family. It was an arbitrary display of
unhappiness forced onto someone who would never understand.

The kind Yoo Sangah would grieve knowing that it was impossible for her
to understand. I laughed at the unknown sense of victory. "I'm sorry. It was
a joke."

"Huh?"

"It was a lie. Were you fooled? Do you think there is a novel like this? My
mother and I are ordinary people and my father had an accident when I was
young…"

Then something small and soft gripped my hand. The texture was so warm
that I forgot what I was about to say. For a while… I stopped walking.

Yoo Sangah wasn't looking at me. Thus, I wasn't looking at her either.
We walked hand in hand without facing each other. It was as if this
alone was sufficient. Strangely, my heart gradually calmed.
[The exclusive skill, 'Fourth Wall' is shaking faintly.] Perhaps it was due
to the realistic body temperature.
"Dokja-ssi!"

We neared the entrance of the station and there was the sound of people
rushing forward. We reflexively let go of our hands. Jung Heewon ran over
and asked, "Did the two of you kiss again?"

"K-Kiss?"

"Yoo Sangah-ssi is blushing. You did it, you did it!"

I would've misunderstood if I didn't know Yoo Sangah a bit more.

"Stop playing around. Nothing happened."

"Yes yes, I'm sure." Jung Heewon looked at me and said, "A strange old
lady came to find us. Did Dokja-ssi invite her?"

An old woman with a cane walked out from the back of the party. "I hope
this useless old body will be of help…"

Like other prisoners, the grandmother was wearing a blue prison uniform.
She was prisoner №406. My mother acted very quickly.

"Are you Kim Dokja?"

"Yes, that's me."

"I've heard a lot about you from Sookyung. It is a pleasure."

"It is also a pleasure."

Sookyung was my mother's name. I looked around at the party members
and said, "She is indeed the person I called for. Let's depart."

We exited Yongsan Station and went to a place where people were
gathered. Yoo Joonghyuk's party and the kings were already gathered there.
A white crystal slowly fell from the Great Hole in the sky. It was a crystal
that shone with light.

[Warp Crystal.]

This was the item we would use to go to the next scenario area.
              Chapter 120: Ep. 23 - Abandoned World, V


There were exactly five grooves in the crystal. Yoo Joonghyuk and I were
well aware of what to place there.

Yoo Joonghyuk stood next to me and said, "You came."

"Yes. Unfortunately."

"It doesn't matter if you sit this one out." I turned towards Yoo Joonghyuk
at the unexpected words. This guy was still talking without looking at me.
"You have a woman you love."

"…What?"

"It'll be hard."

It felt like I understood something that couldn't be resolved. Perhaps
he didn't want to take me to the scenario out of care towards me? It
was ridiculous. Yoo Joonghyuk? "It could be the last time."
I shook my head. It wasn't necessarily impossible when I thought about it.
Yoo Joonghyuk had lost Lee Seolhwa in the second regression. It wasn't an
exaggeration to say that Yoo Joonghyuk was arguably the world's greatest
authority when it came to losing a loved one.

I told him, "It's not like that. Do you think my face is full of love?"

I didn't mean it but the words sounded like self-deprecation. Let me say this
first. I have a decent face.

Yoo Joonghyuk stared at me quietly and said, "Certainly, I don't care if
you die." Shit.

"Your words are too harsh. I'm hurt."

"Don't forget I still have one hit left."

"…Ah, yes. I had almost forgotten. Thanks for reminding me."

I didn't know if this bastard wanted me to live or to die. I communicated
directly to my companions through the group chat.

–I will inform you of the precautions now.

Using the group chat meant that things should be kept secret. The party
members focused on my story while pretending to be quiet.

–The warp crystal transports two people together. That's why we will move
in pairs, like I mentioned before.

–Yoosung will be with me as team 1, Heewon-ssi and Hyunsung-ssi will be
team 2, Yoo Sangah-ssi and №406 will be team 3. Gilyoung doesn't have a
partner so he will go with Yoo Joonghyuk's group. That Yoo Joonghyuk…
he can take care of himself.

–You might get dizzy when moving through the crystal. Please don't panic.
The scenario will start as soon as you arrive. Keep in mind that once the
scenario begins in earnest…

I was rapidly rattling off instructions when the dokkaebi appeared on top of
the warp crystal.

[Wait a minute. I'm really sorry but I have an emergency announcement.]

Emergency announcement?

[I forgot to mention that the number of people who can participate from
Seoul Dome is 8, not 10.]

"What are you suddenly saying?"

All the participants were already decided…

Looking closer, this was the dokkaebi who asked me about how to update
the scenario in the Underworld. Was he called Youngki?

[This scenario… there are those who have already gone to the sixth
scenario due to the dimension warping in the fifth scenario becoming
twisted.]

"…Someone is already there?"

[Yes, Seoul Dome already has two people in the scenario.]

That reminded me, Han Sooyoung and Gong Pildu were already in the
scenario. I saw them on the screen in the Underworld but had forgotten for
a moment.

By the way, part of the dimension warped. It seemed that the intermediate
dokkaebi had intervened quite a bit in the scenario to kill me.

[It might be a scenario error but I am removing two of the existing spots for
fairness.]
"What? You can't do that! Then who the hell is going?"

The people who weren't even going were the most upset. The party
members looked at me with troubled expressions. Even Yoo Joonghyuk
was watching me. It was an expression that told me to make the decisions.
Damn…

Unexpectedly, the first one to raise her hand was Yoo Sangah. "I'll stay
back."

She noticed my hesitation and decided to help by coming forward herself. I
had to take that grandmother, even if I lost Yoo Sangah.

Jung Heewon raised her hand next. "I will also stay back. Won't there be
another quota anyway?"

"Is it okay?"

"Dokja-ssi looks worried today but don't you know? This time that scary
person is on the same side."

Certainly, it was reassuring if Jung Heewon and Yoo Sangah were left
behind. They would be able to make it into the second quota, even if there
was a lot of competition.

In the end, the two people dropped out and Lee Hyunsung paired up with
the grandmother. The grandmother looked vaguely pleased.

Just before we left, I whispered to Yoo Sangah. "I forgot to say this but tell
the King of Wanderers to be wary of Jeon Ildo. I think you already know
why."

Yoo Sangah nodded and hesitated before whispering to me. "Don't die."

I nodded. Then Jung Heewon asked, "…Aren't you departing now? I'm not
a constellation but they must be impatient."
Yoo Sangah blushed and retreated while my party and I approached the
warp crystal. I pulled out everything that I acquired from the disasters.

The Protection Symbol of the Imyuntar.

Protection Symbol of the Parasites.

The Protection Symbol of the Jenobel.

Then Yoo Joonghyuk and №406 pulled out one each. They were protection
symbols obtained from defeating the Disaster of Ice and Disaster of Water.

[Insert the five protection symbols.]

The message flowed from the Warp Crystal and we placed them in the
grooves.

There were five protection symbols. It was proof that this world was
protected from the disasters. Only those who survived the disasters were
qualified to go to other worlds.

[The qualifications are complete.]

[The Warp Crystal is activated.]

The crystal split into four pieces and a blue coloured door was created. We
entered in pairs. Shin Yoosung and I held each other firmly and moved
through the door.

[The main scenario has been updated.]




I opened my eyes and Shin Yoosung and I were in a lush forest. We
stumbled and felt the clay texture of the soil. I was dizzy enough to vomit. I
told the party members not to panic but it was funny that I was the only one
to get dizzy.

I looked around and saw that Shin Yoosung was in the midst of vomiting.
"Are you okay?"

"Urgh…"

I patted Shin Yoosung's back and looked around. My mind was confused
but I couldn't stay in this chaotic state. I looked in front of me, behind me
and to the side. Only the forest was visible.

We were in the middle of the forest. It was a scenery that was too similar to
Earth.

[The main scenario 'Abandoned World' has begun.]

The scenario message rose straight away. However, I couldn't afford to
check the details of the main scenario right now. I could already feel killing
intent from the nearby bushes.

"Yoosung."

Shin Yoosung came to her senses and raised her head. Rustling sounds
came from the bushes. This was one of the places where new scenario
entrants were warped to. If I assumed the worst, those in the bushes were
the incarnations of other countries that arrived before us.

I nervously prepared to use the Bookmark skill. Maybe those who warped
to this world were the elite among the elites. If I didn't do my best in the
beginning, my head could fly in the blink of an eye.

However, the thing that emerged from the bushes wasn't what I expected.

[The 7th grade monster 'steel wolf' has appeared.]
Shin Yoosung and I looked at each other with an identical expressions on
our faces after hearing that. It was funny. We were probably the only ones
who would be relieved by this message.

"I think they are quite small, ahjussi."

Given the fact that typical monsters were the size of a house, the current
steel wolves were the size of ordinary wolves. There were approximately
10 of them. It wasn't a difficult number to deal with.

[The character 'Shin Yoosung' has used 'Advanced Diverse Communication
Lv. 3'.]

Shin Yoosung used Advanced Diverse Communication to make the
monsters fight each other. Those Shin Yoosung failed to tame were killed
by the Blade of Faith. The 7th grade monsters were unbelievably fragile. It
seemed that their strength was reduced as their size became smaller.

Shin Yoosong wondered, "…Uh? There are no coins?"

"The event is over."

"There aren't even any items. There are no cores."

"There is a lot of difference in stats."

"Are they really 7th grade monsters? They seem more like 9th grade…"

Shin Yoosung looked a bit lost. It was probably because the first monsters
she met after being so tense were weak.

That reminded me, the condition of the forest was a bit strange. This type of
forest would normally have trees that rose far above my head. However,
these trees were only a little bit taller than my head.
The contents of the scenario were still a mystery. There was only the title
'Abandoned World' while everything else were still filled with question
marks.

[The scenario activation conditions haven't been met yet.]

I jumped up a bit and looked around. Fortunately, the trees weren't tall so I
could see the scenery of the surrounding area just by jumping lightly.

"It isn't all a forest. Let's go over there."

In fact, I knew what to expect if I left this zone. We moved along a forest
path. Not long afterwards, the forest ended and a plains appeared. On the
plains…

"…Ahjussi?"

We faced a group of soldiers.

"They appeared! It really is a scenario!" Someone shouted at us. It sounded
like Korean, even if it was an alien language.

The confused Shin Yoosung stepped towards me.

Hundreds of troops were filling the vast plains. There were dozens of
cavalry and hundreds of archers. In addition, there were hundreds of
infantry. There were enough people for a war waiting for us here.

"Everybody prepare their skills!"

"Prepare to advance!"

Numerous people pointed spears and lances at us. We didn't do anything
but were seen as enemies.

"Attack―!"
It would obviously be an overwhelming sight if it was normal. If only it
wasn't for their size.

"Waaaaahhhhh!" The troops running across the plaints were small people
the size of my fist.

Shin Yoosung cried out, "They are tiny!"

"They are the inhabitants of this place."

"Surely we don't have to fight them? No?" Shin Yoosung stepped away
from the small people who were running. "…I feel sorry because they are
so small."

[You have met with the people of this world. Check the scenario contents.]

Then a scream came from the distance.


"A-A disaster has appeared on the other side!"

"Kuaaack!"

"R-Run away! Full retreat!"

The small people rushing towards us started running away. It was due to the
incarnations killing the small people in the distance.

"Hahahaha!"

"What is this? It is a really easy scenario!"

It was probably a foreign language being interpreted. There were two
samurai wielding swords. They were Japanese. They were playful as they
casually cut down the small people like bugs.
Shin Yoosung watched the ruthless butchery and cried out in a stricken
voice. "…Ahjussi? What is this scenario? What should we do?"

I knew why Yoo Joonghyuk didn't want to bring Shin Yoosung. If I thought
about it, he might be more humane than me.

"It isn't just our planet that runs scenarios in the Star Stream." I pointed to
the small people fleeing the plains. "This scenario is a scenario that we
share with them."

[Many of the constellations are hungry for violence and blood.]

[A significant number of constellations are urging you to make a bold
choice.
[The main scenario is activated.]


  [Main Scenario # 6 - Abandoned World]

  Category: Main


  Difficulty: S

  Clear Conditions: Wipe out all dominant species on the No. 9871
  planetary system, the planet called Peace Land.

  Time Limit: 40 days

  Compensation: 200,000 coins, ???

  Failure: ―


In the sixth scenario, we no longer had the role of preventing a disaster.
[You have become a disaster of the planet Peace Land.]

In this place, we must be disasters that destroyed this world.
       Chapter 121: Ep. 24 - Things that Can Be Changed, I


Soon afterwards, the plains became stained with blood from the battle. No,
it couldn't be called a battle.

Internal organs flowed from the torn flesh of the small people. Every time
the Japanese moved, the small people were trampled on.

"Aaaaaaack!"

"H-help! Somebody, help!"

It might be a small scream but the weight of life was the same. They were
small in size but they had a normal life like the humans on Earth until the
scenarios arrived. People ate, worked and lived an ordinary life with their
family…

The familiar scenes from Earth overlapped with the corpses of the fallen
small people.
The Japanese incarnations shouted. "Hahaha! This is what it feels like!"
Perhaps Xun Kuang should've been born in this age. It was an age where
evidence that human nature was fundamentally evil was everywhere.

The victims who were slaughtered by someone immediately turned into the
perpetrators when provided power and rewards. Maybe they were even
worse because they had been hit once.

Shin Yoosung asked me, "…How can they do this?"

Perhaps it wasn't a question that she was really curious about. She already
knew the answer to the question. I placed a hand on Shin Yoosung's
shoulder without a word. Shin Yoosung's shoulders shook like a person
carrying a heavy burden.

"This is too much…!"

Gain coins, gain new items, gain skills and become stronger. People didn't
know a way to live a bit longer in this world. That's why all survivors
understood other survivors. Some survivors lived in shame because they
understood it.

"D-Disaster…" A small person crawled towards our feet. "P-Please,
mercy…"

The power that went beyond common sense evoked fear and awe. For the
inhabitants of Peace Land, humans were both gods and disasters.

I bent over and extended a finger to the small person. His hand reached out
towards this finger. There were rough breathing sounds as the small person
came into contact with the tip of my finger.

A strange joy filled the face of the small person at the moment of his final
breath. It was as if he touched a god and received salvation.

[Perform the duties of a disaster.]
Now we had to kill these small people. I felt Shin Yoosung emitting a
boiling magic power next to me. I was afraid she would immediately rush
to the Japanese people but her killing intent was directed in a very rational
direction. "That… that guy made this scenario?"

It was the intermediate dokkaebi. Unlike low-grade dokkaebis, a graceful
looking dokkaebi was effortlessly floating in the air with his arms crossed.
It wasn't Paul who was taken to the bureau. He would be melting in the heat
of Hell right now.

I remembered the text of Ways of Survival that I read beforehand.

「 The intermediate dokkaebi of the Abandoned World scenario. His name
is Ganul. 」

The intermediate dokkaebi Ganul said.

[As expected, the 3rd quota players of Japan Dome are hot from the
beginning. I hope you will make a lot of coins on Peace Land.]

It was the third quota…

As expected, the scenario of Japan Dome was very hard.

"Haha, this is the best! This is the reason why the first and second quota
people ran so quickly."

"Do you see the coins coming in right now? This scenario is like a money
printer!"

[Many constellations are excited.]

[Some constellations want to see 10 small people being killed at the same
time.]

Anger soon filled the face of Shin Yoosung.
"It is because of these bastards…!"

However, there was no place for her rage to go. The constellations were on
top of the Star Stream. They weren't someone whom a mere incarnation like
Shin Yoosung could face. That's why all we could do was find a scapegoat
to pour out this anger towards.

"Hahaha, 10 at once! I will kill you first!"

I couldn't find any traces of reason in the eyes of the Japanese people
joyfully wielding their swords. In their eyes, the small people probably
looked like living coins.

"Ahjussi, this…!"

Then a heavily armed small person walked out of the troops. He seemed to
be the commander of this army.

"Glory to Kal-Seiviah!"

The commander of the army raised his sword and bravely rushed towards
the disaster. The Japanese people seemed annoyed and swung their swords.

Surprisingly, the small person escaped with swift movements. The
surprised Japanese incarnation cried out. "W-What?"

The commander ran along the blade and succeeded in stabbing the back of
the Japanese person's hand for the first time. It was a great combat power.
The startled Japanese person waved his arms to shake off the small person.

"Dammit! It hurts!"

The small person screamed as he was thrown onto the plains. The other
Japanese people laughed amusedly.

"There is a pretty brave person?"
It was almost as if there hadn't been a successful blow but there was a faint
smile on the face of the small person who succeeded. There was a small
scratch on the back of the Japanese person's hand, as if he had been stabbed
by a needle.

"L-Look! A disaster is bleeding!"

"Wahhhhh!"

It was one drop of blood. This drop of blood was a miracle to the small
people. They could also kill a disaster. The gods were bleeding. It was only
one drop but it taught the small people.

"We can do it! Attack! Just a bit more!"

The small people stopped fleeing and started running towards the disaster.

"What's happening?"

"Go away! You worms!"

The small people swung swords smaller than toothpicks at the Japanese
people. The useless arrows filled the air and the cavalry maintained their
formation without giving up, driving their lances towards the feet of the
Japanese. There was still no damage but the small people didn't give up.

Shin Yoosung watched the scene with her hands clasped tightly together.
Then an indirect message was heard.

[A small planet's constellation is supporting the incarnation 'Gillemium'.]

The constellation of a small planet. A constellation that was born on a small
planet and grew on the beliefs of the small humans.

[A small planet's constellation has sponsored 10 coins to the incarnation
'Gillemium'.]
Perhaps the incarnation called 'Gillemium' was the name of the small
person who hurt the Japanese for the first time.

"Kal-Seiviahhhh!"

All of the small people were excited, as if they could win if they attacked a
bit more. At least, until the voice of the intermediate dokkaebi was heard.

[This situation is fun. Isn't it more exciting with resistance?]

The dokkaebi Ganul laughed as if to ridicule the resistance of the small
people. It was a strange laugh.

[The bigger the despair, the darker the story.]

A black aura emerged from the bodies of the Japanese incarnations. The
small people realized that something was wrong and stopped attacking.

[Now part of the disaster penalty is lifted. If you choose the path of 'evil',
you can get additional buffs.]

The Japanese people looked down at their bodies and frowned. "Why do we
need this?"

"This game is already too easy… This will make the fun vanish."

[This is also easy. Think of it as a game to relieve stress.]

"Well, if you say so…"

The Japanese people chuckled and didn't hesitate. A strong magic power
filled the Japanese people. Based on their stigma, they seemed to have a
samurai sponsor. I didn't think they were famous…

[Some of the probability constraints on the disaster have been lifted.]
[The synchronization with the disasters and sponsors will increase for a
period of time.

[The lacking probability will be paid by the Star Stream's bureau.]

The ground was crushed and blood splattered from over a hundred of the
small people. It was a considerable destructive power. However, from the
viewpoint of the small people…

…No, it would be surprising for the small children. In front of these
disasters, several small people urinated while others fell unconscious. The
small people stared blankly at the disaster, as if they had forgotten how to
scream.

"Ah, ahh… Uwah…"

The small people holding weapons knelt down. Even the commander who
first hurt the Japanese people dropped his sword onto the ground. The eyes
filled with courage were now completely broken.

「 We can't win. 」

「 What will our planet… 」

This form of despair was familiar, making it painful to see.

[The small planet's constellation has discovered you.]

Then a message was heard.

[The small planet's constellation is looking at you with pathetic eyes.]

[The small planet's constellation is expecting your compassion for a small
planet.]

[The small planet's constellation is looking hopefully at you.]
[A small planet's constellation has sponsored you 10

coins.] I frowned and looked up at the sky. [You have

returned the sponsored 10 coins.] Then the messages

continued.

[The small planet's constellation is embarrassed.]

[The small planet's constellation has turned red with shame.]

It was a misunderstanding. The constellation thought I wasn't moving
because 10 coins was too small. However, this idea was wrong.

I spoke in a small voice towards the air. 'If you are really thinking about
your planet then don't do that'.

[The small planet's constellation is embarrassed.]

'Don't make your planet a story to sell for money'.

[The small planet's constellation is silent.]

In the distance, the second Japanese attack was coming. It would surely
wipe out the remaining small people.

Shin Yoosung declared, "Ahjussi, I can't stand it anymore."

The black aura around the Japanese incarnation's body was gradually
becoming thinner. The probability buff was slowly being released.

It was time to act. I spoke to Shin Yoosung. "There is a way to clear the
scenario even if we don't become disasters."

"…Ahjussi?"
"However, it will be really hard and terrible."

Shin Yoosung's eyes shook.

"You might be tempted to give up. Do you still want to do it?"

In fact, I was going to do this from the beginning. I just waited to increase
the odds. No matter how pitiful the inhabitants of the planet, they were a
different species after all. The most important thing for me right now was
Shin Yoosung's life.

[The probability constraints of the disasters have been restored.]

The black auras around their two samurais returned to its original state.
Shin Yoosung nodded.

"I can do it."

I gave her a signal and ran forward.

[The Star Stream has noticed your anomalous behavior.]

[Warning. Be careful to avoid being hostile to other disasters.]

Maybe Shin Yoosung would soon regret her decision. It would soon
become clear what would happen to those who gave up 'convenience' in an
easy scenario.

However, sometimes a person had to give up convenience to defend their
beliefs.

[Blade of Faith is activated!]

Light exploded and a roar filled the plains.
      Chapter 122: Ep. 24 - Things that Can Be Changed, II


In short, the small people were 'human beings' but they weren't from Earth
like I was. There was a clear contradiction in opposing the human race of
another planet.

Therefore, my current actions were due to the enormous ethics of
'humanity' or 'justice'. If I opposed the small people here then I would miss
out on the achievement I needed for the ending.

This was the only reason I needed to stab Blade of Faith into the ground.

[The Star Stream has noticed your anomalous behavior.]

[Warning. Be careful to avoid being hostile to other disasters.]

[If the hostile acts are repeatedly accumulated…]

Dust flew up and the Japanese screamed as they lost their vision inside the
dust.
"Uwaaaaack! What's happening?"

"Cough cough!"

It was a blow filled with considerable power so the dust didn't sink easily.

[A small planet's constellation is touching his chest.]

I was troubled for a moment. If I killed them with my own hands, I would
be able to get a new scenario right away.

However, the penalty for it would be tremendous. I wanted to delay that
moment as much as possible. That's why, at least…

"Ahjussi, I'll do it this time." Shin Yoosung pulled out a dagger that she had
received from Yoo Sangah and stepped forward. "I will deal with both of
them."

"Can you do it?"

"It won't be a problem."

She was like Lee Gilyoung. I didn't know why kids were so proud these
days. Yoo Sangah would've stopped her but I wasn't Yoo Sangah.

I encouraged Shin Yoosung. "You shouldn't fight for a long time. Did you
hear the penalty message just now? You should handle them as quickly as
possible."

My options in this scenario would be wider if Shin Yoosung could deal
with both these people.

I had a lot to do in Peace Land. Among them, one of the most important
goals was to catch the 'snake' that Persephone mentioned. If I didn't get any
penalties in advance then I might be able to catch the snake earlier than
expected.
"What bastard did this?"

Shin Yoosung ran through the dust towards where the voice was heard. At
almost the same time, I hid myself using Recluse's Cloak. It would be
useless if they had high level detection skills but these guys didn't seem to
have it.

Sharp magic power emerged from Shin Yoosung's dagger and moved in a
half moon arc.

"Uwah!"

The Japanese people withdrew from the dust. The earlier move that created
the dust had been intentional. I missed a golden opportunity but there was a
way to defeat them without me fighting.

The Japanese people were surprised when the child appeared in the dust.

"What, this kid?"

The Japanese incarnations spoke to Shin Yoosung.

"Kid, why are you stopping us?"

"Don't you know what will happen if you do this?"

Unfortunately, it just sounded like a foreign language to Shin Yoosung who
didn't have the Interpreter skill.

"…What are you saying?"

Now the Japanese people noticed the situation.

"Are you perhaps from South Korea?"

"Ah, that's right! This time, the first Korean group entered…"
"Dammit, the first group will be huge…?"

Their complexions suddenly darkened.

"Kid, get lost. We don't have to fight each other."

"No fight! No fight! Good?"

"We need kill them. Small people go kill. Yes?"

The Japanese said they had no intention of fighting in poor English but Shin
Yoosung just shook her head. Her sharp dagger pointed at them and the
Japanese people shrugged.

"Get lost or die. It is one of these two options."

The Japanese started to slowly step back from Shin Yoosung.

"Damn… this doesn't make sense. There isn't a bounty scenario."

"My sponsor wants me to kill this little kid?"

"Aren't there two of us?"

"Did you forget the fighting power of our first group?"

"Uh…"

They were clever people.

Everywhere in the world, those selected for the sixth scenario were the
elites of their country. In Japan, the gap between the first group and those
who came afterwards was probably considerable. Similar emotions
emerged on the faces of the two Japanese.

「 …Should we run away? 」
On the other hand, strange delight spread among the small people as they
watched the confrontation between Shin Yoosung and the Japanese.

"Ah, ahh…"

"Why…?"

They were shocked. A small disaster was suddenly fighting against a bigger
disaster.

"Perhaps it is the small savior?"

"Yes, the prophecy was right!"

[A small planet's constellation is supporting the incarnation 'Shin
Yoosung'.]

[A small planet's constellation has sponsored 10 coins to the incarnation
'Shin Yoosung'.]

[The incarnation 'Shin Yoosung' has received the possibility of a new
scenario.]

I watched the scene while grasping the hilt of my sword. It was a bit
underhanded but it was a way to chase them if they ran away.

As I thought, things wouldn't go so smoothly. The intermediate dokkaebi
watched from the air and giggled.

[Japanese incarnations, you might think you are disadvantaged but are you
really?]

In any case, this damn dokkaebi. The Japanese people realized something
and muttered, "Ah, that's right! That reminds me, the first group…"

"Didn't Asuka become affected by a mutation? The Korean people would
be affected by the same thing. I'm telling you now…"
"There is no need to tell me. In any case, she is just a Korean child."

The eyes of the Japanese people changed after they made a decision. Both
of them stared at Shin Yoosung with killing intent.

"Yes, let's fight once."

"I don't like children…"

They let out unpleasant laughs. Shin Yoosung didn't understand the words
but she immediately grasped the situation. Their blades moved as the two
men slowly surrounded Shin Yoosung.

The killing intent around all three people rose while the two men moved
simultaneously.

Shin Yoosung had raised her agility to the maximum and avoided their
blades without much difficulty. However, the difference was narrow.

These men might not be the best elites of Japan but they were part of the
top incarnations. I saw their swordsmanship and was reminded of a
description in Ways of Survival.

They used only one sword instead of two and it wasn't the Large Rock
Style. This meant I didn't need to worry about them being Miyamoto
Musashi and Sasaki Kojiro, some of Japan's top swordsmen.

It wasn't bad for Shin Yoosung's debut.

"It will be hard for you to keep running Kid!"

Their aura became even sharper as their sponsors lent them power. The
blade that wanted to cut the legs aimed at the legs while the blade that
wanted to cut the arms aimed at the neck. It was natural to step back at the
attack.
However, Shin Yoosung's movements were caught by the swordsmen. No
matter how high Shin Yoosung's overall stats, the swordsmen's combat
skills were overwhelmingly superior. Shin Yoosung's collar was cut and a
small line formed on her arms.

I firmly held the hilt and prepared to move at any time. It was a pity that I
couldn't act properly as her sponsor.

"Die!"

The Japanese cried out in an exaggerated tone and aimed at other parts of
Shin Yoosung's body. This time Shin Yoosung didn't try to escape.

Shin Yoosung was weak in strength and lost her grip on her dagger. The
Japanese took this chance to dig through the gap.

However, Shin Yoosung didn't panic.

[The character 'Shin Yoosung' has used 'Advanced Diverse Communication
Lv. 3'.]

Rather, she turned back and settled on the back of the monster waiting for
her. It was a steel wolf.

"…What?"

It was the right judgment. The basis of fighting was to minimize the
opponent's advantage and maximize your advantages.

Awoooooo!

There were the cries of the wolves as dozens of steel wolves simultaneously
emerged from the forest. She had tamed so many wolves in such a short
time. She truly was the future 'Beast Lord'.

"Shit!"
The surprised men swung their swords at the wolves but the wolves were
already biting onto their arms and legs.

"Fuck! These bastards!"

They might be weakened 7th grade monsters but the two people would
have to consume a lot of magic power to deal with them.

It was truly a rewarding sight. However, Shin Yoosung was still unaware of
something. This was why I warned her not to waste time.

[The Star Stream has detected abnormal behaviour from the incarnation
'Shin Yoosung'.]

[Hostile acts against a disaster have been detected.]

[The incarnation 'Shin Yoosung' has been given a first scenario penalty.]

The penalty had finally begun.


"Uh…?"

Shin Yoosung groaned as she suddenly felt less magic power. Some wolves
suddenly left Shin Yoosung's control and returned to the forest.

[The character Shin Yoosung's body size has decreased.]

[The character Shin Yoosung's total stats has decreased.]

The Japanese also noticed it.

"T-That's it! I knew this would happen!"

"Just a little longer!"
…It ended up like this. Shin Yoosung glanced at me with anxious eyes. I
approached behind Shin Yoosung using Recluse's Cloak and touched her
shoulder.

Shin Yoosung's trembling subsided. "…Thank you ahjussi."

Shin Yoosung understood something and bit her lips.

[The incarnation 'Shin Yoosung' has been given a second scenario penalty.]

Shin Yoosung's body size was getting smaller. That's right, this was the
result of a disaster abandoning their authority. Still, she had enough power
remaining to take away the lives of the Japanese people.

Shin Yoosung put her high agility level to use and approached their backs
using the beast.

"A-Aaaagh!"

Did she learn from watching Yoo Sangah? Shin Yoosung stabbed her
dagger in a poisonous manner. Her dagger moved and a man's carotid artery
was cut.

"K-Kuoock, r-ridiculous…"

The man paled as blood gushed from him and he fell to the ground.

[The character 'Shin Yoosung' has defeated the 'disaster without a name'.]

[Major contributor: Shin Yoosung]

Shin Yoosung wiped the blood that splattered onto her cheek and moved to
the next target. The man was terrified and stepped back. The steel wolves
rushed in and bit his arms and legs.

"Kuaaack!"
Shin Yoosung approached to cut off the man's breathing. It all happened in
an instant.

[The incarnation 'Shin Yoosung' has been completely deprived of the rights
of a disaster.]

[The dokkaebi of the Star Stream sees Shin Yoosung's behavior as taking
action against the scenario.]

[The incarnation 'Shin Yoosung' has been given a third scenario penalty.]

[The small person transformation will begin.]

In this scenario, a person who gave up their qualification to be a predatory
species would become the prey. Shin Yoosung's body became smaller at an
incomparable rate.

"Ah…?"

There was a small groan as Shin Yoosung's clothes became too big and her
dagger fell to the ground. Shin Yoosung's height shrank from my waist, to
my knees and finally to my shins. Then Shin Yoosung's body was buried in
her clothes.

Her stats diminished and her control became weaker, causing the steel
wolves to return to the forest. A small Shin Yoosung emerged from her
clothes and lumped towards the man.

"Yoosung, you can stop."

Shin Yoosung gasped for breath. There was a mixture of poisonous anger
and grief in her eyes. There had been many fights with monsters but this
was probably the first time she committed a serious killing.

"He is already knocked out."
Shin Yoosung stared at the fallen Japanese man. He was lying on the floor
while foaming at the mouth. I tore away a bit of my clothes and covered
Shin Yoosung's body.

Shin Yoosung was as small as my fist and observed her body for a while.
She probably realized what had happened to her. "We have to fight them in
this state?"

"Yes."

"…How many are left?"

"A lot."

Shin Yoosung looked up at me with a complicated gaze. "Ahjussi, did you
know? About being turned into a small person if we are hostile to the
disasters."

I nodded and approached the fallen Japanese man. I checked and he was in
his early 20s at best. He was still breathing.

"Are you going to use this person?" Shin Yoosung asked me.

"There is a person I have to kill before I change."

New messages rose as soon as I said this.

[Be careful to avoid being hostile to other disasters.]

[Those who are hostile to disasters will lose the right to be a disaster.]

There was still a dokkaebi having fun in the sky. Yes… Laugh while you
can.

[The Star Stream thinks that your aren't performing your disaster duties
properly.]
[If you don't kill the rule of Peace Land in the next hour, you will be
deemed as unwilling to act as a disaster and will be deprived of the status of
a 'disaster'.]

I looked down at the Japanese man and slowly took off my cloak. There
was one hour remaining. In this one hour, I had to catch their 'king'.
      Chapter 123: Ep. 24 - Things that Can Be Changed, III


「 Suzuki walked through the forest and thought, 'I was really lucky'.」

Suzuki trembled as he recalled what happened. A girl who manipulated
monsters and wielded the dagger with great skill. Suzuki couldn't forget
how Murakami died with one blow.

'South Korea is scary. A child is already at that level'.

She was just a kid so Suzuki couldn't guess how skilled the man near him
was. The man was wearing a pure white coat and held a white sword. There
wasn't anything special about him apart from the colour of his coat but he
was a life saver to Suzuki. "Thank you very much. I would've died if you
hadn't been here."

"It was nothing."
"I was honestly impressed. I didn't expect to get help from a Korean

person." "It was natural to help." The man in the white coat was modest.


Above all, Suzuki liked that the man was good at Japanese. It was
obviously a skill but having the Japanese Interpreter skill was a sign that he
liked Japanese culture.

Suzuki asked, "Ah, I don't know your name yet. Can I get your name? I am
Suzuki Tatsuya."

"My name is Dokja. Kim Dokja."

"Kimu Dojega?"

"…Kim Dokja."

"Hoh." Kim Dojega. Wasn't it a good name? Suzuki liked this Korean
name.
"By the way, did you see the child? She killed my colleague…"

"Unfortunately, I missed her."

"Sigh… I see."

Suzuki didn't know if this was true or not. It couldn't be helped even if it
wasn't true. In any case, this person was South Korean. It wasn't strange for
him to hide the child or pretend he didn't see the child.

Still, it was disappointing. Suzuki would've been able to get revenge very
easily if he caught the child. As part of the third group from Japan, he
already knew about the 'small person transformation' hidden piece of the
sixth scenario.

He stated, "You saved me so you must've witnessed the small person
transformation."
"If you're talking about how she became smaller, I naturally saw it."

"Then the story will be quick. We are from different countries but we don't
have to fight each other in this scenario. Our enemies are the small people,
not humans."

"I know. That's why I saved Suzuki." Fortunately, the Korean man in front
of him seemed to agree. Kim Dojega said, "By the way, the Japanese side
knows many things."

"Yes. We progressed quickly through our scenario and there were similar
cases among the previous players."

"It was similar?"

"There were a few cases where a human turned into a small person."

"What happened to them?"

"Most of them are dead. Only one person is still alive."

Kim Dojega heard this and seemed to think of something. It was hard to
know what the Korean was thinking. The slightly nervous Suzuki opened
his mouth. "This is just a reminder but I don't hate South Korea."

"…What brought this on?"

"Don't Koreans think that Japan hates Korea?"

It was said by the prime minister, who was part of Japan's first group. Of
course, it was just a nickname and he wasn't the real prime minister.

–South Koreans have a strong nationalist sentiment. They will dislike
anyone who badmouths their country.

Suzuki disliked the prime minister but never received any damages from
listening to his words.
"Kim-san. I also like Kim Ahyeon and Park Sungji."

"…"

"Autumn Sonata is also very interesting. My mother liked it."

Always mention Kim Ahyeon, Park Sungji and Autumn Sonata when
meeting a Korean. This was the prime minister's advice.

"I love Japanese manga."

"A-Ah. It is like this." The prime minister was apparently right. Suzuki
asked excitedly, "What manga do you like?"

"It is hard for me to pick one. I don't know if I can keep reading now."

"…Certainly, it is a bit unfortunate. I waited for the manga every week but I
don't even know if the mangaka is alive."

It was bitter thinking of such things. Suzuki also liked these things. Manga
was one of them.

"It is because everything has changed." 」 –

Ahjussi.

Shin Yoosung's voice broke the immersion. I was in the process of using
Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint stage 2 so I couldn't answer Shin Yoosung
immediately.

[The exclusive skill, Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint stage 2 has ended.]

[Your understanding of the character 'Suzuki Tatsuya' has increased
dramatically.]

Immersing myself in the character made it easier to understand them. It was
smooth because he had a shallow personality. My focus wasn't high
because I was conscious but it wasn't hard to read what Suzuki was
thinking.

–Ahjussi?

–Sorry, I was busy practicing a skill.

The small Shin Yoosung was currently in my pocket. Shin Yoosung spoke
to me through a direct connection because of our sponsor contract.

…It was a bit surprising. I could tell what she was asking without thinking.

I watched Suzuki Tatsuya who was still telling his story. Suzuki appeared
as a passing character in Ways of Survival. The world was described from
his point of view for a smooth storytelling but he could only get a few
pages in Ways of Survival. Still, most ordinary lives could be summed up
in a few chapters.

–I don't understand. Such an ordinary person, how can he do such cruel
things…

Shin Yoosung couldn't understand because of the foreign language but she
caught the gist of the conversation. I couldn't help noticing her agitation.

"I mean, Kim-san…"

The talking Suzuki seemed like an ordinary university student. He was an
ordinary youth who took great joy in talking to others and could be found
anywhere in the world. I told her.

–I saw it a lot in South Korea. An ordinary person having to kill someone in
order to survive.

–At the time, it couldn't be helped because of the scenario.

–It is the same now. That person is doing it because of the scenario.
–It is just an excuse. He won't die even if he fails…!

–Don't think about it this way.

I asked her.

–If the dead small people were in our position right now, would the
situation be different?

–I don't think Suzuki is evil. However, I'm not saying he is good either.

–The original evil is ordinary. We are ordinary people but we seem like the
most terrible disaster.

–Then he isn't a bad person?

–No, every human is a disaster for each other.

I deliberately exaggerated things. If I didn't say this, Shin Yoosung might
not be able to escape from the guilt of killing a person. She asked, -Then
will I also become a disaster in the future?

–Don't worry. I'll stop it from happening.

There was something buzzing in my ears and insects were flying around
me. Suzuki was annoyed as he continued the story.

"The insects here are still the same size. Aren't they disasters to the small
people?"

"That's right."

There was no way. In this small world, insects couldn't be the same size as
Earth.

–Yoosung. Do you understand what they are saying?
The species that could be tamed by Shin Yoosung and Lee Gilyoung were
different but it was possible to understand the language of other species
through Diverse Communication. There was a reason why I placed Shin
Yoosung and Lee Gilyoung in different groups in the first place.

–Hyung… second team… met…

–Good. Then can you pass along my message?

I could feel Shin Yoosung nodding. The insects flying around soon
disappeared into the forest. Suzuki saw the distant insects and asked,
"Kimsan. Are you listening to me?"

"I'm listening. Weren't you talking about creatures from another world?" I
thought a person who could talk about manga even in this situation was
very rare. I struggled to accept it. "I heard that this genre is popular in
Japan."

"Haha, yes. Creatures from another world are my favourite. It is similar to
our situation now. However, it is hard to draw."

The story contents in Japan just before the fall of this world would've been
similar to South Korea.

Japan and South Korea's novel sections were full of stories about going
back to the past. However, the Japanese side was probably a bit worse. The
young Japanese people thought there was no hope when returning to the
past.

I wondered, "Isn't it fun when it is hard?"

"Huh?"

"This is what I like."

"You're having fun."
Suzuki cut through the low bushes and suddenly thought of something.
"That reminds me, we have a mangaka on our side. A person called Asuka
Ren…"

Asuka Ren?

"…That person said something similar to Kim-san. A story isn't fun if it is
too easy."

"About that person…"

"Oh, we have arrived."

A small empty clearing appeared in the heart of the forest. The anticipation
that could be felt everywhere tickled my skin. Perhaps this was the main
base of the Japanese early arrivals. By the way, something was strange.
[You have entered somebody's 'colony'.]

[Your physical condition meets the requirements of a 'colonist'.]

[The colony effect reduces your overall stats.]

Suzuki's expression towards me had changed. He asked, "You said it is
better to solve hard problems?"

Dozens of armed Japanese people popped out of the bushes.

"Good. Then I will make it that way."

I was a bit surprised by the unexpected betrayal. Was Suzuki originally this
type of person?

[The exclusive skill, Character List is activated.]
  [Character Summary]

  Name: Suzuki Tatsuya

  Exclusive Attributes: Double-Faced Person (Rare)

  Sponsor: Silent Sword


I see. This was his attribute. I was still lacking.

In any case, Ways of Survival was a novel that could be never ending. How
many people weren't summed up in a few pages?

By the way, the 'colony' effect was activated so it seemed the king of this
area wasn't the 'snake'. He knew I was Korean and deliberately drove me to
this side…

"You brought the Josenjing¹."

A samurai who emerged from the bushes said and Suzuki bowed his head.
The samurai asked, "You are from the third group. Are you part of the
prime minister's group?"

"No…"

"Then is this a tribute?"

"That's right."

"What is your name?"

"Suzuki Tatsuya."

"I see. Well done Suzuki. From now on, you are in our group."
Prime minister…

Things had become worse. As far as I knew, there was only one Japanese
incarnation who was called 'prime minister'. He was one of the enemies I
had to be most wary of, apart from the 'snake' I had to catch. It was because
his ability exerted a nearly absolute influence on Koreans.

The samurai stepped forward and spoke. He wasn't the prime minister. "The
slave of the great Japanese Empire has walked into the colony."

I grasped the handle of Unbroken Faith and declared. "If you attack me now
then the small person transformation will begin."

"We don't attack you. You will attack us."

"Why should I?"

"Otherwise, your colleagues will die."

What?

"Dokja-ssi… I'm sorry."

I looked towards the voice and saw four small people standing side by side.
To be precise, they were 'transformed into small people'.

Lee Hyunsung, Lee Gilyoung, Lee Jihye… Finally, the smiling №406
grandmother.

The samurai placed his sword against Lee Hyunsung's neck. "Do you
understand the situation now?"

I couldn't help laughing. Normally this would be a catastrophe, but I was
rather pleased. As expected, my companions had hurt the Japanese people
and became small people.
Shin Yoosung asked, –

Ahjussi, what should we do?

What else?

[Hunt the 'small people' in 10 minutes. Otherwise the Star Stream will
determine that you have no intention to carry out the activities of a
disaster…]

It was the wrong timing to catch the snake. Then… well, the new target
wasn't much different.

"Come on, Josenjing."

I looked up at the sky and sighed. Then the stars shone at me like they had
been waiting.

[All the constellations of the Korean Peninsula are looking at you.]

It couldn't be helped. If they expressed such aversion…

[Constellations of the Korean peninsula are angry at the atrocities of
Japan!]

[Some of the constellations who have lived in a certain time are waiting for
you to call.]

It was proper for me to punish the other party.



[1] Josenjing – a Japanese derogatory term referring to a Korean person.
      Chapter 124: Ep. 24 - Things that Can Be Changed, IV


[The Star Stream has noticed your anomalous behavior.]

I hadn't fought yet but my body was already showing subtle signs of
shrinking. If I received the penalty then I would be like my other
companions in a flash.

I deliberately approached them slowly and asked. "Why are you hostile to
Koreans?"

There was a fight against the Japanese in the original novel but it hadn't
started so early. Besides, I destroyed the Absolute Throne and South
Korea's entry into the scenario was slower. That's why this unfolded…

"Do you have to ask? You were hostile to us first."

"…Are you talking about nationalist sentiment? I don't have any
antiJapanese feelings."
"You Josenjings killed us first."

I looked at Lee Hyunsung and asked, "Really?"

"No! It is true that we fought to defend the small people but we didn't kill
the Japanese."

"You didn't?"

The samurai gritted his teeth. "I'm not talking about you. If you're going to
feign innocence then stop."

Weren't we the first ones to enter?

…Wait. Somehow I knew why the Japanese incarnations felt like this.

The samurai cried out, "Don't make a fuss…!"

Yes, this was it.

[The exclusive skill 'Bookmark' can now be activated.]

[The number four bookmark has been activated.]

[Way of the Wind Lv. 8 has been activated.]

A gust of wind blew my way. The Japanese screamed as they were pushed
back by the wind pressure and I rescued my party members in this short
gap.

"Everybody grab onto me."

Lee Hyunsung and Lee Jihye hung onto my shoulders while Lee Gilyoung
slipped into my pocket with Shin Yoosung.

"This is my spot!"
"You can go to the other pocket!"

As the children were fighting, I grabbed onto grandmother №406 with both
hands.

"Then I'm going."

I started running through the forest. There was no need to deal with all the
Japanese people here. If I killed anyone then my plan would be a failure.

[Hostile acts against a disaster have been detected.]

[You have been given a first scenario penalty.]

[Your body size has reduced.]

[Your total stats have decreased.]

Due to magnitude of the battle, the penalty already started. My body size
was reduced by approximately 5 cm. Fortunately, my coat was decreased
along with my body. As expected from the SSS-grade item, it changed
shape with the user. I wondered how small it could become.

"Catch him!"

I saw the Japanese people running behind me.

[Some constellations want to pay back the nation's humiliating history.]

[2,000 coins have been sponsored.]

The messages from the Korean constellations rang in my ears. In fact, it
wasn't strange for them to be angry. At first glance, some of the Japanese
had constellations that would provoke anger.

I asked Lee Jihye who was clinging to my shoulder. "Why did you get
captured already when your sponsor is Duke of Loyalty and Warfare?"
"…There isn't any water around here."

The Duke of Loyalty and Warfare was useless without water until he got
the Two Dragon Sword. Lee Hyunsung would've been penalized while
protecting the small children and Lee Gilyoung… he was currently having a
conversation with Shin Yoosung.

"You should cherish insects. Don't just kill them."

"…The small people aren't insects."

"They are as small as insects."

Yes, I knew what happened. Sometimes I was afraid that Lee Gilyoung
would become a psychopath.

"He is going in the prime minister's direction!"

"Contact the prime minister!"

Thanks to the penalty and the colony effect, the Japanese people were
catching up to me despite Way of the Wind. I told Lee Hyunsung and the
others.

"There is a person I have to catch before the snake hunt."

"You have to catch the prime minister?"

"He is someone who leads the Japanese fighters and the disasters will pause
for a bit after his death."

Once the small person transformation began, the gap with the disasters was
too big. If I didn't catch the prime minister now then he would be the
hardest to deal with later on.

Grandmother №406, who was sitting on my hand, asked me. "Young man,
am I heavy?"
"It is heavy."

The grandmother was heavy. It wasn't because of my body size had been
reduced.

"Do you understand? There is only one chance."

The grandmother laughed. "Yes, yes."

The core of this mission was the grandmother №406. It might be fortunate
that I found the prime minister, even if I missed the snake. The prime
minister was strong but as long as this grandmother existed, the prime
minister would surely be killed.

Then a man appeared from the bushes in front of me. "My sponsor is
clamouring… what is the fuss?"

The man wore a gold armband and looked like a yakuza. Needless to say,
he was the person I was looking for. He was 'Prime Minister' Yamamoto.

"…A Josenjing?" The prime minister was holding an iron cage with a
female small person trapped inside.

Lee Jihye screamed furiously. "This person…!"

The girl in the cage was probably 'Asuka Ren' of the first group. She was
the first person from Japan who refused to be a 'disaster'. Just like not all
Koreans were good people, not all Japanese were bad. Good and bad were
just determined by accident according to the circumstances.

The prime minister asked, "Hey, who are you?"

[The exclusive skill, Character List is activated.]
  [Character Summary]

  Name: Yamamoto Hajime

  Age: 64 years old

  Sponsor: Korean Empire Invader

  Exclusive Attributes: Colonialist (Hero), Lustful Person (Hero), Anti-
  Korean (Rare)

  Exclusive Skills: Hand to Hand Combat Lv. 7, Advanced Weapons
  Training Lv. 4, Japanese Kendo Lv. 8, Mental Focus Lv. 3, Crowd
 Command Lv.4…

 Stigma: Colonization Lv. 7, Spirit Concentration Lv. 5

 Overall Stats: Physique Lv. 60 (+10), Strength Lv. 60 (+10), Agility Lv.
 60 (+10), Magic Power Lv. 60 (+10).

 Overall Evaluation: This is Yamamoto Hajime, who leads one of the
 four major groups in Japan. He can use 'colonization' to exert a
 powerful influence on people from a particular nation. If you are
 Korean or Chinese, it is recommended not to confront this person.


"Why did the colonial slaves come here?"

Just as there were the three kings in South Korea, Japan had this person.
Every country had those who lost sense of what era this was.

[Yamamoto Hajime's synchronization has risen due to the scenario buff.]
Korean Empire Invader. The sponsor behind Yamato was Ito Hirobumi, the
first prime minister of Japan.

[The effect of 'Colonization' has made your movements dull.]

[The effect of 'Colonization' weakens your mind.]

Yamamoto's stigma Colonization gave a powerful debuff to people who
had experienced domination by Japan in history. The mental debuff was
offset by Fourth Wall but the constraints on my movements were quite
large.

I tried to resist capture as I said, "Don't try to pretend to be a great person."

"Trivial person…!"

Perhaps the Korean Empire Invader was trying to accumulate stories in this
scenario. However, it wouldn't work.

[The constellation who longs for the independence of his nation is looking
at you.]

[The great independence fighter promises to kill him if you give the
constellation three bullets.]

I ran straight towards Yamamoto. I put away Unbroken Faith and pulled out
Ganpyeongui.

"Kill him!"

The clever Yamamoto used his men as a meat shield. It was an act that he
did because he knew I would become a small person the moment I killed
one person.

Killing Yamamoto himself wasn't a problem. The problem was that after I
killed, the damage I would receive wasn't just the small person
transformation.
If I killed someone then I would lose the effect of King of No Killing. Of
course, I would give up the King of No Killing in this scenario.

However, not right now. I couldn't afford to kill the prime minister. Thus, I
wouldn't be the one fighting here.

[Ganpyeongui's special option 'Echo of the Stars' has been activated.]

['Echo of the Stars' allows you to ask for the help of a constellation.]

[The constellation can refuse your request and the number of times
Ganpyeongui can be used is reduced when the constellation responds to the
request.]

I turned the Earth Disc and the constellations on the Sky Disc flashed
brightly.

[The great constellations hear your voice flowing through the stars.]

I didn't hesitate to call one constellation. "I want the Nation's Independence
Activist."

In the long history of invasions on the Korean peninsula, there were a
myriad of people who received the title of independence activist. Among
them, there was only one person with the modifier of Nation's
Independence Activist.

It was because all the other constellations of the Korean Peninsula gave her
this modifier.

[The constellation 'Nation's Independence Activist' has responded to your
call.]

A calm and clear energy penetrated my mind and the constellation's image
surfaced. She wore black mourning clothes and a white skirt. A girl who
was too young to climb to the throne of a constellation.
I opened my mouth but the constellation shook her head. It was as if there
was no need to say thank you. I nodded. If Japan had Ito then South Korea
had this constellation.

"What? Who is his sponsor?"

The confused Japanese incarnations yelled. However, there were no signs
of abnormalities from me and the Japanese regained their spirit.

[The stigma 'Declaration of Independence Lv. 1' has countered the effect of
Colonization.]

They were unaware that my strike had already begun.

[The stigma 'Non-Violent Zone' blocks the movement of you and people
from certain countries…]

Suddenly, all the Japanese people in the vicinity froze.

"My body…?"

If Colonization was a stigma exclusively for Koreans, Non-Violent Zone
was a stigma exclusively for the Japanese. Once this stigma was used, all
Japanese people in the area would be unable to move one step. It would last
for one minute.

"Move! Move now!"

Among the confused Japanese people, only Yamamoto laughed amusedly.
He was also trapped by my stigma. "The power of this constellation… how
interesting. My sponsor is going crazy."

"…"

"However, you also can't move. How will you kill me?"

I smiled. "I'm not going to kill you."
It was natural. The person who would kill Yamamoto had been decided
from the beginning.

"Grandmother, now!"

The person sitting on my left hand, prisoner №406 moved. Like magic, the
grandmother's body started to grow rapidly.

"W-What is that?"

In fact, the grandmother had never been affected by the small person
transformation. It was because she was a 'small person' from the beginning.
It was thanks to the magic that a sponsor of my mother's subordinate, Jeon
Woochi, placed on her.

"Don't panic! She is just a grandmother!"

The Japanese staggered due to the binding force as they tried to stop the
grandmother. The grandmother just approached them with a smile.

[The character 'Lee Boksoon' has activated the skill 'Elderly Person Lv. 7'.]
[Characters younger than 'Lee Boksoon' will feel respect for her.]

"Shit, what is this?"

The Japanese people retreated like they were conceding seats on the
subway. Of course, it wasn't intentional.

"Huhu, thanks for letting me pass. In fact, there is no need to make
concessions."

[The character 'Lee Boksoon' has activated the skill 'Old Strength Lv. 6'.]

"This grandmother is strong."

The Japanese people pushed by the grandmother screamed and fell down.
Their arms were swollen like they would burst. Her appearance had
transformed into a muscular body. Lee Hyunsung gaped over the wonderful
muscles.

"…B-Block! Block her!" Prime Minister Yamamoto realized something
was wrong and screamed.

I opened my mouth. "Grandmother, do it quickly."

Lee Boksoon nodded. It might be a favourable situation but she would
become a small person if she killed even one person. The important thing
was killing the target before becoming a small person. The energy of Lee
Boksoon's sponsor emerged.

[The constellation 'Nation's Independence Activist' and 'Harbin Sniper' has
created an ensemble effect.]

[The Harbin Sniper will gain a 100% hit rate.]

[The Harbin Sniper's bullet damage will increase by 150%.]

Now Lee Boksoon looked more like a fighter than an old person. A fighter
who dedicated his life for only one purpose.

"How long have you been sitting in the elderly seats? This isn't the Korean
Empire. I tried to get along with the young people but they should know
when to move out of the way."

[The character 'Lee Boksoon' has activated the skill 'Three Shots Lv. 1'.]

Lee Boksoon made a gun shape by stretching out her index finger and
thumb to a 90 degree angle. Magic power formed at the tip of her index
finger.
Most incarnations were hardly ever damaged by magic power bullets.
Except for one person.

The prime minister was shocked. "T-That ability? Your sponsor is…!"
「 Stage Transformation. 」

The phenomenon that occurred when constellations related to each other
met was activated.

The surrounding scenery distorted and I seemed to hear the engine of a
steam locomotive. It became an old train platform. It was my first time
seeing it but I knew where this place was.

The year 1909, Harbin, China.

"Aaaaah…!" It was the place where Ito Hirobumi had died. "N-No!
Dammit! Stop her!"

Yamamoto shouted with fright. For Stage Transformation to occur, the
synchronization with the constellation had to be absolute.

[Specialized damage of 'Three Shots' is applied due to the influence of
Stage Transformation.]

[The bullets' damage will increase by 2000%.]

The bullets made to kill only one person burned at Lee Boksoon's fingertip.

[The constellation Korean Empire Invader is requesting help from the other
constellations of Japan!]

[The constellation Korean Empire Invader is screaming and staring at
incarnation 'Lee Boksoon'.]

Prisoner number 406, Lee Boksoon. The sponsor behind her was the one
who assassinated Ito Hirobumi, the righteous An Junggeun.

"Farewell, Japanese lord."

The three shots fired and Yamamoto stared blankly at his chest as he fell
backwards.
      Chapter 125: Ep. 24 - Things that Can Be Changed, V


Yamamoto was killed with only three bullets. White smoke emerged from
Lee Boksoon's fingertips like she was a Western cowboy. She was a really
tough grandmother.

[A famous disaster has been killed.]

[The disaster called 'Сolonialist' has disappeared.]

[You have earned 5,000 coins.]

[Major contributor: Lee Boksoon, Kim Dokja.]

It was regrettable that I didn't catch the snake but hunting the prime
minister wasn't a bad income. The absence of the prime minister in the
upcoming war would greatly undermine the advance of the Japanese army.
The compensation was also great.
[Some constellations are against your excessive nationalistic sentiment.]
There were many constellations complaining about my scenario but it
couldn't be helped. Nationalism on the Korean Peninsula gave coins. If I
had to sell a story then it was better to sell it at an expensive price.

[Many constellations of the Korean Peninsula are cheering for your
reenactment.]

[10,000 coins have been sponsored.]

Indeed, there were constellations who haven't forgotten the old days. The
confused Japanese incarnations ran towards Yamamoto but it was already
too late…

"P-Prime minister!"

In the meantime, I ran towards Lee Boksoon who was a dozen meters away.
Lee Boksoon's body was rapidly shrinking.

[The character 'Lee Boksoon' has completely abandoned her rights as a
disaster.]

[The dokkaebi of the Star Stream sees Lee Boksoon's behavior as taking
action against the scenario.]

[The small person transformation will begin.]

Lee Boksoon had a tired expression but it seemed to be the aftereffect of
using Three Shots. The stigmas of certain constellations could cause severe
physical and mental damage to the person who used it. Thus, she was
completely exhausted the moment she used the stigma.

"Young man, give me a lift."

"Put on the clothes in my pocket first."
There were a few pieces of clothing I got in return for saving the small
people earlier. I put the grandmother in the left pocket of my coat and Lee
Jihye helped her dress.

[Way of the Wind Lv. 8 has been activated.]

The remaining time for Bookmark was 10 minutes. Now I had to get out of
the forest area in 10 minutes.

"The prime minister is dead!"

"Stop them!"

The Japanese people were angry.

[You have received the second scenario penalty.]

[Hunt the 'small people' in 5 minutes. Otherwise the Star Stream will
determine that you have no intention to carry out the activities of a
disaster…]

Damn. It was 5 minutes rather than 10 minutes. The time was too short.

"Take me with you!"

The Japanese woman inside the cage that Yamamoto had dropped when he
died shouted.

"Please! Please!"

…Asuka Ren. I felt no hesitation. I intended to bring her with me in the
first place. I jumped forward like a gust of wind and placed her in my hand
after smashing her cage.

"Thank you! Really…"
I skipped the greetings and tensed the muscles of both legs. "Hold on
tightly."

I used all of my magic power. The wind split apart and the fastest 'road'
appeared. The wind force around my legs captured the precise movements
of my muscles and created the optimum speed.

Colonization had disappeared and it was easier to run than before.
However, my stats were halved and the speed wasn't satisfactory. However,
I could actually reach this speed with a level 30 agility. Way of the Wind
was a truly great skill.

Asuka Ren told me, "You are really fast. This speed is as good as Karasu
from Japan."

"I'll be faster if I have more power."

"Do you know Karasu?"

"It is a classic monster from Japan."

I should be faster than Karasu-tengu with Way of the Wind but now wasn't
the time. Besides, I couldn't say that Way of the Wind was my skill.
Bookmark had a time limitation.

"Kill him! In any case, we will just become smaller!"

"We will take care of the smaller ones so kill him!"

The Japanese didn't hesitate anymore.

"Get revenge for the prime minister!"

A few swords narrowly missed my shoulder. It was dangerous but then the
terrain in front of me started to change. The surrounding trees wriggled and
took the shape of a forest path. The shape of the forest was changing.
I thought it was magic but Asuka Ren told me. "It is night. Look out!"

I belatedly recalled a mention of it in Ways of Survival. The forest area of
Peace Land changed shape at night.

It was a type of labyrinth as the forest itself turned into the stomach of a
giant monster. Sticky digestive juices emerged wherever I walked. The
reason why the small people of Peace Land didn't enter this forest was
because none of them returned when it was night.

"Catch him!"

"Aaaaack!"

The forest transformation had begun and the Japanese people chasing me
seemed lost. Of course, the big disasters couldn't be digested by the forest
but there was enough time.

[Hunt the 'small people' in 3 minutes.]

I did my best but the maze-like forest area paralyzed my sense of direction.
There was no specific way to escape from the night forest in Ways of
Survival. Instead…

"This way!"

It was written in Ways of Survival:

「 The first person to be obtained in Peace Land is Asuka Ren. 」

I followed Asuka Ren's directions.

"Run to the right at that tree!"

"Japanese lady, do you know the way?"
Lee Boksoon asked in fluent Japanese and Asuka Ren replied hesitantly. "I
know this forest well."

"Huhu, is it a relevant skill?"

"…Yes."

I knew that Asuka Ren was lying. She couldn't navigate this forest because
of a path finding skill. Perhaps as far as Peace Land was concerned, she
was as much an expert in it as I was in Ways of Survival. Maybe this was
why the Japanese saved her.

I carried Asuka Ren and used Way of the Wind at its highest level. I
ran quickly but the time limit was faster. [Hunt the 'small people' in 1
minute.] A bit more, just a bit more.

"Catch him!"

"We must catch him!"

The number of Japanese people chasing me decreased sharply as the road
twisted several times.

"Almost there!"

Finally, I reached the end of the forest zone.

[You were unable to hunt the small people within the time limit.]

[The dokkaebis of the Star Stream have determined you won't carry out the
activities of a disaster.]

[You have been given a third scenario penalty.]

[The small person transformation will begin.]
Damn.

"Get away from me!"

My party members noticed something at my shout and removed themselves
from my body. It was like my body was being spun in a juicer. The power
left my body and there was the sound of thunder in my ears.

I blinked again and my line of sight was almost at the ground. This was
how a small person felt. Fortunately, the coat shrank with my body. I didn't
lose any items because I placed all of them in the subspace, including
Unbroken
Faith. The problem was when I took them out again…

"Ahjussi, are you okay?"

I nodded towards my party members and spoke to Asuka Ren, who was
watching me from a distance. "Asuka Ren-ssi."

"…Did I introduce myself?"

"The other Japanese people told me your name. I would like to ask you to
take my party members to Veronica Castle."

Asuka's eyes grew bigger at my words. She wondered how I knew the name
of a place in Peace Land.

"There is no time to explain. Please. I will stop them here."

"I understand."

There was the sound of the Japanese people breathing in the distance. Three
of them managed to chase me to the end. They varied in height but all of a
sudden, they looked like monsters.

"Damn Josenjing!"
If there was one person then the party members might somehow be able to
beat them after joining forces. But three of them…

There was no certainty that we could beat them, even if we use all our
powers. Lee Hyunsung said, "We can't leave you alone."

"You have to go so that all of you can live. I have a way to escape if I am
alone."

The Japanese people who had struggled through the labyrinth forest spat on
the ground and smiled cruelly at us.

"I'll trample on them like bugs."

I watched them approach and shouted, "Gilyoung!"

Lee Gilyoung nodded with understanding. Small insects were flying
towards this side.

"I will see all of you later."

The insects started carrying the group members on their backs in ones or
twos. Based on the speed of the insects, quite some distance could be
gained while I buy time.

"Wait a minute! Ahjussi!" Shin Yoosung cried out as a samurai blade flew
towards me.

The blade stabbed into the ground next to me. There was a wave of magic
power and I reflexively rolled my body. It wouldn't be a big deal when I
was a human but now even the edge of the blade was dangerous for me.
Maybe I would be simply cut into two.

"Die!"
I had a plan to catch the prime minister with Lee Boksoon but now I had no
specific measures. I could somehow buy time by running into the labyrinth
forest again or…

"I will kill him. Chase after the rest!"

Two of the three Japanese people nodded and chased after the people on the
insects. I couldn't let that happen

[The stigma Non-Violent Zone Lv.1 has been used!]

The Japanese people stopped.

"Damn, again…!"

The stuck Japanese people looked back at me with irritation.

My magic power had been significantly reduced as a result of the small
person transformation and it took a considerable amount of magic power
juts to block the three of them. My head hurt and blood flowed from my
nose. [The constellation 'Nation's Independence Activist' has blessed you.]

Along with the message, the magic power required to use the stigma
decreased and my body became comfortable. I heard the voice of a
constellation in my head.

[Child, this is the only time I will respond to a call.]

"Thank you, Martyr."

[History is recorded in order to not repeat mistakes. Make sure you don't
repeat the past for the sake of individual success.]

The constellation seemed to notice that I used her for excessive directing. I
used Non-Violent Zone for violence and the constellation became angry. I
barely managed to nod and looked around nervously.
[Non-Violent Zone has 30 seconds left.]

Once Non-Violent Zone ended, I had to run to the forest area with all my
power.

The swords were filled with a tremendous magic power and were
determined to cut me in two. I might not die here but I would be seriously
wounded if I made a mistake.

15 seconds, 14 seconds, 13 seconds…

Then a questionable message was heard.

[The constellation 'Defense Master' commiserates with your plight.]

…Huh? The moment I heard the name of a familiar constellation, there was
a strange sound and explosive gunfire was heard.

[The character 'Gong Pildu' has activated 'Armed Fortress Lv. 1!]

Dududududu!
      Chapter 126: Ep. 24 - Things that Can Be Changed, VI


I was a bit surprised to see it. It was Armed Fortress, not Armed Zone.
Gong Pildu's stigma had passed level 10 and entered the next step.

[You have invaded private property!]

It was a surprise. This message was welcome in a moment like this.

"Ack! It hurts! What is this?"

The Japanese screamed painfully as the hundreds of turrets fired at the
same time. One hit wasn't a big blow but it was disastrous once hundreds of
bullets poured out. The damage was even greater because their movements
were restrained.

Dududududu!

Blood flowed from their bodies as the Japanese were hit by the bullets.
"Eyes! My eyes!"

"What? What is this?"

The shells flew without stopping. The Japanese screamed and sat down as
they were hit.

"Full advance!"

The army of small people hiding at the entrance of the forest joined in.
Originally, it would've been hopeless but the situation changed due to the
current state of the Japanese people. Small blades dug into the holes made
by bullets and the Japanese screamed in succession. Then I heard a
dignified voice. "Don't invade private property. This is my land."

As expected from the Armed Fortress Master. He lay down private property
even when coming to this world.

The wounded Japanese got up and shouted, "R-Retreat! Let's go back!"

It was great. Gong Pildu's turrets were strong enough to make three
disasters retreat despite their small size.

I turned around and saw a small fortress rising from the ground. It was hard
to call it a proper fortress but I could see why he was called Armed Fortress
Master.

"Waaaaahhhhh!"

"We won! We defeated the disasters!"

The jubilant small people gathered around and shouted for victory. There
were two people standing on top of the fortress. One of them was Gong
Pildu. The other one…

"Why is this your land? This isn't a place where private property is
recognized."
"A little girl doesn't know what she is talking about…"

"Hrmm, shouldn't you show more courtesy to this goddess?"

…This voice? The small people shouted again. "Goddess-nim, hooray!
Hooray!"

…Goddess? The woman at the top of the fortress discovered me and
jumped down. Her short dress blew in the breeze and the sound of a light
landing was heard. She had a distinctive prideful look. She really hadn't
changed.

The small people parted in front of her like the waves before Moses. I
smiled and opened my mouth, "Haven't you become very successful?"

Han Sooyoung approached and raised my chin with her fingers. "It's been a
while, Kim Dokja. You are still ugly."

I once again met Han Sooyoung, the goddess of Peace Land.




We headed to the castle and I heard about the things that happened to Han
Sooyoung. "I was walking down the street when I was hit by a bus full of
survivors."

"Then?"

"I woke up here."

"Does that make sense? What about Gong Pildu?"

"I fell into Han River and was here when I opened my eyes."

I felt disbelief. "What is this fantasy novel?"
"Have you forgotten where we are now?"

This was the conversation.

In fact, it seemed absurd but something similar had happened in Ways of
Survival. There were quite a few returnees who travelled to another world
after falling into Han River or being hit by a bus. Still, to experience such a
thing during a scenario…

What the hell were those dokkaebi jerks doing? I asked, "Then why are you
the goddess? Did you ask them to call you that?"

Han Sooyoung shook her head and grumbled. "Tsk, treating me like this for
saving you."

"What? Tell me."

"Have you forgotten who I am?"

"Eh?"

"Has your brain decreased due to your smaller head?"

Come to think of it, this was a stupid question. Han Sooyoung was the only
prophet remaining in Seoul Dome.

Moreover, one day on Earth was three days on Peace Land. We had been
separated for a week so the time Han Sooyoung spent in Peace Land was
around three weeks.

She knew the future and was given three weeks. It wasn't strange for Han
Sooyoung to become the goddess of another world… no, it was still a bit
strange. Why was she a goddess instead of a queen?

"You two know each other very well." I looked back and saw Gong Pildu
watching us with a disgruntled expression.
I hesitated for a moment before opening my mouth. I didn't want to but
there was something I should say. "Gong Pildu."

"What?"

"I'm sorry."

"What are you talking about?"

"I'm sorry for not taking care of you."

"…Who asked you to take care of me?"

"I'm really sorry. Thank you for saving me."

I really was apologetic this time so I spoke in honorifics. Frankly, I had
been too busy in the fifth scenario to care about Gong Pildu. This time he
saved me when my life was in danger. It was too embarrassing to call
myself a patron of the Defense Master.

[The constellation 'Defense Master' scoffs at your apology.]

"Tsk." They seemed to suit each other well.

[You have sponsored the Defense Master 5,000 coins.]

[The constellation 'Defense Master' reluctantly nods.]

Gong Pildu glared at me for a moment before turning away. "Then do well
next time."

It was funny to see a person so full of pride. In any case, I was glad that
both of them were alive, even if they had become small people. Eh? Wait.
Why were they small…?
I glanced at the two people for a moment. I wondered, why had they chosen
to stop being disasters? Both of them weren't the type of people who would
do this?

"I am here to say thank you."

I looked back and saw that Lee Hyunsung and the others were approaching.
They had been riding the insects towards Veronica when they countered
Gong Pildu's group passing by.

"No need. I just did what I had to do." Han Sooyoung smiled slightly and
waved her hands. I now knew what it was like when a devil wore a mask.

Lee Jihye watched Han Sooyoung and opened her mouth. "By the way…
who are you?"

That reminded me, this was the first time that people saw Han Sooyoung's
actual appearance, not her avatar. In other words, the party members had no
idea that she was the First Apostle.

Han Sooyoung glanced at me and I answered on her behalf.

"Uh, that…"

Lee Jihye surely wouldn't stay still if she found out this was the First
Apostle. Lee Jihye was the one who suffered the most damage when the
apostles attacked Chungmuro.

The party would be turned upside down if Han Sooyoung's identity was
revealed and a blood feud might occur. Eventually, I decided to close my
eyes and betray my conscience.

"She is just a friend I know."

I didn't know if I could use the word 'friend'. Well, it didn't matter. I had no
friends anyway. I couldn't see Han Sooyoung's face.
"I'm sorry but… can I ask you one thing?" The one who broke the awkward
atmosphere was Asuka Ren, the Japanese person I rescued from the cage.

Han Sooyoung looked between me and the Japanese person. Lee Jihye was
the same. "…Then who is this Japanese person? Is this person also a
friend?" It was a somewhat sarcastic tone. Damn brat.

"Asuka Ren… she is an incarnation from Japan. She isn't a friend but a
trapped prisoner I saved."

"Why did she need to be saved? She is Japanese."

"This fight isn't Japan vs. South Korea. It is the small people against the
disasters.

Lee Jihye seemed dissatisfied but she was convinced.

Han Sooyoung whispered to me. "What is this? Was this person in the
original novel?"

"You don't know?"

She probably read up to the fourth regression but she didn't know Asuka
Ren? Oh, was Asuka Ren not active then? Asuka Ren glanced between Han
Sooyoung and I with nervous eyes before opening her mouth again.
"Excuse me, the question…"

"Ah, say it."

"How did you already get the Peace Land approval?"

That's right. Certainly, it was natural for Asuka Ren to be curious. Han
Sooyoung wondered, "Kim Dokja, what is she saying?"

"She is asking how you became the goddess."
"Ah, that?"

The others belatedly understood the question and stared curiously at Han
Sooyoung. I also wondered what the hell happened. No matter how fast she
grew, it was completely different from becoming stronger in three weeks
and becoming the goddess of a kingdom.

"I told you. The first place where we fell was the north. Ahjussi and I fell in
the middle of an attack on Veronica."

"It was during a raid?"

"Some of the first Japanese group were attacking Veronica."

"So?"

"Ah, one of the Japanese brats looked at us and said something. I was
annoyed and killed him."

I was speechless for a moment. I roughly knew how things had gone. The
Veronica Kingdom was going to perish because of the disaster. Then two
people suddenly fell and killed the disasters. From the viewpoint of the
small people, Han Sooyoung and Gong Pildu probably seemed like gods.

"Well… I wouldn't have killed him if I knew I would become a small
person."

"You didn't read this scenario?"

"I was walking along the street when I was suddenly transported
somewhere. How could I know this was the sixth scenario area?"

…That's why the Japanese saw us and attacked. These two people were one
of the causes.

"Because of you, we…"
"Ah, I can see it."

Beyond the plains, the castle of this abandoned world could be seen. We
looked at the palace. It was a broken palace. The traces of the disaster could
been seen from the ruined castle walls. The people were crying in the
ruined kingdom.

"Goddess-nim!"

"The goddess is back…!"

The small people who became nothing in front of an overwhelming
disaster. A scruffy looking crowd came out to greet us.

Han Sooyoung showed a bitter smile. "…It is already over. Fucking Peace
Land."

I listened to her words and realized again. I've been lucky until now but that
would end in the next battle. The struggle with the disasters had just begun
and we had to continue fighting a losing battle.

I stared at the people who were coming. The people of this world resembled
the old Earth. There were no sword masters, no 9th circle monsters and
even the use of a 'system' was limited. The people of the so-called 'authentic
fantasy' couldn't stop the invaders, no matter how hard they tried. And I
knew whose 'work' this world belonged to.

"Asuka Ren."

The beautiful woman flinched and looked at me. She was the key to
winning this scenario. I was the one who has read Ways of Survival, but
Asuka Ren still knew this world better than me.

"Join the South Korean group. We need your help."
          Chapter 127: Ep. 25 - Those Who Face a God, I


My party arrived at Veronica and rested for one day. The next morning, I
got up first and stood at the entrance of the castle as I informed the party of
my plans. Lee Hyunsung asked, "Surely you're not going alone?"

"I won't be alone. I'm going with those two." I pointed to Han Sooyoung
and Asuka Ren.

Then Lee Jihye wondered, "What are we going to do while ahjussi is
gone?"

"You and Hyunsung-ssi are in charge of guarding Veronica's walls. Have
you checked the updated scenario?"

"…Is it to defend Veronica Castle until the end of the scenario period?"

"Yes. That is your mission."

"But…"
"Do it."

"…I understand."

I looked at Lee Hyunsung. "There is Gong Pildu but it will be hard to stop
the disasters with Armed Fortress alone. I'm sorry to leave it to you but…"

"Don't worry. Protecting a base is my specialty."

I was relieved by his determined words but I knew it wouldn't be that easy.
It might seem like an easy task but surviving this scenario was harder than
going with me.

"If you see the 'snake' of the first group, don't confront him head on. Flee
Veronica Castle if you have to. Can you promise me this?"

"I promise."

Their mission was to protect the castle until I returned. I gave orders to Lee
Gilyoung and Shin Yoosung. "Secure as many insects and monsters as
possible. Your mission is to buy time."

Lee Gilyoung and Shin Yoosung nodded.

"If you go to the north forest then there will be many unique monsters of
this world. Go and tame those monsters."

"Yes, hyung."

"I understand, ahjussi."

A large number of monsters would help bridge the gap with the disasters. In
the process, the children's skills would also increase significantly. I left
Veronica Castle. Han Sooyoung saw the people watching us from behind
and asked, "So where are we going?"

"The eastern rocky zone."
The startled Asuka Ren told me. "The Japanese has already occupied that
area."

"I know."

I stared straight at Asuka Ren. She had soft and curly silver hair. She had a
clear face with sharp lines, like a cartoonist had painstakingly drawn it. It
was a face that gave off the feeling of a warrior rather than just a beauty.

I told her, "That's why I brought you."

"Do you trust me?"

"I don't trust you. I just want to get back the value of saving your life."

"…I see."

It was easier to say this than to buy her favour with kindness. In fact, Asuka
Ren looked worried about something. Perhaps when her troubles were over,
she would tell me the information in earnest.

We travelled over the plains area towards an area filled with rock
formations. The trip was estimated to take two days but we could do it
within one day if we moved fast.

Han Sooyoung asked, "What is the plan?"

"Unlike us, Japan has an Absolute Throne. In other words, there is an
'absolute king' among the first group who commands all of them." Han
Sooyoung pondered on my words. "…Do you mean to catch the king?"
Han Sooyoung was really quick to understand. I nodded.

Han Sooyoung muttered, "Well, your idea is correct. There would be a
profound effect on the entire group if the master of the Absolute Throne
dies…"
"Of course, killing the king won't stop all of them. Still, it will allow us to
hold on until the end of the scenario."

"Hrmm, then you've been aiming for the boss since the beginning? I like
your ambition."

Then Asuka Ren interrupted. "Do you know who the king of Japan is
now?"

"Isn't he the Sovereign of Eight Heads?"

The Sovereign of Eight Heads. It was also referred to as a 'snake'.

"H-How do you…?"

Asuka Ren was astonished and her body shook. It was natural. She was part
of the first group and knew that type of existence the Sovereign of Eight
Heads was.

For reference, the Sovereign of Eight Heads wasn't the nickname for the
Japanese king but the modifier of his sponsor. The king didn't have a
nickname because there was no meaning in one.

"You must've heard his modifier somewhere but he isn't as easy as you
think…"

"I'm aware of that. He is Yamata no Orochi."

The sky darkened at my words and there was a rumbling sound. Perhaps
that guy had heard me speaking. It was a powerful force belonging to the
constellations.

"…Orochi? Isn't that the name of a mythical monster in Japan?"

"That's right. Now he is Japan's king."
"Then why is he called by his sponsor's name? Doesn't he have a
nickname?"

"It is meaningless. That incarnation isn't sane anymore. During the six
scenarios, he made a ridiculous contract with the Sovereign of Eight Heads
and had his soul stolen."

Asuka Ren's mouth gaped open when she heard my words. She was
surprised that the incarnation of another country knew more about the
circumstances then she did.

"Then he will be in the rocky zone?"

"Yes. However, we can't catch him right now. Preparations are necessary.
We are going to meet someone else in the rocky zone."

"Meeting someone? Is it… Yoo Joonghyuk?"

"He is better than Yoo Joonghyuk?"

"…Is there a person better than him?"

"It is possible."

"Who?"

"A strong person from Peace Land."

Han Sooyoung frowned. "From Peace Land? Are you joking right now?"

It was understandable. This information didn't appear in the first 100
chapters.

"Don't you know how weak the kids here are?" Han Sooyoung exclaimed
without giving me a chance to answer. She always looked particularly
agitated when she became angry.
"There isn't a third rate swordsman here, let alone a sword master! The
only magic these kids can use is to create fire on a stove." I know.

"This isn't a first generation fantasy novel… It is like someone has
maliciously gathered only weak people. No, I don't understand it. Why did
the dokkaebis make this world a stage? Is this an alternative idea to give
coins?"

I could understand why Han Sooyoung was so upset. This girl might be a
plagiarist but she was a popular fantasy writer.

"Relax. This world wasn't made by the dokkaebis."

"What?"

I looked behind me. There was a woman looking down with a flushed face.
It felt like a very new writer standing in front of an experienced writer.

Asuka hesitated for a moment before bowing. "I'm sorry."

Han Sooyoung seemed to realize something.

"Wait, don't tell me?"

Asuka Ren slowly nodded. "…Peace Land is a world I created."




Perhaps Asuka Ren shouldn't have revealed this.

At first, Han Sooyoung was so astonished she couldn't believe it was real.
Then after five minutes, she murmured, "Well, my novel became a reality."
Then another five minutes passed and she started scolding Asuka Ren.

"Why did you do that?"
"…"

"Huh? Why? Answer me, writer. Why did you make a world like this?"

Asuka Ren ended up half crying. "That… there are many mainstream
worlds in Japan. So…"

"Ah, you created this to resist the mainstream worlds?"

"I-I thought that as a writer, I shouldn't bring out a mass production story."
"Mass production?" Maybe she said something she shouldn't have. Han
Sooyoung declared, "Your work can't even be mass produced."

"…Huh?"

Han Sooyoung stared at Asuka Ren like she was pathetic and then told me.
"Hey, Kim Dokja. Is this it? I stayed a few days in Veronica and in this
world, the earl speaks ill of the duke. Besides, the knights are all like
parasites and only know how to dither…"

Asuka Ren protested, "W-Wait a minute!"

"Shut up. We are suffering now because of you."

"I made it but I wasn't the one who called you here."

"Look at this girl? The dokkaebis bought it from you and made your world
into reality! The manga must've been ruined! Let's throw all the ruined
mangas into a world and kill them! You must've prayed with this thought
and received a message like 'I will listen to your wishes'. Right?"

It was the first time I had heard such creative reasoning. She truly was a
writer.

"N-No! That isn't possible!"

"Then what is it?"
I became curious when I heard this. There was no mention of why Asuka
Ren's Peace Land was adopted as a scenario in Ways of Survival. Perhaps I
could get a hint about the writer of Ways of Survival from this?

"That…"

Han Sooyoung was pulling out a sword while Asuka Ren took one step
back. I interrupted them. "I'm really curious but I'm afraid we can't hear it
now."

"Huh?"

"Run!"

We moved by a hair's breadth and sharp swords slashed at where we had
been standing.

Asuka Ren desperately ran with a pale face. Han Sooyoung asked, "Shit,
when did they follow us?"

"They are good at stealth."

"How many are there?"

"Four people."

They didn't underestimate us and tried to assassinate us. We had no chance
in a head on battle.

Asuka Ren gasped for air and said, "It seems to be the Wind Shadow
Squadron. They are the subordinates of the Sovereign of Eight Heads."

"Those brats have weird names."

This wasn't the timing for them to chase me. It seemed that it was a mistake
to mention Orochi's true name. As soon as we entered the rocky area, the
range of our movements became better.
It was due to Asuka Ren's guidance. Once again, the person who created the
world was different.

Nevertheless, the distance was narrowing as the Wind Shadow Squadron
caught up to us.

Han Sooyoung spoke like she had made up her mind. "Ah, I don't know.
Kim Dokja, go first. I'll buy some time."

"Is it okay?"

"Don't you know me? I'm a master at dying."

"Then I'll believe in you." I grabbed Asuka Ren and ran. "Ren-ssi, there is
no time anymore. Quickly find him."

"I-I don't know what you're saying."

"The returnee Kyrgios."

"Huh?"

I shouted while avoiding a flying sword. It seemed that Han Sooyoung had
missed some people.

"Tell me where Kyrgios is."

"…I don't know who that is?"

I expected it to be like this. In Ways of Survival, it only mentioned that
Kyrgios was here and he never came out directly.

"I really don't know! I never created such a person!"

"Nope, you know. He is the only powerhouse of Peace Land."
"There isn't a person like that in my manga! Besides, the characters in my
manga are weak!"

Then a sword thrust at us. I turned sharply and stopped. I didn't want to do
this but I had to touch her wound.

"Your Peace Land was terminated early in the 11th episode and you didn't
get a single volume published after that."

"H-How do you…?"

"I know that you wanted authentic fantasy in your heart. However, it didn't
work out. Your manga, is it really authentic fantasy?"

Two people from the Wind Shadow Squadron appeared in the smoke. I
would be able to cope with them if I was my usual self, but now it was hard
to stop even one. I brushed aside the katana but my wrist was broken.

I activated Purest Sword Force and shouted calmly. "It was just once but
you became angry when you saw the reaction of readers and drew a
person."

"W-What are you saying?"

"He is a strong person not fit for Peace Land. You felt guilty about
pandering to the public by drawing such a person. That sense of guilt ruined
your Peace Land."

"No! I never did that!"

"Please take responsibility until the end. Even if only one reader watches
this world."

"Ah, ahh…"
It became more and more difficult for me to avoid the blades. The panicked
Asuka Ren was completely frozen. Two katanas flew towards my upper
and lower half. Dammit, was I wrong?

"…I'm sorry, I'm really sorry." Then a voice was heard. "You're right. I
obviously…"

The next moment, the surrounding air changed. I felt my limbs become stiff
from the cold. Then another voice was heard.

[Who are you?]

I didn't look back but it was clearly a presence comparable to the
constellations. Otherwise my Fourth Wall wouldn't be shaking so much.

I looked ahead and saw the Japanese people standing like stone statues.
They couldn't even speak as pure white lightning fell towards them from
the sky. The powerful disasters turned into ashes from the lightning.

Once the clouds that caused the lightning disappeared, a small doll was
floating. It was unbelievable. The powerful presence floating in the air was
definitely a small person.

…He was properly hooked.

[I will ask again. Who are you?]

"It is nice to meet you, Kyrgios."

Kyrgios Rodgraim of Peace Land. He was one of the strongest returnees in
Ways of Survival.
         Chapter 128: Ep. 25 - Those Who Face a God, II


The strongest existences in the Star Stream were often called
'constellations'. They observed the stories of every world from above.

However, as I said earlier, the constellations aren't the only ones who could
go against constellations. There were those who refused the path of a
constellation and became demon kings or dragons that ruled at the peak of
all monsters from birth.

Then what about humans? Could humans who didn't walk the path of a
human reach the level where they could oppose the constellation?

The answer was currently right in front of me.

[Interesting. You gave up your existence for another planet?]

Kyrgios could see my identity with one look. He glanced at the confused
Asuka Ren besides me.
[I'll let it pass just once because of your courage. Take that woman away.]

A returnee. Born with special talents, they transcended the category of a
human thanks to the blessing of the Star Stream.

Among the returnees, Kyrgios Rodgraim was a special existence. He was
very powerful among the returnees and earned enough money not to be
dragged into the stories made by the dokkaebis. He was a returnee who
never acted in Ways of Survival.

"I have something to say to you."

[…Say?]

The skills that exceeded the level of transcendence manifested and revealed
their presence to me. It was the presence of a constellation that could
destroy mortals just by existing.

[Do you think you are in a position to talk to me?]

I was surprised that there was so much moisture inside me. My back was
soaked with sweat.

[Your dare oppose Baekchung?]

He was strong. I got goosebumps at the thought of how a small person
could be so strong.

[The exclusive skill, 'Fourth Wall' is activated!]

However, I had a 'wall'. No matter how terrifying the presence beyond
the wall, it wouldn't harm me as long as I didn't cross it. [The character
'Kyrgios Rodgraim' is curious towards you.] Kyrgios noticed something
strange.
[…You endured it? How? Do you have the protection of a higher being?]

I opened my mouth before he became interested in the wrong thing.
"Kyrgios. This world needs your help."

Kyrgios' expression changed.

[This is why you came looking for me?]

"That's right."

[The small person…]

Then the 'small person' replied.

[A small planet's constellation is looking tearfully at Kyrgios Rodgraim.]

[A small planet's constellation has sponsored 10 coins to Kyrgios
Rodgraim.]

Kyrgios frowned.

[I don't need it.]

[The small planet's small constellation has received a large shock.]

A few raindrops fell from the sky like baby pee.

[…Every world has a time of destruction and every story comes to an end.
For this planet, that time is now.]

There were no emotions in Kyrgios' eyes as he stared into the distance.
However, I knew. Even if you became insensitive to everything in the
world, there was no one who could escape from the bounds of their own
story.

"Then why did you come back here? You left Peace Land a long time ago."
[…Something called me.]

My eyes glanced towards Asuka Ren, who was staring at Kyrgios. I knew
what Kyrgios had probably felt.

"Don't deceive yourself. Didn't you come back here to defend your home?"

[There are no good memories here. This place…]

"Is this the place where you were born 'weak'?" Kyrgios shook for the first
time. "It is because of your mother gave you a cursed body?"

[…You know me quite well, incarnation of the scenario. Then I'll say this.
Get lost. I won't tell you a third time…]

"Are you scared?"

[What?]

"I asked if you are scared. This is your world and these constellations are
destroying it. Are you scared of that snake?"

At this moment, a fearsome pressure that almost made my eyes pop out
pushed down on my body.

[If you want to die then I will kill you.]

I gasped for air but didn't stop speaking. "Don't deceive yourself about why
you came here."

[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' is displeased with the
behaviour of Kyrgios Rodgraim.]

[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' is criticizing Kyrgios
Rodgraim's justice.]
[The constellation 'Scribe of Heaven' is severely criticizing Kyrgios
Rodgraim's interference in the scenario.]

The indirect messages emerged one after another and Kyrgios's aura
subsided.

[Weird people are chasing after you. The monkey king and archangel? It is
strange. They have a strong pride…]

I spat out blood and started talking again. "Focus on my story. Did you
come here to see the end of this planet?"

[I can't help this planet.]

Blue sparks appeared around his body. It was the probability storm. It was
caused by killing the two Wind Shadow Squadron members.

He wasn't a being summoned by the scenario and was limited by the
probability, even if it wasn't as much as the constellations.

Kyrgios firmly grabbed a spark and said. [If I act then I will only hasten the
destruction of this planet.]

I understood what he meant. Probability was like a scale for the
constellations. If one side changed the flow of the story without a valid
probability then the law of Star Stream would forcefully correct the
balance.

[If I interfere with the scenario, other constellations watching the scenario
will also be able to move. All I can do… is watch the end of my home.]

I remembered. This was the real 'image' of Kyrgios Rodgraim that I knew.
He left his home, overcame countless trials and returned, only to be unable
to save his home despite his strength.

This was the Paradox Baekchung, Kyrgios Rodgraim.
"There is no need to take action with your own hands."

However, if I was to back down here then I wouldn't have come see
Kyrgios in the first place.

"Don't you need a disciple to learn the top secret technique of your white
energy?" The calm Kyrgios was greatly shocked by my words. "Please
accept me as your disciple. I will be your agent on Peace Land."
However, the shock only lasted a moment.

[…I don't accept outsiders as a disciple. In addition, your strength is lacking
to be qualified.]

My pride was a bit hurt. If Yoo Joonghyuk was here then would Kyrgios
hesitate to accept him as a disciple?

"I'm not qualified despite this?"

I picked up a branch in the vicinity. My magic power was absorbed by
Purest Sword Force and a wave of mana flashed at the tip of the branch. It
was lacking in power but it was still enough to show my achievement.

Kyrgios watched with amazement. In the second scenario, the first thing I
purchased was this hidden skill. Purest Sword Force was Kyrgios
Rodgraim's famous technique.

"I will say it once again. The outsider Kim Dokja requests for the master of
the Baekchung School to accept me."

.

.

Kyrgios made a decision after a few hours.
He released the flaming aura of Baekchung and spoke in a human voice.
"The Baekchung School was wiped out after I left. I don't know if it still
exists."

He kept me waiting for two hours just to say this.

The strong people of the Star Steam lived in a 'unique time zone' in order to
maintain their sense of self over the long years.

"Okay. I will accept you as a disciple."

Kyrgios didn't ask me how I knew Purest Sword Force and how I knew
about his secret technique. Then the training started.




「 …Kyrgios Rodgraim was a 'Murim World Returnee'.

Despite the inherent limitations of the small people, he mastered several
martial arts and succeeded in transcending his race without the help of the
system.

There are many legends about him who advanced to the First Murim and
reigned as the leader. He killed all the enemies taller than himself, cut off
the penis of a drunk man making fun of his height and has an association
with the famous constellation the 'snake'… 」

"Your smartphone has become smaller as well?"

I heard Han Sooyoung's voice and turned my smartphone off. "I put it in the
subspace of the coat and it became like this."

"Damn, you hog all the good things to yourself."
Han Sooyoung was able to safely overcome the Wind Shadow Squadron
and join up with us. They were probably deceived by the 'dead enemy' like
I was.
She muttered, "I never imagined that Kyrgios, the strongest person in First
Murim would be from Peace Land."

"The strongest person can't be obscured and he is close to the strongest. But
how do you know this name?"

"The name appeared in the first part of the novel. It is the first time I've
seen it myself."

"This is also my first time. In any case, wait near Ren."

I was taught by Kyrgios in the rocky area. My goal was to learn Kyrgios's
secret technique in two weeks and return to Veronica. If the story
progressed as the original then this should be when the Japanese king, the
Sovereign of Eight Heads moved to trample all four kingdoms.

Of course, things weren't that easy. On the first day, this was the task that
Kyrgios gave me.

"Repeat this a million times."

"…A million times?"

"Yes, one million. Did you see what I just showed you properly?"

I saw it well. Kyrgios stood in front of me and stretched out his sword. This
was the basic 'stab' posture.

"Why this…"

"Every disciple starts here. It is to aim for the smallest point. In one
extremely condensed and tempered 'point', the universe begins."

"…I see."
I didn't know what he meant.

"You were born big and don't know the meaning of being small."

The moment I heard this, something popped into my head. According to
Ways of Survival, Kyrgios had a complex about his height. I told him,
"Humans aren't very big either."

"Yes, that's what I'm saying. In the end, all of us are specks of dust from
the perspective of the universe. That's why it is wrong to call a small
person a small person. Humans and small people are just dust in the end."
It felt like he was rationalizing his small height.

"However, isn't big dust different from small dust?"

"The important thing is the size of the universe, not the size of the dust.
Even if you are just a speck of dust, the degree of your existence can vary
depending on how big the universe is. No, the smaller the dust speck, the
closer it is to the origin of the universe. This makes it easier to understand
the essence."

I thought it sounded nice. "Ah."

"Do you understand?"

"What does that have to do with stabbing?"

Kyrgios looked at me with contempt and said, "This is why people
shouldn't be born big. Work hard on the stabbing."

Then Kyrgios disappeared. He seemed disappointed in me. It was natural.
Way of the Wind had proven my poor talent. It might take me two decades
to learn the secret technique instead of two weeks.

Four days passed.
"Do it straight. Shouldn't you attempt to do it properly?"

Five days passed.

"This is why those born with big bodies…"

A week passed. Kyrgios' hatred of big people didn't stop. "Have you ever
been born as an insect? Cockroaches probably learn better than you."

"If such a cockroach exists then I would like it as a teacher."

"Do you want to die?"

Finally, it was the end of the second week. I was tired of stabbing and fell
down.

"You…"

I still hadn't learnt the skill. Kyrgios was deeply disappointed with my
talent and soon disappeared. It was like a small breeze had blown for a
moment.

Once Kyrgios was completely gone, I found Asuka Ren and Han Sooyoung
waiting nearby.

"Let's run away."

"What? Did you learn everything? It looked like you couldn't do anything at
all."

"I stole it."

I quietly closed my eyes and whispered something. The next moment, a
violent white lightning bounced around me. It was the secret technique of
Kyrgios, Electrification.

"Eh? What is this? You clearly couldn't…"
"I told you. I stole it."

['Kyrgios Rodgraim' has been added to the fifth bookmark.]

This was my purpose from the beginning. I placed the strongest returnee
Kyrgios into my Bookmark skill and tried to raise my understanding of him
as much as possible.

In the first place, Kyrgios wasn't willing to teach me properly. Strong
people like Kyrgios weren't simple enough to give up their secret
techniques because of flattery.

His purpose was to keep me here until the end of the scenario and then
torture me after the scenario ended to find out everything I knew.

"That's why we have to run away."

"Shit, I understand."

Han Sooyoung grumbled. By the time we finished the preparations, the sun
was shining in the distance.

The warmth of dawn surrounded us. Peace Land changed seasons every
two weeks. It was winter when the training started but now spring was
coming.

Asuka Ren suddenly paled. "The Sovereign of Eight Heads has started
moving."

"Really?"

"He is using the Absolute Throne to call the Japanese incarnations
together."

It was time. Spring was the season where creatures that hibernated woke up
one by one. The season of the 'snake hunt' would soon arrive.
         Chapter 129: Ep. 25 - Those Who Face a God, III


Veronica's high walls. Giants filled the plains below the highlands. They
were once humans but were now disasters. Gong Pildu roared as all the
turrets on the castle fired. "Damn bastards. This is my land!"

There were approximately 50 Japanese people who ran through the plains.
This level of strength meant that more than half the disasters of Peace Land
had gathered.

Dududududu!

"Get lost―!" Gong Pildu was slightly upset as he fired the guns. He didn't
know how he got into this situation. However, Lee Jihye thought that the
aftereffects of Kim Dokja destroying the Green Zones still remained.

Lee Jihye watched the great army of disasters and her fingers trembled.
"Damn, I wish there was a lake…"

"Let's do as much as we can."
Lee Hyunsung walked over from the lookout post and stood beside Lee
Jihye. Lee Jihye turned around and saw Lee Boksoon. Lee Jihye's eyes
shone. "Grandmother, can you borrow the power of your sponsor?"

"Huhu, do you want my ancestor to continue their service?"

"Ah, this is really… Soldier ahjussi, Heewon unni's group still isn't here?"

Lee Hyunsung nodded heavily. "There is no news of the next group. Before
he left, Dokja-ssi said they would be doing a bonus scenario…"

"Damn. Then we have to stop them."

Then dim shadows appeared above them in the sky. Lee Jihye discovered
the small insects filling the sky and was frightened.

"Ack!"

There were a variety of flying monsters mixed in. Lee Gilyoung and Shin
Yoosung had finished preparing the beast and insect army. Lee Gilyoung
was sitting on an insect that resembled a wasp and waved his hand.

Meanwhile, the disasters arrived at the castle and started to break down the
walls.

Lee Hyunsung spoke in a tense voice. "…They're coming."

The full-fledged siege began.

Dududududu!

On one side, Gong Pildu fired while on the other side, the small people
shouted.

"Fight!"

"For Veronica!"
The voices resonated through the castle as the walls were gradually crushed
by the disaster's kicks. Now the term 'disaster' seemed really fitting for
these humans.

'Would I be like that if I chose to become a disaster?'

Lee Jihye remembered Kim Dokja's words and bit her lips. The answer was
still unknown.

The party held on better than expected.

There were Gong Pildu's guns and Lee Hyunsung's Great Mountain Smash
that dealt effective blows to the disasters. The large number of insects and
monsters also bought time.

At this rate, they might be able to protect the castle. This was what Lee
Jihye thought until black clouds covered the horizon.

"What is that?" Lee Jihye doubted her eyes.

[The king of disasters has received the scenario buff effect.]

[Some of the probability constraints on the constellation 'Sovereign of Eight

Heads' has been lifted.]

"Crazy, how do we defeat that?"

Something the size of a huge fortress was coming this way. There were
eight heads and a tail.

'Ahjussi! Come quickly!'

Lee Jihye inwardly screamed.
We left Kyrgios' territory and moved through the rocky area towards the
plains.

Asuka Ren opened her mouth, "I think the Sovereign of Eight Heads has
already started acting. I can't feel his call in this area."

"Ren-ssi, are you okay?"

"I can resist it to a certain degree thanks to my sponsor. However, the
incarnations with weak sponsors have already flocked to the plains."

In the case of the Absolute Throne, there was a difference in the intensity of
the command depending on the distance. There was nothing absolute in the
Star Steam, even if it had the 'absolute' qualifier.

Along the way, we found the bodies of the small people. Asuka Ren spoke
with a bitter expression.

"…Not everyone in Japan chose to be a disaster."

"I know."

I read the original so I could say it clearly. Apart from Asuka Ren, the
Japanese people who became 'small people' couldn't be seen because they
were already dead or hiding somewhere in this world.

"In fact, I don't think the Japanese people who choose to be a disaster are
bad. They are just ordinary."

In the original work, a number of Korean incarnations also chose to be a
disaster. This was probably a normal choice for ordinary humans. Han
Sooyoung also agreed.

"To put it bluntly, I didn't choose to be a small person. Kim Dokja's goal
also isn't to protect the small people."

Han Sooyoung's words were sharp.
[The small planet's constellation is looking at you with hurt eyes.]

It didn't matter if it was for the sake of the small people or the disasters. In
the end, the fight here was a spectacle.

People became immersed in their role and forgot this fact. They sold their
lives to make money. Then that money would be used to buy other stories.
Maybe humans always lived this way.

Then a huge aura rose from the rocky area. It was quite far away but I could
feel the formidable aura from here.

"Kyrgios has noticed. Hurry."

I ran away after asking him to teach me. I would suffer incredible pain if I
was caught. We started to run across the plains in the direction of Veronica.

In the midst of running, Asuka Ren often looked back at the rocky area.
Han
Sooyoung glanced at Ren and asked, "Are you sorry?"

"Huh? No."

"Don't you feel that it is weird? It is probably the first time you saw a
character that you made."

"…Yes."

"Furthermore, he is handsome."

I didn't say it before but Kyrgios was handsome. In Ways of Survival, a
handsome person was often described as 'comparable to Yoo Joonghyuk'
and this was a perfect way to describe Kyrgios.

The problem was his height and his temper…
How did it feel to see a person you created breathing and talking? If the
author of Ways of Survival was alive somewhere then wouldn't he feel
something similar when looking at Yoo Joonghyuk?

Asuka Ren spoke to me. "Ah right, Dokja-ssi. I have a question."

"Yes."

"How did you gain Kyrgios' favour?"

"His favour?"

"I got the impression that Kyrgios liked Dokja-ssi."

"…Huh?"

"Kyrgios acts angry when he likes someone.

[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' is listening.]

That reminded me, Kyrgios treated me quite well despite me not having
talent. Despite all the times he swore at me…

"Dokja-ssi."

I looked back at Ren's words and my expression stiffened along with the
two women. Dark smoke was rising from the place where I was looking. It
was in the direction of Veronica Castle. We glanced at each other and
started running.

Not long afterwards, the battlefield of Veronica Castle was revealed. There
were the bodies of the fallen monsters as well as the trampled corpses of the
small people. I also saw people whose heads were crushed. Perhaps this
was Lee Hyunsung's work.

As we got closer, the number of small people corpses increased and the
bodies of the Japanese incarnations decreased.
No way, I couldn't be late. Then after a while, we witnessed a terrible scene
at the back of the shattered palace.

Dududududu!

Gong Pildu's cannons fired.

Fortunately, all the party members were safe. Lee Hyunsung was badly
injured while Lee Jihye and the children were exhausted, but their lives
were intact. However, it was dangerous. They were fighting…

"Crazy!"

Han Sooyoung shouted and stepped back towards me.

"Ahh! Izumi…"

Asuka Ren groaned with pain as she grabbed her temples and fell down.
Twenty Japanese people were united around one being.

Behind the body of a man whose pupils had turned black, there was a
shadow of a huge monster that covered the whole sky. The heads and tail
were reminiscent of a blood red valley. The king of the disasters was in a
streamlined form.

Suddenly, one head bent down towards the nearest small person. Th small
person turned white with terror and the snake smiled at him. There was a
crunch and only the lower body of the small person remained.

"H-help! Somebody, help!"

The flesh of the small person was sucked into the mouth of the red snake.
Nobody was able to stop it. All the small people, including my party
moments, stood like hardened mannequins and watched the scene.
I belatedly realized. It wasn't because my party members fought hard that
they were unharmed. The gunfire continued but it was resignation, not
killing intent that filled Gong Pildu's face. It was the same for Lee
Hyunsung, Lee Jihye and the others. The reason they were still alive
because they were meals for the narrative-grade constellation.

Every time the mouth of the snake opened, a few small people would
disappear.

[The small planet's constellation is struggling with pain.]

[The small planet's constellation is screaming.]

Han Sooyoung muttered. "Shit… what the hell is this?"

One of Japan's three great villains, the father of Shutendoji, a flood control
mythical monster. That monster was the 'Sovereign of Eight Heads',
Yamata no Orochi. Maybe I would be torn apart by his teeth if I fought
against him.

"D-Don't fight. We absolutely can't win." Asuka Ren mumbled and the
entranced Han Sooyoung grabbed me.

"Kim Dokja. Surely we aren't going to fight that? Let's run away. Yes?"

I didn't answer. The giant head once again swept over the small people. It
was a natural movement, like taking fish out of a fish tank.

Han Sooyoung kept urging me, "It isn't too late. Now we can save the kids.
Quickly bring them and run…" Kwaduduk!

"Ah!"

They're all going to die!" I shook my head.

"Let's wait a bit longer."
If I acted now, that guy would never move. Just a bit longer…

Then the snake's mouth headed towards Lee Jihye. Damn. I reflexively got
up and ran forward. However, the snake's head was moving quickly
towards Lee Jihye.

At this moment, something moved faster than me. One of the snake's heads
fell to the ground with a pained scream. The cloud of dust was lift and a
man could be seen standing on the snake's head. He looked at me with a
distinctive cold expression. "…Kim Dokja."

Yes, why did he always show up late? I smiled at him. "You are late, Yoo
Joonghyuk."

He had become a small person like me but I felt a strong energy from Yoo
Joonghyuk. This person was holding a violet and glossy ornamental knife.
As expected, he obtained the knife.

We stared at each other without speaking before simultaneously turning
towards the disaster.

[The constellation 'Sovereign of Eight Heads' wants your blood.]

Yamata no Orochi mealtime has been interrupted and his body started to
swell up.

"Stay away Kim Dokja. I will catch this guy."

"No, not this time."

I stepped towards Yoo Joonghyuk.

[The exclusive skill 'Bookmark' can now be activated.]

I felt the strong energy seething in my heart.

"This time I have to catch him."
In this scenario, I would break the principle of no killing that I had been
maintaining.
         Chapter 130: Ep. 25 - Those Who Face a God, IV


Yoo Joonghyuk glared at me and said, "It is too unreasonable with your
skills."

Messages poured in.

[Constellations who hate the Korean Peninsula are showing hatred.]

[Constellations who hate violence and slaughter are going crazy.]

[Constellations who hate the Korean Peninsula desires your death.]

I looked at the Japanese incarnations. Their sponsors were all people I
knew. They had entered Bihyung's channel and drove someone I knew to
death.

"I made a promise. Thus, I have to catch him."

"Promise?"
The first promise was to kill the dokkaebi and the second promise was to
revive her. Finally, there was the third promise. It was this.

"I promised to get revenge on the constellations who killed her."

Yoo Joonghyuk probably understood from these words alone. Maybe in this
world, only Yoo Joonghyuk could understand. Yoo Joonghyuk replied, "I
can't concede because of that."

"…This bastard really doesn't understand."

We started moving as soon as we finished talking. The place where we
were standing was destroyed and the head of the giant snake stared at us.

[The constellation 'Sovereign of Eight Heads' is furious!]

It was a fearsome presence. It wasn't just the body but the 'shadow' of the
constellation. This much power was revealed despite only a handful of the
probability constraints being lifted.

This was the dignity of the narrative-grade. It was an opponent that I
would've normally never dealt with.

「 Yamata no Orochi. He was interpreted as an evil spirit in ancient
Japanese mythology. There is only one way to deal with him at this point.
」

I observed Yoo Joonghyuk's sword and said, "You have obtained the
Totsuka-no-tsurugi."

In the original third regression, Yoo Joonghyuk didn't get the sword. It was
probably because Yoo Joonghyuk had become stronger in this round.

Yoo Joonghyuk wondered, "…You know this sword."

"I know. It is a famous sword."
Totsuka-no-tsurugi. It was the sword used by Susanoo to cut down Yamata
no Orochi. In other words, in a distant story, it defeated Yamata no Orochi
once.

It was the same as Gyebaek and Ito. The history of 'defeat' was a fatal
weakness for all beings made of stories. The eight heads cried at once and
shed bloody tears.

[Cheeky…worms…]

Crazy… was he using his true voice?

[The exclusive skill, 'Fourth Wall' is strongly activated!]

The whole area was devastated with a single word. More than half the small
people who heard it died of their internal organs rupturing. Lee Jihye and
Lee Gilyoung coughed up blood and also collapsed. There were even
disasters who bled after hearing the words.

Of course, I had the 'wall' and Yoo Joonghyuk's Mind Barrier had a high
level so we could endure it.

"You don't speak well so shut up." I taunted him. However, the snake didn't
use his true voice again. He didn't have sufficient permissions so using his
true voice consumed a large amount of probability. Instead, his anger led to
action.

The eight heads simultaneously breathed out fire, turning the area into a
furnace. We quickly ran behind a wall. It was Yoo Joonghyuk who acted
first.

[The character 'Yoo Joonghyuk' has used 'Giant Body Transformation Lv.
2!]

As expected, this skill had also been passed to him. I thought that I should
learn this skill.
Yoo Joonghyuk's body swelled up he leapt into the air. Giant Body
Transformation was a technique that temporarily exploded the latent power
of a body to imitate the power of a giant.

For a short time, Yoo Joonghyuk's combat power would be even stronger
than it was before he became a small person. The problem was the duration
of the skill was only five minutes.

The Breaking the Sky Energy filled Totsuka-no-tsurugi. Yoo Joonghyuk
kicked off from the wall and rushed forward. Splitting the Sky reached a
perfect state and gushed out from the ether blade.

Breaking the Sky Sword.

Vanish.

Splitting the Sky Desolation.

The flash of light that emerged from Yoo Joonghyuk's sword split into
dozens of branches and struck the snake.

Gruesome black blood emerged from the wounds caused by Totsuka-
notsurugi and one of the eight heads started to rot.

This was the only sword that could kill Yamata no Orochi. Yoo Joonghyuk
wasn't a constellation so Stage Transformation didn't occur. Still, it was
obvious that the sword was effective.

[The constellation 'Sovereign of Eight Heads' is howling.]

One head was cut off but Yamata no Orochi was still intact. In order to kill
him, all eight heads must be cut off.

Yoo Joonghyuk didn't hesitate and jumped towards the second head. The
battle was so gorgeous that no one could interrupt. It was amazing as Yoo
Joonghyuk zigzagged to avoid the heads and tail
The main character was the main character for a reason. Even so, a person
like this died over a hundred times in Ways of Survival. Once again, this
world was terrible.

"Kim Dokja! Are you going to just watch? Didn't you say you would catch
him?"

Yoo Joonghyuk destroyed three heads in an instant and shouted towards me
as he gasped. It seemed like he was losing steam?

I smiled and replied, "Ah, I meant I would deal the final blow."

"You bastard!"

I leisurely managed my stamina and waited. It wasn't time yet.

On the other hand, Yoo Joonghyuk was in a hurry and squeezed all out all
his fearsome strength at once to hit the other heads. In the process of cutting
off the fourth head, Yoo Joonghyuk's 'Giant Body Transformation' was
released.

Flames and poison poured out from the snake's heads at once. Yoo
Joonghyuk dodged with agile movements but couldn't escape being
damaged by the tail.

[The character 'Yoo Joonghyuk' has used 'Strong Self-Defense Lv. 9'.]

Only the tip of the tail touched him but Yoo Joonghyuk's body was thrown
back into the castle's wall. The bloody Yoo Joonghyuk emerged from the
terrible dust clouds.

"Kim Dokja! Your help…"

"I'm going to act now."

"Stupid person! You can't do it alone! Back off now and later―"
"You've had a hard time. Now it is your turn to watch me."

The moment the remaining four heads gazed at me, I picked up Totsuka-
notsurugi from the ground and ran towards Orochi. [The number five
bookmark has been activated.]

[Activation Time: Three minutes.]

[Your understanding of the character is low, so only a part of the character's
skill is activated.]

It was fine. This much was still good.

[The skill can only be used by a 'small person'.]

[Your current body configuration is similar to the physical makeup of the
character.]

I only needed one skill anyway.

[The level of the character is too high to fully reproduce the skill level.]

[The level of the skill being activated is forcibly adjusted.]

[The exclusive skill 'Electrification Lv. 10' is activated.]

「 The magnitude of the consciousness determines the degree of existence,
making it possible for the smallest being to see the greatest universe. 」

The phrases left by Kyrgios in Ways of Survival passed through my head
and the flow of magic power around me changed. The magic power soon
became particles and the electrons that resonated with each other started to
tremble violently.

「There is a beginning in existence, so the smallest is the greatest. 」
There was the sound of something popping deep in my mind. Maybe it was
something like the coolness of the Big Bang. I opened my eyes and saw my
body covered with a blue-white lightning. It was like I had become
lightning.

The formidable power was wriggling inside me. It felt like I could do
anything. If I wanted to penetrate the sky, I would penetrate the sky. If I
wanted to separate the sea, I would do so. Then if I wanted to cut off this
snake's head, I would cut it.

There was a roar as I took the first step. Then with the second step, I
appeared right in front of the snake's neck. The third step caused the white
lightning to scream in the area and then the fourth step…

I passed by Orochi, leaving a storm behind. My feet were damaged by the
lightning and blood poured from my nose and mouth. My body stumbled
like I was experiencing an electric shock.

I looked back and saw three snake heads falling to the ground. I drank a
magic power recovery potion and the swelling in my hand decreased.

[The constellation 'Sovereign of Eight Heads' is shocked by your
swordsmanship.]

In just a moment, Orochi had one head left and was floundering from the
pain.

[The constellation 'Sovereign of Eight Heads' is questioning the fairness of
the scenario!]

I laughed loudly. "…You are raising an issue of fairness?"

The duration of Electrification was three minutes but right now, my body
couldn't take more than three steps. In other words, I had to kill him in three
steps.
Sparks filled the air and then that damn voice was heard again. [Geez, a
person of noble blood looks so ugly.]

I thought I would hear this voice. The intermediate dokkaebi Ganul was
looking down at this place.

[…Ah, really. I can't just watch. This is a big problem.]

Unlike his words, he didn't seem to want to interfere.

[The constellation 'Sovereign of Eight Heads' is shouting with anger.]

[Hrmm, you can't make an impossible demand. As you can see, you've used
up all the probability allowed in this scenario. 'They' can't lend you any
more power.]

Yamata no Orochi's roar covered all of Peace Land. This must've been the
first humiliation that the narrative-grade Yamata no Orochi had
experienced.

Someone was always a spectacle. Now the victim of the spectacle was
himself. He was filled with anger. There might be only one head left but
Orochi's strength was increasing.

"Protect the king!" The confused Japanese incarnations ran forward. This
was the power of the Absolute Throne.

I heard a message from the dokkaebi Youngki in my head.

–D-Dokja-ssi. The channel is about to burst. I will block the indirect
messages for a while!

I was currently using the power of Kyrgios so all types of constellations
would come to watch me.

"Stop!"
My party members regained their spirits and ran to stop the disasters. Lee
Hyunsung barely raised his bloody body while Gong Pildu supported them
with gunfire.

Meanwhile, Yamata no Orochi was preparing for the final reversal.

[No, wait a minute! Hey Constellation! What are you doing…!]

An ominous current was appearing around Izumi's body, the incarnation of
Yamata no Orochi. It was the sign of a probability storm. The panicked
dokkaebi shouted.

[L-Look here! Turn back! The bureau! It is an emergency!]

It was a real disaster brought about by the desire not to be defeated by me.
The dokkaebi belatedly used the system control but it was unfortunately too
late.

The Great Hole opened in the wide sky.

I realized that Orochi had crossed the line. He even borrowed the
probability that the supreme being granted to the Absolute Throne.

"Ahh, ah!"

Everyone held their breaths as they stared at the sky.

[Someone has interfered with the scenario system.]

Restless sensations were surging from the Great Hole. Chaos. Disorder. A
void. It was the origin of all fear. This existence was lending its probability
to Yamata no Orochi.

The shadow of the remaining snake head started to grow larger due to the
probability. It grew bigger and bigger. It would grow until it covered the
castle and the entire planet.
[Measuring… sword…!]

All beings, whether they were incarnations or small people, collapsed on
the ground and groaned as they coughed up blood. The dreadful difference
pressed heavily on my body. My knees were forced to the ground.
Everything was the worst.

[Mere… hum…ans… going… against… a… great… star…!]

I instinctively realized. I couldn't win even if I used Electrification. At my
level, I couldn't win even if I woke up the dead.

Nevertheless, I laughed. "You just made the worst mistake."

The Star Stream was about balance. If someone destroyed the probability
then someone else would obtain it. Thus, the balance would now be
adjusted.

A fearsome aura was coming from a distance at a rapid pace. It wasn't
Yamata no Orochi or the unknown god beyond the Great Hole. However,
nobody here could ignore this arrogant existence.

[Since when could a god from another world intervene in the scenario?]

He was the absolute being born on this planet.

[Don't get involved in my planet's matters, if you don't want to confront me
where my story began.]

The White Purity, Kyrgios Rodgraim.

[Get lost! Monster of this world!]

Lightning stretched out as Kyrgios soared towards the sky. It was a
powerful force that wasn't pushed back at all by a narrative-grade
constellation.
Kyrgios revealed his true strength and broke through the tentacles, forcibly
closing the entrance of the Great Hole. Then Orochi's power started
plummeting.

[This… ah… ah…! You…!]

I didn't miss this gap and used the remaining three steps. All the magic
power in my body flowed towards Totsuka-no-tsurugi.

Then I saw the incarnation of Yamata no Orochi smiling at me. It was an
expression that welcomed the long-awaited liberation.

Killing one person to save other people's lives. The selfish sword moved
and something rolled along the ground.

[You have killed a person.]

[You have been deprived of the title of 'King of No Killing'.]

The constellation of Yamata no Orochi blinked from the severe blow. There
was a terrible scream and the shadow of the constellation started to scatter
into ashes.

[An unbelievable feat has been accomplished.]

[You have hunted a 'King of Disasters' for the first time!]

[The script of the 'King of Disasters' being defeated in this scenario wasn't
expected!]

[You have achieved an impossible feat!]

[Due to the completion of an impossible story, all dokkaebis of the Seoul
Dome and Tokyo Dome will enter an emergency meeting.]
I looked up at the constellations shining in the sky. All of them wouldn't
know. It was the feeling of a person running hard only to arrive at the
starting point.

[Congratulations! The Star Stream has acknowledged your grade.]

[You have accomplished a total of four stories.]

The end of the sixth scenario. I finally arrived at the starting point towards
the end I wanted.

[Now you must build your last story to become a constellation.]
            Chapter 131: Ep. 26 - Scenario Destroyer, I


[200,000 coins have been acquired as compensation for your achievement.]

[We are currently discussing the compensation for the major contributors.]

After the death of Izumi, Yamata no Orochi's incarnation, the Japanese
people immediately surrendered. The collapse of the Absolute Throne
loosened the power controlling them and the hidden anti-disaster people
started appearing.

"Thank you, Kim Dokja."

I recognized the speaker's face. The greeting was from one of the Japanese
people that Yoo Joonghyuk visited, just like I found Asuka Ren. I nodded
and greeted the speaker. "Kizuki Hiroshi."

"You know me?"
"You got the Totsuka-no-tsurugi in a hidden scenario."

"Hoh, that's right. It looks like you heard it from Yoo Joonghyuk."

Of course I didn't hear it from Yoo Joonghyuk. I was aware of it because I
read the original novel. If I remembered correctly, this person had a sponsor
related to the myths of Susanoo and Yamata no Orochi.

"You managed to kill the Sovereign of Eight Heads… Many things have
been settled thanks to you. I will surely repay this kindness." Kizuki lead
the remaining Japanese people and disappeared.

The Japanese who chose to become disasters took advantage of the fact that
they wouldn't die even when failing the scenario. Izumi was the incarnation
of Yamata no Orochi but Kizuki was also a powerful and clever
incarnation. He would be able to lead the incarnations well for the time
being after returning to Tokyo Dome.

[A constellation born from the sea and storm has revealed his modifier.]

[The constellation 'Snake Cutter' has developed a great liking towards you.]

The constellation 'Snake Cutter' was Susanoo, the original master of the
SSS-grade item Totsuka-no-tsurugi.

I glanced at the Totsuka-no-tsurugi that I gave back to Yoo Joonghyuk.
Totsuka-no-tsurugi had been greatly damaged. It wasn't strange that it
wassaid to have broken after killing Yamata no Orochi.

Yoo Joonghyuk stared at me and the party members who had fallen asleep
after eating the Ellain Forest's Vital Energy.

"Ah, I thought I was really dead this time." Lee Jihye shook her head and
held her forehead after waking up. It was because of the blow from directly
hearing Yamata no Orochi's true voice.
"No, what was that? I just heard a few words…"

"I didn't get such a feeling when the commander made a surprise visit…"

Lee Hyunsung was talking only to freeze when he heard the voice behind
him.

"It looks like you're alive, Lee Hyunsung."

"Y-Yoo Joonghyuk-ssi."

"I told you to follow my group. Why didn't you listen?"

"T-That…" Lee Hyunsung trembled and glanced my way. It was a face
asking me to do something but I couldn't. Yoo Joonghyuk stared at Lee
Hyunsung for a while before turning away.

"Ahjussi." I looked around and saw Shin Yoosung holding onto me. She
looked up at me like she wanted to be picked up.

I lightly patted Shin Yoosung's back. "Was it hard? Well done. You did
well."

I wanted to say something plausible but these were the only words I had.
Shin Yoosung shook her head from within my arms.

"Hyung, it wasn't that hard." Lee Gilyoung interrupted and pushed Shin
Yoosung away from my arms. Despite the arguing, the two children seemed
quite familiar with each other. As expected, kids understood kids the best. It
was worth leaving the two of them together.

"You're popular with children." I looked at the small person who spoke.
Was his name Gillemium? "There will be a royal banquet in the evening.
The castle has almost collapsed and the scale will be very small but… I
would like to invite you to attend." I looked up at the sky.

[Time remaining until the end of the scenario: 27 days.]
[The disasters have given up the scenario and the sixth scenario is
scheduled for an early termination.]

It might take a bit of time because of the disasters scattered throughout the
world. However, once Hiroshi went around Peace Land then the scenario
would end automatically.

A banquet…

Was it to play and drink? Ah, then perhaps?

"I understand. We will attend."




"It looks like you are very fond of drinking."

"Well… it has been hard to see then these days."

I brought out a lot of distilled spirits that remained in the warehouse with
Gillemium's help. Peace Land's drinks had very low alcohol content so I
needed a lot to make the drink I wanted.

[The constellation 'Snake Cutter' is interested in your brewing.]

I poured alcohol into a bucket the size of a human, threw in all the
ingredients I had and started to stir.

[Eighth Head of the Sovereign of Eight Heads.]

[Seventh Tail of the Sovereign of Eight Heads.]

These were items that came out when defeating Yamata no Orochi. They
were fragments rather than proper body parts because the true body hadn't
appeared. Still, they contained part of the constellation's power.
It was only Yoo Joonghyuk who realized what I was going to do. "You
know this hidden piece."

"Aren't I a prophet? Now give me your sword."

Yoo Joonghyuk knew what I was going to do and obediently offered his
sword. I threw the Totsuka-no-tsurugi that I received from Yoo Joonghyuk
into the alcohol. Originally it shouldn't be made like this but I used a
shortcut. The Totsuka-no-tsurugi melted into the alcohol.

[Two stories give meaning to your actions.]

[The narrative of the Sovereign of Eight Heads and the Snake Cutter has
been combined.

[Some parts of the story are damaged due to incorrect transmission.]

The damaged part was a bit disappointing but it couldn't be helped.

[The narrative of Ame no Murakumo no Tsurugi is expressed!]

According to the stories, Ame no Murakumo no Tsurugi was the sword that
came out of the tail of a drunk Yamata no Orochi. However, it was possible
to acquire it using a shortcut. In any case, I just needed to drink.

Lee Jihye asked doubtfully, "Why did you throw the sword into the
precious alcohol?"

"Wait and see."

A moment later, a mysterious aura flowed from the alcohol and a sword
surrounded by a pure white light rose.

[The star relic 'Heavenly Sword of Gathering Clouds' has appeared!]

As expected, it appeared. There was nothing wrong with the method from
Ways of Survival.
Yoo Joonghyuk reached out his hand. "This is mine."

"Hey! We caught him together."

"I was the one who caught him."

Usually, I would've insisted, but Yoo Joonghyuk's eyes were serious this
time. This son of a bitch…

Of course, the relic itself wasn't my goal but it was still bitter to have the
star relic taken away right in front of me. I couldn't fight him here so I gave
up on the sword.

[The star relic 'Grass-Cutting Sword' has appeared!]

A knife rose from the alcohol.

…Eh?

The contents of Ways of Survival flowed quickly through my head.

「 Names give birth to narratives and narratives are reproduced in reality.
In the world of the Star Stream, Ame no Murakumo no Tsurugi has a total
of five names. In other words, Ame no Murakumo no Tsurugi isn't 'one
sword'.
」

I belatedly realized. Perhaps the name of Ame no Murakumo no Tsurugi
was used for five things in total. In other words, one sword appeared in
Ways of Survival and the other four weren't mentioned.

I quickly grabbed the knife. "Then this is mine. Any complaints?"

"That…" Yoo Joonghyuk's narrowed eyes stared at me before he turned
away. "Do what you want."
I inwardly sighed with relief. I was satisfied with the grip of the knife in my
hand. It was the second in the Ame no Murakumo no Tsurugi, the
GrassCutting Sword. This sword contained the power of a dragon killer so I
didn't need to be afraid of any dragon species that I encountered in the
future.

Lee Jihye watched from the side and pouted. "These petty-minded males
obtained the swords…"

Lee Jihye joked playfully before poking the jar of alcohol. "Can we drink
this now? The smell isn't a joke."

"You are a minor…"

It wasn't just Lee Jihye. People were flocking to the golden coloured
alcohol. Everyone seemed to be hungry for alcohol. Well, they would
become drunk just from smelling it…

"Drink up everyone."

People started to drink like crazy after I gave my permission.

"Ohh, how could it have this taste?"

"A heavenly drink!"

The people drank the golden alcohol and exclaimed with joy. It was
fermented with the magic power of a constellation so it would naturally
have a good taste. In fact, the alcohol content in it was insignificant but it
also had the effect of increasing stats.

"Aren't you drinking?" I asked Yoo Joonghyuk. I looked closer and saw
that Yoo Joonghyuk was making a simple dish.
He was slicing and roasting meat and vegetables. It was an outdoor party so
the food ingredients brought by the small people were piled up in the area.
However, Yoo Joonghyuk's cooking…

Yoo Joonghyuk spoke in a cold tone. "I don't consume anything made by
others."

"Are you afraid of being poisoned?"

"It is because it isn't delicious."

"How delicious can the food you make…" I said this but I quickly took a
bite out of the dish Yoo Joonghyuk was making.

Then… No, what was this?

Lee Seolhwa, who was helping Yoo Joonghyuk nearby, smiled and asked
me, "Is it delicious?"

"…Yes."

It was damn delicious. Really, it was delicious. No, it was the best dish I
had ever eaten. What was this meat skewer?

One side of the expressionless Yoo Joonghyuk's mouth curved up. Damn.
Even if he was a regressor, how could this bastard cook so well?

I mumbled something and moved away when I heard something that was
like a musical instrument. It was excellent music that was very calm and
profound.

I followed the sound and saw a doll sitting on top of the castle. It was the
smallest person who was as handsome as Yoo Joonghyuk.

It was Kyrgios Rodgraim. He sat on the ledge and played the viola while
staring at the distant sky. It was gentle and sometimes sad. It was filled with
a faint longing. The noisy crowd stopped one by one and listened to the
music. The exaggerated heat cooled down.

First, someone's eyes reddened. Then the next person burst into tears. It
seemed contagious and they all started to cry. As if they missed the
moments they had to cry, everyone burst out crying.

The inhabitants of Peace Land also experienced the scenarios. This was
music that comforted them.

I drank a bit of the alcohol while listening to the melody. Then Asuka Ren
came up to me. She hadn't joined the Japanese group.

I asked her, "Ren-ssi, have you seen Han Sooyoung?"

"Ah. I was describing some settings to her and she suddenly said there was
a place she had to go."

I see. It seemed she left to find a hidden piece. That girl…

The sound of the viola spread through the broken castle and I recalled
something as I saw Asuka Ren's face. A person who had reached the end of
a long dream was likely to make this face.

I thought I could ask now. "How do you feel?"

"…It is weird." She hesitated for a moment. "I'm thinking that I shouldn't
have given up."

I understood immediately what she was saying. She licked her lips
before opening her mouth, breaking the moist film on her mouth. "Who
would've thought of this when reading my manga?"

"Someone obviously did."
Asuka Ren smiled sadly and looked down at her hands. Her red cheeks
made it clear she had drank a lot of alcohol.

"I suddenly had a thought. Maybe I'm not a member of a world someone
drew…"

I paused before saying, "Perhaps it is a world that doesn't matter."

"Huh?"

"There is the story I wanted to hear last time…"

I noticed Asuka Ren didn't understand and explained it a bit better. Asuka
Ren said, "Ah, an email arrived shortly after the series ended. They wanted
to borrow the setting of my manga…"

I was a bit surprised by the unexpected words. There was no such thing in
Ways of Survival.

"Borrow the setting?"

"Yes. I didn't think much about it at the time but this situation occurred not
long afterwards…"

"Do you remember the exact details? For example, an email address or…"
"As soon as I replied to the email, all related emails were suddenly erased.
So the detailed address…"

"I see."

Asuka Ren heard something in my voice that made her feel sorry. She
hesitated before adding, "…That, um. I'm not certain but I think the
email address started with a 't'." t? I became dazed and reflexively asked,
"Could it be… tls123?"
            Chapter 132: Ep. 26 - Scenario Destroyer, II


tls123. This was the ID for the author of Ways of Survival.

Asuka Ren's eyes widened. "Eh? tls123…?"

I urged her, "Do you remember?"

"Remember… eh?"

"What is it?"

Asuka Ren blinked and her eyes became dazed for a moment. Faint sparks
appeared around her body.

"■■■…■■"

Huh? I was shocked and asked, "What did you just say?"

"…Huh?"
"The words you just said…"

"What do you mean? What did I…"

Asuka Ren's face showed that she didn't know anything. I felt a terrible
sense of foreboding. I quietly activated Character List.

  Overall Evaluation: The current comprehensive evaluation is currently

As I saw in Ways of Survival, this woman must be the creator of Peace
Land.
Then…

…Was it 'editing?' The next moment, I saw the disappearance of an entire
feature window in front of my eyes. Like sand, the letters scattered one by
one in front of me.


  Exclusive Attributes: Mangaka (Rare)


Very slowly, goosebumps crept up my spine. Why was 'Creatore of Peace
Land' missing all of a sudden? It was impossible for any constellation to do
this.

Asuka Ren looked at me and asked, "Sorry, what were we talking about?"

"We were talking about Ren-ssi's work."

"My work?" Asuka Ren made a face like she couldn't remember anything.
She couldn't remember any of the settings of Peace Land that she created.

「 At this moment, she knew that the world had completely left her hands.
」

I had a throbbing headache. Was there such a sentence in Ways of
Survival? I didn't know.

However, one thing was for certain.

The melody of the viola playing in the lonely night. The cries of the small
people. The sad and rich atmosphere elevated by the emotions. This was the
moment the world called Peace Land was completed.

Now there was nothing to add to this story. Finally, one story had become
completely independent from its author.
I suddenly thought I understood why an attribute disappeared from Asuka
Ren. The moment the world was finished, the author had to descend from
the position of creator.

I suddenly wondered. Where did the finished story go?

[You have come to know the planet Peace Land.]

[All beings belonging to Peace Land are faintly aware of your gaze.]

[The small planet's constellation rejoices in your presence.] [The

beings of Peace Land have started to write legends about you.] The

funny thing was that I hadn't asked for it.

…I see. The destination of the story that left its creator was decided from
the beginning.

After that, I asked Asuka Ren a few more things while using Lie Detection.
However, she really didn't remember anything.

"I'm sorry, I really don't know. It is like a manga I have read…"

It was like she read her own story. Somehow, I felt depressed. Asuka Ren
closed her eyes for a moment before saying, "However, I think I enjoyed
reading it. Definitely…"

Sadly, the information about the author of Ways of Survival that I barely
managed to touch stopped here. It was still unclear what type of person the
author of Ways of Survival was and what they wanted.

Still, at least one thing seemed vaguely clear. Perhaps like me, the author of
Ways of Survival wasn't satisfied with the existing ending. That's why they
gave me the book before the end of the world. If so, I would meet those
expectations.
I stepped away from Asuka Ren who was enjoying the scenery and pulled
out a small ampoule.

[Ancient Serpent's Sacred Blood]

It was an item obtained with the constellation parts. I sent a signal and the
distant Lee Hyunsung nodded and approached. Lee Hyunsung wasn't
drinking. I was sorry but I had some work for him to do today.

"I need your help now."

"Leave it to me."

Lee Hyunsung was entrusted to be my guard. It was because I was going to
collapse for a bit. I sprinkled the Ancient Serpent's Sacred Blood into the
cup and the golden alcohol turned into a dark red.

[You have drank alcohol made from the Ancient Serpent's Sacred Blood.]

[The greedy snake will test your mental power.]

This was a hidden piece that Yoo Joonghyuk didn't know about in the third
regression. It was a ceremony that could only be done when the alcohol
made from Orochi's parts was mixed with the sacred blood. I wouldn't have
given up an excellent trait like King of No Killing if it hadn't been for this.

[The snake has confirmed your eligibility for Dragon Slayer.]

[The new attribute 'Eight Lives' is being prepared.]

…Good. Now that it was being prepared, I would have a new attribute
when I woke up.

One thing was finished and the other…
I poured the remaining alcohol into my mouth. I became dizzy and felt
drunk. However, I couldn't fall asleep right away. I sat on the ground and
wrote a message.

'God of Wine and Ecstasy'.

Why? Dionysus was unresponsive despite the joyful atmosphere. The same
was true for Persephone.

It was a difficult situation. I accomplished my task but there was no one to
take me to the Underworld.

Should I bring Yoo Sangah over? If there was a direct terminus with
Olympus then I could send the signal right away.

'Father of the Rich Night'.

It happened when I wrote Hades' modifier. An eerie aura swept over my
body.

I was filled with the urge to vomit and when I opened my eyes again, I
realized that I had already come to the Underworld. This disturbing and
unpleasant air could only be felt in the Underworld.

Looking around, it was fortunate that I hadn't fallen into Tartarus. Someone
was standing in front of me.

[You shouldn't enter the Underworld right now.]

It wasn't Hades or Persephone. I could tell the moment I saw the outfit
resembling the envoy.

"Judge-nim."

It wasn't the judge who guided me last time. I replied to him, "I came to
report that I've completed the queen's task."
[I know. Once again, you can't enter the palace.]

"…Why?"

[I can't tell you that.]

The judge waved his hand like it was troublesome.

[Go back. I summoned you using the power of the father but it is
impossible for you to enter.]

"I have an appointment with the queen. I must enter."

[You can't right now. Go back.]

What type of crap was this? Despite his strength, the judge was miniscule
compared to Persephone. Still, looking at this stubbornness…

"…Perhaps they are both away?"

The judge hesitated before nodding.

[That's right.]

"What's going on…"

Hades and Persephone were absent at the same time. I didn't know what it
was but there was a high probability that something big had happened. If it
was an emergency meeting for the 12 gods of Olympus… but was there
anything worth making that summons at this point?

"Did they leave something for me? Something I can pick up if I arrive…"

[Why should I tell you if there was such a thing?]

I knew that the judges had different personalities but I didn't expect to be
caught by such a tough one. Based on the way he talked, there must be
something. There was no way that the meticulous Persephone would've just
left…

It couldn't be helped.

"I'll let you take a sip of this if you help me."

I took out the Yamata no Orochi alcohol that I had placed into a bottle in
my coat. I opened the lid and the smell of sweet fermented liquor spread.

[T-That is…?]

The judge was shocked. For a person who had lived a long time, alcohol
was like drugs. It was the only means to forget the tragedy of the long
years. This wasn't alcohol but alcohol made from the parts of a
constellation.

[H-Hrmm. Hrmm…]

"If you don't like it then I can go."

[W-Wait a minute! I understand. I'll give you the thing that the queen left.]

He ate the bait. This was completely different from the harsh judge I saw
last time.

[Hah… good…]

The judge grinned with satisfaction after taking a sip and pulled out a
yellow bead.

[Here, take it and go.]

It was a bright yellow bead. I realized it was the soul of Shin Yoosung that I
had been eagerly looking for. I rubbed the bead several times and it shone
with a faint light as it floated in the air. I placed my hand on the bead and
thought, 'I'm sorry, am I late?'
The bead only screamed, like she had lost most of her language.

[Ah…ah.]

A woman who lost her words and her memories. Despite dedicating her life
to the scenario, the only story left to her was a horrible history of pain. This
was what a normal person would say.

'You've gone through enough so rest and take it easy'.

However, Shin Yoosung couldn't rest. She still had work to do in this
world.

[Ah…jussi…?]

The soul trembled after a long time.

[Really, really…]

'Yes'.

[Why…?]

'You still have work left to do in this world'.

I didn't come here because I sympathized with her. I did it because I needed
Shin Yoosung's help. There was something that only she could do with the
story she built up for a long time. Shin Yoosung responded with slight fear.

[I… what should I do?]

I touched her soul and showed her some of my thoughts. Shin Yoosung was
silent for a while before she burst out laughing.

[Haha, ha… a cruel person, ahjussi… in a way, you are more cruel that the
captain…]
'I'm sorry'.

[But… okay. I accept. No… I want to do it. This is what I want. This time,
I want to see the 'ending' of this world.]

'Your memories might disappear. Can you endure it?'

Shin Yoosung nodded.

[I'm not afraid. Ahjussi… I'll believe in what you told me.]

Finally, Shin Yoosung's soul disappeared back into the bead. She probably
wouldn't come out for a while. The moment we would meet again was after
she gained a physical body.

The judge watched us and opened his mouth.

[As you might know, the body isn't resurrected just by taking the soul out of
the world. Moreover, it is impossible for the soul to settle into a new body
after a long time.]

The judge chuckled.

[There might be a way with reincarnation but this soul has committed so
many sins that it won't be born again as a human. If you want her to be born
again as a human then you have to throw away all the stories of the soul. In
that case, she won't be the person you knew.]

"I know."

As Persephone said, the soul was a story. Even now, Shin Yoosung's soul
was becoming 'not Shin Yoosung'. However, that wasn't the only path for
Shin Yoosung.

I immediately called to someone. 'Bihyung'.
He was silent. I waited, looking down at the bead until Bihyung responded.
Only high value beings could choose the body a soul was reincarnated in…

She had been dominated by the story so far and now she would be reborn as
the ruler of the story. I finally felt Bihyung through the channel. I opened
my mouth. 'I need your help'.

–What help?

I didn't answer. Bihyung was silent as he glanced between me and Shin
Yoosung's soul. He soon noticed the meaning of my words.

–Surely, you… you want me to do 'that?'

I nodded.

–Hey, think about it. It isn't as easy as you think. It might be better off if
she disappears here…

'Do you want to ruin your channel?'

–Shit. Hey, this is really… I've never done this before!

'First time for everything'.

–Fuck.

Bihyung hesitated for a long time before finally giving me a golden egg.
The egg from the greatest 'Star Story' came down.

I put Shin Yoosung's soul into this egg. The egg trembled and gave off a
brilliant light before it flew up into the sky again.

Bihyung couldn't say anything for a long time before muttering in an absurd
way.

–I never thought I would receive a 'child' this way…
My enemies weren't just inside the scenarios. The Shin Yoosung of the 41st
regression, she would be the only 'streamer' for me in this round.
            Chapter 133: Ep. 26 - Scenario Destroyer, III


The negotiations with Bihyung finished and the judge urged me.

[If it is over then go back.]

The judge was absentmindedly staring at my liquor bottle again. It seemed
that he hadn't drank enough…

Wait. Didn't he say that Hades and Persephone weren't present right now?

"Hey, Judge-nim. One more thing."

[I don't know what it is this time but…]

"I'll give you the bottle." The judge's eyes flashed at my words. "Please take
me to Tartarus again."
There was no time so I went down to Tartarus and then came back up
again. It was only a short time but the judge was already drunk.

[Then are you done?]

"Yes."

Hades and Persephone being away was a divine move for me. I only gave a
bit of information but if I knew Kim Namwoon, that alone would make a
big difference. I was looking forward to the Gigantomachia that would
arrive one day.

[There is a message that the queen left.]

"The queen?"

[Yes. I will directly recite it.]

The judge repeated Persephone's words in a profound voice.

[Incarnation Kim Dokja, you have completed the task in a very interesting
way.]

"…"

[Many nebulae in the Star Stream are now watching you. Many of them are
hostile towards you.]

In fact, this scenario had caught too much attention from the constellations.

[You should be prepared.]

I became a bit nervous after listening to the story. Was this related to Hades
and Persephone's departure? The amount of messages from the other large
constellations had noticeably decreased a while ago.

Uriel in particular. And Uriel was part of the 'Eden' nebula…
[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' feels sorry.]

[The constellation 'Secretive Plotter' is comforting 'Prisoner of the Golden
Headband'.]

These guys were still here.

[Then go well.]

I nodded. There was no point worrying about it now. The important thing
was to build up my stories. Some nebulae might despise me like
Persephone said but it wasn't everyone.

There was a distant whirlwind and my field of view gradually changed.
Once I opened my eyes again, I had returned.

"Dokja-ssi."

There was a strange tension in the voice. I hit my cheeks to come to my
senses. Then I saw Lee Hyunsung's anxious face and asked, "What
happened?"

The people around us were buzzing. Lee Jihye and the others were all
crowded around one place. In the air, traces of a distorted space were
appearing.

A portal. It was the pathway that my companions and I had gone through.
Why was this thing open? Hadn't the scenario ended?

Lee Hyunsung explained, "The second South Korean group has shown up."
The second group? They came now? "I'm not really sure…"

There was a sense that the second group had come too late. Usually the
second group appeared a week after the first group, but this time the
personnel supplement didn't occur until after the scenario ended. It was
different from Japan, whose third group were deployed in an instant.
Lee Hyunsung and I headed towards the portal.

"Ahjussi, this way!"

I headed in the direction of Lee Jihye's voice and then a man appeared from
the portal. His whole body was charcoal, as if he had been burned all over.

"Uhhh…"

This man was someone I knew. I asked with a shocked expression, "Jung
Minseob-ssi? What is this…?"

Jung Minseob. He was one of the few readers who was on my side when I
was fighting the apostles. I thought he had died after the War of Kings
because I hadn't seen his face for a while. Why was he here…?

Lee Seolhwa appeared and started to treat Jung Minseob. However, it was
already too late. At the last minute, Jung Minseob met my eyes and
muttered towards me. "D-Don't… come… back…" They were Jung
Minseob's last words.




[You have protected the peace of Peace Land.]

A huge string was shining in the air. There was still a festive atmosphere
but the expressions of my party members were different. Lee Jihye
wondered in a confused voice, "What the hell is this?"

It was a situation where the scenario wasn't completely closed so it wasn't
unusual for additional personnel to be dispatched. Yet the extra personnel
was injured from the beginning.

"Was there a case like this in Japan?"
Asuka Ren shook her head at Lee Hyunsung's question. "Perhaps they were
attacked by something when crossing the portal…"

"Is that possible?"

There were times when there were dimensional species living in the portal.
However, based on my memories, that didn't happen in this scenario.

Then Lee Jihye gave her opinion. "Perhaps the remaining people are
fighting among themselves?"

I didn't want it to be like that but it was the most realistic guess. Asuke Ren
nodded and added, "There is no Absolute Throne on the South Korean
side?"

"Yes."

"Then this isn't likely."

Japan was currently in similar situation. In countries that weren't affected
by the Absolute Throne, the leaders of a group often changed. As far as I
knew, this happened a few times in Ways of Survival.

This situation was a bit surprising. It was still the early stages of the
scenario. If the isolated ones joined together, their strength still wasn't high
enough. Moreover, Seoul had prepared a contingency plan. There was Yoo
Sangah, Jung Heewon and my mother, the King of Wanderers.

It was impossible for a new leadership group to emerge as long as they
were there. The eyes of the party members were anxious.

"Perhaps… it can't be."

None of the scheduled second group had come. Only Jung Minseob arrived
and he was in a dying state. There was even the message 'don't go back'. I
could guess a few possibilities but…
"We won't know for certain unless we go back." When did he appear? Yoo
Joonghyuk spoke from beside me.

I nodded at his words. "You are correct. Let's go back and check it." Then
the scenario message was heard.

[Additional compensation for the major contributors has arrived.]

[Major contributors: Kim Dokja, Yoo Joonghyuk] Finally, the main
scenario rewards had arrived. [Do you want to check the compensation
history?] I nodded.

[Rewards List]

   1. Moon Wave Folded Fan (SSS-grade)
   2. Blue Dragon Sword (SSS-grade)
   3. Magic King's Bracelet (SS-grade)
   4. A choice of one of the following A-grade skills.

There were a total of four rewards. The compensation list was considerable
because the scenario was very difficult.

The items such as Moon Wave Folded Fan and Blue Dragon Sword would
show strength comparable to star relics after they were gradually enhanced.
There would be no damages. In addition, there was the Magic King's
Bracelet. This was a good item to defend against beginner and intermediate
spells from magic-based returnees.

However, I had obtained the Grass-Cutting Sword and the first two items
weren't very advantageous. The Magic King's Bracelet was intriguing but
the value was reduced unless I met a returnee. Thus, the answer was fixed
from the beginning.

"I will pick the fourth option."
A list of skills appeared in front of me. The reason for the increase in rating
was because the skills that appeared mainly belonged to the Murim system.

Manifestation of Nature New Feat

Small Yang Sword.

Taichi Blurred Palms.

…

There were the exquisite techniques of the Shaolin school or famous ones
like the 24 Plum Blossoms Swordsmanship. Every one was a skill I coveted
but I only had one choice, so I had to be careful.

As I mentioned last time, regardless of the skill's level, some skills were
highly difficult to obtain. There would be a chance to get the Murim skills
again but if I missed this chance, there was a skill I would never get. For
example, the Peace Land limited 'A-grade skill'.

"I will pick the A-grade skill, Miniaturization."

Lee Jihye saw my choice and screamed, "Ahjussi, are you crazy?"

"Why?"

"Why would you choose such a thing? It is too stressful to be small… I
would rather you choose the Blue Dragon Sword and give it to me!"

Lee Hyunsung also looked surprised. The kids didn't care and were playing
with each other. On the other hand, the small people looked strangely
touched. They probably thought I chose this skill to remember them.

[Now that the compensation has ended, it is time to go back. I'm sure
you've become attached to each other but please say goodbye.]
The dokkaebi made an announcement and then a huge portal appeared in
the air. Gillemium and the small people gathered around us.

"Go carefully!"

"Thank you. I'll definitely remember you."

The small people sang a song of farewell for us. Asuka Ren's eyes
reddened. The Japanese group also disappeared into the portal. My party
members were the last ones to leave. The song of the small people
continued.

I kept listening and seemed to hear some lyrics.

–Hero who saved Peace Land.

His name

It isn't Dokuja

Dokja

Ohh it is Dokja.

Shit, what were these lyrics?

[The beings of Peace Land are linked to your legend.]

[This achievement can be viewed after becoming a constellation.]

On top of a bell tower, I could see Kyrgios looking at me. I thought he
would run this way and make all sorts of threats after the scenario was over,
but he just watched quietly.

Asuka told me, "I think he appreciates you."

"Huh?"
"It is just a feeling. I don't know why."

Asuka Ren smiled at me. Her qualifications as a creator might be lost but
the author was still one of the readers.

"Let's survive and meet again, people of South Korea."

Asuka Ren bowed and disappeared into the portal. Then we also entered.
My vision swirled and once I came to my senses, my feet were touching the
ground. I wasn't too dizzy since I had experienced it once before.

[The main scenario has ended.]

The view of Seoul entered my eyes. I looked around and Yoo Joonghyuk
was the only one who arrived at the same place as me. We might've entered
the same portal but the exits were different. Still, why was I with this
person…

"Kim Dokja, move." The moment Yoo Joonghyuk spoke, the ground where
we were standing exploded. The magic bullets that flew over turned this
area into a mess.

"The Supreme King!"

"Don't panic! Shoot!"

"They aren't on the same side anyway! Leave the Supreme King and go for
the King of No Killing!"

In a way, it was an expected ambush. Dozens of people were gathered
beyond the dust clouds. At first glance, they had a great deal of equipment
and had sponsors.

Were they incarnations belonging to other nebulae like Persephone had
warned me about? The answer was still unknown.
"He can't kill anyone! There is a penalty if he kills! Therefore, don't
hesitate!"

"There is a possibility that he collected points and will revive again. Don't
miss the time of revival and kill him!"

…When had that information leaked? They even knew the information of
'King of No Killing'. After a moment, the person leading them appeared
through the dust.

"Kim Dokja! Slowly put down your weapon and come this way!"

I listened to his words. As they came closer, their armed appearance
became clear. Each person was wearing A-grade equipment and their
overall stats were outstanding.

They wouldn't be pushed by the wanderers group that my mother led.
Where the hell had these people come from? The leader smirked at me like
it was already over.

I smiled at him and asked, "Where did you get my information?"

"What are you going to do?"

"I will let you know that one part is wrong."

"What?"

[Blade of Faith is activated!]

Blade of Faith was pulled out and instantly cut the leader and his men who
were surrounding me.
            Chapter 134: Ep. 26 - Scenario Destroyer, IV


"U-Urgh?"

The heads of the people in front fell down and the people around them
withdrew in fear.

"He killed! That guy killed!"

"Isn't he the King of No Killing? This is different from what I was told!"

The flustered people urgently rushed out with their weapons. I didn't need
any special skills to catch these tadpoles. I simply used Blade of Faith and
cut down those who were running.

"Aaaagh!"

I neatly destroyed the encirclement around me. The last person started
screaming when he was half-cut. I stuck my blade in the struggling man. It
was without hesitation.
"I-I didn't hear about him having this much skill…?"

"Run away!"

Up to now, I had tried not to kill no matter who attacked me. Of course, I
didn't want to lose the King of No Killing. As I repeated this behaviour, I
developed the habit of refraining from killing.

It was different now. I would create a weakness if I didn't act more
aggressively. That weakness meant that countless hyenas would emerge in
the future. Once I decided, there was no hesitation in my hands.

The rest of the hyenas collapsed in an instant. There was only one left.

"You are slow."

I heard a sword and saw Yoo Joonghyuk putting away his sword. There
was no expression on the face of the person who killed a lot more people
than I did.

"U-Uhh, it was clearly said that the Supreme King doesn't cooperate with
him…"

One remaining man walked backwards while his limbs shook.

I asked him, "Who made you do this?"

"T-That…"

[The character 'Seol Ingu' has fallen into deep agony.]

The next moment, his expression changed and he suddenly ran towards me.

"Aaaah!"

It couldn't be like this. It was strange. Why run to die when he had no
chance of winning at all? A cool sensation flashed through my mind.
Then the man yelled. "For the liberation of humanity!" He had the look of a
martyr.

…The liberation of humanity? Yoo Joonghyuk's sword moved and the
man's head fell down.

"What are you looking at stupidly?" I completely woke up at Yoo
Joonghyuk's testy voice.

"Don't you think something is wrong?"

"It is rare for a person to have such strong loyalty."

"You know, humans aren't such loyal animals. Moreover, in the current
circumstances…"

Yoo Joonghyuk scolded me, "You dragged out time and the ones hiding
escaped."

I couldn't have a conversation with this jerk. We decided to follow the trail
of those who ran away. I asked, "…By the way, are you going to keep
going with me?"

"…"

"Are you perhaps looking for your chance to hit me?"

Yoo Joonghyuk watched me with his uniquely fearsome eyes and slowly
opened his mouth. "You are the one who reminded me. Thanks for letting
me know."

"…I would be more grateful if you kept forgetting about it."

I sighed and checked the surrounding area. It was near Kkachisan Station of
Seoul Subway Line 5.
Yoo Joonghyuk spoke with a puzzled expression. "…Strange. The hunting
scenarios should be in progress in Seoul Dome."

"I don't know. The hunt might not actually be happening."

All the roads leading to Kkachisan, including Ujangsan Station, Sinjeong
Station and Mokdong were covered with the blood of incarnations. There
were corpses lying on the street. There had been many bodies previously.
The problem this time was the method of killing.

Yoo Joonghyuk looked at the wounds and nodded. "The cause of these
wounds are humans."

If the monster hunting scenarios had proceeded then all the wounds on the
bodies would be tooth marks or claw marks from monsters. However, these
people had clearly died from sharp weapons or magic bullets.

In other words, there was a fight here regardless of the scenario. Not long
afterwards, we discovered a person who had fled.

"Over there."

Before we could approach, the man was pierced by an arrow fired from
somewhere. I drew my sword to face a new enemy only to meet an
unexpected group. They were the Hwarang. They started talking about the
dead person.

"There is no doubt. It is the remnants of the Savior."

"Finish him."

I confirmed they weren't enemies and ran towards them.

"Wait a minute!"

Then the woman looked back at me. She had a face weary from combat.
"Kim Dokja-ssi?"

She was Min Jiwon.




We heard unexpected news from her.

"…The kings' factions were disbanded?"

"First, the Maitreya King's forces were hit and then it was the King of
Wanderers."

I was startled. For a moment, there was a strong feeling of dizziness. "Is the
King of Wanderers dead?"

"I don't know her whereabouts. She is currently missing. Jeon Ildo, the
Neutral King joined the other side."

It was certainly possible if it was the Neutral King. Sometimes the word
'neutral' referred to those who were the most cowardly.

My mind became complicated. If my mother was hit then there was no
guarantee that Jung Heewon or Yoo Sangah would be safe. Who the hell
were these people?

I asked, "Is it the Yeouido forces we saw before?"

"No, it is an emerging force. Those bastards call themselves the Salvation
Church… and Yeouido is in their hands right now."

…Salvation Church? I naturally knew this name very well. It was because
the Salvation Church was a group that occupied an important position in the
original novel.
However, something was wrong. The original Salvation Church appeared in
the tenth scenario after the liberation scenario of Seoul was over.

"The Salvation Church suddenly appeared on the day you left. They said
they were going to liberate the human race from the scenario… the forces
that went against them were removed without hesitation.

Yoo Joonghyuk asked. "Where was such a force hiding? All the big powers
in Seoul would've gathered at the start of the sixth scenario."

"…They aren't from Seoul."

I immediately understood what she meant. Light suddenly gushed out in
front of us. It wasn't one or two light rays falling from the sky. Humans
were summoned with the light rays, as if it was a spotlight from heaven.
Half of them seemed crazy but the other half had very clear eyes.

Then a message was heard.

[New people have entered the scenario zone!]

[The seventh main scenario is currently underway at Seoul Dome.]

More than 900 people were summoned to the square. Everyone was
wearing casual clothing, not combat equipment.

Yoo Joonghyuk muttered, "It's already time for new people to be added."

At present, the main scenarios were in progress only in the capitals of
countries around the world. As we went through the scenarios, too many
incarnations died. In such cases, the bureau would summon a certain
amount of humans in accordance with internal regulations. Most were
randomly summoned from all over the country.

Like right now.

"U-Uhhh… uhhh…"
Most of the people were frightened but many incarnations had already
started to explore the surroundings. Based on their looks, they seemed to
have just gone through the first scenario.

Yoo Joonghyuk's eyes narrowed. "The Salvation Church was summoned
like them?"

"Yes."

"It doesn't make sense. Those who are just summoned won't be able to
defeat existing incarnations."

Yoo Joonghyuk's words were right. Of course, the recently summoned
would receive better rewards for the sake of balance control. However, that
alone wasn't enough to beat the existing incarnations.

Min Jiwon bit her lip and said, "The Salvation Church's lord was strong
from the beginning."

The trembling of her shoulders indicated someone who experienced real
horror.

"Supreme King, I know you are strong. However, never fight him. His
strength and resourcefulness has already transcended humans. He isn't
human. He is like another creature…"

Then the dokkaebi appeared among the murmuring people.

[Now, everyone. Don't panic. Calm down and look here.]

The new incarnations paid attention to the dokkaebi, like well-behaved
children.

[Your are now summoned and are like chicks who have lost their mother.
Of course, there are people who have already chosen a good sponsor but
you should know that it isn't easy to survive in this world. Thus, you have
to find a 'group' to protect yourselves. They will be the 'mother' who
protects you until you become a mighty incarnation.]

At this time, some of the incarnations screamed.

"There isn't anything else. This information already came out!"

"You've told us so get out of here!"

The incarnations started to move before the dokkaebi finished his words.
There was the event related to the prophets and internal information was
also released by the incarnations with the power of the Internet. Many of
them were probably already prepared.

"Supreme King! I have to stick to the side of the Supreme King!"

"That's right! The strongest incarnation is the Supreme King!"

These poor people were heading to their deaths themselves. I prayed for
their souls.

"I heard the King of Beauty is good."

"What are you doing? She is weak."

"She is unbelievably beautiful."

"…Should we go see her first?"

Yes, this might help her feel better. On the other hand, some people were
more cautious.

"Stupid fools. The real power isn't the Supreme King or King of

Beauty." I could hear some of the people with somber eyes who

gathered.
"The King of No Killing, or the Immortal King is the best."

"The King of No Killing?"

"It is said that he doesn't die even when killed."

"Wow. Amazing."

"In fact, there is a rumour that the Supreme King and King of Beauty
were beaten by him. There are also many women chasing after him?"
Uh… Is that right?

"Really? Who is it? What is the king's name?"

"I'm not sure…"

"Damn, then how can we find them?"

"I heard that we should find the ugliest king."

I suddenly felt a gaze and saw Yoo Joonghyuk staring quietly at me. What
was he looking at?

"No, recently…"

Meanwhile, the conversation of the incarnations continued. Which king was
better and who should they go under? I felt frustrated that I had removed
the Absolute Throne.

At this moment, a sound that was like a horn was heard in the distance. Min
Jiwon jumped and she started shaking. "We have to run away."

A voice was heard before Min Jiwon could finish speaking.

"Poor people playing out the scenarios of the highest beings."
The voice was vast and it was like the whole space was ringing. They
appeared on a monster species that resembled a giant elephant. As if they
were performing, the Salvation members were mumbling something on the
elephant. This march that was like a miraculous scene overwhelmed all
incarnations.

"We have come to save you!"

It was the appearance of the Salvation Church. However, Yoo Joonghyuk's
expression was strange as he stared at the center of the group.

"I didn't know he was going to follow me in this life."
            Chapter 135: Ep. 26 - Scenario Destroyer, V


I reflexively asked Yoo Joonghyuk, "Do you know these people?"

"Just one of them."

Yoo Joonghyuk knew the Salvation Church? Well, he would've met them in
the second regression. I was also familiar with the Salvation Church.
According to the original novel, the Salvation Church was a group that
completely abandoned the stereotypes of the word 'salvation'.

「 "There is no salvation in the afterlife." 」

The first sermon of the Salvation Church began with this.

「 "The most important thing is the story and 'today' is what we need to
liberate ourselves from. 」
At first glance, their doctrine had no problem. It gave importance to the
present, not the past or the future. It was a story I heard many times even
before the destruction came.

The Salvation Church mumbled unintelligible words while leading
enormous forces. The elephants making harsh cries were the 7th grade
desert thorn elephants. They had somebody who could tame the elephants.

"O-Ohhh…"

"The Salvation Church!"

The incarnations cheered at the splendid appearance. I was a bit nervous.
The Salvation Church had already appeared. Someone was intervening in
the future I knew. It was also a very strong presence.

I heard a voice from the elephant in the front. "Young incarnations. The
Salvation Church has come. We will free you from the scenario."

At these words, the Salvation members spread out their arms towards the
incarnations. Some of the incarnations came forward.

"…What do you mean by liberation from the scenario?"

"Literally what I said. I will give you freedom from the scenarios."

The words were still elusive but they were appropriate to tempt the
incarnations.

Liberation, freedom.

Some incarnations were prepared but for most of the incarnations who were
forced into this place, they were sweet words.

"C-Can we become stronger if we enter the Salvation Church?"
Some incarnations were already convinced while others were more
cautious. They believed in immediate power rather than vague words of
'salvation'.

"Stronger…" A shadow moved on the palanquin atop the elephant. The
gender of the voice couldn't be identified. "What do you think strength is?"
Gazes focused on the man who asked the original question and he stuttered
with a red face. "Well, strength is to be powerful… or to have strong skills!
Isn't that what it means?"

"A strong power and strong skills… something like this?"

Magic power slowly stretched from the palanquin and formed a gigantic
palm. It was magic power manifestation. A technique that could be used by
a returnee was being implemented by a mere incarnation in the scenario.

[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' is hostile towards the
'palm'.]

A huge palm that was overwhelming covered the sky and fell towards the
man.

"Waaaaahhhhh!"

Everyone screamed at the overwhelming magic. The moment the palm
covered the incarnations, it transformed into wind and disappeared. A warm
and gentle airflow surrounded the incarnation.

"You are pursuing fleeting things. Strength and weaknesses are all images
made by stories."

The curtain of the palanquin was lifted and something emerged. Like the
bright sun rising, a light was emitted from the whole body. It was like a god
descending as the light landed on the ground.
Then I realized something. I hadn't thought that the 'Salvation leader' I
knew would already come into the scenario. The incarnation who asked for
strength hesitated and opened his mouth.

"W-What does that… can I become stronger if I go under you?"

The lord of the Salvation Church spoke with a benevolent smile. "There is
no meaning."

"N-No meaning?"

"Poor living thing trapped in a pile of time. You are now being deceived by
the story." The hand of the Salvation leader touched the forehead of the
incarnation. "Tell me. Who inspired you to be 'strong'? Why do you want to
be stronger?"

The incarnation opened his mouth like he was possessed. "T-That… being
strong… can survive…"

"What does it mean to survive?"

"To survive… is to survive! Become stronger and live…"

It was repeated like a silly song. However, maybe this was the most honest
answer. The Salvation leader asked, "Is that your life?"

"W-What…?"

"If you live all day in order to be stronger, where is your life?"

As if realizing something that he shouldn't be aware of, the body of the
incarnation shook.

"My life is… huh?"

Tears flowed from the man's eyes. The man continued crying without
understanding the meaning of his tears.
Whenever a human faced an incomprehensible emotion, they would try to
forcefully gain an answer. Everyone watching the scene felt a sense of
exaltation. It was as if they had been waiting for someone to fix the
situation.

The Salvation leader wiped the tears of the man and some people sighed.

"This is the trap of the story."

I looked up at the air and the dokkaebi seemed to be listening with interest.
The leader of the Salvation Church declared, "Don't be eaten in the future."
Every word wedged in the hearts of the incarnations.

"Don't be fooled by the salvation of the afterlife that will come someday."

All the incarnations who just entered the scenario watched spellbound.
Whether they understood it or didn't understand it, the words became a
sound that permeated everyone's heart.

The Salvation leader continued speaking, "Salvation is here now and here is
where you should be."

Live and protect the present. Regain human pride without being eaten in the
future.

"Struggle here! Then leave yourself with a new story! This is the only way
to be liberated from the scenario!"

It was beautiful to hear. At least, if the person saying it wasn't the 'Salvation
Church's leader'. I looked at Yoo Joonghyuk. "Yoo Joonghyuk."

Yoo Joonghyuk was also pulling out a sword. There was a fierce killing
intent on his face. "It is a great way to train a suicide unit with tremendous
bullshit."
The Salvation leader turned around at Yoo Joonghyuk's words. The
moment they locked eyes, Yoo Joonghyuk demanded, "You better turn it
off and leave, Salvation Leader."

"You?"

A vast wave of air seemed to encroach on the surroundings and the
Salvation leader started to slowly fly to this side. The person wearing
ghagra and flying in the sky gave off an exotic atmosphere like a fairy. The
leader of the Salvation Church called out, "Yoo Joonghyuk?"

Why? A beautiful smile spread on the face of the Salvation leader. "Yoo
Joonghyuk! Do you know how long I have been looking for you?"

He was stronger than any incarnation I encountered before. According to
the original novel, it should be a long time before this person appeared.
Thus, I wasn't prepared for him.

I quietly activated Character List.

[The exclusive skill, Character List is activated.]

[There is too much information about this person. Character List is
converted to Character Summary.]

Then a message I saw for the first time popped up.

[There is still too much relevant information about this person. Character
List will try to summarize it again.]

[The information summary has failed.]

[The relevant information of the person can't be summarized.]

It was ridiculous. It was impossible to summarize the information? I
thought for a moment before changing the setting to only the 'first attribute'
of the person.
[The settings of the summary list have been changed.]


  [Character Summary]

  Name: Nirvana Moebius.

  Exclusive Attributes: Reincarnator (Legend)


…I got goosebumps the moment I got the information. Dammit, it really
was him.

The third way to survive in a ruined world. The person in front of me was
the third method. The reincarnator, Nirvana. A human who wasn't a human.

"Yoo Joonghyuk!" It was a jubilant voice.

I watched the man approaching and my palms became wet with tension.
This person's mindset was different from ordinary humans. No matter how
much I read Ways of Survival, there was a limit to how I could take
advantage of him. So, what should I do…

Nirvana smiled brightly and spread open his arms. "Yoo Joonghyuk!
Become one with me!"

At this moment, I understood how I could use him.




Nirvana clearly remembered the first moment he woke up in this 'world'.
Funnily enough, Nirvana was a diving beetle.

'…'
As soon as he opened his eyes, Nirvana was eaten by a frog. In the next life,
Nirvana was born as a frog.

'It wasn't an easy life'.

In that life, he was eaten by a rattlesnake and died. Nirvana became a
rattlesnake the life after that.

'At least I can eat frogs'.

In that life, Nirvana was killed by an anaconda. In the next life, Nirvana
was born as an anaconda.

'I will eat all snakes'.

In that life, Nirvana evolved into a powerful monster. Soon after, he
experienced the crisis of being hunted by humans. The humans blinded by
rewards harmed him and Nirvana suffered great injuries. On the brink of
death, Nirvana hid from the hunters in the forest.

However, he was noticed by a human.

"…You look injured."

Why? The human didn't hurt him. The man took care of his wounds and
then released him into the forest. Nirvana couldn't understand kindness but
he remembered this man's hand for a long time.

Then Nirvana was born as a human.

[The constellation 'Mandala's Guardian' is observing your life.]

Nirvana knew someone was watching him. He later realized it was a
socalled constellation. Since then, Nirvana continued to be born as a
human.
He became an excellent farmer and then the person who led the farmers. He
became a soldier and then a sword master respected by soldiers. He was a
slave and a noble who slaughtered slaves.

He experienced countless deaths and lived countless lives. He went through
numerous scenarios. Then he realized that he was the only 'special being' in
this universe.

'Only I am reincarnated with all of my memories'.

This fact made him terribly lonely. He was lonely so he enjoyed life even
more. He lived as if he could never survive again. Only once had he lived
like he had 'one life'. He taught others how he lived. Then he survived
alone.

One day, he received a message.

[You are caught in the huge wheel of time.]

[Your reincarnation circuit is subject to the wheel of time.]

[The constellation 'Mandala's Guardian' feels pity for your destiny.]

[You are participating in the Planetary System 8612 scenarios.]

Nirvana came across a person.

'Yoo Joonghyuk'.

For the first time, he found someone who repeated their life. The form was
different but he was still bound to the wheel of eternity.

'You are like me'.

Just this allowed Nirvana to receive tremendous salvation. In this vast
universe, there was someone who understood him.
'I failed in my past life. This time will be different'.

The Salvation leader approached Yoo Joonghyuk and shouted, "Yoo
Joonghyuk!"

Nirvana watched Yoo Joonghyuk and laughed even more. Nirvana had
been waiting for this day since he entered Yoo Joonghyuk's 'time'.

"Yoo Joonghyuk! Become one with me!"

"Stop with the bullshit and get lost. Before I kill you."

Despite Yoo Joonghyuk's prickly attitude, Nirvana laughed. Now, even his
grumbling felt cute.

"You pretend to hate me but I know that, in fact, you want me more than
anyone else. You need my strength!"

Last time Nirvana ruined his work but this time would be different. Nirvana
kept shouting, "I shall help you! Have you forgotten your last failure? Only
I can save you! I will liberate you from the wheels of eternity…"

"I don't need a person like you."

"What?"

Nirvana asked in a devastated voice and Yoo Joonghyuk glanced to his side
before speaking again.

"I have a companion already."
            Chapter 136: Ep. 26 - Scenario Destroyer, VI


I doubted my ears for a moment. This bastard Yoo Joonghyuk… What did
he say just now?

[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' appears late and looks
around.]

[The constellation 'Secretive Plotter' explains the situation while
snickering.]

[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' is astonished.]

[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' is desperately praying for the
line to be spoken again.]

Nirvana asked again like he couldn't believe it. "Just now…"

[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' likes this relationship
triangle.]
[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' has sponsored you 2,000
coins.]

What damn relationship triangle? When I saw Nirvana's face grow pale, it
hit me that things were going sideways. I was in the middle of putting
together a good plan dammit.

I said, "Hey, what bullshit is that? We aren't companions?"

Yoo Joonghyuk replied with a blank expression. "I wasn't talking about you
specifically…"

However, regardless of what Yoo Joonghyuk's intentions were, the situation
was already worsening. With trembling lips, Nirvana spat out their
passionate fury in a shaking voice. "How could it not be me…"

A fearsome killing intent was released from Nirvana's body and a huge
mandala appeared behind him.

I instinctively took a few steps back. Why were the people around Yoo
Joonghyuk always so anxious to be acknowledged as companions? I
wouldn't mind giving this jerk to them.

"How, how could you become one with someone that isn't me?!" A
dazzling light exploded from Nirvana's mandala.

I urgently whispered towards Yoo Joonghyuk. "Hey, just say that you like
him too. Quickly."

"I don't want to."

"Why not? Listen, just close your eyes and get it over with…"

Nirvana was spitting with rage at my whispering. "Don't whisper in front of
me!"

Then Yoo Joonghyuk spoke in a loud voice, "I'm not interested in men!"
[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' is howling while spitting up
blood.]

[2,000 coins have been sponsored.]

Nirvana looked like he was also going to spit blood.

"I am not a man!"

[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' is taken aback.]

"Of course, I'm not a woman either!"

It was an absolute disaster. I was annoyed seeing the wave of magic power
that was growing stronger with Nirvana's passion.

"What are you doing? Just say you like him! You can use him later…"

"He is too dangerous."

Shit, that damn pride. Nivana's combat power was expected to be at least on
par with Yoo Joonghyuk's. On top of that, if all the members of the
Salvation Church joined in, there was no way we could be certain of
victory.

"Please, wait!"

In the end, I stepped forward and opened my mouth. A reincarnator was a
card that could be useful in future situations. There was no need to fight
against him here.

"There seems to be a misunderstanding, so let's talk."

[The character 'Nirvana Moebius' has lost his sense of reason.]

"We have no intention of being hostile to the Salvation Church. He just isn't
good at expressing himself…" I put on a show while deliberately bumping
Yoo Joonghyuk's shoulder. "In fact, we were also considering whether we
should join you as subordinates, Church Leader. Let's throw away the
future and live for the present! How good would that be? Joonghyuk-ah,
don't you also think so?"

Of course, I didn't actually agree with the doctrines. In the world of the Star
Stream, if you threw away the future and lived in the present, then you'd
just die in the present. And even if I was a bit less happy, I wanted to live
longer. That's why I was a slave to capitalism.

"…Really? Answer, Yoo Joonghyuk!"

Maybe since he ate up my acting, Nirvana's fierce aura gradually declined,
but Yoo Joonghyuk didn't help. "It's nonsense."

"No, wait a minute!" I shouted but it was already too late.

Nirvana gritted his teeth. "Indeed, so it's like this. Then you can go to hell
together!"

I used Bookmark the moment Nirvana moved.

[The Bookmark skill is currently updating.]

[Replacing old bookmarks with new bookmarks.]

[There are five minutes left until the bookmarks replacement is complete.]

What? Now of all times? Meanwhile, Nirvana had accelerated to right
before my nose. It was fast, as if he was using Way of the Wind.

…Wait, this really was Way of the Wind? I belatedly recalled that he was
an Imyuntar in a past life.

Yoo Joonghyuk stepped in front of me. Nirvana's mandala and Yoo
Joonghyuk's Splitting the Sky Sword collided, emitting a sound like a
building was exploding.
Nirvana said, "What a touching friendship. So you think of your companion
first, is that it?"

"Kim Dokja, stay back! This person…!"

"Unfortunately, however." Nirvana's words were faster. Not just his words,
his actions were faster too. "Your companion will die."

Nirvana chanted a spell and Yoo Joonghyuk's body stiffened like a stone
statue.

[The character 'Nirvana Moebius' has used the stigma Eternal Nightmare
Lv.
8.]

I knew this skill. It was the most lethal technique against Yoo Joonghyuk.
Sparks flew around the hardened body of Yoo Joonghyuk. Like a broken
robot, Yoo Joonghyuk's neck froze as he turned back to me. Although he
was looking at me, his eyes weren't truly seeing me.

R…un… aw…ay.

Yoo Joonghyuk was currently trapped in a prison of his most terrible
trauma. A horrible prison where one memory was repeatedly played. It was
a mental skill that was a level higher than the skill used by the boss of the
Theatre Dungeon.

"Come here, cheeky person who was reborn."

Nirvana had the highest level mental skill to dig into the gap in Yoo
Joonghyuk's weakness.

It was an incredible feat. However, a reincarnator was still affected by
probability. It was impossible for him to have such strength at this point. I
stared at Nirvana's slender muscles.
"I will make you holy."

Did he abandon everything physical and invest everything in the mental
system and acceleration? This was the only thing that made sense.

Nirvana raised a counter skill just for Yoo Joonghyuk, who had a weak
mental state. It was unknown about other existences but he couldn't lose
against Yoo Joonghyuk. By the way, how did he get the exact right skill?
Unless someone else gave him the information…

"Run away!" Min Jiwon and the Hwarang blocked the incoming Nirvana.
She didn't back down in front of the person who could even stop Yoo
Joonghyuk. "Quickly! There is no hope in Seoul if you die!"

"King of Beauty." Nirvana smiled happily at the sight of Min Jiwon.
"Last time you ran away well but now you seem inspired by my
thoughts!" The two of them had already met.

"You knew you were going to die and realized something? Humans really
have to live in the present. Humanity is all about the present."

Min Jiwon shouted at me, "Go quickly! It is too much for you alone! If you
are with Yoo Sangah-ssi and Jung Heewon-ssi…!"

Nirvana moved before the King of Beauty's words finished. More than a
dozen Hwarang flocked to Nirvana but they weren't a match for him in the
first place. Nirvana touched the forehead of the Hwarang and they
collapsed on the spot. It was the use of Thought Infection.

"U-Uwah, uwahh!"

The Hwarang collapsed and started to scream with pain.

"Life is hell!"
Along with the screams, the shouts of the Salvation members were heard
from the rear.

"Die for the present!"

"Today is the only place where we can live!"

The members recited threats and sprang towards the Hwarang. As I looked
at the Salvation members, Nirvana was already reaching towards the King
of Beauty's forehead. "Don't worry, King of Beauty. I like pretty
existences."

"U-Uhhhh…"

"Thus, I won't kill you."

[The character 'Nirvana Moebius' has used Thought Infection Lv. 9.]

A white aura stretched from Nirvana and started to wriggle around Min
Jiwon. Like tentacles, the aura stems pierced her body.

"Accept your present."

"I don't want to! I don't want to…!"

The hidden desires of the King of Beauty were pouring out thanks to this
aura. Nirvana laughed at her desires.

"You want to go to a luxurious spa while your companions are dying?
Foolish woman."

"N-No. I…"

"You just want to enjoy a splendid life. You still haven't forgotten the
days when you were an actor. Thus, you became a king." Nirvana was
enjoying himself greatly.
"Accept your desires. Admit that you have such sick thoughts while your
companions are dying! That is what a human is. If you deny your desires
then you are nothing."

The king of Beauty's eyes gradually became cloudy. It was a skill that
violently convinced a person of their own desires and forced their time into
the 'present'.

This was the process of joining the 'Salvation Church'. Dammit, Bookmark
was still…

[The Bookmark update has been completed.]

That's it!

[The update has increased the efficiency of the bookmarks by 20%.]

I activated Bookmark.

[The exclusive skill 'Way of the Wind Lv. 9' has been activated!]

I stepped on the wind and flew through the air. The increased bookmark
efficiency raised the level of Way of the Wind.

Okay, then there might be a chance of victory. I swung Blade of Faith
towards the confused Nirvana. Nirvana managed to avoid my blade but it
was a close call.

I raised Min Jiwon. "Are you okay?"

"Ah, ah…"

Nirvana, who retreated, was once again flying towards me. Light flowed
from the mandala into his grip.

I swung the Blade of Faith. Sparks flashed and my hands hurt, but I held on
more than I expected.
Like Yoo Joonghyuk's Transmission, the reincarnator had a similar
Succession skill. It allowed him to inherit skills from his past life. As I
expected, this person focused more on mental abilities and speed than close
combat.

"How can you use Way of the Wind? It can't be…" Nirvana frowned as he
blocked my blade. "Are you the one the 'neutral' guy mentioned?"

"I'm a bit famous?"

"Impertinent fellow!"

Nirvana once again collided with the Blade of Faith. Then a white aura was
emitted from the mandala.

[The character 'Nirvana Moebius' has used Thought Infection Lv. 9.]

It appeared like expected.


"Now die! Accept your fate!"

Nirvana's white aura shot towards me but I didn't avoid it.

"Human beings aren't slaves of desire. They are animals fighting their
desires."

[The exclusive skill, 'Fourth Wall' is activated.]

The white aura digging into me melted away in an instant. I'm sorry but
your thoughts would never eat at me. It was because my 'present' wasn't
here.

[The Fourth Wall has completely invalidated the effects of Thought
Infection.]

I rushed to the astonished Nirvana.
                  Chapter 137: Ep. 27 - Unreadable, I


Nirvana was astonished by his mental attack bouncing off the Fourth Wall
and then he was hit by the Purest Sword Force.

"What the hell is this…?"

"I didn't do anything. It is the power of the story."

"What?"

I didn't believe in the doctrines of the Salvation Church but there was one
thing I agreed with. "You said that strength and weakness is determined by
the story."

A high health warrior would just be food to a magician if they didn't have
any magic defense skills. Strength and weaknesses were determined by the
history of the characters.
"It is your fault that you didn't get any close combat skills in this life. All
because you wanted to aim at Yoo Joonghyuk's weakness."

I never thought things would be resolved this way. Something influenced
Nirvana's growth path and he became the counter for Yoo Joonghyuk.
However, since Nirvana became Yoo Joonghyuk's counter, he could never
win against me.

Nirvana's eyes shook as he read something in my tone. He stared at me
quietly and said, "I know your name. Kim Dokja."

"We are talking about names? Okay, Nirvana Moebius. Do you want to
have a heart to heart talk?"

The light of the mandala turned off. A reincarnator wasn't a reincarnator for
nothing. As if a switch was turned on, the agitated Nirvana disappeared and
the Nirvana who regained his composure was in front of me.

"Some nebulae warned me to be careful of you. Of course, I didn't know
what to expect."

Some nebulae… I was certainly drawing attention.

Nirvana asked me, "How did you get such a strong mental barrier? The
only person who hasn't been infected with my thoughts until now was Anna
Croft."

I smiled bitterly at the familiar name. That woman had already touched the
reincarnator. It wasn't strange. Anna Croft would've already started
contacting the strongest players in the world. In order to save the world,
that woman would even sell souls to the devil.

Nirvana read something in my face and said, "You… know the prophet.
What the hell are you? Are you a regressor? Or…"
[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' is interested in the story.]

[The constellation 'Secretive Plotter' is quietly contemplating the

situation.]

The information filtering should've gradually started being removed.
Information about regressors and reincarnators would start to enter the ears
of the constellations. I'm sure those of the great nebulae should already
know about it.

Nirvana looked at me and kept talking. "This is an interesting rebirth. I have
lived for over a hundred years yet I am curious about you…"

"You talk too much. It will be hard for you to get Yoo Joonghyuk in the
future."

"Ahaha! I will accept you as a follower."

[A constellation who recites the Buddhist scriptures is wondering about
you.]

It was a proposal I would've readily accepted earlier. However… "I
respectfully decline. Among those who are supporting me, there is one who
hates your sponsor."

[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' reveals hostility to
Nirvana Moebius's sponsor.]

Nirvana's mouth slightly opened. "The monkey king? Why is he chasing
you?"

"I don't know."

"…I have become even more curious. Come under me along with Yoo
Joonghyuk."
"I don't want to."

"Aren't you curious about the secrets of this world? I can help you survive
even after the end of this world. It has nothing to do with the failure of the
scenarios."

The words were persuasive. If I wasn't a 'reader' then I might've accepted it.

"I'll allow you to become one with me!"

Behind Nirvana's back, the mandala started to shine again. Hundreds of
faces appeared on the slowly rotating mandala. The pained faces screamed.
All of them were 'one' with Nirvana.

I exclaimed, "Shut up you pervert."

"If you don't agree then I'll have to force you."

Nirvana's face was still relaxed despite the unfavourable situation. In any
case, the opponent was a reincarnator. He had lived countless lives and had
a much better combat sense than me. As time passed, my movements would
start to be read by him and I would fall into a disadvantage.

If so, the answer was to win the fight before that happened. A white energy
swirled around the mandala. I didn't hesitate and rushed towards the
mandala.

[The exclusive skill 'Miniaturization Lv. 1 is activated!]

[The effect of Miniaturization will decrease the size of your body.]

My body became very small and the blow from the mandala missed.
Nirvana laughed. "…What is this petty trick?" Was it really a petty trick?

[Due to the effects of Miniaturization, all your equipment will be
transformed to fit your size.]
[The skill level is low and the duration is shortened.]

[The duration of Miniaturization is two minutes.]

This was why I chose Miniaturization over all the other good skills. It was
because only Miniaturization could make me the most powerful person I
knew.

"I will choose the fifth bookmark, Kyrgios Rodgraim."

[Your current body configuration is similar to the physical makeup of the
character.]

[The level of the character is too high to fully reproduce the skill level.

[The level of the skill being activated is forcibly adjusted.]

The white lightning energy swelled and nestled in my heart. It was the
power to break the sky and cause thunder. Beyond the mighty lightning, I
could see Nirvana's pale face.

I wondered, "Do you still see this as a petty trick?"

No matter how strong Nirvana was, he couldn't surpass Kyrgios's power at
this moment.

[The exclusive skill 'Electrification Lv. 10' is activated.]

Intense lightning appeared all over my body and clouds of lightning started
to gather at my fists. If I couldn't take advantage of the reincarnator then it
was better to get rid of him here.

I stretched out my fist towards Nirvana. "Pray to be born human again."

The lightning storm exploded towards Nirvana's side. Nirvana screamed
terribly and I heard the incarnations shouting. The level of Miniaturization
was low so there wasn't as much power compared to when I dealt with
Orochi, but it was still tremendous damage.

A cloud of dust appeared and Nirvana was blown away with a large hole in
his side.

…He was alive? How could that be?

"Kieeeeeeek!"

Blood poured from his mouth. It seemed to be a serious blow but I wasn't
satisfied. It was strange. He couldn't survive this attack, even if he was a
reincarnator.

Then I could see lotus petals growing on his body. I thought I knew what
was going on. I thought this stigma wasn't possible because of the
probability? This bastard, don't tell me?

"Using my memories in a mere place like this…"

A grim voice was heard. I looked at the sparks around the petals and knew
how he had survived.

[Story Payment.]

He borrowed the power of his sponsor in exchange for his story.

"…I will see you again."

His body was covered in a large lotus leaf. I rushed towards him. My fist hit
his chest but Nirvana was laughing with a distorted face.

"You will pay for going against the 'present'. It will be in the most terrible
manner."
Starting from the center of the chest that I hit, his body started turning into
lotus leaves. I stretched out my hand and tried to grab onto the left arm of
the disappearing person.

"Just wait!"

The next moment, Nirvana disappeared, leaving only his torn off left arm
and flying lotus leaves.

[The character 'Nirvana Moebius' has used the stigma Non-possession Lv.
7.]

Non-possession. It was a stigma where he abandoned some of his memories
in exchange for escaping from danger. He paid using the memories of his
reincarnations and escaped me.

"L-Leader!"

"Leader-nim! Where did you go?"

The Salvation members were collapsing. Some were already running away.
Others saw their leader being defeated by me and the mental shock was
huge.

I sighed as I watched the Salvation members retreating. Smoke emerged
from my body and Miniaturization and Bookmark were released at the
same time. My overworked muscles were crying out in pain. I didn't
manage to kill Nirvana but there were some harvests.

[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' can't hide his joy at
your victory.]

[10,000 coins have been sponsored.]

The incarnations who saw my victory looked at each other incredulously.

"The Salvation leader lost!"
"Who is that incarnation?"

"Wait a minute, that face, that…!"

Someone pointing me and shouted, "The ugliest king!"

I ignored them and found Yoo Joonghyuk. Yoo Joonghyuk was released
from his paralysis and could be seen stumbling in the distance. This sunfish
bastard, he didn't help when it was important.

"Hey, are you okay?"

Yoo Joonghyuk held his head like he had a headache and asked, "The
reincarnator?"

"He fled."

"Pathetic. Did you miss him?"

"Do you have the right to say something like that?"

Yoo Joonghyuk's expression was serious. "We have to quickly chase him.
His purpose isn't to clear the scenario."

"I know that."

"If you know then how could you let him leave? If you don't catch the
reincarnator before the 10th scenario ends, Seoul will…"

[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' belatedly regained her spirit.]

[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' wants to explain why she
came here.]

At Uriel's words, Yoo Joonghyuk and I looked up at the air simultaneously.

[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' needs your help.]
It was difficult to grasp the exact context due to the limitations of the
indirect messages but it wasn't difficult to guess what happened.

Uriel was Jung Heewon's sponsor. Uriel, who was supposed to be with Jung
Heewon, came all the way here and contact with Jung Heewon was broken.
This meant…

"Min Jiwon-ssi. Do you know where Jung Heewon-ssi is?"

However, Min Jiwon was still unconscious. This wouldn't work.

"Yoo Joonghyuk, defend me."

"What?"

I immediately closed my eyes and focused. I had become quite familiar
with it after all the practice while sleeping. There was the feeling of my
body sinking to the ground and darkness was everywhere.

I felt a shallow sleep and immediately used Omniscient Reader's
Viewpoint. I needed to find a voice. I was looking for a voice.

However, the voice was missing. I became increasingly uneasy. I told them
to think about me when something happened… was there a problem.
'Dokja-ssi'.

For the first time, someone called me. My vision distorted and Third
Person's Viewpoint was triggered. I groaned at what I saw on the screen.

「 Hwaruruk! 」

The entire screen filled with white flames. It was the stigma of judgement
that burned everything in the world. I didn't have to ask. This was definitely
Jung Heewon's Hell Flames Ignition.
It was fortunate. Jung Heewon was still alive. By the way… it was strange.
This wasn't Jung Heewon's viewpoint? After a while, I saw the lotus patten
shin on Jung Heewon's forehead within the flames.

…Damn, Nirvana already got to her. Well, Yoo Joonghyuk was hit by it. It
would be weird if Jung Heewon wasn't affected. However, a question still
remained. Who called me?

「 Jung Heewon-ssi?" 」

It was an unsophisticated soldier's voice. It was Lee Hyunsung.

「 Kukukuku! 」

There was a loud sound and the screen vibrated. The surrounding
incarnations were blown away. Everywhere touched by the flames started
burning. It was a location where I couldn't help immediately.

In any case, there would definitely be consequences. Jung Heewon was
affected by Thought Infection and wouldn't hesitate. The innocent Lee
Hyunsung was helplessly exposed in front of her blade.

Damn, what should I do?

"Cough!"

Suddenly, the darkness burst and the screen was broken. I opened my eyes
with a strong sense of nausea and saw Yoo Joonghyuk's angry expression.

"Why are you going to sleep now?"

Saliva ran down my mouth and I felt incredibly sick. That jerk, did he hit
me to wake me up?

…Wait a minute, hit? I gained sudden enlightenment. Yes, this was it. I
hated it but it couldn't be helped.
I spoke to Yoo Joonghyuk. "Hey, hit me one more time. A really strong
one."

"…What?"

They were misleading words. Then I had to say it again. "No, kill me now."
                Chapter 138: Ep. 27 - Unreadable, II


Everyone had a few words that influenced them. Lee Hyunsung had
something like this. For example, when Lee Hyunsung was a
undergraduate, these were the words he heard the most from his teacher.

'Everyone, be creative!'

'Think about what other people can't!'

'You must be able break out of this place!'

At the time, Lee Hyunsung had thought, 'So how do I do that?'

The demands of society were sudden for Lee Hyunsung who had been used
to going to school, eating meals and then going to sleep since childhood.

So far, he had been told how to move and now he was forced to do
something he had never done before?
What was creativity? What was thinking about an idea that other people
couldn't think of? Why did it suddenly become a world where he had to do
something like this? Then what had he been doing so far?

Lee Hyunsung wandered all throughout university and then he naturally
joined the army.

'I think you have a natural constitution to be a soldier. Please apply to be a
senior officer'.

If he hadn't heard the administrator's words at that time, what would his life
be like now? It was impossible to know.

There was nothing he knew about the future he hadn't chosen. In any case,
he was a soldier and he lived without regretting his choice. For a person
who found society difficult, the army was relatively comfortable.

The administrator congratulated Lee Hyunsung for passing the senior
officer's test and said,

'Ensign Lee. If you're not sure then just follow what the manual says. Then
at least people won't hold you responsible'.

He heard these words instead of the toast. The memory was as clear as the
lunch he ate a week ago. However, if he could meet the administrator again
then he would ask one thing.

'Administrator, what should I do now?' Lee Hyunsung looked at the
incoming sea of hell flames and bit his lips. 'I have no manual for cases like
this'.

He thought it would be easier for him to call out the military creed as Lee
Hyunsung shouted, "Jung Heewon-ssi! Please regain your mind! Please!"

Just as the service creed couldn't move the hearts of the soldiers, his voice
didn't reach Jung Heewon.
Hwaruruk!

He narrowly hid behind a building as the hell flames covered the ground
and the incarnations burned painfully.

"Kuaaack!"

"Help me!"

Lee Hyunsung couldn't save any of them. He looked at the deaths
happening in front of his eyes and once again realized that the 'justice'
sleeping inside him was just a manual.

Jung Heewon's figure was approaching through the hazy heat.

[The constellation 'Master of Steel' is looking at you.]

Lee Hyunsung received that silent gaze and bit his lips.

'Dokja-ssi. What should I do?'

Should he fight? Could he stop her?

Lee Hyunsung looked at the incoming Jung Heewon and his fists shook.
Lee Hyunsung had no idea what this shaking meant, why he hesitated and
why he couldn't run away from this place.

Maybe it wasn't the world that was hard. The difficult thing was Lee
Hyunsung himself.

'Dokja-ssi, please let me know the answer!'

Despite knowing it wasn't possible, Lee Hyunsung prayed like a reservist
desperately hoping the training would be cancelled due to the weather.
Then amazingly, he heard the voice he had been waiting for.

–Lee Hyunsung-ssi.
He thought it was a joke.

–Can you hear me?

However, it wasn't a joke. He looked around but there was no source for the
voice. In other words, the voice was heard in his head.

"Dokja-ssi!"

Was this the enemy's trap? Still, he was willing to believe it even if it was
the enemy's trick.

–Let's start thinking while running away. There are two ways.

Lee Hyunsung instinctively rose and ran. It wasn't a trap. There was only
one person who would speak like this.

Jung Heewon was chasing behind him but he wasn't afraid anymore. His
breathing stabilized and he was ready to accept new commands. His
muscles started to tense as his breathing became heavy.

–One method is to kill Jung Heewon.

"…It is a familiar choice."

Kim Dokja had always been this way. It had been like this since the first
time they met. He always released the safest and most brutal solution first.
The party members themselves rejected it.

"The second method is to keep running away like this?" –

…That's right.

"Then we will do it the third way."
Kim Dokja's solution was always the third answer. He was a person who
always thought of the third situation. That was who Kim Dokja was. Thus,
Lee Hyunsung believed in him.

However…

–Lee Hyunsung-ssi. This time there was no third method.


Of course, I had a third method. I just had to wait for the right time.

[Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint stage 3 is activated.]

['1st person supporting role viewpoint' is currently incomplete.]

Jung Heewon was using Hell Flames Ignition. It was terrible even if the
opponent was bad. Well, who would be different?

"…Why are you always like this?" Lee Hyunsung cried out while breathing
harshly. The 1st person viewpoint meant I could feel the heat of the hell
flames.

Jung Heewon swung her sword like she intended to turn all of Seoul into a
sea of fire. In fact, strictly speaking, the first and second methods I
presented would have the same results.

Lee Hyunsung had to either kill Jung Heewon or flee. If he left, Jung
Heewon would run out of magic power and die. In other words, one of
them would die. This was the damn 'Nirvana' scenario.

"Kill Heewon-ssi? You came to give me that advice?"

Jung Heewon was approaching. It was different when they were allies but
now I knew for sure after she became an enemy.
The Judge of Destruction, Jung Heewon was strong. Even if she didn't use
Hour of Judgement, she was the owner of Demon Slaying. In addition,
there was Uriel's stigma Hell Flames Ignition.

She was one of the strongest members of my party. It was almost
impossible to suppress the berserk Jung Heewon without killing her.

"I can't accept this method."

What the hell was this courage? Lee Hyunsung started running towards
Jung Heewon.

–Wait a minute, Lee Hyunsung-ssi!

"Jung Heewon-ssi! Wake up!"

Lee Hyunsung kept running towards Jung Heewon. He rushed as if he was
angry for believing in me, the country and the manual. Lee Hyunsung's
Great Mountain Push and Jung Heewon's Hell Flames Ignition clashed.

However, the palms that could push a mountain found it hard to break
through the archangel's flames. His right arm soon started to melt from the
pure white light.

"Jung Heewon-ssi!"

Lee Hyunsung let out a pained and depressed cry. Lee Hyunsung lost his
right arm and reached out with his left arm. I cried out urgently,

–Lee Hyunsung-ssi, if you run away then at least one of you can live.

"I don't want to."

–Nobody will blame you if you run away.

"I don't want to!"
–Don't you think of me as a manual? Then please listen to me!

"I don't believe in such a manual!" Lee Hyunsung's answer was unexpected.
At the same time, it was Lee Hyunsung's answer.

Everyone was contradictory. The person who followed the manual actually
hated the manual more than anyone else. He was a creative person who
were more subordinate to the system than anyone else. It was when he
broke through this contradiction that his story would begin.

"I can't give up, even if the results aren't good! It doesn't matter if I die
here!"

No matter how durable Lee Hyunsung was, it was unreasonable for him to
resist Hell Flames Ignition that melted even Shin Yoosung. His left arm and
then his right leg started to melt.

Nevertheless, Lee Hyunsung resisted. Like a moth towards the flames, he
tried to reach Jung Heewon. He staggered as his right knee disappeared and
I told him,

–I see. You did well.

Lee Hyunsung didn't answer. I smiled bitterly.

–This is the third method.

The third method wasn't something I could tell him. It was up to Lee
Hyunsung to decide for himself. I wasn't even convinced that it would
work.
Even so, I chose this path because I found the sad feelings that occurred in
Lee Hyunsung's mind the moment he saw Jung Heewon.

–You found the path yourself, without the manual.
Lee Hyunsung laughed as he collapsed in the flames. "Dokja-ssi, thank
you."

I could feel the ecstasy that occurred in Lee Hyunsung's body. It was an
emotion that humans reached when they broke through the contradiction
and received an answer from death.

Perhaps this sensation was the reality that Nirvana wanted to reach. It
would've been wonderful if Nirvana could see this. Jung Heewon was the
one infected but it was Lee Hyunsung who lived in the present more than
anyone else.

–Thank you. It is starting now.

This was the beginning of the story. It was up to the audience to determine
the continuation of this story. There was one being watching Lee Hyunsung
with more delicate eyes than anyone else.

–Master of Steel. One of the most steadfast beings in the Star Stream.

I spoke slowly.

–When are you going to act?

[The constellation 'Master of Steel' is listening to your words.]

The constellation 'Master of Steel'. The master of Orichalcum, the hardest
planet in the universe and the sponsor of Steel Sword Lee Hyunsung. I cut
to the chase.

–Give your incarnation a chance.

[The constellation 'Master of Steel' is silent.]

–I know your fears. You must be afraid of the probability.

[The constellation 'Master of Steel' has closed his eyes.]
–But when are you going to notice the nebulae around you? Are you going
to be daydreaming until the end of the scenario?

Lee Hyunsung had done enough. Now it was up to his sponsor.

[The constellation 'Master of Steel' acknowledges the courage of the
incarnation 'Lee Hyunsung'.]

[The constellation 'Master of Steel' says it isn't time yet.]

I had expected it. In fact, Lee Hyunsung was still too weak for the
awakening.

[The constellation 'Master of Steel' thinks that the incarnation 'Lee
Hyunsung' won't be able to handle his narrative.]

The narrative of steel was hard and heavy. Lee Hyunsung wouldn't be able
to withstand it. Of course, if he was alone.

–I'll bear it with him.

[The constellation 'Master of Steel' is looking at you.]

The Master of Steel seemed to be thinking of something. A moment later, a
message was heard.

[The constellation 'Maritime War God' has nodded.]

Then sparks filled the vicinity.

[The character 'Lee Hyunsung' is preparing for his attribute evolution.]

[A narrative is required in order to evolve the attribute.]

[The constellation 'Master of Steel' is putting the narrative to the test.]

[The narrative 'Proof of Steel' has begun!]
A torrent of silver light rose from Lee Hyunsung's body. I looked at the
brilliant light and was reminded of a scene from Ways of Survival.

Who was it? A character asked Yoo Joonghyuk a question.

「 "Why is Lee Hyunsung called the Steel Sword? Ahjussi doesn't use a
sword." 」

Lee Hyunsung never used a sword at all in the original Ways of Survival.
Even so, Lee Hyunsung's nickname was Steel Sword.

「 "Lee Hyunsung doesn't need a sword." 」

Steel started to grow from the melted arms and leg of Lee Hyunsung. Like
scales, the steel grew to cover his whole body. Lee Hyunsung's body
changed into one big sword.

[The character 'Lee Hyunsung' has activated the stigma 'Steel
Transformation'.

A single sword that wouldn't break before any trial. If Yoo Joonghyuk
was here then he would've said it clearly. 「 "That guy, he is the sword."
」
                Chapter 139: Ep. 27 - Unreadable, III


The new layer of skin was made of steel. Lee Hyunsung's body was being
reshaped, as if he was another species.

Steel Transformation.

Only the first stage 'Armour' was activated but this alone wasn't the usual
power. Lee Hyunsung who mastered stage one was harder than Gong
Pildu's armed fortress and wouldn't die even after being hit by Yoo
Joonghyuk's Splitting the Sky Sword.

"Li…live…"

The problem was that stage one wasn't fully activated yet.

–This is the real stigma that Lee Hyunsung-ssi needs to learn.
Lee Hyunsung realized the situation and quickly retreated.

[The Steel Transformation isn't yet complete.]

[The stigma can only be used by those who have achieved a story.]

All sponsors gave a stigma to their incarnations. There were stigmas in the
form of gifts and some that could only be used under difficult conditions.

Steel Transformation of the Master of Steel was one of the difficult stigmas.

[The story 'Proof of Steel' has begun!]

It was because this stigma required the indirect 'proof' of what the
constellation had experienced.


  [Proof of Steel]

  1. 「 True steel is born in tens of thousands of quenches.」


It was an unkind sentence thrown into the scenario. Lee Hyunsung seemed
confused. "What does this mean?"

–The basis of quenching is cooling after a high heat treatment.

"Don't tell me…"

–It seems right. Please keep your mind straight.

In a sense, it might be fortunate that Jung Heewon was Lee Hyunsung's
opponent. Lee Hyunsung turned pale.

[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' is interested in the
story of this world.]
[The constellation 'Defense Master' wonders how his strength compares.]

[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' has both hands clasped
together in a nervous manner.]

The blazing hellfire turned blue along with the messages of the
constellations. Maybe Jung Heewon's Hell Flames Ignition had increased a
level because the flames became deeper and fiercer.

The asphalt mixed with impurities melted from the pure white flames and
the high heat turned them into a deadly weapon.

The silver armour instantly started to melt and the scattered foreign
materials penetrated the armour like bullets, damaging Lee Hyunsung's
insides. New steel grew from the melted areas but it wasn't without damage.

"Kuk…!"

Blood emerged from Lee Hyunsung's mouth.

He would've been able to resist Hell Flames Ignition if his Steel
Transformation was perfect, but it wasn't yet. In any case, Hell Flames
Ignition was the highest level stigma belonging to the fire property. It was
amazing that he didn't just collapse.

Lee Hyunsung took one step back and screamed. I was pained to see this
scene but it wasn't yet time. Lee Hyunsung's steel was burning red. A bit
more, a bit more…

[The temperature has exceeded the standard value!]

That's it.

[The quenching has begun.]
The base of steel was quenching. The heart of this story was to burn in a
high temperature above the standard until the body became made of perfect
steel.

–Hold on! You can do it!

Fortunately, Lee Hyunsung wasn't 'evil'.

Hell Flames Ignition was a stigma with the 'fire' and 'divine' properties. If
Lee Hyunsung was 'evil' then he would've already been turned into a pile of
ashes from Hell Flames Ignition.

As Lee Hyunsung was enduring, I quickly looked at the information of
Jung Heewon.

[The character 'Jung Heewon' is currently suffering from 'Thought
Infection.]

[The character 'Jung Heewon' is in a lost state.]

[The trauma of the character 'Jung Heewon' is completely open.]

…

…That bastard, he completely made a mess of a human's mind.

「 I can't forgive them… 」

Nirvana's Thought Infection pulled all the dark parts of a person's mind to
the surface in order to settle their time in the present.

「 I should kill them. 」

Humans who faced the reality of a cliff where the future had disappeared
usually lose hope. This was especially true when the reality was terrible.
In the process, someone would feel despair and collapse while someone
else would turn into a beast and release relentless desires.

Some resisted angrily and lose their sense of reason. Once this resignation
was repeated, they would find a 'savior' to comfort themselves. They would
martyr themselves for this saviour, sacrificing their humble lives before the
great 'present'.

「 Kil all the men. 」

I seemed to know what her trauma was. Jung Heewon's initial attribute of
'crouching' was based on a strong psychological shock. Looking back on
the first moment I found her, it wasn't unusual for her to have a strong
hostility towards 'men'.

"This… is this Heewon-ssi's heart?" Lee Hyunsung asked from amidst the
blazing flames.

–Can you hear her?

"That, a bit…"

I never thought that Lee Hyunsung would be able to hear the messages of
'Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint'. Was it because I was immersed in the
first person viewpoint? Did Lee Hyunsung feel my emotions as much as I
understood Lee Hyunsung?

Lee Hyunsung spoke like he had forgotten the heat. "This is Dokja-ssi's
ability?"

–Yes. It is my skill.

I had to confess because there was nothing good about lying here.

–I apologize for hiding it until now.
However, Lee Hyunsung didn't seem upset. "I'm a bit embarrassed. My
heart…"

The second wave came before he could finish. The intense heat melted the
incarnations in the surroundings and the area was filled with lava.

The entire ground melted from the powerful heat. The buildings sank with
the ground. Now I had to make a decision.

–You should head in the direction of suppression.

"Won't I hurt Heewon-ssi?"

Lee Hyunsung was at the disadvantage but he was worrying about the other
person. Still, Lee Hyunsung's words weren't wrong.

–Her heart is hurt.

The most obvious solution was to kill Nirvana or resolve Jung Heewon's
trauma. The former was impossible now and the latter…

I wouldn't have been so worried if Jung Heewon was a character with a big
role in the original novel.

Jung Heewon was a newly discovered person and I didn't know her well.
The only thing I could do was take care of the symptoms, not the cause.

"Dokja-ssi." –

Let's try it.

We nodded as one body. We were too far from Jung Heewon now, because
she had stepped back a bit. We had to be close to her to try this method.

The skin of steel grew to cover Lee Hyunsung's face. The muscles all over
Lee Hyunsung's body were twitching. He was like a silver knight as the
steel properly covered his body. The silver knight started to run through the
flames.

In accordance with this, the wall of flames became higher. It was a warning
not to come closer. He wasn't allowed here.

"Uwooooh!"

Lee Hyunsung acted like it was training and ran straight through the flames.
He was burned again and again. Steel pieces melted and fell to the ground.
His eyes were becoming blurred from the heat.

"Heewon-ssi! We will save you!"

It was one step.


"We… are…!"

Once again, another step.

"Heewon-ssi!"

I watched Lee Hyunsung and had a thought. I had forgotten for a while
because I could hear the hearts of other people. Originally, reaching a
person's heart was a difficult and painful thing.

Lee Hyunsung and I clearly saw the world from the same eyes but we didn't
see the same thing. Lee Hyunsung's heart bursting with emotions was proof
of this.

It was a strange feeling. Originally, it wasn't supposed to be like this. The
story changed thanks to me.

"Uhhh… kuoooh!" Lee Hyunsung's knees collapsed when there were ten
steps left.
[The character 'Lee Hyunsung' has reached the limits of his mental state.]

I was awakened by my shaking vision. Even if the story changed, this was
still Ways of Survival.

[The constellation 'Master of Steel' is looking at his incarnation with sad
eyes.]

All characters struggled in utter despair. This was Ways of Survival.

–Hyunsung-ssi.

Still, I was sometimes curious when reading Ways of Survival. Had the
author of Ways of Survival regretted the 'ending' that he created?

–Leave it to me for a moment.

[The exclusive skill, 'Fourth Wall' is shaking!]

[The '1st person supporting role viewpoint' is extremely active.]

Lee Hyunsung's consciousness was shaken and my consciousness entered.
Control of his body was transferred and the senses of the entire body were
strongly activated.

Lee Hyunsung was suffering from this pain. It was enough to make him
crazy. The whole body burned in the flames and the melted bone joints and
tendons made it feel like my limbs were cut off.

I used Lee Hyunsung's voice and shouted at Jung Heewon. "Jung
Heewonssi! You will die if this continues!"

There was no response from Jung Heewon. She just kept emitting the
hellish flames.

"Lee Hyunsung will die! Do you want to kill Lee Hyunsung-ssi?"
I raised Lee Hyunsung's legs with all my strength and moved forward a bit.
One step, two steps, and… Shit, it was too hot.

I heard a voice as my knees bent from the pain. 'Dokja-ssi. I'll do it'.

It was Lee Hyunsung's voice.

'I must do it'.

[The will of steel has responded!]

I nodded. After all, I was a 'reader'. I must not forget my duty. My
consciousness left and Lee Hyunsung regained his body again. Lee
Hyunsung's body was regaining a perfect steel shape.

"Heewon-ssi."

The blazing hellfire made her face blue. This fire would eventually gnaw at
her. Her tears dried as soon as they fell down.

Lee Hyunsung acted unexpectedly towards her. "Excuse me for a moment."
Lee Hyunsung took the last step and embraced Jung Heewon.

[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' is embarrassed by the
unexpected love between companions.]

Jung Heewon's small body entered Lee Hyunsung's wide arms. It was so
wide that he could touch his fingertips together without touching her.
Rather than avoiding it, Jung Heewon made her flames stronger. It was like
the flames were all she could do with her emotions.

There was a rattling sound and walls of steel started to be created around
Lee Hyunsung's arms. It was a wall that would free one person from the
world. In order to remove flames, the oxygen must be shut off.

Lee Hyunsung knew this and sacrificed himself to become the wall for her.
He would bear her wrath on behalf of the world.
All I could do was watch the two of them. I hoped that Lee Hyunsung could
reach the heart of Jung Heewon who couldn't speak.

How much time passed?

[The story 'Proof of Steel' has been completed.]

Finally, Jung Heewon's flames died down.




It was a familiar female voice that woke Lee Hyunsung up.

"I'm choking…"

He looked down and saw Jung Heewon's face. He looked around and it was
an unimaginable sight. The steel that grew out from his body covered Jung
Heewon while blocking the surrounding area.

"U-Uhh! I-I'm really sorry! I will release you now!"

Maybe it was because the melted steel wall had hardened but the steel
wall wasn't easily released. As Lee Hyunsung was feeling confused, Jung
Heewon's forehead touched Lee Hyunsung's chest. "Thank you." Lee
Hyunsung shook his head at the soft touch to the steel.

"…No."

It was a very small gesture but it was enough. His heart had clearly been
delivered.

[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' hates this companionship.]

"By the way Hyunsung-ssi, who else was here?"
"Huh? That…"

Jung Heewon looked grumpy at Lee Hyunsung's confusion. "It's okay. It
isn't important. Rather, release this quickly. There is no time."

"…Huh? Did something happen?"

Jung Heewon glanced at Lee Hyunsung but shouted in a loud voice towards
the sky. "Kim Dokja-ssi, are you listening right now? Yoo Sangah-ssi is in
danger."




               Chapter 140: Ep. 27 - Unreadable, IV


[Your body has woken up due to a powerful shock.]

[Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint stage 3 has been turned off.]

My senses gradually returned as my consciousness settled into my flesh. By
the way, something was strange.
…Why didn't I see the resurrection message?

[You can't be rewarded for 'Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint' stage three
because of the unstable connection of 1st person supporting role
viewpoint.]

As I was feeling surprised by this unexpected message, I slowly felt the
pain and weight of my flesh. There was something wrong.

I saw Yoo Joonghyuk who was staring at me. Shit, I was almost surprised
to death.

"Kim Dokja, are you dead?"

I thought I knew a bit about what was going on. I knew why the
resurrection message didn't come up and why there wasn't compensation for
Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint stage three. I never died in the first place.

"Kim Dokja."

I was just hit really hard. Damn bastard, why didn't he kill me? This jerk,
not killing me when I wanted to be killed…

「 …Should I have just killed him in the beginning? 」

I heard an unexpected thought and shut my mouth. Omniscient Reader's
Viewpoint had automatically activated. Yoo Joonghyuk's thoughts poured
in like a waterfall.

「 Everything is twisted because of this person. 」

「 It is different from what I know in the earlier regressions. The amount
of information available is too limited. I can't save the world like this. 」
What was this?
「 The reason I was hurt by the Salvation Church was because I spent too
much time in the last round. It was a mistake to train for 100 years then. My
mind was permanently damaged. 」

「 Maybe it was a mistake not to get the Absolute Throne. 」

「 I will start from the beginning again… 」

Dammit, the regressor's depression had begun. Was it due to the mental
attack? I cried out in fear of what he would decide. "I'm hurt you jerk!"

Yoo Joonghyuk looked over at my provocation and spoke in a subdued
voice. "…You are the one who wanted me to kill you. Is the matter
resolved?"

"Roughly. The urgent fire has been put out."

Yoo Joonghyuk's expression didn't look bright so I touched my pained
stomach and told him some of what I learned.

I told him about how Lee Hyunsung saved Jung Heewon. Of course, I didn't
mention that I watched from the 'Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint'.

I usually would've added on a lame story but the half-hearted Yoo
Joonghyuk nodded with a gloomy expression. "That is what happened.
Then what are you going to do now?"

"I haven't decided yet but the situation is very optimistic."

"The woman called Yoo Sangah is important to you so you must be
desperate to find her first. Was she caught by the Salvation leader?"

"Maybe. In any case, I am hopeful about the situation."

"…What is so hopeful about it?"

"Joonghyuk-ah, we can save the world. You know that, right?"
Yoo Joonghyuk stared at me. "What are you talking about?"

I thought I was being too obvious so I added an excuse. "Well, it is like this.
If my guess is correct, Nirvana wouldn't have touched Yoo Sangah. If he is
the Nirvana I know."

"…Do you know the reincarnator?"

Yoo Joonghyuk's eyes narrowed. Min Jiwon, who hadn't wanted to disturb
us, finally interrupted. She had a startled expression on her face as she said,

"The two of you are quite familiar with each other."

"I'm a friendly person. By the way, are you okay?"

"…Thanks to you. I almost joined the Salvation Church."

Min Jiwon trembled because the encounter with Nirvana left a deep trauma.
Unfortunately, I didn't have time to consider her situation.

"King of Beauty, I think I need some help."




I started to collect the scattered people using the King of Beauty's Hwarang.

The urgent task was to prevent further damage from Nirvan's Thought
Infection. In particular, it would be disastrous if Lee Jihye was infected
with strange ideas. Then the ghost fleet on Han River would turn Seoul into
a wreckage.

Fortunately, Lee Gilyoung and Shin Yoosung were in close proximity with
each other and it wasn't difficult to find Gong Pildu who had occupied a
building. He complained, "I wanted to stay in that land."
"Peace land?"

"Dammit…"

Gong Pildu seemed sorry that the previous scenario was over. Well, Gong
Pildu was a king there. Han Sooyoung used to be a goddess so I wondered
how she felt now.

"Honourable Supreme King! Please accept me!"

"I respect you!"

The flattering words that were difficult to hear came from the new
incarnations who entered the scenario. The rumour that we returned from
Peace Land had spread. I looked to the side and saw the frowning Yoo
Joonghyuk.

「 Those people can't save the world, even with 100 trucks. 」

「 Once again, the answer is regression… 」

"Now now, our Supreme King isn't in a good mood right now so back off.
Do you want to die?" I personally stepped forward to get rid of any causes
of depression.

The new incarnations glared at me like fans kicked out by a celebrity's
manager.

"Who is this bastard?"

"He is the Ugliest King."

These scum. I was going to say something when unexpectedly, Yoo
Joonghyuk opened his mouth.

"If you want to join me, become a person who can help me."
Unlike usual, there was a strong melancholy in his cold voice. They were
insulting words but fans truly were different.

"Shit, so cool… that excellent young and dark voice…"

The incarnations, both male and female, looked entranced.

"So chic! I will become stronger! I will definitely be helpful!"

Why was the world so unfair? By the way, why were they looking for Yoo
Joonghyuk? Had they all forgotten that I was the one who overpowered the
Salvation leader?

At this moment, someone opened his mouth. "Hey, based on what I saw
earlier, the Ugly King is more powerful."

"Eh? Is this real?"

I didn't know if it was real but I was pretty strong.

"Are your eyes in the back of your head? The Supreme King overpowered
him with one hit."

"Is that right?"

My shaking hands became heavier and I noticed that Shin Yoosung and Lee
Gilyoung had grabbed onto my hands.

"I think ahjussi is handsome."

"Hyung, the face isn't everything."

The only one on my side were the kids… no, Shin Yoosung. By the way,
what was with the Ugly King? It seemed to be positioned as my nickname.

I honestly didn't understand. I had never heard the word 'ugly' used towards
me until the fall of the world.
Yoo Joonghyuk was depressed but I was the one who had to suffer.

"The Ugliest King? Ahaha! It fits really well."

I turned my head at the laugh and saw Lee Jihye. Almost all my party
members were gathered except for Jung Heewon and Lee Hyunsung, who
were relatively far away.

Then what should I do now? I had a headache.

At this moment, a loud sound appeared from somewhere and Yoo
Joonghyuk responded first. "…A large monster species. It is 6th grade."

"Is there a scenario in progress here?"

Lee Jihye was right. The seventh scenario 'Monster Hunting' was an event
scenario for incarnations who didn't participate in Peace Land and the new
incarnations.

…Sixth grade monsters were already showing up in the seventh scenario? It
was Min Jiwon who answered the questions I had. "I'm sorry but the
seventh scenario is already over."

"…It isn't in progress right now?"

"You arrived around the time the rewards were given. The situation is
already finished. The Salvation leader received the highest reward."

As expected from the Salvation leader. Speaking of which, the Salvation
Church seemed to have hunted monsters when I first met the leader.

"Then where are these monsters coming from?"

"Be prepared. It isn't just one or two." Yoo Joonghyuk raised the Splitting
the Sky Sword while the other party members also brought out their
weapons.
The 6th grade heavy hounds appeared and broken buildings with huge
paws. At first glance, there were more than ten of them.

"The sixth grade monsters shouldn't move around in groups like this. What
is with these bastards?"

We swung our weapons at the monsters. Lee Jihye used Demon Slaying
while Gong Pildu used Armed Fortress. In addition, there was Yoo
Joonghyuk's Breaking the Sky Sword and Shin Yoosung and Lee
Gilyoung's Diverse Communication. Certainly, our party members were
strong.

We cleared ten 6th grade monsters in an instant but the situation wasn't
resolved.

Gong Pildu shouted, "They're coming again!"

"Everyone, come this way!"

I had to reduce the damage so I evacuated the new incarnations and cut off
the head of the heavy hound with the Blade of Faith. Of course, I didn't
forget to collect the cores of the fallen monsters.

[The constellation 'Secretive Plotter' is wondering about your reasoning.]
However, there was something uncomfortable. This development didn't
appear in the original third regression of the novel. It didn't appear in the
fourth, fifth… or even the 10th regression.

It felt like I was missing something important. Think. Kim Dokja. When
did this scenario happen?

[Due to the effect of your exclusive attribute, memories from the books
you have read will become stronger.] …Perhaps?

[I wish to inform all incarnations of Seoul Dome.]
Then the message of the dokkaebi came. It wasn't Bihyung but a voice I
was hearing for the first time.

[Aren't you surprised by the monsters suddenly appearing? Sigh… as you
might've expected, the next scenario has started. We also wanted to give
you a break… it is regrettable. This scenario wasn't created by the dokkaebi
but is an automatic scenario.]

[A new main scenario has arrived.]

[Main scenario # 8 - The Strongest Sacrifice has begun.]

It was a different name from the eighth scenario I knew. I opened the
contents of the scenario.


  [Main scenario # 8 - The Strongest Sacrifice]

  Category: Main

  Difficulty: S

  Clear Conditions: Survive the wave of monsters (this scenario requires
  caution because the rank of the monsters rises every four hours).

  Time Limit: ―

  Compensation: ???

  Failure: Death

  * There are additional clear conditions.

  * Hints are provided once every four hours.
[Ah, for your information. It starts from the 6th grade. In four hours, the 5th
grade species will emerge and then four hours after that, it will be 4th
grade. Then four hours later… huhu, well. Don't you know?]

Then one of the incarnations shouted, "What? What is an automatic
scenario?"

"Eh? There isn't a time limit?"

[A time limit? Haha. There is no such thing.]

I knew the words were true. Nirvana appeared and Yoo Joonghyuk's party
was much stronger than the original third regression…

I vaguely guessed what was going on. This development had appeared in
Ways of Survival.

[It is because all of you are too strong. Oh my god, the Korean incarnations
have become so strong that they don't fit the balance anymore. Aren't you
being a bit too greedy? This is a scenario that automatically occurs when
the incarnations of certain domes become too strong.] The Seoul
incarnations were at a loss.

[As mentioned, there are two solutions to this scenario.]

Additional conditions appeared in the air.


  Additional Clear Conditions (Pick 1):

  1. The death of half the incarnations in Seoul Dome.

  * Current number of incarnations (107,624).



The dokkaebi spoke with admiration.
[Hmm, there are still so many people? It is good that it is an even number.]

"Shit! Don't talk nonsense!"

"You are telling us to just die? Dokkaebi scum!"

The dokkaebi smiled and added,

[Please calm down. There is a second condition.]



  Additional Clear Conditions (Pick 1):

  1. The death of the strongest incarnation in Seoul Dome.


I understood.

…The name of this scenario was the 'ultimate sacrifice'.

In other words, even if half of Seoul didn't die, the scenario would end with
the death of the strongest incarnation.

The incarnations shouted excitedly, "The strongest incarnation? What?
Who is that referring to?" "Tell us who it is!"

[Haha, I can't tell you that. Is it any fun if I tell you? Well, he is the
strongest so he would know the best.]

The dokkaebi said,

[Then work hard to find them. Or do you already know? Perhaps the
strongest incarnation is the apostle of justice who will sacrifice themselves
for you. Ah, I'm a bit bored so let me give you a hint. I wish you the
blessing of the story.]
  [Hint 1]

  The tenth strongest incarnation in Seoul Dome is 'Maritime Admiral
  Lee Jihye'.



"Wow, what? Nonsense. I am only 10th?" Lee Jihye grumbled.

However, no one was able to laugh at her. Everyone was busy watching one
person. He was the person I was eavesdropping on right now.

「 Everything is too twisted. 」

「 A scenario I don't know about has appeared. 」

Ah, please. Yoo Joonghyuk…

「 I can't think of a way to fix it. Maybe I should regress… 」

Damn, what would happen to me if he regressed? I absolutely refused to be
swept up in his death without knowing anything. I glared at Yoo Joonghyuk
in front of me and formed a fist.
           Chapter 141: Ep. 28 - The Ultimate Sacrifice, I


30 minutes later, all the 6th grade monsters were cleaned up. My party
members and I were very active, particularly Gong Pildu. It was a
rewarding moment for one of the 10 Evils.

"We can take a break now. What about four hours later?" Lee Jihye
wondered while slipping her sword back into the sheath at her waist.

I looked around and the fighting in the area was also entering a lull. I didn't
know about other areas but at least we protected this one. Of course, not
everyone was safe.

"Father! Please wake up! Father!"

"Somebody help!"

Many incarnations who didn't have the know-how yet couldn't resist the 6th
grade monsters. There were those who suffered severe trauma from the
heavy hound's paws or had their internal organs burst. Most of them were
new incarnations.

[* Current number of incarnations: 90,531 people.]

It was only the first wave and one-tenth of Seoul Dome had died. A little
further away, Yoo Joonghyuk was watching the incarnations. I became a bit
nervous as I watched Yoo Joonghyuk.

The dokkaebi stated that the sacrifice of the strongest incarnation would
save all the incarnations in Seoul Dome.

"Hey, Yoo Joonghyuk."

Yoo Joonghyuk turned to look at me. I didn't know exactly what scenery
held value for Yoo Joonghyuk.

As I said every time, reading Ways of Survival didn't really tell me about
this person. After all, I was only understanding the text, which had been
processed and transmitted to me. Some things couldn't be read because they
were unreadable.

"Let me talk to you for a bit."




We went to the rooftop of a high rise building. On the way, I used

This guy still didn't know who his sponsor was. I already knew why it
wasn't visible.

Even in the original Ways of Survival, Yoo Joonghyuk's sponsor wasn't
revealed in the end. I thought maybe it would show up in the epilogue but
unfortunately, I couldn't read the epilogue of Ways of Survival.

His sponsor was more resistant to the 'probability' than any constellations I
knew. They had the power to turn back the wheels of time while deceiving
other constellation. Until the end of Ways of Survival, the constellation
didn't provide anything other than 'regression' to Yoo Joonghyuk.

I didn't know exactly who they were and what they wanted to gain from
Yoo Joonghyuk.

"…Is there a way to kill Nirvana?"
This jerk, he was always so impatient. He had been given time to rest but he
was still busy thinking. Regardless of his depressed state, Yoo Joonghyuk
was Yoo Joonghyuk.

"Before that, let's take a moment to breath. The view is great." I said while
sitting on the roof railing.

Yoo Joonghyuk asked me, "What are you up to?"

"I'm just looking at the world. Isn't it beautiful?" The city of Seoul was
destroyed by the monsters. I quickly added, "It was originally a beautiful
place."

"I don't like landscapes."

"Why?"

"They are things that will disappear someday."

I thought I had a bit more understanding of the third regression Yoo
Joonghyuk after fighting against Shin Yoosung. I wanted to believe he was
a person who could love this world without giving up or feeling despair.

I told him, "However, we need to protect these things."

"Kim Dokja, you don't know."

This might be my misunderstanding. Yoo Joonghyuk could give up at any
time because he was still in the midst of his regressions.

In the end, Yoo Joonghyuk's purpose was to prevent the 'destruction of this
world'. Paradoxically, he could give up on this world at any time. His
essence was regression and this fact would never change.

"No, I know," I replied.

"What?"
"The fact that you can regress at any time means that death is meaningless."

I looked down at Lee Seolhwa caring for the injured. Lee Seolhwa was
feeding her boiled soup to an unknown person. Despite her efforts, there
was a high probability that the character would die. Even if they lived now,
they would die tomorrow. If they miraculously survived tomorrow, they
would die the day after tomorrow.

It was the same in the fourth regression and the fifth regression. There
would always be 'death' in the world of Yoo Joonghyuk, even after passing
the 100th regression.

"If there is no sense of death then the value of life also disappears."

"What do you know…"

"Yoo Joonghyuk, wake up. Don't think things will improve if you repeat
them a few times."

Yoo Joonghyuk remained silent like he was surprised by my hard words.

"There is a chance that you can do better in the fourth regression. However,
there is also a chance that won't happen. Have you already forgotten the
Theatre Dungeon? If I hadn't appeared at that time―"

"The next regression will obviously be better. There were many unexpected
things in this round so the next round will certainly be better."

"Why? Do you know a lot of the future?"

There was the vague belief that he could do better in the next round with
more information. It was easy for him to give up on this regression if
something went wrong.

This was the precursor symptom of 'regression depression'. Some of the
contents of Ways of Survival passed through my head.
It was around the 48th regression. Yoo Joonghyuk had consulted with an
incarnation of the constellation 'Discoverer of the Subconscious' on the
'regression depression'. At the time, he seemed to be speaking like I was
now.

I continued speaking, "Yes. It might be as you say. If you repeat it 10 or 20
times then it will surely get better. You'll be exposed to more scenarios and
see more of the future. The real problem is when you someday save the
world in this manner."

"What does this mean?"

"At that time, do you really think you saved this world?"

"…"

"Do you think you will be able to keep the same mindset after repeating it
100 or 200 times?"

"I won't regress that many times."

I silently stared at Yoo Joonghyuk.

「 …Don't tell me? 」 Yoo Joonghyuk's eyes slowly widened.

I kept speaking, "Are you having nightmares these days?"

"…"

"You won't be saved, even if you save the world. The moment you save the
world, the worlds you have forsaken will come to you. Despite saving one
world, all the other worlds you abandoned will drag you to hell."

Yoo Joonghyuk's eyes shook. Perhaps it was something he was already
dimly aware of.
"Thus, live this round properly. Shin Yoosung was destroyed after
wandering for countless years. You will be more than that. The more you
repeat the turns, the more out of control you will become. Ask yourself.
How different are you now from the beginning?"

"That…" Yoo Joonghyuk's expression hardened. His eyes were shaking
violently. The Yoo Joonghyuk from the beginning couldn't have done this.

"Don't imagine that you will get better if you throw away this round. Maybe
this is the round where you will see the end of this world as a 'human'."

"…"

Yoo Joonghyuk closed his mouth. He wanted to say something but the
words didn't come out. There was an intense conflict on his face.

Yes, Yoo Joonghyuk. Feel conflicted. What would happen to me if he
regressed?

[The mental state of the character 'Yoo Joonghyuk' is slightly restored.]

I could see a faint light of determination in Yoo Joonghyuk's face. Every
world was goddamn hard. It was the same for this world. Every time you
restart, live with all your strength.

A cool wind blew and we looked down at the ruined city together.

"This scenario has a strong event propensity. The flow will return to the
direction we know. The future you know will be available again. Don't you
still have many hidden pieces that only you know? If Seoul Dome is
somehow liberated…"

At this moment, the door of the rooftop slammed open with a loud sound
and people fell down. The first one who fell down was Gong Pildu and Lee
Jihye and the children were on top of him.
"Waaah! Don't push!"

"Ah, I wonder what they're talking about. Ahjussi, why did you do that?"

"A man shouldn't interfere with a person's conversation."

"A man is a rat…"

…I could roughly guess the situation.

[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire''s eyes are shining.]

"All of of you…" I spoke before Lee Jihye spoke more bullshit. "Don't joke
around today. I'm not in the mood."

[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' is sad.]

It didn't matter if the constellation was sad or not. The important one right
now was Yoo Joonghyuk.

Uriel wasn't giving us coins now so I hoped she would go to Jung Heewon.
Yoo Joonghyuk opened his mouth. "I have been making a plan for this
scenario."

"A plan? What is it?"

Yoo Joonghyuk turned towards me. "This scenario is one where the
strongest incarnation must die. I have been thinking about it."

I suddenly got goosebumps. Why was that bastard looking at me when he
said this?

Lee Jihye spoke with slight excitement. "Oh, we were also talking about
that. How did you decide? Who is the strongest incarnation?"

"Of course it is me."
I looked at the confident Yoo Joonghyuk and realized that my worries were
a misunderstanding. Well, he was a prideful person…

No, wait a minute. The fact that this scenario ended when the
strongest incarnation died and he thought it was himself… "Do you
mean to die?" I asked him.

"I will be able to stop this scenario if I die."

I was a bit moved by his noble mindset. Damn, his regression depression
suddenly seemed a bit cool. However, I couldn't let him actually die.
"Aren't you being too hasty? Is there any guarantee that you are the
strongest? For example, me…"

The party members looked at me at the same time. Lee Jihye hit me on the
shoulder and laughed exaggeratedly. "Hey, are you being serious?"

"Dokja hyung is kinda…" Lee Gilyoung looked at me with pity while Shin
Yoosung was confused. Even Gong Pildu and Min Jiwon were the same.

"There is no need to ask."

"…Isn't the Supreme King still stronger?"

"Wait, didn't ahjussi say that he defeated the Salvation leader?"

Bullseye.

"Is the Salvation leader really that strong if ahjussi could defeat him? I
didn't see it but he must've used a strange trick. No?"

In a sense, it was correct. My mood was somewhat strange as I added an
excuse. "…I was just using myself as an example. The Salvation leader
might be stronger than Yoo Joonghyuk. In fact, I had a pretty hard time
before."
Lee Jihye's eyes widened with surprise. "Master, is this real?'

"…That guy doesn't fit with me." Yoo Joonghyuk's words threw the party
into confusion.

"Then… isn't the Salvation leader the strongest?"

"Oh my god, there is a person stronger than Master?"

"However, what is the criteria for the ranking? Combat power? Or is it the
person who wins in a fight…"

I replied to Min Jiwon's question. "It is possible they are using overall
combat power. In the first place, not everyone can fight each other. There
could be a change after fighting."

"That reminds me, what did the dokkaebi say? He is the strongest so he
would know the most…"

We looked at Yoo Joonghyuk.

"Yoo Joonghyuk, is there something different from usual? Did the dokkaebi
say anything to you?"

Yoo Joonghyuk formed a fist and slowly replied, "…Well, I haven't heard
anything."

I looked around at the party members and said, "I don't think we can
confirm anything."

"Then what should we do?"

"Let's just think that this is a good thing. After all, none of us here want
Yoo Joonghyuk to die. For now, let's make a reasonable judgment that
Nirvana is the strongest and get rid of him."

"If it turns out that the Supreme King is the strongest…"
"We will think about it then."

Min Jiwon told me, "The Salvation Church is in Gangbuk. It isn't easy to
approach because the borders are heavily guarded and there is a huge
difference in force. Even if we all go…"

"We won't go there. We'll make him come to us."

"How? Will he respond? It would just be a loss for him…"

"You are thinking with common sense."

However, Nirvana wasn't a person with common sense.
           Chapter 142: Ep. 28 - The Ultimate Sacrifice, II


The monsters flocked from the outskirts of Seoul. Maybe there was a gate
where they were created and the rating of the monsters would skyrocket in
four hour intervals.

In other words, the time we had was eight hours at the most. I had to lure
Nirvana in to make him confront Yoo Joonghyuk.

"I think I can do it."

I left the party members and called Bihyung through the dokkaebi
communication. However, the voice that came back was from Youngki.

[I'm sorry, Bihyung is a bit busy right now…]

That Bihyung bastard, he became sloppy as soon as he was going to be
promoted? He was an ungrateful bastard. I had been trying to raise his
performance but he didn't know how to repay favours.
–There are random boxes in new scenarios right?

[Yes. It came out.]

–I'll have 10 of them.

I thought it was good but Youngki surprisingly hesitated. [The

odds of the random boxes are terrible… will you be okay?] –It

will be fine.

I knew what the dokkaebi was worried about. Could a person like this
survive?

[You have purchased 10 'Main Scenario #8 Special Random Boxes!']

[You have spent 30,000 coins.] –

We will stop here.

[Yes. I wish you the blessing of the story.]

Youngki's voice disappeared and 10 shiny boxes appeared in the air. They
were colourful boxes with large question marks.

Lee Gilyoung asked me, "Hyung, is that what we see in games? If you
open it, you get a random good item…" The little kids noticed the fastest.

"Yes, that's right."

[Random box].

A gambling item that had a low probability of giving SSS-grade weapons
and SSS-grade skills. This was an item designed by dokkaebis to trick the
blind constellations. Why did I buy the box?
[The constellation 'Maritime War God' is a bit disappointed in you.]

[The constellation 'Maritime War God' says that the basis of longevity is
integrity.]

[The constellation 'Bald General of Justice' advises you to be wary of
luxury.]

[The constellation 'Slumbering Lady of Fine Brocade' wants you to donate
if you have coins.]

Min Jiwon's face turned red at the Slumbering Lady of Fine Brocade's
message.

"I-I'm sorry. My sponsor is a bit…"

"It's fine. In fact, this isn't a very expensive product. Let's do it together. I'll
give you one to change your mood."

"You will give it? Really?"

"Yes. You can keep any main items that come out of the box. I would be
grateful if you just give me any auxiliary item that comes out as a
consumable."

I originally planned to sell it for a few coins but the people here had some
relationship with me. It would help me if their power increased. Thus, it
wasn't a business with any losses.

Lee Jihye was excited about being given something free and snatched a
box first. "Wow, since ahjussi said so… I will make good use of it!" Then
Gong Pildu and Lee Gilyoung took a box.

"Hyung, what if I get an SSS-grade?"

"It is tough since the odds are 0.00001%.
"…Really?"

"It is business acumen. Let's just be fooled for today."

Yoo Joonghyuk scrutinized me and said, "Kim Dokja. Do you think an item
will come out that will help me deal with Nirvana?"

"Well, something like that?"

"…It is a pathetic plan."

This jerk also took a box…

Finally, Shin Yoosung was the last one to take a box.

"I'll give you two."

Shin Yoosung's eyes widened with surprise. "Really?"

"Yes."

Shin Yoosung hesitated for a moment before taking the boxes from me.
Somehow, the child's expression wasn't ordinary. I looked closely and there
were tears in her eyes.

"Do I deserve something like this…"

The past of Shin Yoosung came to my mind. Maybe this was Shin
Yoosung's first 'gift' since she was born.

There were many people with this type of convenient setting in Ways of
Survival. The convenience of someone would be the real unhappiness of
someone else.

I handed the box to Shin Yoosung who was wiping her eyes. "Take this.
You're my incarnation. That alone is enough to be deserving."
I regretted not taking care of her earlier as I saw Shin Yoosung's face turn
red with liking. I wasn't yet qualified to be a 'constellation' so I couldn't
give Shin Yoosung a stigma.

Was it the right choice to take care of this child? Maybe this child would be
unhappy because of me. For now, it was unknown. However, I would do
my best to protect this child.

"Then let's try opening them. Think of it as a diversion."

Everyone nodded and started opening the boxes.

[The 'Main Scenario #8 Special Random Box' has been used!]

[You have acquired two Ellain Forest Essence.]

[One 'Fairly Usable Pair of Boots (E-grade) have been acquired!]

[Other consumables have been acquired.]

…This was it. The only things that came out were E-grade items and
consumables. The situation was the same for the other party members.
Well, I expected it. In the first place, the random box…

[Congratulations! Someone has broken the probability of 0.00001%!]

Grand celebration firecrackers appeared in the air. I turned and saw triumph
on Shin Yoosung's face.

…Don't tell me? Really?

"A-ahjussi?"

The small fruit in Shin Yoosung's scattered a bright light. I went closer and
the identity of the item became clear. Oh my god, this was what she
received?
…How was my incarnation so lucky?

The watching Yoo Joonghyuk was also a bit surprised. "You got something
good."

The SSS-grade item, Ancient Beast's Fruit.

Among the SSS-grade items with a 0.00001% chance of appearing, the item
with the worst probability was the Ancient Beast's Fruit. It was a
consumable item but its effect was worth the rating of SSS.

"If you feed this fruit to a monster you can't tame, you will be able to tame
it. Congratulations. Save it for the right time."

There was no better item for Shin Yoosung who could use Taming. If this
was used on a monster that could evolve beyond the 1st grade, Shin
Yoosung might be able to grow beyond the 41st version. Shin Yoosung
looked between me and the fruit with sparkling eyes.

"Ahjussi, this is great… but can it only be used on monsters?"

"Perhaps. Why?"

"…It's nothing." Shin Yoosung blushed cutely as she watched me before
avoiding my eyes.

Lee Gilyoung drooled and rushed over to her side. "Hey, can't you give me
that? I'll give you my Titano."

"I hate insects."

Lee Jihye watched like she was jealous. "Ahjussi, why are you doing this?
Do you really want to change our mood?"

"Of course not. Give me the consumables that came out from the box."
I was aiming for the consumables that came out from the box since the
beginning.

[Loudspeaker (Dome Channels) x 4 have been acquired!]

[Loudspeaker (General Channels) x 4 have been acquired!]

[Loudspeaker (Area Only) x 2 have been acquired!]

Yoo Joonghyuk's eyes narrowed. "I know what you want to do."

[Loudspeaker.]

They were useful consumables that could send messages to specific
channels or entire areas depending on the options.

"However, just saying a few words to that guy…"

I told Yoo Joonghyuk, "The important thing is what you say."

I used a loudspeaker. Then let's get started. I started the story that would
attract Nirvana.




At this time, Nirvana was in the church hideout. Nirvana had his eyes shut
while the statue of Avalokiteśvara Bodhisattva looked down on him.

Don't hang onto the past or look to the future. The past had already
disappeared and the future hadn't come yet.

Nirvana memorized these phrases but the doctrine wasn't spread by
voice. Sweat covered his forehead. Sparks bounced all around his body.
After a while, his eyes turned white and a message came. [You have
succeeded in learning a new skill!]

Nirvana opened his eyes. "…It was unreasonable."

His stigma 'Succession' consumed probability when used. Therefore, he
couldn't use Succession unless he used the 'story' that had accumulated
through his reincarnations to provide some plausible probability.

'I've lost too much story'.

His past disappeared but Nirvana soon regained his composure. There were
some things that must be emptied in order to live in the present.

He struggled with the energy consumed as he headed into the depths of the
church. He went down to the basement and after passing through a corridor,
a gentle light appeared.

It was a room with an antique-style table and a double bed. It was a
wellequipped room with a warm atmosphere.

"I've kept you waiting. Then shall we begin today's session?"

There were two women sitting at a table in the room. They were the
vanished King of Wanderers, Lee Sookyung, and Yoo Sangah. Yoo
Sangah's eyes were wide as she stared into the air and Lee Sookyung asked,

"When will you release the skill on this child?"

[Thought Infection.]

Over a week had passed but Yoo Sangah was still resisting. Nirvana
laughed.
"I'm not releasing it. You have to solve it yourself." It was interesting from
Nirvana's standpoint. "It is a foolish thing. She is resisting when she simply
has to declare that she will live in the present."

"The value of the past is different for those who live a short life."

"It is because you live a short life that you should put more value in the
present. You are blessed with death but you don't know the value of it."

"Don't judge other people's present based on yourself. She is living in the
'present' enough. You are the one ignorant about the present because you
reincarnate over and over."

"Don't forget. I'm only keeping you alive while your story is worth it."

Lee Sookyung's face was relaxed despite the threat. She was like
Scheherazade in One Thousand and One Nights.

Nirvana slowly pulled out a chair and sat down. He demanded, "Tell me the
information I want to know."

"What do you want to know?"

"The incarnation called Kim Dokja."

Lee Sookyung's smile stiffened for the first time. "I don't know that
incarnation."

"There is no use in pretending. I already know that he is your son. The
'neutral' guy told me."

"…He and I parted when he was young. I have no idea about how he has
been living."

"I'll see when I look inside you."
The bright wheel of life started to turn behind Nirvana. Inside the wheel of
life, the thousand hands of Avalokiteśvara started to stretch out.

The gigantic hand covered Lee Sookyung's head. Lee Sookyung glared at
the hand in a displeased manner.

Nirvana threatened, "Open your memories or the woman next to you will
die."

"It is a childish threat."

"You have been giving in to this childish threat. That is what a human is."

Lee Sookyung stared at Yoo Sangah's blank eyes and sighed. "…Do what
you want."

[The exclusive skill 'Origin of Principle and Secondary Causes Lv. 6' has
been activated.]

Avalokiteśvara's hand firmly dug into Lee Sookyung's head. Lee
Sookyung's story flowed and started to entangle with Nirvana's story. There
was a sense of being 'one'. Nirvana's senses trembled. He chewed, tasted,
ate and enjoyed. He was a genuine epicurean of the Star Stream.

"It is really amazing. How does a human like you have filtered information
of the future?"

Lee Sookyung desperately tried to protect the memories but the
fragmentary future knowledge she obtained from Kim Dokja couldn't rebel
against the flow of Origin of Principle and Secondary Causes and they were
sucked into Nirvana.

"Interesting. This is the essence of Kim Dokja."

"…"
"You are a sad mother. You lied to your child. You deceived your child for
your own dogmatism."

Cold anger filled Lee Sookyung's face as she declared, "You won't be able
to win against that child."

"…I admit that he is an interesting incarnation."

He was one that forced Nirvana to use Succession. However, he was only
human. It was just up to here. Then a message rang in the air.

[ Applying for a duel with the Salvation Church's leader, Nirvana Moebius.
]

The surprised Nirvana looked up at the air. It was Kim Dokja using the
loudspeaker.

Lee Sookyung spoke like she had been waiting. "That child is strong and
wise. He knows what he needs and what he can do best."

[ The place of the duel is Gwanghwamun at 2 p.m. today. The person you
will be confronting is the Supreme King Yoo Joonghyuk. The two people
closest to being the strongest incarnations will fight to defend Seoul Dome.
If you are really living in the present, don't avoid this confrontation. ]

Using the 'present' as an excuse? It was a confrontation that couldn't be
avoided if he was a real 'savior'. Furthermore, the clever use of the
loudspeaker was amazing. If he avoided this confrontation, he would
receive the chastisement of all the incarnations in Seoul Dome as well as
the Salvation members. However, he would be a fool to go after knowing it
was a trap. Nirvana laughed.

"The provocation is decent. Then what should I do? In any case, my goal
isn't to clear the scenario. My purpose is great…"
[ Of course, your great plan won't concent to this confrontation. However…
]

Nirvana stiffened at Kim Dokja's words.

[ If you come now, I will give you a chance to become one with Yoo
Joonghyuk. ]

Nirvana was so astonished that he let go of Origin of Principle and
Secondary Causes. He shivered in anger, wonder and an unknown sense of
shame and bit his lips.

Lee Sookyung felt Nirvana's intense urge through the string that connected
them. It was a desire to combine with one person for a bigger story.

Lee Sookyung laughed at the desire. "I told you that you are going to lose."




[ Okay. ]

Nirvana's answer came quickly. The party members looked blank, as if they
didn't know what to expect.

I stood up and shook off my dizziness.

"Dokja-ssi, how… no, are you okay?"

Min Jiwon looked anxiously at the black bruise around my left eye. It was
the trace left behind by Yoo Joonghyuk after I sold his name. I rubbed my
eyes and asked, "Has that jerk left already?"

I even fell unconscious for a while. Damn, that ignorantly powerful man.
"He left as soon as he heard the answer."
"Then we will go as well."

Lee Gilyoung's slightly sour expression became excited. "Dokja hyung, I'm
glad we're fighting together this time."

"Yes."

I couldn't laugh. Nirvana would've surely gained new skills and couldn't be
challenged as easily as before. Of course, Yoo Joonghyuk would also
defend himself so victory or defeat wouldn't be easy to predict. In fact, I
wasn't interested in their fight.

The real problem was the loud message in my head.

[You are currently the strongest incarnation in Seoul.]

…Now, what should I do?
         Chapter 143: Ep. 28 - The Ultimate Sacrifice, III


Our party arrived near Gwanghwamun half an hour before the promised
time. In the meantime, the same message appeared in my head.

[You are currently the strongest incarnation in Seoul.]

Damn, I wanted to say that I already knew. Frankly, I felt embarrassed
every time I heard it. I couldn't guarantee victory against Yoo Joonghyuk
even if I used all my power and I barely managed to beat Nirvana. Why
was I the strongest?

Then a sentence from the 51st regression in Ways of Survival appeared.

「 Strength and weakness in the Star Stream have nothing to do with the
power or skill proficiency. The standards of strength come from the 'story'.
」

Then there were the words that Nirvana had said. "Strength and weaknesses
are ultimately determined by the story."
"Dokja-ssi!"

In the distance, Lee Hyunsung and Jung Heewon were approaching. It
seemed their bond with each other was stronger after overcoming the
difficult situation together. Jung Heewon waved at me.

"I saw the proclamation of war. It was very beautiful."

"How are you feeling?"

"I'm fine. Hyunsung-ssi was a bit hurt…"

"I will be fine!"

"…He is just bluffing."

At the end of Jung Heewon's words, Lee Hyunsung struck his chest to
prove he wasn't bluffing. It was exaggerated but it was hard to see it as a
bluff.

Lee Hyunsung had started to inherit the story of the Master of Steel.
Perhaps Lee Hyunsung was one of the top five incarnations in Seoul Dome.
He was strengthened by inheriting the story.

Lee Hyunsung was the perfect example of 'strength is a story'. It was the
price of a story that determined 'strength' in this world.

Perhaps I was ranked as the 'strongest incarnations' because the stories I
accumulated in this life were at an impossible level.

Of course, the stories of the regressor Yoo Joonghyuk and reincarnator
Nirvana were also formidable but their story was of the past.

The landscape of Gwanghwamun started to be seen in the distance. I
checked the time. Three hours and 40 minutes had passed since the first
wave. Once every four hours, the monsters would come. The second wave
would soon be upon us.
"The 5th grade monsters will soon come. Will the other incarnations be
okay?"

"It will be fine here."

I looked around and the eyes of Jung Heewon and the party members
moved with me. It was more crowded than it was 10 minutes ago and the
number of people was growing.

"This…" Jung Heewon seemed to realize something. Shouts came from all
over the place. Everyone in Seoul was gathering at Gwanghwamun.

"Let's defeat the Salvation Church's leader!"

"We have to kill him to end this scenario!"

People armed with weapons were shouting. No one was talking about
freedom or equality. It was because the humans of the present were too
shabby to talk about such a grand concept. Instead, they gathered for
survival.

"Follow the Supreme King!"

"Break the Salvation Church!"

Lee Hyunsung looked at the scene with a complicated gaze and said,
"Dokja-ssi knew this would happen."

"I did expect it."

No matter how many new incarnations came in or how popular the
Salvation Church was, the majority of the Seoul population were 'existing
incarnations'. They just needed a focal point to go beyond factions.

Gong Pildu looked at the crowd and sighed. "…South Korea is ruined.
Dammit. Are the lawmakers who were going to return my land dead?"
"You are saying those words in a situation like this?"

Lee Jihye clicked her tongue and Gong Pildu rubbed his lips.

"…What about Yoo Sangah? I heard she was caught by the Salvation
Church."

"We'll go and get her. However, not right now."

I couldn't be hasty. Even Nirvana wouldn't dare touch the terminal of the
nebula Olympus unless he was thinking about a war between nebulae.

All of Gwanghwamun was becoming heated up by the incarnations when a
shining message appeared in the air.


  [Hint 2]

  The ninth strongest incarnation in Seoul Dome is 'Insect Boy Lee
  Gilyoung'.


Lee Gilyoung's eyes shone when his name was called.

"Hyung, I'm ninth!"

"…It is ridiculous. I'm weaker than that kid?" Lee Jihye grumbled.

"Stop talking and get ready."

The party members nodded simultaneously. The second hint was
announced and the second wave would soon begin.

Roars were heard from the outskirts of Seoul and the cries of monsters
started to be heard.
5th grade monsters that could be classified as 'small disasters' started to
emerge. In order words, it was a level that ordinary incarnations couldn't
handle. Fortunately, all the incarnations were gathered near Gwanghwamun
and it wasn't an impossible fight. The narrower the area to protect, the
easier it was to save the incarnations.

"We have to settle this in four hours. After that, 4th grade monsters will
start to emerge. It is the end once that happens."

The parry members nodded. There was nothing scary about 'small disasters'
but they didn't want to see the monsters of the upper rank. I asked Gong
Pildu and Lee Hyunsung to lead the incarnations and form a defense
network.

"Leave it to me."

"Gwanghwamun will become my land after this scenario is over."

I smiled and replied, "…Go ahead. Do what you want."

Sadly, once this scenario was over, the 'Seoul land' that Gong Pildu desired
wouldn't exist.

I led the rest of the group to the center of Gwanghwamun. In the center of
Gwanghwamun, there was a large dome that didn't originally exist.

It wasn't a real building. There was no stadium in Gwanghwamun. It was a
space that the Salvation Church temporarily added. The interior of the
dome was still opaque but when I looked closely, a small figure was
standing on top and giving a speech.

–All incarnations, who is our real enemy? Why are we now pointing our
spears and swords towards each other?

Jung Heewon frowned at the voice.
"…It is the Neutral King."

The Neutral King was using 'Voice Amplication' at the top of the dome like
he was a dokkaebi.

–I naturally understand your feelings. Whether it is the Salvation members
or other forces, we are all weak people. We are just victims of the scenario.
In fact, you know. There is no point in fighting between us here! This is
what the dokkaebi wants!

"Shut up! It was the Salvation Church who started fighting first!"

"Yes! Kill him!"

Jeon Ildo laughed lightly.

–Everyone, don't you know that the monsters are coming? Seoul will be
destroyed if we fight.

"Then what are you going to do?"

–Everyone knows this is a scenario where we can live if the strongest
incarnation sacrifices themselves.

The opaque exterior of the stadium became transparent and the interior
started to show. There were two people standing on a stage with the
gorgeous spotlight behind them.

–The two heroes who are coming forward for the incarnations of Seoul
Dome! I will introduce you to the strongest incarnation candidates!

The Salvation members on the opposite side of the dome clapped loudly.

"Yoo Joonghyuk! Yoo Joonghyuk!"

"Nirvana! Nirvana!"
The incarnations seemed baffled by the sudden change of atmosphere.

"W-What is this?"

"Are they fighting already?"

I knew what they were thinking.

「 What if we can clear the scenario like this? 」

「 Regardless of whether it is the Salvation leader or the Supreme King,
isn't it good for us if both of them die in this fight? 」

Every human was a coward. Nirvana knew when humans were the most
cowardly. It was time for the 'unattainable future'. Some people had already
died while others would fight back and find a way to live.

I approached the dome and hit the wall.

[The incarnation 'Jeon Ildo' is using Fair Duel Lv. 3.]

[All incarnations apart from those involved in the duel aren't allowed to
enter the stage.]

…He used the stigma of Gwanghaegun. In this case, no one apart from Yoo
Joonghyuk and Nirvana could physically get involved in the battle.

I spoke to Jung Heewon and Lee Jihye. "Kill Jeon Ildo!"

The next moment, something burst from inside the stadium. Finally, the
battle between Yoo Joonghyuk and Nirvana started.

There was a gigantic screen above the dome that was created by the
dokkaebi.

[You are doing something interesting. I think it will be a fun fight so I'm
prepared to let everyone see it.]
On the screen, I could see Yoo Joonghyuk's two swords and Nirvana's
white magic power colliding.

Yoo Joonghyuk's Breaking the Sky Sword and Nirvana's Mandala caused a
storm in the space.

Dozens of exchanges were done in a short amount of time. It was a cautious
and elaborate battle.

They used Transmission or Succession to read the other person's skills and
tried to gain an advantage. This was a confrontation between a regressor
and a reincarnator.

It was Nirvana who moved first in earnest. Nirvana's mandala rotated
quickly, spinning his magic power as a threat that attacked Yoo
Joonghyuk's body.

Yoo Joonghyuk jumped high into the sky, avoiding the white magic power.

At first glance, it seemed like an endless number. It was because the white
magic power acted according to his movements. Yoo Joonghyuk quickly
spun his blades to hit the mandala's power but unfortunately missed two
bundles.

Blood poured from his left shoulder and thigh. A loud sound emerged from
the mouth of an incarnation. Jeon Ildo was making a fuss as he nervously
fled from Jung Heewon.

–Ah, it will be like this?

However, Yoo Joonghyuk was calm. Yoo Joonghyuk jumped near the
dome's ceiling and dived down while holding the Heavenly Sword of
Gathering Clouds. Blue magic power was nestled in the sword but Nirvana
was already finishing his defense.

"Come on, Yoo Joonghyuk!"
At this moment, the size of the Heavenly Sword of Gathering Clouds
suddenly changed. It was transformed into a giant sword and started to
grow to the size of a tall building.

Yoo Joonghyuk's arm holding the sword was the same. It was like the right
arm of a giant god.

[Giant Body Transformation.]

The surprised Nirvana tried to leave the range of the blade but it was
already too late. The weight of the blade that split the sky literally fell onto
Nirvana.

There was a huge roar and the entire stage was filled with dust.

"Kuooh!"

Nirvana was hit hard and lay in a deep pit made by Yoo Joonghyuk's sword.
The incarnations exclaimed. Numerous arms had emerged from the
mandala.

The Thousand Hands of Avalokiteśvara. The hands of the Bodhisattva were
fighting against the giant sword. If it wasn't for the dome,the area would've
been destroyed by the collision. All the incarnation were overwhelmed by
the sight.

「 This is a showdown between the strongest in Seoul. 」

The strongest… I somehow felt bitter. I swallowed the bitter taste and used
Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint.

On the surface, it seemed like a simple confrontation of strength but in this
moment, there was a flow of thoughts between Nirvana and Yoo
Joonghyuk.
Nirvana thought, 「 Did the level of Mental Barrier go up? The magic
power wavelength is becoming stronger. 」

「 Your skill level is lower than I thought. What did you gain from
Succession? 」

「 You act like your left shoulder is hurt but that is a trap. 」

「 Giant Body Transformation has a short duration. You should look at the
whole of the match. 」

····.

It was a battlefield that only I could see. The two thoughts that didn't touch
each other were depicting a battle that hadn't yet occurred.

I felt pure admiration and appreciated the view.

How much time passed?

I reached the 'result' of this confrontation faster than anyone in the dome. I
jumped and headed to the rooftop of a nearby building overlooking the
dome. Then I opened my mouth.

"Han Sooyoung. I know you are watching."

The space behind me split apart and Han Sooyoung appeared from the
darkness. "…How did you know?"

Han Sooyoung was wearing a blue combat suit that clung to her body.
Perhaps it was a hidden piece from Peace Land.

"You couldn't stay away after hearing the loudspeaker."

"Tsk."
[The constellation 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' shows its teeth towards
you.]

As expected, Han Sooyoung chose her sponsor. Han Sooyoung approached
me and sat on the railing. "It was fun. Why did you call me?"

"Why are you watching? Don't you want to clear the scenario?"

"Ah, I need to clearly know who the strongest is… wait. You know who it
is?"

"I know."

"Who? Is it Yoo Joonghyuk?"

"No."

Han Sooyoung sighed with relief. "I'm glad. If that bastard dies, the world
will go back. Now this isn't difficult.

Han Sooyoung pulled out a dagger. "The Salvation leader… are you going
to kill him?"

I shook my head towards Han Sooyoung, who was going to descend. "He
isn't the strongest."

"No? Then who? Who should I kill?"

I silently stared at Han Sooyoung. After a while, her eyes filled with
disbelief. "…Don't tell me?"

I nodded. "Let's decorate the finale of this scenario."
          Chapter 144: Ep. 28 - The Ultimate Sacrifice, IV


[Geez, this could end quicker than I thought?]

The dokkaebi giggled as he saw the bloody battle between Yoo Joonghyuk
and Nirvana.

[If not one half, I thought at least a third of the incarnations would die…]

[This story isn't interesting.]

In the air, three intermediate dokkaebis were looking down at the stadium.
The incarnations outside the stadium froze at the appearance of the
dokkaebis. Every time they appeared, something ridiculous happened.

[Is it worth giving a hints now?]

[It isn't a big deal. Let's release them a bit faster.]
The moment the dokkaebis spoke, the rankings of the incarnations started
to appear on a board in the air.


 The eighth strongest incarnation in Seoul Dome is 'Moonlight Girl Yoo
 Sangah'.

 The seventh strongest incarnation in Seoul Dome is 'Armed Fortress
 Master Gong Pildu'.

 The sixth strongest incarnation in Seoul Dome is 'Judge of Destruction
 Jung Heewon'.


Three rankings were released in an instant and the reactions of people were
almost explosive.

"Who is Yoo Sangah? Moonlight Girl?"

"Gong Pildu is seventh!"

Jung Heewon was also watching the electronic display in the sky. "Oh my,
I'm sixth?"

"I am tenth… che. Unni, would you like to have a match against me?" Lee
Jihye asked as she trampled on Jeon Ildo, who was trapped on the ground.

Jung Heewon also stepped on him and replied, "Hrmm, I'm sorry but it's
hard. My sponsor likes you."

"What? Why?"

Instead of answering, Jung Heewon pointed her sword at Jeon Ildo. "Excuse
me, Jeon Ildo-ssi who can't even make it into the top 10?"

Jeon Ildo's whole body shivered at the sight of the blade and he asked, "…
Jung Heewon, how did you get rid of Thought Infection?"

"Don't ask me questions. I'll kill you if you don't answer quickly."

"If you kill me… you can't… get rid of the dome."

These were the last full words he said. The atmosphere was somewhat
tiring so Jung Heewon punched Jeon Ildo one more time before going to
find Kim Dokja.

"Dokja-ssi?"

However, Kim Dokja wasn't present.


  The fifth strongest incarnation in Seoul Dome is 'Pure Steel Lee
  Hyunsung'.


Lee Hyunsung and Gong Pildu fighting with the monsters outside the dome
heard the message. Gong Pildu frowned and asked,

"…What is pure steel?"

"I-I don't know either."

Lee Hyunsung used Great Mountain Smash on the 5th grade monsters. For
him who could use Steel Transformation, the disaster level monsters were
no longer an enemy.

However, the number of monsters was more than they thought and the front
line was slowly being pushed back.

Lee Hyunsung protected the armed fortress while thinking.

'Dokja-ssi. Are things going well?'
He hoped that Kim Dokja would answer but of course, Kim Dokja didn't
respond.


  The fourth strongest incarnation in Seoul Dome is 'Black Flames
  Empress Han Sooyoung'.


At the same time, Han Sooyoung was laughing as she saw the board.

"…I'm really fourth?" Han Sooyoung asked as she looked down at Kim
Dokja bleeding on the ground. He was stabbed so that he wouldn't die
instantly, but the bleeding was severe and he was sure to die soon.

Han Sooyoung bent down and touched the cheek of the bleeding Kim
Dokja. "Kim Dokja. Are you really going to die like this? What if you are
in third place?"

Han Sooyoung looked down at Kim Dokja with an uncomfortable
expression.

"You look so carefree now."

Of course, Kim Dokja didn't answer. She was the one who stabbed him but
once she did, she was really afraid that Kim Dokja would die. He didn't
even have an avatar… no, perhaps?

"Why am I worried about him…" Han Sooyoung complained before falling
silent.

The lips of the unconscious Kim Dokja contorted with pain. She wanted to
know what was going on but she didn't ask.
Kim Dokja was having a hard time. Like her, he was an ordinary person
before the world was destroyed. Such a person had jumped onto a stage to
decide the world's fate and was moving the main characters. Han Sooyoung
had forgotten for a moment that Kim Dokja was also a normal human.
She stretched out a finger and touched Kim Dokja's mouth. Then her face
became a strange mixture of a smile and a frown.

Han Sooyoung giggled. "…It is really strange."

At this moment, a huge shock wave occurred in the dome. The battle
between Yoo Joonghyuk and Nirvana was coming to an end.

[Haha, there are three people left to look forward to. I wonder who they
are?
Just wait! The rankings will soon be made public!]

[The constellation 'Secretive Plotter' is shutting off his heart.]

[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' is sweating and has
lost hair.]

[The constellation 'Bald General of Justice' wipes his head.]

Yoo Joonghyuk listened to the incoming messages and raised his sword
again.

There was a gruesome sound as the Thousand Hands of Avalokiteśvara
were pierced and a mechanical sound came from deep muscles.

Yoo Joonghyuk felt his presence slowly collapsing. It was the side effect of
Giant Body Transformation. It was the cost of bearing the power that he
couldn't afford.

The colossus had clearly warned him when he was given this power.

「 Never use this skill until all your stats have reached three digits. 」
However, the colossus expected him to receive this skill through
Transmission. He knew Yoo Joonghyuk wouldn't listen to his warning.

Yoo Joonghyuk had to walk the sura path, the impossible path, and he had
to use every means he had to pass. The frustrating thing was that the end of
the road was still invisible.

Yoo Joonghyuk squeezed out all the magic power in his body and aimed his
sword. There was a huge blast of blue magic power towards Nirvana.

「 Splitting the Sky is an explosion.

Don't hide yourself. Expand, blossom, flood. Don't allow the heavens to be
above you. 」

It was the words of the Breaking the Sky Sword Saint, who taught him
Breaking the Sky Swordsmanship.

In the middle and second half of the second regression, the Breaking the
Sky Sword Saint fought against the alliance of returnees and died alone. At
that time, Yoo Joonghyuk saw a thick sky that he couldn't break. There was
definitely such a sky in the world.

"Yoo Joonghyuk―!"

However, Nirvana wasn't that sky. Nirvana was a strong reincarnator. He
would become stronger in the future. He wasn't yet as strong as a heavenly
demon or the Breaking the Sky Sword Saint.

'Thus, I can kill you'.

Yoo Joonghyuk released all his magic power and crushed Nirvana's entire
body. Nirvana's Thousand Hands of Avalokiteśvara was broken to pieces.
The flesh hit by the magic power was torn apart. This was the limit of a
hastily inherited skill.
"Kuaaah!"

Nirvana's body smashed into the ground and a huge shock wave occurred
inside. Yoo Joonghyuk was sure of his victory.

This strike was sufficient. Nirvana might have a number of hidden cards but
he couldn't reverse a blow like this.

'He became aware of Kim Dokja so he would've inherited a close range
skill'.

Yoo Joonghyuk pulled up his remaining magic power and prepared the
final blow. The moment he emerged from the pit to deal the final blow. A
beep suddenly rang in his head.

[The exclusive skill 'Advanced Mental Barrier Lv. 3' has reached its limit.]

[The exclusive skill 'Thought Vaccine Lv. 1' has eroded it.]

…What? It wasn't possible. Thought Vaccine was a counter-skill to
Nirvana's Thought Infection and Eternal Prison. Why was it used on him?

'Don't tell me'.

He gained sudden enlightenment. The present Nirvana was still weaker than
the Nirvana of his past life. What if Nirvana didn't inherit a close combat
skill?

Despite the variable called Kim Dokja, Nirvana's only goal was Yoo
Joonghyuk from the beginning.

'Shit, it is 108 Worries'.

[The exclusive skill 'Advanced Mental Barrier Lv. 3' has been destroyed.]

[108 evil spirits have started to gnaw at your mind.]
At this moment, Yoo Joonghyuk's eyes turned black and his five senses
started to run wild. He should've noticed something strange when his
thoughts became unusually heavy. Nirvana laughed from inside the pit.

"Yoo Joonghyuk! Only I can understand you!"

It was obvious that Nirvana had been enduring only for this moment. 108
giant beads shone behind Nirvana.

"Stop now and become one with me."

Light rose and Yoo Joonghyuk felt fragments of agony piece his mind. He
wouldn't be able to guarantee his next regression if he fell to this skill.

'This is the end'.

He had to regress now. Yoo Joonghyuk exercised final control over his
body and brought the Splitting the Sky Sword to his neck.

–Don't imagine that you will get better if you throw away this round.

Why did those words appear at this moment?

–Maybe this is the round where you will see the end of this world as a
'human'."

Yoo Joonghyuk was in a terrible state of mind and had a thought for the
first time.

'Kim Dokja…'

Then his vision gradually dimmed.

–You jerk, you think quickly.

He was mistaken. A familiar voice was heard.
–Take a break.

Despite his reluctance, Yoo Joonghyuk felt relieved by the voice and easily
closed his eyes.




I slowly opened my eyes and felt like I was overflowing with power.

The height of my field of view had changed and the feeling of the combat
muscles made me feel good. An adequate amount of adrenaline was
secreted. I was full of confidence that I could do anything.

[The 1st person protagonist's point of view has been activated!]

Crazy… this was the 'real' 1st person protagonist's point of view. This was
how Yoo Joonghyuk usually felt. I could never be strong like this.

"…How did you get your mind back from 108 Worries?"

I could see Nirvana's figure in the distance. I glanced outside the stadium.

The fact that I was attached to Yoo Joonghyuk meant that Han Sooyoung
had done her job properly. If it was as scheduled, there were five minutes
remaining until my breathing completely stopped.

Nirvana's eyes were fierce as he aimed a skill at me again.

[The character 'Nirvana Moebius' has used 108 Worries Lv. 2!]

108 Worries. It was originally a skill to raise a person's enlightenment level
by frightening their own spirit but when used on others, it would invoke
terrible delirium. In particular, the effect was worse than Thought Infection
or Eternal Prison for regressors like Yoo Joonghyuk.
Of course, this would only happen if I was Yoo Joonghyuk.

[The Fourth Wall has completely neutralized the effect of 108 Worries!]

I'm sorry but I wasn't the normal 'Yoo Joonghyuk' now.

"This feeling is… who are you?"

As expected, the reincarnator noticed quickly. I rushed over and punched
him in the mouth.

"Kuaaaak!"

Nirvana went flying with a scream. The body of a regressor was truly
excellent. I had this much speed and destructive power without even using
Electrification.

Nirvana's physical strength was exhausted and he couldn't resist as he flew
through the air.

It was a very pleasant feeling.

However, Nirvana could still withstand it. It was natural. He would be used
to pain and death. I once again hit him and said, "You have been through
death dozens of times so you don't know 'death'. It's funny."

Death was death and it only happened once. A human's 'present' was
important because there was nothing after death. This was why Nirvana
didn't know 'death' or the 'present'.

"A person who can't live in the present preaches about the present. There is
no contradiction."

"How about me… keok!"
"I know. The reason why you want to be one with Yoo Joonghyuk, why
you are spreading the Salvation Church and what you ultimately want to
reach."

I understood, which was why I had to stop him now. Nirvana hesitated.
Still, he was a reincarnator and quickly regained his composure.

Nirvana shouted, "Foolish person! It is useless to do this. Even if you do
this, Yoo Joonghyuk will die. No one can stop the destruction of the
scenarios. Even if this life is ruined, the world will repeat. I will reincarnate
and Yoo Joonghyuk will regress! We will end up as one!"

Yes, this was the mindset of a reincarnator. However…

"Do you really think so?"

At this moment, a message appeared on the message board. This was the
right timing.


  The third strongest incarnation in Seoul Dome is 'Supreme King Yoo
  Joonghyuk'.


Nirvana's expression became strange. "The third? Yoo Joonghyuk?"

I nodded and smiled. "Yoo Joonghyuk will never go to the next regression."

"What?"

"No matter what, Yoo Joonghyuk will survive. It is either you or me."

"Don't make me laugh! I am the strongest incarnation, Nirvana Moebius. A
trivial person like you…!"
  The second strongest incarnation in Seoul Dome is 'Salvation Leader
  Nirvana'.


…Damn. I didn't know the second place would already be released. I
looked up and saw the dokkaebis giggling like it was funny. Maybe they
decided the game was settled. Nirvana's body started to tremble. "…This
is… ridiculous…"

"Nirvana, you said that you wanted to live in the present?"

"Perhaps… you…?"

Nirvana's body shook like he encountered a topic that could never be
interpreted. I stared at Nirvana and opened my mouth.

It was a very low voice, like the whisper of a reaper. "I will tell you about
your 'death'."
          Chapter 145: Ep. 28 - The Ultimate Sacrifice, V


The moment that the third and second rankings were announced in Seoul,
the incarnations fell into a panic.

"Fuck! What is this?"

"Then who is the strongest? What are we going to do?"

The incarnations assumed that the strongest person was either Yoo
Joonghyuk or Nirvana, and that both of them would die here. Now the
situation had changed. The moment the first ranked person was obscured,
the incarnations trying to clear the scenario shivered at the unexpected
reversal.

To make matters worse, one of the 5th grade monsters pierced through the
defenses. The miserable incarnations were torn apart by the beast's teeth.

"Aaaagh!"
The situation was becoming worse. The 5th grade monsters weren't easy
and the incarnations were less united than expected.

[* Current number of incarnations: 89,041.]

Thousands of incarnations died. Lee Hyunsung broke the head of a monster
with Great Mountain Smash.

"Soldier ahjussi! What the hell is going on?" Lee Jihye and Jung Heewon
rushed towards him.

They had also been responsible for defending against the monsters.

"If Nirvana isn't the strongest, isn't Dokja ahjussi wrong? What are we
going to do now?"

The party's plan was based on the assumption that 'Nirvana is the strongest
incarnation'. Now the scenario wouldn't end even if they killed Nirvana.
Lee Hyunsung stared blankly at the stadium.

"I think…"

Lee Hyunsung's face paled as he had a thought.




"Kuaaaak!"

Nirvana screamed as his body flew through the air.

"You will tell me about death? Don't make me laugh!" Despite being
helplessly beaten, Nirvana remained steadfast. "I won't die. No matter what
you say, true death won't come to me! If I could die that easily, I wouldn't
have suffered like this!"
I was amazed that he could retain such emotions after living such a long
life. Perhaps this was his purpose when preaching of salvation.

I grabbed his collar and told him, "You actually want to die. Right?"

"…!"

"It is because you can't die that you are comforted by the deaths of others."

Every human placed value on their life because they only died once.

"That's why you preached to the Salvation Church. You watched them live
a one-time life and also wanted to be absorbed into their lives. You want to
share the emotions they feel."

[Your understanding of the character 'Nirvana Moebius' has increased.]

I knew Nirvana. I didn't just know him because he was a character in the
novel. Nirvana yearned for something he could never be. Nirvana
resembled me.

"Don't speak nonsense."

Unexpectedly, Nirvana's voice was calm. It was when he was really angry
that he made a voice like this.

"It is the same for humans who don't know death. Nothing exists after a rare
death! Humans can die but they can't suffer from death in a true sense. It is
something that can't be owned by anyone!"

"At least we can feel the fear of death. It makes human life possible. That is
the biggest difference between you and an ordinary human."

"You…!"

Nirvana's fist flew towards me but I easily caught it.
"That's why you want to become 'one' with Yoo Joonghyuk?"

"…?"

"You think you can erase your existence by becoming one with Yoo
Joonghyuk. Right?"

Nirvana's expression completely stiffened.

"Reincarnation is the stigma of the highest-grade constellation. To erase it,
you need the power of a higher constellation."

Nirvana looked at me and gritted his teeth. "…You are beyond my
imagination."

"I hear that often."

"Then kill me. I'm not afraid of death as you said." Nirvana's eyes were
burning with vengeance. "Still, you better keep something in mind. I'll
come back again and again. I will come back to life a number of times, kill
you and show you the worst pain. Just like I did to your mother."

I was surprised. "…Did you meet my mother?"

"She is a very good mother."

[The exclusive skill, 'Fourth Wall' is shaking!]

"It is fun to make her submit. You know, I like to corrupt a virtuous spirit."

[The exclusive skill, 'Fourth Wall' is shaking!]

"The scene where she struggled and begged for her life is still vivid in my
eyes."
There was such provocation in this world. I was hooked despite knowing it
was a provocation. This was despite knowing my mother wouldn't have
done that.

[The exclusive skill, 'Fourth Wall' is steadily shaking.]

"Hahaha! You are caught!"

My vision shook and the world became black.

[The character 'Nirvana Moebius' has used 108 Worries Lv. 2!]

My consciousness was sucked somewhere and I was thrown into a world
other than the stadium. I heard familiar voices in the darkness.

「 Master, run away! 」

「 Please, please save this world. 」

「 You can easily throw away this world. But I…! 」

They were voices filled with resentment. I knew where this world was. It
was the place where the Fourth Wall was shaking. It was the inner part of
Yoo Joonghyuk, who was infested with many worries.

"Yoo Joonghyuk! You finally allowed me in! Now… you will be one with
me."

Nirvana was standing in front of me. I smiled as I looked at him. Preparing
a counterattack at the last minute, a reincarnator was truly a reincarnator.

I told him, "It was a mistake for you to enter here."

A mandala pattern appeared under Nirvana's feet. The inner surface of the
soul was less affected by probability. Here, Nirvana was able to use the
power of the stories he accumulated.
Nirvana grew to the size of a giant in a flash. The pressure of the soul that
accumulated countless stories was really great. Once again, it was natural
for him to have built up such stories.

Hundreds of arms grew like wings from his back while his legs were half
covered with the feathers of a bird and half covered with the scales of a
snake. A wolf-like snout protruded and horns grew from his head.

It looked like he was concentrating all the reincarnations he had
experienced.

[I am Nirvana Moebius.]

This was Nirvana 'himself'.

[A reincarnator who leads the unfortunate people to Nirvana.]

He looked confident but Nirvana didn't know. I deliberately let myself by
hit by his 108 Worries. I smiled and opened my mouth. "Nirvana, do you
know the principle of reincarnation?"

The space trembled ominously. I kept speaking.

"Your soul is bound to the mandala's guardian. Once you die, you don't go
to the Underworld. According to the unique laws of the constellations, your
soul is nestled in a body that was just born."

[…What are you talking about?]

"You aren't immortal. Your body is born again but your soul isn't."

[Nonsense!]

The hundreds of arms on Nirvana's back poured towards me. The Thousand
Hands of Avalokiteśvara poured out like a waterfall. If I was hit by that in
reality, my body would burst and I would be dead. However, this place was
different.
Now I was Yoo Joonghyuk. In other words, this was also my 'inner self'.
The Thousand Hands of Avalokiteśvara melted away in front of my nose.

Nirvana looked baffled. I saw the numerous pages that surrounded me.

[The exclusive skill, 'Fourth Wall' is activated!]

There was the sound of pages turning and the pages started to flutter
around. There were words written on the white pages. The countless words
that I read formed a huge wall.

The astounded Nirvana tried to escape but it was already too late. Sparks
formed as Nirvana's body hit the wall.

[What have you done?]

The Fourth Wall could even repel the constellations. I was curious. Maybe
it was possible to use this to wipe out a 'reincarnator'.

[Release this wall! This, this is…!]

The perplexed Nirvana looked at the wall. A blinding light emerged from
the letters on the wall.

「 If this world continues to be reborn, we can clear it. 」

[This… don't tell me…!]

Nirvana stared at the pages that contained his truth.

「 Yoo Joonghyuk, I can take you to the end of this world. 」

[H-How do you have this?]

I approached Nirvana and said, "You don't have to go until the end of this
world."
Every time letters appeared on the world, Nirvana's huge body started to
disintegrate. Nirvana's body split into countless letters and started to be
sucked into the Fourth Wall.

"You will die here."

There was a strange emotion on Nirvana's face as he saw his soul
disintegrating.

「 At last, the reincarnator Nirvana reached a 'single life' after hundreds of
years of wandering. 」

Nirvana laughed as he saw the sentence on the wall.

[Ha… haha, hahaha!]

「 He greeted his first real 'death'. 」

Nirvana's expression was jubilant.


「 This is… dying. 」

[I see. This is it.]

「 At that moment, Nirvana realized what he had long been waiting for. 」

It had been hundreds of years. He reached the end after countless
incarnations. Nirvana closed his eyes at this long-awaited moment. Despite
closing his eyes, Nirvana's inner thoughts were still written on the wall.

「 Then why? This is what I've been hoping for. 」

Nirvana's entire body was covered with minor cracks. His feet, legs, thighs,
chest… The broken pieces were being sucked into the Fourth Wall.

「 Why am I feeling afraid? 」
He felt the fear of death for the first time.

To die. There was no future. He couldn't think, move, talk or even feel his
own existence.

「 I don't exist. 」

Nirvana's eyes flashed open for a moment.

「 Don't… I don't want to! 」

「 However, Nirvana's mouth was gone and he couldn't shout it. 」

「 His disappearing arms stretched helplessly towards me. 」

「 In the first place, existence isn't beautiful. 」

No one would hold a philosophical view when fated to die. All beings were
helpless before death.

「 No! Please! Stop! Don't kill me! 」

「 Yes, your mother's secret. I know it! I know the story that your mother
never told you―」

「 Save me. Please. If you save me…! 」

I looked at him. It was as if witnessing the end of a character in the novel.

「 In his last moments, Nirvana repeated the words he hated the most. 」

「 I don't want to die. 」

Soon, Nirvana's soul completely disappeared.

[The Fourth Wall has eaten the character 'Nirvana Moebius'.]
This was the first message I heard. The wall reacted differently from when
it killed the Theatre Dungeon's boss. I was frightened at first.

[The Fourth Wall is smiling with satisfaction.]

It was fine to kill Nirvana. However, once I thought about it, I didn't know
exactly what the Fourth Wall was.

[The Fourth Wall is looking at you with greedy eyes.]

It wriggled like it was alive. The wall wanted a taste of me, like swallowing
Nirvana wasn't enough. Something popped up on the wall.

「 At this moment, Kim Dokja thought, 'Maybe someday, I will also be
eaten by this wall'. 」

[108 Worries has been disabled.]

My vision started to return to its original state. The wall, Nirvana, Yoo
Joonghyuk. It was as if nothing had happened from the beginning.

…

I blinked and found I was back at the Gwanghwamun stadium. Nirvana was
scattering in front of my eyes. After a long time wandering, he finally found
rest.

The area was silent, as if cold water had been poured on it. I slowly moved
Yoo Joonghyuk's feet.

The dokkaebi started talking. [This… It is already the end of the scenario.
Shall I now announce who the strongest incarnation is?]

I found it hard to move due to fatigue. The voice of the dokkaebi was heard
above my head.

[The strongest incarnation, he is…]
At this moment, my consciousness blurred and I couldn't hear the voice
anymore.

It seemed that my time had run out. I couldn't hear the final words as my
consciousness disappeared.

[Excessive mental exhaustion has turned off Omniscient Reader's
Viewpoint stage three.]

[1st person protagonist's point of view has been released.]

.

.

.

[You have died.]




Two days later, my funeral began.
           Chapter 146: Ep. 29 - Constellation Banquet, I


Rain poured down on Gwanghwamun Square. The streets were near ruins
thanks to the monsters. The collapsed media logos were broken and
trampled on. The King Sejong the Great and Yi Sunsin statues that were the
symbols of Gwanghwamun were completely destroyed.

"Ah…"

The civilization that Seoul boasted had collapsed and the culture was lost.
There was only one story left but none of the people in Gwanghwamun
wanted this story.

Lee Jihye opened her mouth as she watched some of the Hwarang digging
at the ground. "…Is he really dead?"

Nobody answered her. The reasons for not responding were different. Jung
Heewon, Lee Hyunsung, Lee Gilyoung, Shin Yoosung…
They had their own thoughts but none of them spoke. Perhaps their
thoughts were wrong. Perhaps… they were afraid it was right.

"No… Really?"

Kim Dokja's body was discovered around an hour after the end of the
eighth scenario.

"Ahjussi! Wake up! Is this a joke?"

The cause of death was excessive blood loss. At first, everyone was
confused. Kim Dokja, who hadn't been seen throughout the entire situation,
suddenly died.

Still, the party members waited without much panic. This situation had
happened a few times. The first time they hunted the fire dragon and when
facing the Disaster of Floods. Kim Dokja always survived death.

Thus, they waited this time. He would rise again as usual and give the party
members his distinctive smile. He would tell some timid jokes.

However, Kim Dokja didn't rise again. One hour passed and then two.
Finally, one day passed. It was the same when the second night arrived.

Kim Dokja didn't resurrect. His body was cold.

It was Min Jiwon who encouraged the members by making a coffin.

"…He was the strongest in Seoul."

She started doing what no one else could do. She knew Kim Dokja but she
could do it because her relationship with Kim Dokja was light.

Min Jiwon spoke of Kim Dokja's sacrifice. She spread the story of the man
who chose to die quietly while everyone was enthusiastically watching the
battle between the strongest people.
Everyone called Kim Dokja by different nicknames. In fact, when the
dokkaebi had named the strongest incarnation, people thought of different
nicknames.

King of a Kingless World.

The lonely Messiah.

The Ugliest King…

The words were different but the direction they converged was all the same.
The strongest person in Seoul Dome was Kim Dokja and Kim Dokja died
for Seoul.

Seoul was saved by Kim Dokja. A savior died in a place that no one knew.

Min Jiwon made a coffin for this Kim Dokja. People watched Kim Dokja's
body being laid in the coffin and held back tears. Some people were
confused by who he was while some people sighed after belatedly hearing
the story.

Meanwhile, Shin Yoosung was crying. "Ahjussi…"

"Yoosung." Jung Heewon pulled Shin Yoosung away from the coffin. Lee
Hyunsung still had a confused expression while Lee Gilyoung's face was
blank, as if he was fleeing reality.

"Dokja hyung isn't dead."

Finally, Lee Jihye screamed, "…Where did Master go?"

"…"

"Master can save ahjussi! Where is Seolhwa unni?"

However, Yoo Joonghyuk wasn't here to hear the blame. Eventually, Lee
Jihye also started crying. "Ahjussi…"
They had to admit it, even if they didn't want to. Kim Dokja was dead and
he wouldn't resurrect again.

[The new main scenario will start soon.]

They now had to live in a world without Kim Dokja.




「They now had to live in a world without Kim Dokja. 」

If it was Ways of Survival then this sentence would've been written.

"Well, don't mourn for me."

I wanted to shout but my voice didn't come out. It was because I was in a
state where my vocal cords weren't formed. It was comforting to be able to
observe the situation was a 'third party observer' whenever my mental
power was restored.

It would be nice if I could use 'first person's viewpoint' but it wasn't
working right now after being overloaded by Yoo Joonghyuk.

[Excessive immersion has restricted the use of 'first person viewpoint'.]

The coffin was covered in dirt and some people shouted,

"The Ugliest King!"

Shit. Did the dokkaebis attach the nickname 'the Ugliest King' to me? It
must be that bastard Bihyung.

I felt stranger when I saw Shin Yoosung crying and throwing flowers onto
my grave. The party members were now convinced that I was dead. I
watched as they attended my funeral. I was probably the only one like this.
"Haaaaaah!"

Lee Gilyoung was weeping and had a runny nose as he ran towards the
coffin half covered in dirt. Lee Jihye was also the same.

"Ahjussiiiii―!"

She was normally a child who acted angrily towards me so I was touched. It
would be a funny scene if I woke up in the coffin right now.

However, I couldn't do that. It was because I was currently in the so-called
'cooldown' time.

[The privilege of 'Eight Lives' has been activated.]

The resurrection itself was nothing to worry about. I had the attribute Eight
Lives that I obtained from Peace Land after giving up King of No Killing.
This attribute could be obtained only by drinking the soul and flesh of
Yamata no Orochi, literally providing the person with eight lives.

[The first head of the snake has been sacrificed.]

[The power of this head is Wary Person.]

Different types of abilities slept in Yamata no Orochi's heads and after
resurrection, I could get a blessing related to the ability. This wasn't bad at
all. The problem was that unlike King of No Killing, there was a waiting
time with this privilege.

[72 hours of waiting time are required before the resurrection.]

[Time remaining: 24:07:12]

I still had one more day to go and it was time for the next scenario to start. I
watched my funeral a bit more before changing my point of view. I couldn't
resurrect yet so I felt sorry to watch it any longer.
[Changing the person observed with 'third person viewpoint'.]

Then a new screen popped up. It was a basement with antique finishes. A
man and woman were there.

"…Yoo Joonghyuk-ssi?" The woman was naturally Yoo Sangah. Needless
to say, it was Yoo Joonghyuk who released her from where she had been
tied up. It was the last favour I asked before leaving his body.

Yoo Sangah asked, "What happened to Dokja-ssi?"

"Kim Dokja is dead."

Yoo Sangah looked like the world had collapsed at Yoo Joonghyuk's blunt
declaration. I frowned slightly when I saw this expression. The 28 year old
Kim Dokja's life wasn't that bad.

"However, he will live again."

"…Live again? How?"

"I don't know. I just know he won't die like that."

Well, Yoo Joonghyuk had seen me resurrecting in the past. He would
surely believe that I would rise again eventually.

"…No, he must live."

Then why was he clenching his fist so much? Yoo Joonghyuk was silent for
a moment before speaking to Yoo Sangah, who was in shock.

"Where is Kim Dokja's family member?"

The remark surprised me. This bastard, why was he doing something I
didn't ask him to do? Yoo Sangah's face changed at the world 'family
member'. She seemed to have something urgent to say.
"His mother is…"

Unfortunately, at this moment, the screen was turned off and a message was
heard.

[Your mental power is exhausted.]

[Exclusive skill, Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint stage 3 has been turned
off.]

This was the bad thing about a soul body. The recovery of exhausted
mental power was slow. It was natural since there wasn't a physical body. A
soul without a body was like a battery that lost one electrode. The longer
the period without a body, the more exhausted the mind became. It was the
reason why ghosts went crazy.

'Did Nirvana kill my mother?'

I had to keep asking questions in order to keep from going crazy.

'It can't be'.

This was my mother, not someone else. Nirvana also wasn't a character
who easily killed or tortured others. Nirvana was a gentleman when acting
as the Salvation leader.

However, there were the last words that Nirvana spoke. He said that my
mother had a secret she kept from me. A secret that my mother was hiding
from me? I couldn't get a grip of it at all, no matter how hard I thought.

…I didn't know. No, maybe I didn't want to know.

Then an indirect message was heard.

[The constellation 'Master of Abydos' is calling your soul.]

I hadn't heard any indirect messages for a while so I was a bit confused.
…Master of Abydos? I pondered over the contents of Ways of Survival. If
I remembered correctly, Abydos was the capital of Ancient Egypt. [The
nebula 'Papyrus' wants to offer you the 'story of resurrection'.] Oh, look at
this? Papyrus was the nebula for Egyptian mythology.

[The constellation 'Scribe of Heaven' is calling your soul.]

Eh? Metatron? As soon as I thought about it, the next message appeared.

[The nebula 'Eden' wants to lead you down Messiah's Path.] The story of

resurrection, Messiah…?

[The constellation 'God of Wine and Ecstasy' wants to take you away from
the lower constellations.]

[The nebula 'Olympus' will set the stage for you.]

…What was this?

[The constellation 'Master of December 25th' is calling you.]

[The nebula 'Vedas' will present you with the 'holiday of resurrection'.]

[The constellation 'Flower Blossom of Seocheon Flower Fields¹' is calling
your soul.]

[The nebula 'Tamna' wants you.]

From Indian mythology to Korean mythology? Many more indirect
messages were pouring in. From huge nebulas to small nebulas, they all
sent me love calls.

I could tell what these constellations were thinking. They were trying to
cover me with their myths?
[Some constellations are facing each other.]

[Some constellations are giving warnings not to steal someone else's
myths.]

Dionysus, Mithra, Hallakgungi…

The constellations calling me were all involved in resurrection.

[Constellations are having a battle of nerves over your resurrection.]

In other words, these guys were trying to step into my narrative. All stories
were enhanced through being circulated. The more that humans told the
story and passed them on, the stronger the influence of the stories.

What if one day, the person called 'Kim Dokja' was resurrected after three
days and shouted the following words,

"I am Kim Dokja! I received the blessing of Christ!"

It didn't matter if Christ was replaced by Dionysus, Mithra or someone else.
People would be amazed and a myth would be reproduced on the spot.

The amazed incarnations would spread the story and the power of the story
would exceed imagination. As a result, the nebula related to the story would
have more power to intervene in the probability.

In other words, the nebula were in a frenzy because of this. I had the power
to control the scenarios.

[Constellations of the Korean Peninsula are paying attention to your
choice.]



[1] Field of Seocheon an important place in Korean mythology. It appears
in four myths, excluding the Igong Bonpuli. Wiki.
          Chapter 147: Ep. 29 - Constellation Banquet, II


According to my choice, the fate of the nebulae would be reversed on the
Korean peninsula. At first glance, it looked like a situation where I was in
an advantageous position but I wasn't that comfortable.

[Constellations are quarrelling over the legitimacy of the myths.]

I seemed to have the option of choosing but the problem was after the
selection.

The nebulae were sensitive about plagiarism when it came to the
'resurrection story' In particular, the confrontation between Eden and Vedas
was severe. If I chose one side then the other side would completely turn
their back to me.

I was only a bud who hadn't become a constellation yet. If I refused all of
them, they would feel resentment towards me…

[Many constellations want you to choose quickly.]
Damn. I was afraid of receiving criticism over the resurrection and of
becoming a public enemy among the constellations. What should I do…

[The constellation 'Queen of the Darkest Spring' is mediating the conflict
between the constellations.]

[The constellation 'Queen of the Darkest Spring' emphasizes that it is the
incarnation's choice.]

Persephone was on my side. By the way, why was she helping me?

[Some constellations are dissatisfied with the intervention of Queen of the
Darkest Spring.]

[Some constellations are asking for a solution from Queen of the Darkest
Spring.]

…

[The constellation 'Queen of the Darkest Spring' recommends that the
incarnation Kim Dokja be invited to the constellation banquet.]

…Banquet?

After a while…

[The nebula 'Eden' agrees with the suggestion from Queen of the Darkest
Spring.]

[The nebula 'Vedas' agrees with the suggestion from Queen of the Darkest
Spring.]

…

[A number of constellations agree with the suggestion from Queen of the
Darkest Spring.]
Regardless of my intention, I felt like my existence was being sold at a low
price. I somehow felt empty and then the dokkaebi Youngki appeared in
front of me.

[Pant, pant. Sir Dokja.]

Perhaps he came in a hurry. Youngki was covered in sweat.

[There is a place you have to go.]

'…Where?'

[Ah, I will help you get there. I'll prepare it right away!]

I had a rough idea of where I was going. Based on how nervous Youngki
was, the pressure from the constellations must be considerable.

Eh? It felt like my body was collapsing and being reborn. It wasn't
resurrection. It was closer to the the soul forming a body. It was a state like
a floating ghost but it was temporary.

[Umm. This is an important meeting…]

A shirt and suit covered the soul body that didn't have any genitalia.
The texture of the cloth felt like it had been created for me. [Stories are
shining in the distant night sky.]

[The constellation banquet is currently being held.]

[The constellation 'Queen of the Darkest Spring' has invited you to the
constellation banquet.]

The constellation banquet.
Along with Sponsor Selection, it was an event arranged for the
constellations of the Star Stream. I was invited to a banquet where only
constellations were invited, despite not yet being a constellation.

I looked at the time remaining until I was resurrected.

[Time remaining: 23:54:12]

23 hours. It was enough time for a short visit. It was a bit fast but the place
I had to go was obvious.

"Okay, let's go."

It was finally time to visit the constellations.




[The person who invited you will soon send an envoy.]

"Understood."

[I-I wish you a successful debut!]

Youngki raised a fist with resolute eyes and soon disappeared from in front
of me. I looked around and the area was covered with white clouds.

I realized that this was one of the tributaries of the 'cloud road'. Numerous
dokkaebis moved along this road to get to other dimensions.

[You have temporarily left the main scenario area.]

[You must return to the scenario area within 24 hours, Earth time.]

[If you don't return in time, you will be disposed of according to the
scenario rules.]
Disposal. The system was really frightening, just like last time when I went
to the Underworld.

[The hidden scenario - Constellation Banquet will begin!]


  [Hidden Scenario - Constellation Banquet]

  Category: Hidden
  Difficulty: ?

  Clear conditions: Participate in the banquet and have a successful debut.

  Time Limit: 24 hours.

  Compensation: 100,000 coins, favour or dislike from some of the
  constellations.

  Failure: ―


…At any rate, there are many scenarios hidden in the Star Stream. As long
as I maintained my heart, I would get more coins than I thought.

I saw four horses flying in from a distance. The white horses were like a
light source as they emitted a white light. They flew with 'golden wings'
and behind them was a golden carriage.

There was the symbol of the sun engraved on the outside of the carriage. I
recognized the carriage with one glance. Surely this wasn't the 'sun
carriage?' Then the presence in the carriage…

[Hey, get in.]
I was amazed by the true voice that I heard. It showed that the presence in
the carriage wasn't someone huge.

[Hey, it's okay. This is a symbolic realm so my true voice is weaker. Get in
quickly. I won't eat you.]

I nervously got into the carriage. If this was really the sun carriage, the
owner of this carriage would probably be the sun god Helios… eh?

"You are…?"

I looked at the occupant of the carriage with wide eyes. To be precise, it
wasn't an 'occupant'. Only a wine glass filled with delicious red wine
floated inside the carriage. I wondered about the situation and then the
wineglass opened its mouth.

[Don't you recognize me?]

[The constellation 'God of Wine and Ecstasy' is disappointed in you.]

I asked in a startled manner, "…Dionysus?"

There was a dazzling spark and the wine glass screamed.

[Hey, don't call my name so carelessly. I feel good because I'm excited.]

"…Why do you look like this?"

[It is due to the probability. This is a good form to save on probability costs.
You know, the great Star Stream is quite strict.]

In fact, it was better for me that he didn't have his true form. It didn't matter
that I had the Fourth Wall, there was no certainty that I would be in a good
state if I saw the body of the constellation.

The carriage set off as soon as I sat down. I didn't know why Dionysus was
driving Helios' sun carriage but he seemed to have a reason.
[Is this the first time you've actually seen me? Nice to meet you, I am the
God of Wine and Ecstasy. My name is famous in your country.]

"I'm also pleased to meet you."

We awkwardly greeted each other and sat in a corner of the carriage. Unlike
his usual playfulness, Dionysus didn't say much.

Did he have a shy personality? It was unexpected. Well, not all stories were
true.

The wine in the glass shook in a worrisome manner every time the carriage
jolted. Would it fly in my direction? The liquid seemed to be a symbol of
something and I wondered what it represented for Dionysus.

After a while of idle thoughts, Dionysus said, [Ah, I'm sorry. I was chatting
with a goddess I know for a second.]

"…It seems you are very busy?"

[It isn't like that. I should proactively manage the girls these days.]

I didn't know if it was a joke or not.

[By the way, you are calmer than I expected? I am still a famous
constellation.]

"It isn't the first time I've seen a constellation."

[Ah, that reminds me. Was it last time when I sent you to the Underworld?]

"Yes, thank you for that."

[What thanks? What did you do in the Underworld?]

"Huh?"
[I have never seen the queen act so kindly. Trying to protect one
incarnation from the nebulae… huh? Perhaps? What that it? You told that
old lady…]

His voice was somewhat envious. Dionysus didn't seem to know that I
completed Persephone's task.

"Nothing happened."

[Hey hey, don't be shy. Isn't that auntie sexy? If I wasn't a gentleman on the
outside…]

"Do you have to say it that way? Isn't the queen of the Underworld your
mother?"

[Um? Haha. There is that theory.]

"Is it fake?"

[I didn't say that.]

"…"

[Why are you looking at me like that? Don't you know Olympus? This
taboo is nothing.]

Come to think of it, Olympus was such a place. A paradise of gods who
thought with their lower half. Still, this was too nasty.

[Ah, yes. Speaking of which. Did you get my previous message? Stick to
my side. I particularly want to give you the story of 'Bacchus'… why is
your expression like that?]

"No need."

I hurriedly shook my head. Dionysus was one of the 12 high ranking
constellations of Olympus. But the story of Bacchus…
[Aha, I get it. Look at this person. Are you comparing it with the stories
from Eden or Vedas?]

"No, that's not it…"

[Hey, it is because you don't know anything! Do you know what will
happen if you receive the story of the resurrected Messiah? You will have
to live compassionately your whole life! It is the same after you die. Yes?
You will have to live like a priest God!] Dionysus shouted loudly.

[Huh? Do you know how great the Bacchus story is in contrast? Don't you
know my goddesses?]

"The goddesses who ripped apart homosexuals?"
Dionysus jumped with surprise.

[Ah… Y-Yes! You can spend frenzied days and nights with them. I can
give you an endless refill of wine! Have you heard of the Olympus orgies?
Do you know Aphrodite? If you want, I will invite her…]

[The constellation 'Goddess of Love and Beauty' is looking at the 'God of
Wine and Ecstasy'.]

[…Let's just pretend I didn't say that. What do you think?]

"It doesn't appeal to me."

The Dionysus wine shook uneasily.

[…That reminds me, an angel of Eden says that you are interested in
sodomy…]

"I think I know who spread it but ignore that girl. I want to know the real
reason why you came to see me."

[Um? What are you talking about? It is to get you to join our nebula…]
"Is that really all it is?"

Dionysus was silent for a moment. The wine glass was still for a while
before making a circle in the air.

[…You noticed quickly.]

"I've heard a lot."

[Do you want a drink? Drink some of my wine.]

"I don't really like drinking."

[Well… okay. You're right. In fact, my purpose isn't to take you to
Olympus.]

It was as I thought. He was a god, meaning nothing he said was sincere. It
was strange that despite all the nebulae paying attention to me, one of
Olympus' 12 constellations came to pick up one incarnation. Yet Dionysus'
next words completely broke my expectations.

[I'll tell you directly. I hope you don't join Olympus.]

"…Huh?"

[To be more precise…]

Then a terrible explosion occurred. The sun carriage shook like it had been
hit by something and the horses screamed. I turned back and saw wine
pouring from Dionysus' glass.

[Ah fuck. I was so surprised I pissed!]

I was afraid to ask what his urine was. I carefully avoided the spilled wine.

[Damn, it looks like other nebulae are looking for you.]
I looked out the curtain and saw creatures with terrifying presences flying
all over the place. They were still far away and I didn't know what nebulae
they belonged to, but it was clear they didn't like me.

[Fuck. I paid a lot to borrow this from Helios… this won't work. Get off
here and run the rest of the way. It is just a short run along the cloud road.]
Here? Wasn't it air?

[I will stop them. Go quickly! If you enter the banquet hall, no nebulae can
touch you!]

The curtains opened at his words. I looked at the clouds below and gulped.
I was a soul. This meant I wouldn't die if I fell.

Then Dionysus' voice was heard behind me. [Keep this in mind. Don't trust
anyone.]

I leapt out of the carriage as Dionysus laughed.

[See you again, Incarnation Kim Dokja.]

I jumped off the carriage onto the road. There was a loud noise behind me
and then a brutal oppression pushed on my body. It was a tremendous force
I had never felt before. At least part of the true essence had descended.

Sparks struck like a thunderstorm. I could tell without looking back. The
confrontation between constellations had begun.

I rushed with all my strength along the cloud road. Debris flew over my
head and I felt the ground cracking. I never looked back.

How much time had passed? Finally, a huge castle was seen and the noise
behind me weakened. I had reached the entrance of the castle.

"I came to participate in the banquet."
The gatekeeper looked down at me. He seemed to be a low-grade dokkaebi
dispatched from the bureau. "What? I didn't hear about an incarnation
coming here alone."

Dammit, perhaps it was a mistake to get out of the sun carriage. Maybe that
would've been my free pass. At this moment, the inner castle door opened
and an unexpected savior appeared.

[Let him in. He is part of my group.]

It wasn't Persephone. The constellation I had wanted to see for a long time
was waiting for me.
         Chapter 148: Ep. 29 - Constellation Banquet, III


He stood at the entrance of the banquet hall. If I was right, he was one of
the high level constellations who supported me since the beginning of the
scenarios.

「There was a mischievous look on the face covered with white-gold hair.
One of the most powerful authorities who was imprisoned in the smallest
prison of the world. I was unable to breath as soon as I encountered the
noble self and piercing eyes. 」

This was the description from Ways of Survival. I watched in a spellbound
manner. This was a top presence located at the top of Ways of Survival. I
ignored the housekeeper and ran inside. "The Great Sage, Heaven's Equal!"

However, the laughing Great Sage, Heaven's Equal disappeared in front of
my eyes. He was like smoke. It was as if he was telling me I wasn't
qualified to meet him yet.

…A clone?
My hand fell in a dejected manner but the situation wasn't over. I suddenly
called out the name of the Great Sage, Heaven's Equal, making the
constellations on the first floor of the banquet hall pay attention to me.

[Who is that person?]

An incarnation called the nickname of a particular constellation. Most of
the constellation didn't have great expressions. Gazes focused on me from
all over the banquet hall.

[An incarnation?]

[What? Who is that incarnation?]

Countless gazes gathered, the atmosphere was heating up and I was so stiff
that I couldn't move. My mind became blank and I couldn't tell who was
looking at me.

I thought I could hold on after hearing the constellation's true voices.
However, it was clearly the influence of Fourth Wall. Just their gazes made
me like this.

Now I realized. I was the only existence in this banquet hall who wasn't a
constellation. I finally stood before the constellations.

"Now now, please calm down. There was a mistake so I will be taking this
friend for a bit." I heard a familiar voice and somebody lifted my stiff body
and moved it somewhere. As I left the banquet hall and entered the banquet,
the hell was over and I barely managed to breathe.

"…Why would you come here alone?"

I turned and saw a familiar figure floating in the air. "Bihyung?"
"Yes, it's me. The Queen of Night said she would send an envoy. Didn't
they come with you? Why are you wandering around alone in this place?
Do you want to go to hell?"

"There were circumstances."

"Hey, is that the problem now? This isn't the scenario area! If you make a
mistake then it is the end! This place…"

"It is a place where there are people who can kill humans with their eyes
like we are bugs."

I know. I understood. That's why I came here.

Bihyung pouted like he wasn't satisfied and took me somewhere. "I'll take
you to the waiting room. Rest there for a while. There is a screen in the
waiting room that you can watch. Be sure to take a look. Do you
understand?"

There must be something based on the way Bihyung was acting. Not long
afterwards, we arrived at the waiting room. By the way, the sign in front of
the waiting room was very strange.

"…Incarnation waiting room? There is something like that?"

"Do you think you are the only incarnation? Of course, you are the only one
who came here alone."

The door opened and I saw an unexpected figure. He spoke first. "…Kim
Dokja?"

I looked at him with a blank expression and waved awkwardly. "…Yoo
Joonghyuk."
The constellation banquet was frequently mentioned in Ways of Survival.

It was the place Yoo Joonghyuk usually came to whenever he used
'regression'. It was natural for Yoo Joonghyuk to be included on the
invitation list. I didn't know who was invited this time but this person
would try to form a relationship with the narrative-grade constellations…

The constellation banquet was a joint event with several countries. There
was the Seoul Dome, Washington Dome, Moscow Dome and New Delhi
Dome.

Perhaps the bureau had held a performance presentation to select the best
performing domes. Once I saw the list of participating countries… it was
similar to Yoo Joonghyuk's 24th regression. There were separate
incarnations for each country in the waiting room.

Yoo Joonghyuk asked me, "Why are you here?"

"Probably a similar reason to you."

"When will you revive?"

"Maybe tomorrow."

"The others are worried."

"I'm sorry."

I felt somewhat uneasy as I had a conversation with Yoo Joonghyuk. His
fists were clenched tightly like he was angry. I suspected that he might have
anger control issues these days.

I sat in the chair next to Yoo Joonghyuk and watched the scene playing on
the large screen in front of me. There was an intermediate dokkaebi
promotion ad playing on the screen.
–Thank you to all the constellations and dokkaebis who have given me the
glory of the story…

It was an interview with the representative of the low-grade dokkaebis,
Bihyung. That bastard, this was why he told me to watch.

–Half of the glory is actually due to an incarnation working hard in my
channel. Maybe he is a friend that you know. I'll give half this joy to the
incarnation!

I felt uncomfortable at the shameless words.

The surrounding incarnations were looking this way so I turned my
attention away. Then Bihyung took out a golden egg and raised it up to the
sky. I immediately recognized what it was.

–The other half will be given to this child who will be born!

It was the egg where the soul of Shin Yoosung was sleeping. Fortunately, it
seemed to be growing well.

"Don't tell me, did you…?" Yoo Joonghyuk used Sage's Eye as he looked
between me and Bihyung's egg with a shocked expression.

I spoke an excuse. "It was the only way."

"Do you know what you did?"

"I know."

"If you do this, Shin Yoosung…!"

I knew what Yoo Joonghyuk was worried about. The person who had been
suffering from the 'story' for so long was now the subject producing the
tragedy. I didn't have to say that Yoo Joonghyuk knew how painful this
was.
I told him, "If she is born as a dokkaebi, at least she will never die. The
bureau is the safest place until the Star Stream is destroyed."

Of course, this wasn't the only reason. Still, I couldn't tell him all my
reasons for making Shin Yoosung a dokkaebi. Yoo Joonghyuk's eyes met
mine. It felt like he would pull out his sword and cut me to pieces right
here.

"Perhaps… are you Kim Dokja?" The voice that interrupted us caused the
tense atmosphere to disappear. I turned and saw a beautiful mixed-race
woman. She had wavy brown hair and gentle brown eyes. Her smile was
especially beautiful.

"That's correct. Do you know me?"

"Oh… a little bit. I have heard stories."

It was great. I couldn't believe this woman came to talk to me first.

"Nice to meet you, Selena Kim."

"Do you know me?"

"Aren't you the representative of the United States? I've heard it before."

Of course, I didn't really hear it. I just knew her.

  [Character Summary]

  Character: Selena Kim

  Exclusive Attributes: Animal Lover (Rare) King's Guardian (Hero)

  Sponsor: Ender of Wars


Selena Kim from the Washington Dome.

She was a member of Anna Croft's Zarathustra and one of the strongest 100
women in Ways of Survival. The King of No Killing was an attribute that
originally belonged to this woman. Unfortunately, she had acquired another
attribute because I took it first…

I asked, "Anna Croft didn't come?"

"…You know Anna?"

"I've met her in a dream the other day."

"She wanted to come. If she knew you were coming, she would've come."

Of course, then the situation would become more complicated. Why? It was
due to this guy.

"Tell that girl to take good care of her neck."

"…You are the same as Anna told me, Yoo Joonghyuk."

The reason Anna didn't come here was due to Yoo Joonghyuk. In the last
regression, Yoo Joonghyuk was betrayed by Anna Croft. Anna would've
seen what she did to Yoo Joonghyuk. Thus, it was natural that she didn't
come here.
"There is a very ugly person on the Korean side. Are you the representative
of South Korea?" I looked back and saw that it was Russia's representative
who spoke this time.

"Iris, that's rude. It is a bad habit to evaluate others based on appearance."

"I said he is ugly because he is ugly. Honesty is a virtue in Moscow."

White blond hair with pure white skin. The little girl had her hair up in twin
ponytails.

I knew who had come from Moscow. However, I pretended not to know.
This girl was one of the people I hated in Ways of Survival. I deliberately
asked her, "Who are you?"

"…Don't you know? You don't know me, Iris Vladimirovna Rebezova?"

"Should I know you?'

Selena Kim intervened. "Dokja-ssi, I will introduce you. This is Iris. She is
a representative from Russia. In Russia, she is called the 'Full Body Red
Square'.

"Ahem, that is me."

I nodded. I wanted to say something about the ostentatious nickname but I
stopped because it would cause trouble.

Selena Kim continued speaking, "Iris, this is Kim Dokja. He is from South
Korea and his nickname… I-I'm sorry, I don't know Dokja-ssi's
nickname…"

Then Yoo Joonghyuk opened his mouth. "This nickname is…"

I hurriedly interrupted. "I don't have a nickname yet."
A ridiculing laugh emerged from Iris' mouth. "A person came here without
a nickname?"

I had one but it was disgusting.

"I don't know why you are qualified to be here but you better be good."

As the Russia representative showed a fighting spirit, Yoo Joonghyuk
moved forward. Perhaps she felt the huge strength of Yoo Joonghyuk. Iris
took a half step back.

"Don't interfere. This is better me and that ugly guy." Despite Iris' warning,
Yoo Joonghyuk kept staring at her.

Well done. If you want to slap someone then do it to Yoo Joonghyuk. In the
end, Iris bit her lips and retreated. "Well, I don't know what trivial
historicalgrade constellation brought you here to take their story but… let's
just leave
it."

…Take the story of a historical-grade constellation? How cute. That
reminded me, there was something about the 'Story Succession' at the
constellation banquet. Perhaps this was what Iris was alluding to.

Knock knock.

The door of the waiting room open and a low-grade dokkaebi appeared.
"Incarnations. We will be holding the 'Story Succession' soon. A place has
been temporarily set up on the first floor of the banquet hall. For reference,
the first floor is only for the historical-grade constellations."

[Story Succession.]

It wasn't only through Sponsor Selection that the constellations could
influence the incarnations. Despite not being their sponsor, an incarnation
could build up strength by inheriting the story of other constellations and
showing examples of the story. By widely announcing the story, the
constellations broadened their power. This was good for both incarnation
and constellation.

We walked to the banquet hall one by one. The first one to enter was Selena
Kim.

[Selena Kim! King's Guardian!]

[I've been watching your good performance!]

Unlike before, the reaction of the constellations were favourable. Maybe it
was because they met their favourite incarnations. It was like meeting their
favourite celebrity.

Then it was Iris' turn. She walked past the constellations and waved lightly
like she was giving them fan service.

[Iris! The Red Square kid!]

[Hahaha! Cute.]

[Isn't it exactly the same as what I saw on the screen?]

She stood in her place and stared at me. She seemed to be saying to me, 「
Did you see? 」

…So what? It was soon my turn.

I walked into the banquet hall and the pressure of the gazes poured towards
me again. This time, I could endure it. Maybe because I had experienced it
once before or because the gazes contained a different feeling.

However, the reaction of the constellations was strange. The heated
atmosphere was quiet, as if cold water had been poured on it.

…Perhaps I wasn't popular? Iris seemed to be laughing at me.
Then someone opened his mouth.

[…That person. He is Kim Dokja of the Korean Peninsula.]

[Kim Dokja? That Kim Dokja?]

The chatter started again. It was a completely different reaction from the
previous incarnations.

[Kim Dokja! That guy is Kim Dokja.]

[Kim Dojega! Kim Dojega!]

[The King of a Kingless World!]

The voices of the constellations rose every time I took a step.

[He who opposes the enemy!]

It was like a wildfire spread throughout the hall as the voices continued.

[Hey, do you remember me? The Bald General of Justice!]

[Kim Dokja! I'm King Heungmu the Great!]

I silently walked through the middle of the banquet hall.

[I saw Peace Land very well! Child, can you say something?]

[Hey! Wave your hand over here! I sponsored you 3,000 coins!]

[You came! Kim Dokja!]

[Isn't he better than what we watched?]

The whole banquet hall seemed to be a vast melting pot as the
constellations forgot their dignity. Their souls seemed to be ripening so I
was forced to raise my hand towards them and waved. Then chaos exploded
among the constellations.

[Handsome Kim Dokja!]

Iris was looking this way with a dismayed expression. However, I didn't see
her. I didn't come here to play.

The scenario footage was covering the ceiling and walls. Incarnations were
screaming and dying while the constellations laughed as they watched.

I saw this and once again realized what this place was. It was where all
human tragedies became dinner.

I looked up at the second floor of the banquet hall. Unlike the ridiculous
first floor constellations, an ominous silence came from the constellations
on the second floor. They were constellations who each shone with a
fearsome presence.

They were the real enemies I had to fight.
          Chapter 149: Ep. 29 - Constellation Banquet, IV


Yoo Joonghyuk was next and he enjoyed an unprecedented popularity.
There was even some sound on the second floor when he came out. It felt
like I heard the name 'Eden' so I didn't know how to feel.

[Yoo Joonghyuuuuk―!]

[The best Supreme King!]

[Come into our nebula!]

There was a bit of time left until the Story Succession. I sat down on the
first floor and watched for a while. I had to be wary of all constellations,
regardless of their grade.

I wasn't looking for reliable people. There was a reason Dionysus told me
to trust no one. Thus, I wasn't looking for someone 'reliable' but someone I
could 'use'.
"I…" Iris approached me and opened her mouth.

I could predict what she was going to say. I warned her first before she
opened her mouth. "Don't be hasty if you want to survive."

"Yes, yes?" Iris' blank face became astonished as she looked into the air.

[A few constellations are amazed by your judgment.]

[A few constellation have sponsored you 5,000 coins for the cider.]

There was a panel on the ceiling that zoomed in on Iris' face. Iris blushed
and the watching constellations chuckled. Iris muttered,

"A-All that was filmed?"

It was naive to think the channel would be turned off after entering the
world of the constellations. Rather, the constellation's eyes would've shone
from the moment we came here as they watched our reactions.

Especially those on the second floor. Maybe the reaction of the
constellations had almost reached the peak when they saw the confrontation
between Iris and I in the waiting room.

However, I didn't want to give them pleasure. As I said, I didn't come here
to play. At the very least, I didn't want to look silly. "Do well next time,
Kid."

I patted Iris' shoulder and got up. Once I moved, the constellations on the
first floor reacted.

[Kim Dokja! Come here!]

All the constellations on the first floor were in the form of 'symbols' rather
than humanoid or biological forms. It was hard for the historical-grade
constellations to handle the probability consumption so they saved on the
consumption cost by streamlining their bodies into the simple symbols.
At first glance, I couldn't see who was who. Then I saw a bamboo stick and
straw and the golden crown of Silla.

"Bald General of Justice. And the other… Slumbering Lady of Fine
Brocade?"

[Ohh! You remember me!]

[That's right. It has been a while.]

I found the constellations of the Korean Peninsula.

[I wanted to see you once but to think we would meet like this.]

The floating eye seemed to be the One-eyed Maitreya…

In addition, there was the symbolic body for the Last Hero of
Hwangsanbeol, King Heungmu the Great. There was Gyebaek…

[Kim Dokja.]

I looked back at the voice and saw a 100 won coin floating. 100 won? Who
was the 100 won?

[It is good to meet you.]

"W-Who…?"

[I'm upset. You don't recognise me?]

Wait. Who was the person on the 100 won coin?

"Admiral?"

I asked in a startled manner. My patriotism might be close to zero but I
couldn't help feeling emotional when I saw this person. The coin turned in
the air, revealing the figure engraved on the front.
[It seems like you are using the stigma I gave you.]

"Thank you for that."

The Duke of Loyalty and Warfare, Yi Sunsin. The person who gave me the
Song of the Sword was also invited to this banquet.

"By the way, why do you look like this?"

[…This appearance isn't according to my will.]

I somehow understood what he meant. Speaking of which, the Duke of
Loyalty and Warfare wasn't the only one in the form of currency. I looked
at the green paper on one side of the first floor and asked,

"Then perhaps that person is…?"

Yi Sunsin nodded.

[He is the founder of 'Hangul'. Do you know the big golden statue in
Gwanghwamun?]

I knew it. I couldn't not know it. Yi Sunsin continued speaking,

[The symbolism is according to our most known symbols. Perhaps he is
similar to me.]

I looked sadly towards the 'Founder of Hangul'. King Sejong was the 100
won note while Yi Sunsin was the 100 won coin. These great people were
confined to currency and eventually these became their symbolic body.

Then a giggling sound came from the second floor. The constellations on
the second floor all had humanoid or at least living appearances.

Even the most famous people on the Korean Peninsula didn't get a
humanoid form. It was hard to imagine how strong these constellations
were. I was really lucky to have only hunted Yamata no Orochi's shadow.
At this moment, a constellation caught my eye. "Who is that constellation?"

[Who? Oh, that person?]

I noticed a person sitting on the landing between the first and second floors
while drinking alcohol. He was armed with a long knife and maintained a
humanoid figure instead of a symbol. No matter how I looked, he must be
narrative-grade. Yet the passing narrative-grade constellations were staring
at him with contempt.

Samyeongdang interrupted. [Among the historical-grade constellations of
the Korean Peninsula, there is no one above that person.]

"He is historical-grade?"

[You might say that he is the strongest historical-grade. It isn't due to fame
among later generations but a position he gained from the stories he
accumulated.]

Certainly, if he had enough room to maintain a humanoid body then he
wouldn't be defeated by the narrative-grade constellations. As far as I knew,
such a presence was only in China…

[Have you heard of Goryeo's First Sword?' I heard that it was revitalized
recently.]

Goryeo's First Sword.

"Don't tell me…"

I realized that who he was. I wondered why I didn't recognize him instantly.
If this constellation was the greatest person on the Korean Peninsula then
he should've been the first one to come to mind.

[Everyone leave!]
Then there was a disturbance on the stairs. Some constellations who came
down from the second floor were coming this way. No one was able to face
them.

Yi Sunsin sighed. […Your popularity is great. They want to take you to the
second floor.]

Yoo Joonghyuk was already being led up to the second floor by someone.
On the other hand, Iris remained on the first floor and looked at me with
envious eyes. Perhaps the story she came to inherit was only from a
historical-grade constellation.

[Please take care.]

As soon as I nodded, the symbol of a constellation appeared. The symbol
was in the form of a reaper. I recognized who they were with one glance.

[The queen is looking for you.]

They were the judges of the Underworld. That reminded me, they were
narrative-grade. Although they borrowed Persephone's stories to maintain
themselves…

I was heading up the stairs with them when someone on the landing spat.

[…You are pathetic. Fawning on the guys from the second floor.]

The judges became furious at the Goryeo's First Sword's words.

[Goryeo's First Sword, what are you saying?]

[Do you want to die?]

The Goryeo's First Sword rose from his seat at the judge's remarks.

[I am ready to die at any time. Shall we fight?]
The symbolic body of Goryeo's First Sword was bigger than I thought. No,
maybe this feeling didn't come from the size of the symbolic body. This
was the size of the 'status' of the constellation.

[Don't be a fool. Lowlife parasites who are barely attached to the end of a
narrative.]

The awe-inspiring aura caused the attention of the first and second floor
constellations to focus here. The judges seemed a bit embarrassed but
couldn't retreat easily because of their pride.

The eyes of Goryeo's First Sword shone. He seemed like he would take the
lives of the three judges right away. He looked beyond them at the
narrativegrade constellations acting like nobles on the second floor.

[Olympus. Eden. Vedas… I don't know why you came to such a small
village but it would be nice if you didn't leave your servants here.]

The atmosphere of the second floor became intense after his words. No
matter how strong Goryeo's First Sword was, they couldn't endure the
taunting of a historical-grade constellation. The moment that the banquet
hall was going to be a fight among constellations…

[Stop―!]

A powerful true voice dominated the entire banquet hall and the atmosphere
quickly sank.

[Judges, don't do unnecessary things. And Goryeo's First Sword, you
shouldn't be too rude.]

At the cool tone, the judges started guiding me again while Goryeo's First
Sword sat down with a disgruntled expression and started drinking.

I looked at the owner of the voice. As expected, it was the Queen of the
Underworld.
Persephone's strength wasn't known but she was the wife of one of the three
heads of Olympus for a reason. Perhaps among the narrative-grade
constellations who came here today, Persephone was among the top.

[It's been a while. Kim Dokja.]

The Persephone I met still looked like Yoo Sangah. She was truly a spiteful
aunty.

"How are you?"

[You did something useless in Tartarus.]

"Haha…"

I shrugged and looked at the constellations around me. It was harder to tell
who the constellations were when they had a humanoid body instead of
symbolic body. A symbol could evoke the name of a constellation…

I could also see the Great Sage, Heaven's Equal sitting on the second floor.
The Great Sage, Heaven's Equal looked at me for a moment before turning
his head away.

…Was his personality originally like this?

After a bit more time, the arrangement of the second floor became familiar
and I seemed to figure out the camps.

Olympus was based around the central Persephone, Vedas was in the west
and those who weren't in a nebula or were in small nebulaes were to the
north, including Great Sage, Heaven's Equal…

Finally, it was easy to recognize Eden in the south. It was due to the wings.
An incredibly beautiful angel winked lightly at me. She was an angel
dressed like a demon in the black lace dress…

Wait a second. Like a demon? That's right. Was she that angel?
I was suddenly curious. Maybe that constellation…

"Queen of the Underworld. I want to ask you something."

[What is it?]

"Did the constellation called Secretive Plotter come here?"

[…Secretive Plotter?]

Persephone's expression seemed strange for a moment. Then she shook her
head.

[I don't know. More than that, the Story Succession will soon begin. Have
you made a decision? There are a few constellations who want to use your
resurrection.]

"I'm still thinking."

Of course, there were a few methods I thought of. However… Persephone
seemed to read my thoughts.

[Perhaps you want to reject everyone. It has been like this the entire time.]

Indeed, this was a favourite statement in my channel. In fact, I wanted to
choose this method.

[However, this choice isn't right. It is because everyone will start a
copyright dispute.]

"A copyright over a story?"

[They will claim it was their own. It'll probably be quite

painful.] Damn, they were complete thugs. "Are you telling me

to choose Olympus?" Persephone laughed.
[I'm not saying that. In fact, I hate those guys.]

As it said in Ways of Survival, Persephone had a rather hostile relationship
with Olympus. In fact, the Olympus participants at this banquet were only
the 'third generation'. Despite this, the constellations of other nebulae were
reluctant to approach.

They were probably wary of Persephone… or more precisely, of Hades.
Thus, I was unwittingly protected by the Underworld. It might be fortunate
that the first narrative-grade constellation I met was Persephone.

"Then, Queen-nim, what do you think I should choose. Vedas? Or will it
be Eden? Perhaps a different nebula?" Persephone shook her head.

[You will gain an enemy no matter who you choose. In addition, these
enemies will be far stronger than any enemies you have ever met. As you
can see, the 'resurrection story' forms the basis of the mythology of many
nebulae. Accepting one story sometimes means denying another.]

Persephone licked her lips like she had delicious steak in front of her.
Maybe the queen was enjoying this situation. I felt a bit annoyed as I asked
her, "… Then what do you want to say?"

[I just wanted to share my thoughts. Think about it. Is it a problem of
turning them into an enemy?]

It wasn't a problem of turning them into an enemy?

Finally, a dokkaebi went to the stage and opened his mouth.

–From now on, the Story Succession will begin!
